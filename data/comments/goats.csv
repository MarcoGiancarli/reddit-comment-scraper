If you choose to milk once a day letting the kids feed during the evening/day do you have to start milking twice a day if you sell the kids after 8 weeks? I couldn't find the answer anywhere and this seems like the best place to ask.

In the middle of breeding season. Ah bless em. I just can't wait to have every single milking + breeding + all my normal work + taking care of their dogs. LOL.  I'll be taking a vacation too, but when it comes to me, I cannot leave the farm until our girls have begun to enter their two month pre-maternity leave/vacation.   Goats do not do well with strangers milking them. If you want to vacation, you'll probably want to dry them off - less worry for them having some stranger pulling their tits on a strange routine they aren't familiar with, and less worry for you, imagining mastitis and what not.  Nah, you'll just worry about all the other things that can go wrong."

Just trying to see it from all angle so I can either come up with answers or at least a good plan if vacation falls into Milk Season. Tough thing for us is my husband has tax season which isn't really flexible. Both seasons together leave us with November/December not really ideal travel times. Thanks for the input!

I offered the owner a reasonable amount of money, especially since it's something that is not going to be passed on genetically, and I only wanted it because I love unusual animals, but she understandably passed on the offer.  She used to have a picture on her website, but this was some time ago...I'll search and see.  Otherwise, eye pictures...hmm. I know I have one.  Imgur  The pupil is always quite irregular and can even be triangular in shape. And each eye can be slightly different."

goats,3crhdu,CochinBrahmaLover,4,Fri Jul 10 04:37:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely impossible to make any kind of judgement without seeing conformation and udder shots.  I will say that for us, a goat needs to hit a certain amount of points for me. This includes, yes, color, but more important, correct conformation up to a certain standard, as well as a correct udder, which has several points of it's own of course.  I also will cull any goats who are sick more often than they should be, or suffer problems with their hooves or parasites, or are piss poor mothers."
goats,3crhdu,Epona142,2,Fri Jul 10 15:15:04 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, I don't care about color. Normally I do, but in this case I'm rather indifferent towards it.   I'm pretty sure Hottopics issue is that Jackpot is a bully, stress from being moved & possibly some parasites.   Getting pics now.  Edit: Hot topic, Chiffon, Jackpot  Got the best shots I could get, I'm alone. Thanks for any help"
goats,3crhdu,Dekonite,3,Fri Jul 10 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"Hot Topic doesn't look terrible for a doe putting a gallon out. Dry her up and let her get some condition back before you judge her too harshly. I think she's your better older doe by far.  I'd keep Hot and Chiffon, but those are my opinions."

Shots from the front are always good too - a great tip is to squat down on the goat's level so the angles aren't obscuring the lines.  http://www.harlequingoats.com/Site/Senior_Does_1.html  Anyhow! :)  Hot Topic is showing improvement. Her udder is not bad at all - decently attached, good medial, good teats. I see healthy hair coming in under that shit overcoat. Jackpot has a nicely attached udder, good teats, good medial and looks nice. Chiffon looks like she is growing well and appears in good health.  Hot Topic will be the most difficult for you to bring through the winter. Jackpot and Chiffon offer the highest chance of offering a return value in kids/milk."
goats,3crhdu,Epona142,2,Fri Jul 10 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry I was by myself, if I had someone to hold them I could've gotten better pics.  And yep she's shedding a ton.  Why do you say that? Her lack of weight?   I think I'd like to sell jackpot. I can show Topic next year, she's well behaved & she's registered/pedigreed unlike the others. Thanks for the help though, I'm glad she's looking better. I've also started milking her again, because she did not dry up at all. She produced more than normal and that was it, like I missed a milking."
goats,3crhdu,Dekonite,2,Fri Jul 10 21:27:11 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean - you've seen my pictures lol. All from just following them about, desperate for them to stand still in a spot with flat ground.  Her weight is currently an issue, but if you keep her pointed in the direction you're taking her, I think you will see her bounce back. I've seen does that looked worse in the weeks after their kidding.   You're the boss of your herd, that's for sure! It sounds like Hot Topic fits into your future plans far better so sell Jackpot and use that income to get Hot Topic ready for winter.  As for Chiffon, how old is she? I know you mentioned feeling she is small, but she looks about right to me, if she is in the age range I assume."
goats,3crhdu,Grimsterr,2,Fri Jul 10 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"She was born 3/14/15 I believe.  She may not be small per se for her age, but she still looks really little. I want to breed her this fall but that may not work out. If we get a buck this fall, and she's too small to breed, will I have to be concerned with him breeding her? I know they can get pregnant very young, but I feel like a full sized buck wouldn't breed a tiny doe. However if my rabbit experience is correct,  that's wrong."
goats,3crhdu,Dekonite,3,Fri Jul 10 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"You could breed her late this fall or early next year, but only if you pay special attention to diet and ensuring kids don't grow too big, and of course, you are always rolling the dice on that giant single buck kid that gets stopped up! Lol!   Most do just fine breeding that early - she will continue to grow while pregnant and after birthing.   As for a giant buck and a tiny doe...sigh! Our LM buck Dominic is a beast, a massive tall beast. He is twice my weight literally, if not more. He can scale a fence in no time flat.  Mistletoe is a tiny yearling Nigerian Dwarf, pretty as a picture.  And Bubs is their son LMAO.  Diet and care of the dam has far more impact than the size of the buck compared to doe."
goats,3crhdu,Dekonite,3,Fri Jul 10 21:41:39 2015 UTC,Many people ramp up feed in the last few weeks/month of pregnancy too and all they're doing is making bigger babies. It amazes me how many people don't realize that.
goats,3crhdu,sprocket,2,Sat Jul 11 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"Well so far she's been getting milk regularly & sometimes I'll throw on calf manna, alfalfa and/or corn with molasses.   We bred our Nigerian doe at 7 months and it ended well, but I guess I've heard a lot about big bucks over small does is a huge no-no, so I'm still nervous haha. I'll definitely have to talk to you later when we get a buck arranged.  And LOL. Yep I've definitely had huge bucks try and breed tiny does. I had an 8lb mutt buck who would cover my 2lb holland does! Size means nothing to them haha"

They can clean up a pasture and turn it into a beautiful thing, however, which is always lovely.   I suggest you get a group of wethers, three or four perhaps, of any breed of your choice. Bottle-raise them. Make sure the breeder does health testing and disbuds their kids. Don't be afraid of the big show breeders - little boy goats are born as often or more often than little girls, and they need homes or they go in the stew pot.   With wethers, you will not need grain or expensive feed - just good quality hay free choice and good free choice loose mineral.  Pay special attention to your fencing. Goats can go through anything porous and will destroy most fencing in time.   Become familiar with the base line of goat health and learn how to trim hooves.   The more stimulation in the form of companionship, toys, and food that you offer within the pen means the less time they spend looking for ways out of the pen. Except that even if you build Goat Buckingham Palace they will still consider the rose bushes on the other side of the concrete wall to be better and find a way to get it."
goats,3cbjmb,tossedassunder,6,Mon Jul 6 18:22:18 2015 UTC,Sheep might be a better option for someone looking to maintain a lawn. Although they will still pick and choose which grass they like. They are also a lot easier to contain.
goats,3cbjmb,Dekonite,5,Mon Jul 6 20:09:36 2015 UTC,Take a bucket of water and throw it at your fence. If any gets through so will a goat.

goats,3cbjmb,jesesaurusrex,3,Tue Jul 7 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"We get pretty even grazing on our pastures by only giving enough grass for 2-3 days of grazing by our herd, then moving them on to the next patch.  We use the Premier1 electrified mesh to set up a grazing area.  On the first pass through the pasture, the goats will eat off the first and best quality forage, and then eat the less desirable stuff as that runs out.    It does take some work, however...mowing the lawn may be quicker and cheaper over the long run. :)"
goats,3cbjmb,sprocket,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"I have used the electronet on our farm, and a neighbor uses it exclusively, but I've since abandoned it. I had one adult get tangled and strangle, and we found one baby tangled just in time to get her out. The neighbor that has used it for her sheep for years has had only one loss. We keep it HOT, but if one of the goats gets pushed into it, the results can be really terrible. They flail and roll, and then are just done for unless you're within earshot when it happens."
goats,3cbjmb,Grimsterr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, that is a risk of the netting.  We'll usually have a training period on new goats where they're in a much smaller area that normal, and supervised.  We want them to touch it at least once, preferably more to learn to keep back.  Their initial response is to move forwards into the fence, which definitely isn't what you want, as that leads to the tangling.  In our experience, the few goats who got tangled up in the netting were the ones who were reaching through a square for food on the other side of the fence.  This usually happens because there was a short and the voltage was down in that section, or because they're hungry and the food on the other side of the fence looks better."
goats,3cbjmb,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Thu Jul 9 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"You're gonna still have to mow.  If you want a mower get a cow.  Goats will eat every leaf off every tree, and bush, and flower that they can reach.  Within a short time you could damn near shoot a laser line level across your yard at goat reach height and there won't be a single leaf below that straight line.  And unless you have a LOT of bushes, you'll have to buy food for them even in the summer."
goats,3cakde,brunobits,3,Mon Jul 6 11:58:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone was up in arms because I had pics of our goats tied out, well I wanted to show everyone that we got some new fencing up and created a new pen for them."
goats,3cakde,sprocket,2,Mon Jul 6 12:00:06 2015 UTC,"Looks great!  One note on using welded wire fencing - we've found that over time, the pressures of having goats standing on the fences will eventually break the welds.  Generally speaking, we've found woven wire to be longer lasting, and if you can run a single strand of electric on the goat-side of the fence to keep them off it, you'll have even fewer damage problems. :)"
goats,3cakde,the_last_fartbender,2,Mon Jul 6 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"yeah we are working with basically found materials, we got the fence for free and one of our bigger goats Lillith was climbing up on it when I took her kid for a walk, but her and her kid are likely going to be our biggest goats as we are looking to breed smaller, like Pygmy/Dwarf and Kiko and Boer to get a smaller more manageable goat.  Right now they are all looking around like ""This is new"" but we have plenty of space, grass to eat so nothing to complain about...just different..."
goats,3cakde,Dekonite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"Now I am not trying to be annoying here, but that's a lot of food. We give ours 2 handfuls of grain each per day, the rest is oaten hay and even then they are a touch tubby. One handful in the morning, one before bed."

Roughly how many acres if you don't mind my asking. I'm on 30ish but it looks waaay smaller than that due to all the hills and woods breaking it up. I'm in Western NC btw. That's awesome that you are actually putting that horse to work! Maybe I misjudged horses! Everyone around here keeps them as very large expensive pets.

goats,3c08w2,catsngoats,2,Sat Jul 4 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yes they will :) Blue eyes are a dominant trait native to Nigerian Dwarves (and Myotonics). While all kids are born with light colored eyes, there is a distinct difference than the ice blue that stays blue and the light green/blue that darkens to gold or brown.  A blue eyed goat bred with a brown eyed goat means each kid has a 50% chance of being blue eyed. Blue eyed to blue eyed is a 75% chance.   I've not seen a proven case of homozygous blue eyed goats, which means 100% of their kids will be blue eyed no matter what they are bred with, but it's plausible and so far Olivia's dam is batting 100% blue eyes out of five kids."

goats,3byq6d,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Fri Jul 3 06:25:18 2015 UTC,"Good luck trying to get a goat not to go where they know there is food. The only suggestion I have is for you to fence around the rabbits.   As far as the blood, was the milk bloody or just the skin of the udder? Cracked skin is bad, but not as bad as mastitis. If it is just the skin, get some udder cream or bag balm and start using it daily. Also, don't let her get so full."
goats,3byq6d,BeanCreekFarm,2,Fri Jul 3 13:03:03 2015 UTC,Udder of the skin. No blood in milk.  I figured as much.
goats,3byq6d,Epona142,2,Fri Jul 3 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"LITERALLY the ONLY spot they're not supposed to be and it's the ONLY place they want to go. They could go 50 miles north and join the caribou if they wanted, but they INSIST on going in to the front yard."
goats,3byq6d,Epona142,2,Fri Jul 3 06:31:02 2015 UTC,"Build Fort Knox around where they want to go and pray.  Once they discover a food source they will do anything within their power...which is a lot...to get to it.   How much blood? A little blood is okay, a lot of blood is a problem. Any elevated temperature? Heat in the udder? Could she have banged it against something? (I know, a hard one to answer unless you stand out and stare at her.)"
goats,3byq6d,Epona142,2,Fri Jul 3 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"Sigh.. Ok. Figured as much.  You know how some times dogs will get little red spots from noseeums biting them? It was like that, but actively bleeding. Not a lot."
goats,3byq6d,sprocket,3,Fri Jul 3 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"On the udder or in the milk?  (ETA: Already answered!)  If on the udder, another person suggested a nice udder balm which I agree with. It's not unusual for the skin of the udder to become cracked and dry and overfilling during drying off can cause some bleeding.  If in the milk, could be any number of things. If I notice blood spotting in milk, they are pulled from the machine and hand milked until a cause is determined, or, much more common, they simply don't have a reoccurance in two consecutive milkings.   A lot of blood in milk, enough to turn the milk pink, is a serious concern, but I think that really goes without saying lol.   ETA: Went back and read and I see it's indeed on the udder."
goats,3byq6d,sprocket,2,Fri Jul 3 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yep just on the udder. Thanks, I have bag balm, I've put some on the teats but didn't think of the hairer parts.. Never shaved her.  Also, how do you dry them off? Milk once a day for a while? Cause I basically just assumed it was pretty straight forward - milk less for a bit until you can stop milking - but then she started bleeding and yeah."

She is more than capable of running and jumping and being silly like a kid should! My issue is if she will be able to carry and deliver kids without undue stress - we'll probably try it one year and evaluate. :)  Their health comes first, and if I believe she will be at elevated risk carrying and birthing, she will be put on medical retirement until a perfect pet home comes along."
goats,3bvqip,iseeyouasperfect,3,Thu Jul 2 18:34:27 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought about kidding.  Is it because the crookedness could effect her hips in the long term?
goats,3bvqip,iseeyouasperfect,3,Thu Jul 2 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"Hind legs and joints are the most important, as they bear the majority of the animal's weight, which will only increase during a pregnancy. It could end up being hard on her, and she may eventually suffer early arthritis in the hock.  She also has a slightly limited range of motion with it now from the calcification healing created, slightly fusing the hock.  And of course, as you mention, it could indeed affect the rest of the body because now she compensates for that slight irregularity of gait even when just walking. It's nothing now, but years of that will change her muscle structure, which will cause who knows what other kinds of effects.   It will be interesting to follow her long term case."
goats,3bvqip,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Thu Jul 2 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Please keep up with the updates.  I find it very interesting.  I haven't had to deal with anything broken with the goats yet, but it's certainly something that could happen.  Do you think her being young gives her a better chance to live a normal life compared to if she were an adult?"
goats,3bvqip,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Thu Jul 2 21:39:36 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Younger animals heal faster - the hard part is ensuring it heals straight which can be difficult. Plus less weight to carry about and far easier to keep contained and calm during the early healing stages.  A broken leg of that magnitude would have been very hard on an adult.

I'm sorry, I feel like I started this with my post /:  In the end most people here agree with how you raise your animals and care for them, and will counteract the nay-sayers.  I never heard of this goat and frankly I'm confused. Do you mean her older sister, a goat, adopted her and therefore is her owner? She's very cute. I hope she ends up in a good home or able to have kids.   I recently had issues with broken legs. A young pullet completely snapped her knee, and my old hen broke her leg near the ankle. The pullet we gave to a friend, I'm not sure if she made it, healed or what. But she was super sweet. She came to me with a fucked up eye, like a chicken pecked it, so she'd already been through a lot of stress. My older hen is healed up ok, she has some calcification and limps but seems not to be in pain (! Flew off the deck like 20min ago! No wonder she broke it, she crash landed!). I'm not sure what to do with her, because she's laying thin shells, no one wants that and I'm trying to get rid of all the chickens. Haha rambling sorry, just emphathising, broken legs suck!"

goats,3btcwb,Dekonite,2,Thu Jul 2 02:34:13 2015 UTC,"Ha! Speaking of goat-swag, anybody here notice correlations between social status and beard length/quality?  We do, at least anecdotally. The best-looking beard is on our ""enforcer"" doe... she's not the herd queen, but she takes care of all social enforcement in the herd.  We wouldn't let the 4-H kids show her last year, because it requires shaving off their beards, and we just couldn't do it. :-)    We're pretty convinced that beard length/quality is a rough indicator of something I guess you could call ""endocrine health"".  If a goat is physically and socially able to take on a dominant or enforcer role, the beard is a visual reminder of that to the others.  And it probably works in reverse as well... if a goat isn't able to dominate or enforce, e.g. because someone else is fulfilling that role, hormones are down-regulated, and the beard isn't as robust.    There's a research article that seems to indicate we're not totally imagining things. (It's just a brief mention - what we call ""enforcers"", they call ""affiliative"".)  http://www.researchgate.net/publication/230642506_Social_strategies_associated_with_identity_profiles_in_dairy_goats"

goats,3bfweb,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"Huh. It kind of looks like he does in that picture, but nope. He's gopher eared. You can't actually register a elf-eared buck."
goats,3bfweb,Dekonite,2,Mon Jun 29 05:46:01 2015 UTC,That goat's daddy was half nubian with the ears to show for it. I'm surprised both twins ended up with such tiny ears.   Personally I am not a fan of LaMancha ears in any form. Too many problems with infections and just ears clogging with wax.
goats,3bfweb,Epona142,2,Mon Jun 29 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"Could be environmental - the difference in our local vs yours. Would be absolutely fascinating to study the difference.    We haven't had a single ear infection ear, nor any major problems with ear wax. About half our herd is La Mancha I suppose, never really stopped to count how many of each we have. A lot. Lol."
goats,3bfweb,Epona142,3,Mon Jun 29 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"Most of our mancha ears come from one mom. They all have wax clogging issues. My other lamancha girl came to us with ear infections.   Just curious, how often do you check ears? Our issues are not obvious. Just notice hearing problems or ear scratching and wiggling."
goats,3bfweb,Epona142,2,Wed Jul 1 03:26:49 2015 UTC,It's part of our monthly check. We run the entire herd through and do a head to tail point check lol. It's kind of a pain but really it's the bare minimum. I wish I could do it weekly.
goats,3bfweb,big_onion,2,Wed Jul 1 03:52:36 2015 UTC,Fair enough. We are having to do weekly checks on our sheep. They seem to enjoy dying way more than the goats.   ETA: The goats are all dairy so they get daily handling. It's pretty clear when one of them has a problem. Most of the time they are lining up to lodge a complaint with management.

I can't think of any reason a cold temperature would produce a bad taste...so it's possible that you started with milk that may have been off in the first place.  How would you describe the off-flavour?  Draining at about 20C/68F is probably the right temperature.  You wouldn't want it significantly warmer than that."
goats,3begqv,sprocket,2,Mon Jun 29 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"I think it got down to like 50-ish the other night. It's usually 70-80 in here when I have great batches.  The flavor was less tangy/lemony than you would want with a chevre and much more goat than you would typically want. The good news is that once I drained it and added salt, it was still passable. Not the best by any means though."

It might be expensive though.  Crock pots and fondue pots sometimes have a nice variety of settings and might work for you."

goats,3b9y0d,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jun 27 04:50:53 2015 UTC,"Fence in those gardens. The goats would clear a whole new pasture for you. But compared to 2 horses? Hardly any. I wouldn't see why not. Build them a section of pen different of they want to get away. Butcher. Well, look at your market. Whether the first ones and see how fast they sell & how much. Here, they don't sell quick and don't sell for much. You're better off just eating. Yes. No horns. Yes because they're yearly breeders,but not for most breeds. I believe both Nigerians, boers & pygmies are all year round. But larger breeds often aren't, like La'manchas are not. A goat has a dressage of about ~50%.  A 50lb Pygmy should get you about 25lbs meat. But the skeleton is about ~20% of the carcass weight as well. Not a lot, but they're good converters due to size & more reasonable than 200lb boers. I'd imagine they also have litters of 3 more frequently, I know our Nigerians did. Mini goats are easily separated from horses, and yes, I'd feed them different. Keep the horses feed up high where they can't jump up or break it down. Separate part of the pen with a ~3ft high opening for the goats to walk into. You could probably make it 2ft even - our goats can squeeze everywhere.   Yes. The goats will steal the horses food. And it's not that they want to steal the horses food, they will. You will have to fix it several times before they leave it alone for a few months and figure it out again."
goats,3b9y0d,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:50:04 2015 UTC,"You could try breeding Dwarf with a Boer to get a smaller Boer to eat.  Also if done properly you can keep a goat milking non stop between kidding.  We have a Nigerian Dwarf Pygmy male he is only 6 months old, but he is tiny, Not sure how much meat you'd get off him.  As a comparison, I have a wethered male Nubian/Oberhasli/Boer/Saanen mix (he was an accident) he is just under 2 months old like 7 weeks, and he is bigger than our now 6 month old Nigerian Dwarf/Pygmy.  We do have a 25%Pygmy/75% Boer that does have a decent enough size she could have some meet on her, but she is kidding age and planning on breeding her out some more.  We also have a Kiko, they are a VERY sturdy meat breed."
goats,3b9y0d,brunobits,2,Sat Jun 27 12:11:27 2015 UTC,"Look into Kinder Goats. They're a meat/milk hybrid kind of breed that you might be interested in.  As for fencing, it sounds like you know what you're getting into with keeping animals. Just remember that goats are ninjas.  Goats will eat any kind of feed you leave out and you probably don't want them getting into any kind of feed that isn't formulated for them. You can feed hay year round and keep them fine. I know a couple of people who keep their's that way."
goats,3b74hq,Grimsterr,8,Fri Jun 26 14:41:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the update - I hope he starts hitting those growth spurts under your management and matures well for you :)
goats,3b74hq,Epona142,4,Fri Jun 26 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Me too.  It's just frustrating, his parents were large animals, his daddy is a monster sized goat, I was really hoping on a big un like his daddy.  I'm doubtful, even if he does start growing better, that he'll ever be that size."
goats,3b74hq,sprocket,5,Fri Jun 26 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"It's still possible for him to grow.  We once had a little runt that we named Napoleon, and he stayed small for the first year or so before growing into a MASSIVE wether.  (He also developed into one of the most clever tricksters - if there was something for him to cause trouble, he was there, and leading the rest of the herd in trouble making too.)  Hey may hit a couple growth spurts over the next year or so and catch up eventually.  I wouldn't write him off entirely, just yet. :)"
goats,3b74hq,Dekonite,5,Fri Jun 26 17:12:28 2015 UTC,I'll second this. Our white/roan buck that i've posted pictures of here before was a little guy until after his first rut. I don't know if that shot of manhood did it or what but as soon as he went out of rut this spring he hit a massive growth spurt.
goats,3b74hq,Epona142,4,Sat Jun 27 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"It is frustrating - I've had a couple ""failure to thrives"" that I was insanely disappointed in because I expected so much better. It simply happens sometimes, and there is no blame to be placed on anyone except nature and chance."
goats,3b74hq,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Fri Jun 26 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"Even if he's under sized, couldn't you still breed him? Since it wasn't genetic, it's because his growth was stunted due to worms.  Either way, best of luck. I'm in the same situation - finding the right stud service is hard. Right now I can't even find a lamancha buck much less a pedigreed one. Maybe we can do AI.."
goats,3b74hq,Epona142,3,Fri Jun 26 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"Time will tell on his breedability later on, he might just be a late bloomer and he may catch up now, we'll see.  I'll be weighing him weekly to chart progress."
goats,3b74hq,CochinBrahmaLover,7,Fri Jun 26 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Now, this is just my opinion but I personally would not. Whether is it failure to thrive or stunting due to internal parasites, he was not hardy enough to grow properly.   With so many great bucks on the market, there is no reason to breed even a good one, let alone a bad one.  Of course, if you're just after milk from the does and meat from the kids, you use what works. And we all start somewhere, right? Lol.  I'm not judging, just sharing the train of thought I have. :)"

goats,3b74hq,Dekonite,2,Sat Jun 27 08:30:57 2015 UTC,Is it possible to have something air shipped in to where you are? Might be a touch expensive but there's some good breeders on the west coast.
goats,3b74hq,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Sat Jun 27 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"Something? Like,a goat? Or sperm?  We were thinking of doing AI, but not sure yet. If we find a lamancha buck in person that's decent well use him."

goats,3b2rey,derpfreely,6,Fri Jun 26 03:32:33 2015 UTC,That makes me sad. I'm not a freaky animal rights nut either I just love animals and don't like seeing any of them slaughtered.
goats,3b2rey,duhbigredtruck,3,Fri Jun 26 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"It's okay to feel that way, in my opinion. As long as someone isn't trying to stop me from raising meat in a humane fashion, what do I care if they don't eat it."

goats,3b2rey,duhbigredtruck,3,Mon Jun 29 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, it's absolutely possible to be quite sad about something like this, and still know it's OK and the right thing to do. I will shamelessly admit that I can get VERY sad about butchering one of our goats.  But because I know we're doing the right things in the right way, I'm OK with it.  I just don't want you to think that people who raise and butcher animals are Completely Different From You.  We're not.  :-)  We're animal-lovers, too.  It's just that being an animal-lover means thinking carefully about what ANIMALS care about.  Animals don't worry about the future or their own mortality.  They care about being healthy and comfortable and free to do whatever it is their species needs to do.  At some point, they all die.  As humans, we have the unique ability to make that death quick and painless.  And that's an awesome thing.    So don't be sad that animals are slaughtered... be glad there are a few people doing it the right way.  Be sad and angry that MOST animals raised for food in the US are brutalized and mistreated.  Don't give those people your money.  THAT makes you the best kind of animal-lover."

goats,3azzpc,Dekonite,3,Wed Jun 24 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"I'm just now getting to where I can sort out the 'serious' fights from the 'play' ones so watching more is always interesting.  That doe reminds me of our herd queen when she's in heat. She gave our baby buck hell until he bred her. She's usually super laid back though and I don't think that girl is in heat. I don't know a lot about nigerians though, are they seasonal or year round breeders?"
goats,3azzpc,Dekonite,3,Wed Jun 24 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"Year-round for Nigerians. Bossy little monsters.   Both does were in standing heat, but this is a five day cycle for the aggressive doe and they are under the ""buck effect"" having never been around a mature buck before. (They were sold from our farm as bitty babies and their owners brought them back to be bred here recently.)"
goats,3azzpc,isaidputontheglasses,3,Wed Jun 24 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I just watched it again and I definitely see a ton of tail flagging that I missed in the first video. I wasn't focused on the rear ends the first go round, haha.  That's interesting that they're year round. Does that translate over to minimanchas too? Do you breed them every heat cycle?"
goats,3azzpc,isaidputontheglasses,5,Wed Jun 24 23:59:51 2015 UTC,"I have found with Mini La Manchas it is very hit or miss. Some will cycle year 'round and some are seasonal.   No, once a year. I've known folks who breed their Dwarves twice a year and that's their choice but I will not do that except once in a while in particular cases - very unusual cases. The overall health of our herd is extremely important to us and a doe in a constant state of pregnancy is under extreme strain.   I'd rather have a healthy doe and strong kids once a year than a strained doe with a shortened lifespan and the corresponding weaker kids she will produce twice a year.   But as usual, that's just my thoughts on the matter."

Well you can probably guess.  They can claim that they are not ""natural"" because humans created them. I was unaware that humans were not natural...because we are natural. And everything we do is natural. Do they call it unnatural when a pack of wolves moves into an environment and changes the dynamics of not only the prey items, but the land itself? No."
goats,3b0ecl,Epona142,0,Thu Jun 25 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And even those who have been around livestock, well a lot of them anthromorphize the animals like crazy. I have this vegan woman on facebook - and don't get me wrong, if you want to be vegan that's fine, but she's just crazy. Has a few chickens, and when they beg for the eggs (because she feeds them to the birds) she says that it's them getting mad about her taking the eggs.  Just, blegh. If people actually understood animals and didn't take every behavior and give it human meaning behind it - instead of just thinking the birds have eaten eggs, like them and thus are bawking so you'll give it to them.. Especially if they've associated the bawking with you giving it - there'd be a lot less of this crap. Not that animals can't have emotions, but they're not nearly as complex as some of those people think."
goats,3b0ecl,RabbdRabbt,2,Thu Jun 25 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"Animals are heavily anthromorphosized these days. I see it excessively even in people who consider themselves animal-savvy.   (Hell, even I do it to a point - the difference is I know that I'm doing it for my own entertainment and out of affection for the animals. Hard to know where someone else stands on that line however)  There's a reason I live under a rock and why this subreddit is literally the only place I regularly give out advice without someone coming specifically to me and asking. I just no longer wish to come up against people with unrealistic views of the world - mostly because they delight in attacking others with their ignorance, and that is honestly something I don't bother with. I imagine at some point this subreddit may become popular enough that I'll leave here too.   Just the way it goes, no big deal."
goats,3b0ecl,Dekonite,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"There are no cows or pigs in wilderness, there are mooses, elks and boars, that is how domestic cows and pigs are unnatural."
goats,3b0ecl,isaidputontheglasses,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"..Boars are pigs, buddy. Just because we haven't domesticated those exact animals doesn't make them any less of a pig. It's not like they suddenly leapt into a new genus."
goats,3b0ecl,RabbdRabbt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"Dude, not only are moose & elk completely irrelevant, since we have no domesticated version of them (I'm assuming you mean goats are natural because there's wild versions).. There are wild pigs. Boars. You listed them. And if a pig gets out, they usually have a decent time surviving.  The cow ancestor went extinct - aurochs. Because their ancestor went extinct, but they didn't, they're unnatural? So everything is unnatural? Because a moose's ancestor is dead, horses ancestors are dead (they came from tiny little several toed things), elks ancestors are dead, and boars ancestors are dead."
goats,3b0ecl,isaidputontheglasses,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:23:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying naturally in the sense of ""in its country of origin"" or ""before selective breeding"". I am saying naturally in the sense of a pig being forest raised as opposed to being raised on slats or a cow being grassfed as opposed to cornfed or fed on by-product feedstuffs in a stockyard, or a chickens free ranging as opposed to being raised with its beak seared off in one of those big misery tubes.  Whether you like to look at your food before you eat it or not is irrelevant. People will eat their animals regardless. I guarantee a lot of the goats you see here will be or have already been eaten."
goats,3b0ecl,RabbdRabbt,0,Thu Jun 25 18:34:46 2015 UTC,Everybody dies. A lot of people on the other subs are dead already or will die soon. That is irrelevant. The question is whether I like a picture of a funny goat or not. Which depends also on a context like 'look how Buttermilk plays ninja' or 'look at this not-yet-chopped meatloaf'.
goats,3b0ecl,frugalNOTcheap,0,Fri Jun 26 12:16:37 2015 UTC,Is it really irrelevant? You may have brought up a good point. I think someone that cannot handle looking their food in the face may have an unrealistic perception that death is not a natural part of the life process.  People eat animals. Things die. Get over it.

There's tons of dairy goats here, what do you think happens to them when they're older, or the buck kids? Not everyone can be Wethered or retired into a nice big field where they'll live out the rest of their days.   Don't want to see a soon to be food goat? There's funny little button called 'hide.'"

I wish I could invite them out to see our farm, see our goats, meet them, meet me, and then ask them again if they believe our goats are suffering.  I never understood why it was okay for humans to have to work a job to support themselves, but a goat gets a legitimate job with better benefits than mine by far, and it's suddenly cruelty."
goats,3b0ecl,Epona142,2,Thu Jun 25 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it. I hope I come back as a goat in the next life!  To me, life is about quality and not quantity. My animals get to live better than most people. They live, frolic, and play. They're out in the sunshine with fresh food all around them. They have strong family bonds and even some romance.  In stark contrast, most people spend the bulk of their lives in dank factories or tiny little office cubicles so far away from their food that they don't know what it ever looked like originally or where it came from. They spend their days drooling over mass propaganda tv spots and what that celebrity over there is doing. To top it of, they are not even healthy despite all of the ""conveniences"" with 7 out of every 10 Americans on at least one prescription drug and 133 million Americans – 45% of the population – having at least one chronic disease. link  I've never had one animal with diabetes or cancer. My animals are as free and healthy as they can possibly be until the day they die.  Hell, I often joke that my chickens are free enough that they could go to college for their doctorates if they desire. There are no fences for them at all. My goats are fenced in as little as possible. Most of the year, they could run off to join the ivy leagues as well if they choose!  (Just to be clear, there's nothing wrong with fences if the animals have enough room and are not overcrowded. I just don't fence mine for the most part and joke about it.)"
goats,3b0ecl,Epona142,2,Thu Jun 25 17:59:48 2015 UTC,"I myself have a whole list of health problems that means my life will, most likely, be shorter than average by a generous amount. And that's okay - I'm enjoying life to the fullest I can right now.  So I totally agree with that statement and train of thought.  Quality over quantity.   Our goats live better than most livestock and I feel no guilt at all when one goes to Freezer Camp. That life was created by me and it was given back to me at the appropriate time to continue the life of me and mine. That's something to respect and honor, not feel guilt over or have to justify, yet we are expected to do so these days."
goats,3b0ecl,isaidputontheglasses,2,Thu Jun 25 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I feel like we have to justify to people that act like they don't eat anything at every turn, which is ridiculous.  So sorry to hear about your condition and I hope I did not offend talking about the chronic disease epidemic in this country. Sounds like you have good spirits about it though! Just do what you can to repair, or if it isn't possible, enjoy the hell out of life while you are still kickin'!  I wish you all the best!"
goats,3b0ecl,isaidputontheglasses,4,Thu Jun 25 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"Oh no, it's quite alright! It is impossible for anyone with half a brain to argue that your statements don't have a very clear ring of truth to them.   I went through a lot of bitterness over my health problems (the majority are directly tied to some terrible times in my childhood and my less than stellar parents) but have come out the other side of it and I accept that I am what I am and I'll make the most of it. Lol!"

That said, you most certainly seem to be going gangbusters on the quality-of-life part. :-)  What u/isaidputontheglasses said is chillingly accurate, too.  Of my group of close friends, the majority are chronically ill in one way or another.  These are people who would seem to have every advantage, but some are almost entirely unable to function normally.  It's unsettling.  Spooky.  And I'm full of theories about why, most of which have to do with sedentary and sanitized lifestyles.  Convenience and comfort are too seductive... I doubt they'd trade their lives for mine even if they believed it would improve their health.  To be fair, however, I have been bitching about the housefly maggots a lot this summer, so maybe I'm not doing a good job of properly marketing Farm Life. ;-)"

I have little to complain about to be honest :) Nothing can change the damage done in the past, and I'm sure not going to dwell on it.  If I didn't work as hard and long as I do, then I would be in a very dark place that I fought very hard to escape after the fire that took everything from us. I never want to return there, so I turned my thought process around and dived head first into WORK! And really, who can call it work, when one enjoys it so much. Part of my job is literally sitting on Reddit or Facebook talking to other folks about their goats. That's how cool my bosses are, they don't keep me to themselves! Lol!  Except...I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to leave. I don't think they'll let me. Lol."
goats,3b0ecl,Epona142,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"A bit off topic: but how do you keep your birds safe? Fucking fox keeps killing things - lost a duck and a serama broody hen and one of her chicks :( the stupid person who lived here before fed the foxes, so there used to be a ton of foxes here. And they're bold.   Do you have an LGD, or just lucky with no predators?"
goats,3b0ecl,isaidputontheglasses,3,Thu Jun 25 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Just to reiterate, I have over 30 chickens. I used to have over 70. They all run all over the place on 30 acres as long as they are free rangers and not free loaders. (We have a lot of those. They just crap on the porch.)  Anyway, we have only lost ONE chicken due to predators. knocks on wood We have a lot of bear hunting dogs here in the area (Plott hounds and Blueticks mostly), and when we first moved here, it bugged me how they never shut up. I think it turned out to be a blessing as it seems to keep a lot of foxes from coming anywhere near the place. I think the predator that got my one chicken was actually just a hungry stray dog. It was definitely a day time predator because my chickens all come home to go in the coop at dusk.  I have my dog outside 24/7 as well, but he isn't a legit LGD. Just a mutt that likes to bark. I plan on investing in a good Pyrenees before winter.  I have a bunch of ducks too, but most are trained to come home at 5pm to go in the coop. To me, ducks are the Rainman of the bird world. The coop ducks are my egg layers. I have 4 ducks I leave out cause they don't like hanging with the flock, and they rely on the goats for protection. They are also pretty well camouflaged being Khaki Campbell ducks. I don't recommend  Pekins for doing what we do as we had two of those. Those things practically glow in the dark. One was eaten about 3 days in. The other had something gash her face not long after. The Campbells remained just fine.   Hey, enjoy your goat meat! I'm SUPER stoked to start raising boer/kikos soon. Unfortunately, it's on my list behind a garden, meat rabbits, and a new hen house. :("
goats,3b0ecl,frugalNOTcheap,2,Fri Jun 26 04:42:30 2015 UTC,"Lucky. Tons of foxes here.  Understand your point about Pekins. Here, red chickens survive the best. Their always the last to be killed or eaten, as are khakis. Might need to just stop with the colorful birds :( that, or I was thinking perhaps next summer (my hens are getting old, hoping they'll die soon lol. Does that make me terrible? They're like 4-5) I might do quail. Cause quail sound amazing. 1lb of feed per month per quail. Butcher in 8 weeks, and I have lots of hunting buddies who'll use them for training. Maybe you should look into them!  Thanks. Hey, meat rabbits & a garden are great! at this point my garden is like 40% peas, 40% chick weed (whatever, animal food), & 10% other stuff."
goats,3b0ecl,frugalNOTcheap,3,Fri Jun 26 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"Huh.. I'll have to look more into quail. they look delicious, but small. That feed-to-meat ratio sounds pretty amazing so far!  Speaking of smaller birds, do you raise any banties? Those things will roost high up in trees and are nearly impossible for predators to catch. They lay smaller eggs, but I like them cause the yolk is almost the same size as a standard egg. I've never had one for meat, but I bet they are comparable to quail.  I'll have to try and grow some chick weed. If nothing else it would distract the birds form the rest of the garden. I know I am getting a late start, but I've just had so much else going on. We recently had to cover our entire yard in wood chips to make it more hygienic due to the large volume of chicken poo. lol. We never had much grass to begin with as our soil drains poorly and turns into a mudpit every other day when it rains. This is actually why I have to build box gardens this weekend. We had a failed garden last year in the ground with some amendments.  I'm doing so much work and all I produce so far is goat milk, goat cheese, chicken and duck meat, chicken and duck eggs. We're still only making like 10% of our food so far. I'm determined to get it though. I think adding the veggies, the bunnies, and the boers will increase that percentage drastically. We're also planning on foraging our asses off here soon and making preserves.  Man, I don't know how anyone has time to get bored on the homestead. :p"
goats,3b0ecl,frugalNOTcheap,2,Fri Jun 26 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah they seem awesome. And we can just put them in rabbit cages. Or build our own.  Do I have bantams? You even read my user bruh? Ok, Cochins aren't necessarily bantams.. But they are to me! Lol. My favorite hen is a Cochin cross. She lays bantie sized eggs, and is a broody right now. Been sitting for just a few days, and took the orphaned babies in.  I even had seramas. Had. Rooster died this winter, hen got taken by a fox a few days ago (she's the reason we have orphaned chicks) and I have another sitting on an empty nest cause she didn't like the orphaned chicks I gave her. They would roost real high, but not high enough I guess. Oh we also have ravens too, so yeah. Maybe the guineas will start attacking them when they're older.  The chick weed is loved by all animals! But when it grows, it GROWS. And don't worry about starting late, my gardening season starts when it's no longer freezing (no green house) so around June and ends around the end of August. We've got some green onions planted, tomillos (or however the fuck you spell it ), bird seed for the rabbits, lettuce, rhubarb, chives, peas, peas, and peas. I've grown a pea, we always bought them and killed them a month later. So I carefully planted them in rows, and then said screw it and dumped them after like 50 peas. Well the first 50 I planted in a spot of the garden that gets very little sunlight, so the ones I just dumped.. Yep, growing like weeds. But well have like 200 peas.   Good luck. Were only producing goat milk/cheese and some eggs. But it's enough for us. And have fun foraging - once it stops raining I'm going to go and get a ton of fireweed, grass and blue bells to dry out to feed the rabbits in the winter. Also might get some wild roses, and rasberries. Could make a lot of jam!  Lol. True."

They do need to be worked with, I wouldn't call it training and I have been working and training dogs since I was too small to even understand what I was doing. They are very different than the majority of dogs but people don't seem to realize they DO need to be worked with and shown their duties, but they cannot be handled like a Labrador or a Border Collie."

Revisit internal parasites (I know, I know, you probably have) and make sure to copper bolus her. What mineral mix are you using? It may not be strong enough for her on a specific level - like people, they're all different. Hit her with vit a/d injectable. She needs a good zinc source as well - look into black oil sunflower seeds.   Some goats simply never thrive. I talked a little bit about that on the post about the Nubian buckling. La Manchas tend to be especially prone to ""failure to thrive"" and I have aggressively culled them from the dairy's herd."
goats,3axms0,sprocket,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"This is the photo her owner sent when we were picking out the goats. Her original owner also said she was an easy keeper.   We worked her with ivermectin, and also a cattle pour on dewormer. For mineral, were using Sweetlox for goats & sheep. We can switch this to a higher copper % after we butcher the sheep. No copper bonus.  Also, we gave a selenium gel a month ago or so I'd say. Were very low on selenium here. Should I give another perhaps?"
goats,3axms0,Epona142,2,Wed Jun 24 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience using the selenium gels, but be aware that there's a fine line between deficiency and toxicity, particularly with the injectables.  Goats that are quite deficient in Se may also start losing some of the hair on their noses/getting crusty bumps on the bare skin.  A shot of selenium should have that cleared up within a month or so."
goats,3axms0,Epona142,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"They eat it, not an injectable.  Trust me, it's very unlikely they'll get a selenium toxicity. I err and go on the 'slightly over' when I give it because our area is just so deficient in it. Our doe who had triplets had a buckling with white muscle disease because we didn't realize that until like a week before she was due."

goats,3auow4,Grimsterr,6,Tue Jun 23 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"This a bottle baby? Obviously by this age he should be weaned, but he hasn't even reached that level of maturity.  In my opinion, yes, he is undersized and immature.  This is not uncommon for bottle babies who weren't fed often enough. Or bottle babies who weren't given proper cocci treatment/prevention.   Many of them eventually catch up and fill out, but it will take some time. I'm not sure when you were hoping he'd be ready to breed by, but know that Nubian bucks can be very slow to come into their own, and in my case studies of ""bucks who didn't buck"" Nubians came out number one among the breeds of the bucks I met who didn't understand how to be a buck. (Several were rehabilitated through my patented buck camp and went on to produce kids at long last). If you have other mature bucks, your goal will be to get him big enough to live with them.   He needs alfalfa in some form to help him grow. Also follow /u/Sorceress_of_Rossak's advice, especially with finding out the parents' G6S status as well as his. I have had a few G6S Nubians and a couple were incredibly stunted, like Nigerian Dwarf sized Nubians."
goats,3auow4,Epona142,4,Tue Jun 23 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Well I was hoping for a Thanksgiving breeding with kids hopefully arriving then in April.

I keep alfalfa in his hay feeder at all times, he has pretty much 24/7 access to it, we pull out any remaining and add fresh once a day.  Here are his parents ADGA entries:  Sire: http://www.adgagenetics.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=N001418697  Dam: http://www.adgagenetics.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=N001646926  I haven't looked much through these links will they likely have the info on this?"

Or at least, I highly doubt it.   I would just keep him on a good diet and stay on top of parasite control and let him grow best you can. By three years old he should be caught up to normal size - or not. Sometimes there just isn't much you can do - every year we have at least one or two kids that receive the same care as everyone but just do not grow or look good. I call those ""failure to thrive."""

I confess to being incredibly soured on the Nubian breed due to the amount of piss poor breeders in our area. I got several Nubians and each of them had some major problem. It was a nightmare. G6S and CAE were the big ones, as you can imagine.  I did promise my husband a new Nubian baby after his last died about three years ago, so I've been on a waiting list for one of the best breeders since then. Lol! Guess it'll be worth the wait."

goats,3auow4,Epona142,2,Tue Jun 23 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"You can give him some b12 in either injectable or liquid oral form which should help perk him up. Also vit a/d injectable - you can inject or give it orally. 3cc of that. The B12, follow the dose on the bottle weight to pounds.   Otherwise, just keep on what you're doing and the advice you've gotten, and I bet you'll get him turned around in no time and growing like a weed."
goats,3auow4,Sorceress_of_Rossak,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:51 2015 UTC,The ADGA website is down and even the office is up and down on being able to register and transfer animals. So there's that.
goats,3auow4,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Wed Jun 24 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"The whole G6S was what turned me off getting Nubians and the fact that a lot of Nubian breeders don't check for it. I am on a couple dairy goat groups and I am constantly seeing people who have bought Nubians then later finding out the goats are carriers or have the defect. I always feel so bad for the people in that situation because it just a simple blood test, but breeders have convinced them that their goats are fine and healthy. There are very few breeders I trust and without the paperwork proving their goats are healthy I just don't even bother looking at their animals. It still shocks me when someone on one of the goat groups doesn't know what Coccidia is...  On a side note, did you think the bucks legs looked right? When I was looking at the picks I couldn't help to think his legs looked a little off even for a kid."
goats,3auow4,197NINE,2,Wed Jun 24 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Yup...very wary of the Nubian breed now, and it was, for many years, the reigning breed of choice in the state. They are still most popular, but the tide is turning now.   Kid legs can look insanely wonky in pictures, so I dismissed them the first time around. Took a second look, and there may be some slight bowing out that is not atypical in these unthrifty kids. Until he matures, it's very difficult to really see how the structure of the leg is going to hold up."
goats,3auow4,197NINE,2,Wed Jun 24 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Well, first let me say I don't raise Nubians, I raise Lamanchas. It would be very difficult to give any definite answers to your problem without actually laying hands on the goat itself. But, I can suggest some things that I would do in order to determine if a goat is having issues.   First, has there been a recent fecal done on the goat to determine if wormer actually had any effect? How are his eyelids, pink, pale pink, or pale? How much feed is he getting per day? What minerals are available? How is his water intake? After looking for the answers to these questions I would talk with the breeder and see if she/he might have any suggestion or additional info, e.g., if either of the parents were slower to mature and grow.   Did the breeder provide testing information for their herd(CAE, Brucellosis, Johne's, CL, and since he is a Nubian G6S)? Especially the G6S genetic testing because of the poor growth in an animal that has the defect. This is what I would be worried about for this particular buck. I would get a vet out for their opinion and to run a fecal if you don't do it yourself.  Most standard breeds don't reach their full potential size until they reach 3 years of age. It really could just be stress from being bullied by the bigger goats. Sometimes certain bloodlines can mature a little slower than others, I have a couple in my herd that I had to wait to breed until they were a little over a year old. Also, goats when they are sick or stressed can drop weight really rapidly and it takes way longer for them to put that weight back on. I would start with these questions and go from there."

goats,3a0sh6,sprocket,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"I got mine through our local dairy guy - the construction of the buckets is essentially the same, the other peripherals probably have minor differences.  I would personally look into getting a pipeline put in, were I in that position again.  Using the bucket milkers involves a lot of lifting (which is fine, but hard on the back long term) and hand cleaning (which is time consuming).  How big will your rounds of goats going through the parlour be?  We've currently got these headgates:   https://www.homesteadersupply.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=73_181&products_id=1573  which allows us to move 12 girls at a time through the parlour.

goats,3a0sh6,sprocket,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:13:56 2015 UTC,This is a stop gap for right now. We're going to be culling fairly hard over the next 2-3 kidding seasons to get our herd exactly where we want it and get a new barn with a dedicated milk parlor. Right now we're working out of an old janky horse barn kind of setup and it's not working super great for us but it's what we have until we can save the money to have a new one built.  A pipeline is definitely something i'm interested in though in that barn.
goats,3a0sh6,sprocket,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, in that case, the buckets are probably the cheapest option during that transition.  We used a fixed vacuum pump that we eventually used to drive our pipeline system; good, used ones can usually be had for pretty cheap.  We got a used DeLaval vac pump from an old cow dairy that'd just upgraded to a new robotic milker for under 1000, and it's good to run up to 9 milking claws simultaneously."

goats,39xili,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Mon Jun 15 16:55:12 2015 UTC,Goats milk isn't naturally homogenized?  Ours always has separated cream from the milk.
goats,39xili,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 16 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah it isn't, just something people have latched onto and parrot, including the majority of websites talking about goat milk.  To steal from UCDavis' research:   Two misconceptions about goat's milk are associated with the fat globule size. First, it is often claimed that goat's milk is naturally homogenized. This statement is derived from the observations that milkfat from the goat does not cream quickly. This slow creaming was attributed to the belief fat globules in goat milkfat are very much smaller than those found milk. However, the size of the fat globules, on an average is only smaller than those found in cow's milkfat. The apparent reason for creaming is the lack of a protein (agglutenating euglobulins) which individual fat globules to cluster and rise. This protein is found in cow's milk. Creaming at higher temperatures, where the rate of clustering is not as dependent on the protein, is probably somewhat related to the fat globule size. Secondly, it is often proposed that the apparent ""small"" globules in goat's milk render the fats more digestible. No evidence has been presented to substantiate that point of view."
goats,39xili,Epona142,0,Tue Jun 16 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"Relax.  It is just shorthand for ""goat milk behaves a lot like homogenized cow's milk in that it doesn't separate as easily due to a variety of factors, including a lack of a protein that causes the fat globules to cluster and rise to the top.""  I fully understand that the udder of a goat does not have a homogenization machine installed."

It's never comfortable to cut open what was very recently a friend, but the information about their death can be valuable, and it would be disrespectful to not utilize it for the future well being of others.

goats,39r8t9,Epona142,4,Sun Jun 14 01:34:39 2015 UTC,Can you give me an idea as to the sorts of things you'd be looking for during a necropsy?  I've never done one myself; but I can see how it'd be useful in diagnosing future situations.
goats,39r8t9,sprocket,4,Sun Jun 14 05:11:23 2015 UTC,"When I started, I didn't really have any clue, I just looked at all the organs and muscles and made notes and took pictures. I made sure to do animals who were healthy but died due to accident, so I could see what was normal.  With sick animals or animals who died without obvious reason, I look specifically at the organs - anything abnormal.  I also try to measure sub-q fat and fat depth around the organs, and whenever I have the extra money, I send in a sample of the liver to biopsy for copper and other mineral levels.  A lot of it is simply gathering info that may or may not be useful to me later. As I continue to do so, I have found, like with anything, practice has made my eyes open to far more subtle signs I would have missed in early necropsy.  Because I am intent on studying these animals, it's an ugly but necessary chore for me."
goats,39r8t9,Epona142,3,Sun Jun 14 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"On an unrelated subject, how often do you copper bolus?  How many grams of copper are you giving each goat at a time?   We've just started in the last year, and it seems to have a difference, though we've also had a very dry year, as compared to our normally very wet weather, which makes a difference too."
goats,39r8t9,sprocket,3,Sun Jun 14 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"I have found 1g per 22lbs of copper bolus to be most effective. We do it twice a year however I would like to see us move to three times a year if possible.   Once I started bolusing, I noticed a distinct difference in coat, hoof, and parasite resistant health. Milk output increased (marginally) as well."
goats,39r8t9,Epona142,3,Sun Jun 14 20:06:44 2015 UTC,Where do you source your boluses from?  We don't have them in Canada and I've had to source them from down the US and bring them up on my yearly livestock supply run south of the border.  Have you experimented at all with the ones that also include selenium?  Selenium deficiency is another big problem in our area on account of the rainfall.
goats,39r8t9,sprocket,3,Sun Jun 14 23:04:39 2015 UTC,"Jeffers Livestock website. We buy Copasure and break them down into smaller gelcaps.   The ones packaged specifically for goats (including the selenium ones) are fairly new.   Haven't tried the selenium ones, but a good reminder about them - perhaps I should try them on next year's butcher wethers and see if I can notice in difference, inside or out."
goats,39r8t9,Epona142,2,Sun Jun 14 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'll add to this question - at what age do you start with copper?  We've also recently started with copper boluses.  Our vet, and other goat owners we know are entirely unfamiliar with the issue.   Sprocket, what signs of copper deficiency were you noticing?"
goats,39r8t9,Epona142,3,Sun Jun 14 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"Once they are ruminating, the bolus is effective. Ours generally get their first dose at 4-6 months."
goats,39r8t9,sprocket,2,Mon Jun 15 11:48:57 2015 UTC,"Right on.  I'm going to err on the early side with our three kids this year, because they're already showing some reddish color, and of course their dams were both mildly deficient in retrospect.  In the meantime, I'm monitoring their loose mineral intake, making sure they get a snout-full with morning feeding."
goats,39r8t9,sprocket,2,Mon Jun 15 14:03:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't necessarily treating a copper deficiency  (though we were probably low in copper) - we operate a goat dairy, and were looking at ways of improving resistance to internal parasites during the milking season.  We can't treat (or we can, but have to withdraw milk from the supply) with chemical dewormers while milking, so something as simple as a copper bolus, which doesn't show up in the milk, was attractive.  We live in on the west coast of Canada, where it's VERY wet and temperate in climate, making it a parasite paradise.  Anything we can do to boost our goat's resistance to it is a major plus for us.    Parasite stuff aside, some of our black goats will develop, throughout the year, a browish-orange tinge to their coats, particularly on the flanks.  After treating with copper, the coat usually returns to a sleek black colour.  While I'm not concerned about the coat colour itself, I do take it as a sign that some of the goats were probably copper deficient in the standard mineral mix we were providing."
goats,39r8t9,Epona142,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yep - sounds familiar!  I thought the brown/russet color was just... color.  None of the other goat owners or vets we interacted with ever called it out as an issue.  Then we suddenly had a haemonchus problem, and their skin this spring was awful.  Slow to shed winter wool, and flaky.  It was by accident that I discovered these are all potentially diagnostic for copper deficiency.    We now have a vet with more goat savvy - but even she had never heard of the issue or its symptoms, and her only advice was to caution me about copper toxicity.  Under other circumstances I'd feel kinda proud of myself for having taught myself some crucial information.  But it's actually NOT a good feeling to know more than a professional/expert.  I want my goats to have their own Dr. House, and not have to rely on my google skills.  :-)"
goats,39r8t9,Epona142,2,Mon Jun 15 13:58:55 2015 UTC,"Based on our experience, very few vets know much about goats. Those that do are often applying what they know about cows to goats, which sometimes works..and is sometimes wrong or disastrous.  In all likelihood, you'll have to become the Dr. House, and become the local resource for goat info. :)"

I just fenced off a new area last weekend for them and herded them into it. They just started going to town on it. My fiancee and I sat out there and watched them for 30 minutes because we found it entertaining. It was mostly thorn bushes, poison ivy, and honey suckle.   Setting up the fencing is a pain but it only took like 30 minutes tops. If I were to clear that brush by hand it would have been over an hour of hard labor."

It's hard to say exactly what it is without being there, but goats get abscesses from all manner of things, it's not an uncommon problem.   I've experienced sub-q lumps that had no obvious cause and never did anything but sit under the skin, and upon necropsy, appeared to simply be fatty lumps."
goats,399o60,Epona142,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:37:34 2015 UTC,To add to this: Did your recently give a shot there? We have a lot of lumps raise up from subq injections that go away on their own in a few months.

Not to mention the elevated risks of mastitis of all types simply because she'll be dragging that horrid bag over everything."

goats,399nmb,Epona142,2,Wed Jun 10 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"Haha ah well, then if she's $50 that might be a good deal.  Something that old isn't going to have the best flavor - if you want to try goat's meat at it's best, you need a kid just before or just after weaning. Mmmm...so tender and delicious.  Older goats deff have a unique flavor - some like it, some don't.   Goat meat from most stores tastes like shit."
goats,399nmb,Epona142,2,Wed Jun 10 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"She's $100. I figured, she's a full size dairy goat, at least 100lbs, $1 per lb live weight isn't that bad eh?? Or am I wrong?   You sound like a maniac lol. I thought you loved goats!  I'm raising a kid right now but I won't be able to eat her (selling her at the fair), but if she doesn't make weight we'll either sell or eat her. Depending how we like it would depend if we went to eat her ourselves. Hence why I want to try goat meat. Few month old goat tastes fine, right?  I could probably haggle a bit on the price though."
goats,3923xk,SWATyouTalkinAbout,9,Mon Jun 8 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"Is it a raised lump or a bare patch? Squishy or firm? When you squeeze it gently and roll it around, what does it feel like under the skin? How long has it been there that you know of?  Do the goats have access to the same pasture/browse/water as white tail deer?"
goats,3923xk,Epona142,4,Mon Jun 8 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"It's a raised bump, in between squishy and firm, it's not hard but not really soft either. And I couldn't really describe what it feels like to roll it around... It feels like a pocket under his skin with stuff in it. Not really thin, liquefy stuff, just... Stuff. It's been there for like two weeks tops.   And I know nothing of white tail deer, but they're certainly nowhere near our goats! They all eat the same St Augustine grass, sweet feed, hay, herbal mixtures, and we let them nibble on our spruce trees occasionally as a treat. And they all drink the same water. And that goat in particular has never once been sick or weak since we've had him."
goats,3923xk,Epona142,4,Mon Jun 8 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Has it changed in those two weeks or remained the same?  If it's been the same for that long then I would just let it be and watch it for any change. If it changes, the way it changes (growing, shrinking, losing hair, growing hair, etc) can say a lot.  Most likely cause is an abscess of some type. Goats get them all the time from all manner of ways. I know CL is generally the first thing people think of, but it's more often something else."
goats,3923xk,Epona142,3,Mon Jun 8 19:21:52 2015 UTC,"I had noticed it probably a couple weeks ago while petting him, but I assumed it was simply a bug bite or something. Then it lost all its hair, so we got worried. But we'll keep an eye on it for sure.   What's CL? Is that particularly bad?"
goats,3923xk,Epona142,8,Mon Jun 8 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"Mmmk that particular detail concerns me - that is started and then lost hair. Could be nothing, could be CL.

goats,388ro9,isaidputontheglasses,3,Tue Jun 2 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"We use alfalfa pellets and a grain mix.  They do get produce treats, but nothing that has had any measurable effect on flavor.  We have a very crisp, clear taste to our milk the first few days, (cold or heated) but the goatiness develops after 5-6 days (faster if we haven't been careful about cooling & handling...).  This is a big dilemma, I think, for small-scale milkers... we're only milking two right now, so it can take a while to get enough milk for, say, a 7-gallon cheddar.  Especially while the babies are still getting milk. By then, the goaty flavor is creeping in.  In order to make cheese from that day's milk, you gotta be milking enough to get decent volume every day.  And if you milk that many goats, you better be prepared to make cheese every day!    And, if you're selling the milk, you have a very short ""best if used by"" window!  If you're getting goatiness from same-day milk, maybe it's feed, but maybe it's other things, too?  People on this forum helped us out with that - keep it clean, cool it fast, and handle it gently.  But we still struggle with it.  So I'm curious to see other answers to your question!"
goats,388ro9,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response!  I do keep it cold by pouring small amounts from my steel bowl directly into a steel bucket that is nested inside yet another bucket filled with ice.  It's funny you mentioned the goaty flavor creeping in. I had some today from 5/29 (so a little over 4 days old) and I detected a very faint goat flavor but thought maybe I was imagining it. lol  Does the goat flavor effect cheesemaking much? Should I hurry and make a chevre out of a gallon if it hits 3 days?  Lastly, does the crisp non goaty flavor last longer if pasteurized?   I'm tempted to just tell folks that, if they want flavorless milk, to just go to the store and get homogenized cow's milk, but I just want to cover all my bases."
goats,388ro9,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Tue Jun 2 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"Not imagining things :-)  I've had some two-week-old goat milk that tasted like you'd been head-butted in the mouth by a buck in rutting season.  Not a spoiled tasted at all.  Just GOATY.   It does affect the cheese, some more than others.  With chevre, you'll DEFINITELY taste it.  With aged cheeses, less so.  (In my opinion, anyway.  I think the ability to detect it varies across people.)  I notice it in feta more than mozzarella.  So yeah, if you can, cheesify that milk as soon as you have enough for a ""batch"".  Other ways to use up smallish amounts before goatification sets in include caramel and mozzarella.  After MANY failed attempts, I've finally found a mozzarella recipe that works for goat milk, and I make batches with as little as 1.5 gallons, then freeze the balls for future pizzas.  I've never noticed any increase in goatiness in my year-old frozen mozzarella.  (The recipe is a modified version of the one on the fiasco farms website.  If I remember, I'll put it up in a separate post...)    We've never pasteurized, so I'll defer on that question to those who do.  But the goatiness is a function of three long-chain fatty acids that break down. (Caprylic, Caproic, Capric)  They break down over time, and with rough handling, but it seems likely that certain kinds of bacterial action (or the lack of it) contribute to the rate at which the chains break down.  So I'm not sure I could predict whether or not pasteurization would slow or increase the speed of those reactions.    And yeah... if people wanna drink something that tastes exactly like skim milk from a plastic jug, then they're gonna need to buy pasteurized, skimmed cow milk down at the 7-11!  Around where we live, raw cow and goat milk is huge, and people seem very accepting of the variations.  In other markets, you have to work harder to convince them that the goaty flavor doesn't mean your doe got a foot in the bucket while you were milking. :-)"

goats,388ro9,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:02:43 2015 UTC,Goat flavor is good for cheese. Toggenburgs were bred specifically for a goat taste for cheese. But that depends how strong you want it.
goats,388ro9,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:01:41 2015 UTC,I agree. I actually like the goat flavor myself. I'm asking about this more for other folk's palettes than my own.   I did not know that about Toggenburgs. Interesting!

goats,3832bn,Epona142,2,Mon Jun 1 15:37:28 2015 UTC,"My google-fu isn't turning up much information on how long CL can be in the soil. Some say it's up to two years.

goats,3832bn,sprocket,2,Mon Jun 1 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"Are there any permanent buildings, or is this just pasture land, or brush land?  Do you know for certain that the previous herd had CL at the time they were on the property?  If it is all open, outside land, I would say that there is a risk, though small.  Time and sunlight are good sanitizers.  Buildings, however, the interiors of which don't get a lot of sunlight and have permanent fixtures (posts, walls, etc) for goats to rub on will likely have an increased risk.  I would still rate it as low-ish, but it's non-zero.  How many years has it been?"

goats,37x2je,Dekonite,1 point,Sun May 31 07:13:10 2015 UTC,"My old scrub goats I'd do them about twice a year, but I hear with Nubians I should do it more often, I've only had the girls for 4 weeks so I haven't yet but probably will soon, I've heard Nubians and the humid Southern US summers people would have you shoot for 1-3 months (depending on who you talk to)."
goats,37x2je,Dekonite,2,Sun May 31 07:26:44 2015 UTC,"Technically, you should only deworm when you see evidence of worms... otherwise, you'll end up with a farm and goats full of drug-resistant worms that can't be gotten rid of.  Never deworm on a ""schedule"", only when actually needed.  If you don't already, you can learn how to do your own fecals, or you can have your vet do them.  It's a hassle, but better than the nightmare of worms that you can't kill..."

What's your goal with her - is she more of a pet, or are you going to try to breed her yourself for meat, or to improve bloodlines of your own herd?"
goats,37xx5y,sprocket,2,Sun May 31 12:56:06 2015 UTC,i just want her bloodline. the owner told me they are moving away from goat meat production almost all their goats are saanen/anglo nubian
goats,37xx5y,sprocket,1 point,Sun May 31 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"Not a bad price; around here I'd say around 250-300 for a breeding doe is fair.  Personally, I'd probably say something more like 250 (unless she's really good) on account of having lost a couple breeding years.  That said, if you keep her healthy, she should have many good years ahead of her yet."
goats,37xx5y,isaidputontheglasses,1 point,Sun May 31 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"If there are no papers, I wouldn't go more than $200. That's what unregistered boers seem to be going for in my area, and those are two years old so in their prime I believe. I could be wrong, but 4 seems a bit old to me."
goats,37xx5y,brunobits,2,Tue Jun 2 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure on the age because I don't know how long you can breed, but $300 for a breedable Boer female is about average around here I think..."
goats,37xx5y,Dekonite,2,Sun May 31 10:59:19 2015 UTC,We have an 11yo lamancha doe here this year who kidded. So long as they're healthy they can breed.

goats,37xx5y,isaidputontheglasses,1 point,Sun May 31 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"I was recently told pure boers are very prone to parasites and it is generally a good idea to cross them with kikos. Is this true?  I've actually been thinking about getting into raising goat meat myself. I mean, it'll be sad cause goats are my favorites, but it'll be pound for pound less death than with my chickens and ducks, but that's a whole other can of worms right there I guess. :\"
goats,37xx5y,Epona142,2,Tue Jun 2 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"As a general rule of thumb, I would say yes, it is true. Kikos are famed for being parasite resistant and hardy, while Boers are...well...not.   Goats are delicious. Especially ones raised with care and love."
goats,37xx5y,isaidputontheglasses,2,Tue Jun 2 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll definitely go for the cross when the time comes. :)  I had goat meat one time at a Mexican restaurant with mole sauce. I thought it tasted like a cross between venison and lamb, which was pretty good.   I'd be very curious to see what my home grown goats would taste like. I don't have the quality of pasture for cows, so goats are a natural choice for large meat production.  I have to be honest. I thought for sure you would be opposed to goat meat doing what you do all day. Glad to see you are practical!"
goats,37xx5y,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 2 01:57:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think the same and are surprised when they hear I routinely butcher cute young goats and enjoy them in a stew.   I love goats, I am passionate about them, they fascinate me. We molded them into one of the first domesticated animals and refined them to provide us with a multitude of uses, and I would be a fool indeed to not appreciate all of those purposes.   I honestly don't eat much meat, but what I do eat, I know where it came from and how it lived, and I feel I can appreciate it fuller this way."

goats,37xx5y,Epona142,6,Sun May 31 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Why?  I'll tell a little story that taught me a valuable lesson about how it's impossible to judge a person or situation by grammar/spelling.  I saw, several times, on my local craigslist, an ad for Nigerian Dwarf goats. It was badly written, with poor grammar and spelling and an odd way of phrasing words, alongside bad pictures. I assumed it was a non-native English speaking family, most likely Hispanic, raising scrub goats in their backyard. So I never bothered to have a look, despite it being very local.  Another goat friend called me and said she was going to check it out and invited me along. Why not?   Instead of what I expected, we found a beautiful little farm with a beautiful herd of goats. The owner and her husband were lovely wonderful people, friendly and knowledgeable, if perhaps a little behind the times. The owner's husband is Deaf, and was the one writing the ads.  I took home a goat.  Years later, guess where you'll find me. Living here on that very same farm, working my dream job.   I found it extremely interesting to think about later - how I ignored the ads because of how badly they were written. Just goes to show both how we shouldn't judge, and how important it is to present oneself in a professional manner."

goats,37rdbn,Epona142,2,Fri May 29 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"The captive bolt is completely humane when done properly.   Cutting the throat properly is also humane, but for skilled hands only.   A bullet to the back of the head is the right way to go when using a firearm - in this situation and aiming at the proper spot, the .22 is efficient."
goats,37rdbn,Dekonite,1 point,Fri May 29 23:58:30 2015 UTC,Chemical euthanasia is horrible. Captive bolt or properly placed shot with a .22 long rifle bullet is the only way to roll. You either kill them instantly or stun them into sweet oblivion then bleed them out very quickly.  ETA: Dairy bucklings not having meat is not necessarily true. We have a Lamancha wether we either intend to keep and try to get him to learn to pack or eat depending on how his personality shapes up and he's a monster little boy.
goats,37rdbn,Dekonite,1 point,Sat May 30 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting about the chemical euthanasia... I know there are at least a couple different methods & drug combinations for small animals.  Is it the case that you find all forms of chemical euthanasia to be inhumane, or just what's used for larger animals?"
goats,37rdbn,Epona142,1 point,Sat May 30 19:08:30 2015 UTC,I just don't think we know enough to know how the chemical cocktails function inside a ruminant to know if it's humane or not but it's pretty hard to deny that destroying brain matter or exsanguination being humane.
goats,37rdbn,Epona142,1 point,Sat May 30 22:44:36 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Makes sense.
goats,37rdbn,Dekonite,1 point,Sun May 31 01:06:01 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with chemical euth in large animals is that most of them are then buried. Which means chemicals in the ground and all of the natural organisms that feed off the body.  I have seen chemical euth go horribly in an equine and I've also seen it quite successful, so I am not really for or against it. The majority of animals that need it, yes pets included, we put down right here on the farm."
goats,37rdbn,Epona142,2,Sun May 31 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very important concern.  And exactly the reason carcasses donated to the rehab facility can't have been chemically euthanized!  But you've made me curious now... I'll have to see if I can find any information on the breakdown products of the chemicals typically used in euthanasia.  Bacteria are phenomenal little critters, and it's very likely that there are species of soil bacteria that can disassemble those chemicals into harmless byproducts, but only if they can get to it before an animal does."
goats,37rdbn,Dekonite,1 point,Sun May 31 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"I agree - I sell the majority of our LM bucklings for meat, and we butcher several for ourselves. Of course, we have a large Hispanic community and several other communities where goat is a common meat, so the market is very strong."
goats,37o2hz,jilliu5,12,Fri May 29 01:42:55 2015 UTC,"first check eyelids. Red is good, white is a dead goat still on her feet.  Then you need to decide if this is a pet or if this is livestock.  In other words, how much are you willing to pay to save her, and perhaps buy another couple years?  If the answer is that a couple hundred bucks seems fine, then get her to a vet asap. Make sure it's a vet that knows goats. Your average suburban vet will be clueless.  If that's too much (and I won't fault you if you think it is) then the next step would be to try and do the best you can for her at home. Hit her up with a course of antibiotics, probiotics, and the best care you can get for her. Isolate her if you think she is getting bullied, or may have a parasite / infectious disease. Make sure she has good U disturbed access to hay and feed. Try a bit of Apple cider vinegar in her water. Hit her up with the de-wormer again. Look for any hidden injuries / hoof problems.  At that point, all you can really do is mo it or closely. Maybe she'll turn a corner, maybe she'll continue to slide downhill. If so, you'll have to make the call on when it's time to put her down.  The vet can do it, although it will of course cost money. You can do it, though if she's been a friend for 12 years that will be awfully tough. I vote gunshot to the head if you go that route."

goats,37o2hz,salent0,2,Fri May 29 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"Vets can definitely do that for you.  However once you start talking about a herd of half a dozen or more, you quickly have to start thinking about the money side of things, and asking they are pets or livestock."

goats,373dyh,brunobits,3,Sun May 24 14:29:41 2015 UTC,Goat lice isn't transferable to humans. Your local feed store should have a lice powder/dust. It's like $10 all you have to do is dust in on their back and it gets rid of the lice. Works well. I had to dust all three of my kids when we got them and they were lice free pretty quickly. Good luck!
goats,373dyh,bitchinawesomeblonde,3,Sun May 24 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"You can get a pour on insecticide that will work well.  Some will have zero-day milk withdrawals, in the case you are currently milking the goats for personal consumption.  While I have not personally tried it for lice, I would not recommend diatomaceous earth.  The lice are also very likely in your goat's bedding and it will take several weeks for all the eggs to hatch, and for those larvae to be killed as well.  Something a bit more potent tends to work better with lice and done properly, you won't have to do it again."
goats,373dyh,sprocket,1 point,Sun May 24 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pyrethrin dust works great.  And do you clip your goats for the summer?  We had some lice on some of our goats this year... but it was about time for summer coat-clipping anyway.  In most cases, a nice shave and a little brushing solved the problem.  For a couple, we used some ""Python"" brand pyrethrin dust as well.  Good luck!"

I will bring up clipping to my friend Cory who is the main caretaker of the goats."
goats,36zkyg,HeelsDownEyesUp,11,Sat May 23 13:54:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have someone to assist? If so, tie her short to a fence or sturdy wall and get your helper to lift one hind leg to gain better control while you milk.  If you are alone, get a couple of leashes and put one around the midsection in front of the udder and strap her close to the fence (tie her close by the head/neck as well) and hold one leg while you milk. You can also tie up a leg, depending on how she acts.  Milk from behind instead of from the side - you'll have some better control.  Either way, it may be a rodeo.   If she is not showing any signs of mastitis, I would just leave her be. Cut out any grain if she is getting it."
goats,36zkyg,Epona142,11,Sat May 23 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"If you do decide to milk her, putting some grain in front of her often distracts them long enough to get a good amount of the milk out."

goats,36zkyg,Epona142,2,Sat May 23 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to give her anything too rich (sensitive old stomach) so I gave her wet rabbit feed in a bucket. She was pretty good and distracted for half of it, then just decided the food wasn't worth it I guess. I tied her to my horse's cross tie area thinking that'd be better than a fence. I'll try the fence next time, it was a rodeo-- but I got all the milk out of her full udder (3 cups from just that one!) the other udder was high and dry. Looks awful... one udder all shriveled up and the other is a limp hanging tube. Could I band them off?"
goats,36zkyg,Epona142,8,Sat May 23 18:21:25 2015 UTC,Please do not band your goat's udder. Is there an experienced goat keeper in your area that can help you???   Plain alfalfa pellets will also be far cheaper than rabbit feed...I do hope what you gave what the type of rabbit feed that is mostly alfalfa.   If she is only filling on one side I would not be milking it at all - that is how one encourages a lopsided udder.
goats,36zkyg,Epona142,3,Sat May 23 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"I have a neighbor that breeds sheep, and another that had a few goats; otherwise, no one to help with this.  I've had the vet out to see this goat before when one udder seemed to become infected and enlarged, the other had milk at that time but barely any. The vet said it was mastitis, prescribed penicillin shots for 2 weeks, said to milk her out, and infuse the udders twice each. My goat dried up for a while and her udders were all small... then this happened again right now with the other side being the bigger one... I just want to keep her from getting mastitis again until I infuse her or get the vet out.  I keep her on pasture with a pig and mini horse, I didn't have any feed besides my performance horses' and the rabbits' so I opted for the rabbits' Nutrena Country."

When goats are pregnant you say the goats 'are kidding'.: Inaccurate. The act of giving birth is called kidding, but pregnancy is merely called gestating or other similar terms.  Goats are smelly. This is because they have a musk gland behind the polls on the back of their head. Inaccurate. While they do have glands, only intact buck goats will extrude that offensive smell.  In every goat herd there is a herd queen (or pack leader). They're often the oldest and get to eat first. They groom up the new 'heirs' to the position. This new heir often protects the old one from the rest. Inaccurate - some founding in truth, but still not how the herd hierarchy works.   All goats have beards and some have 'tassels' under the chin Inaccurate. Not all goats have beards. The tassels are called ""wattles.""  Goats hate people touching their ears Inaccurate. Poorly socialized goats do not like to be touched in any manner, let alone the ears.  Goats discovered coffee! Apparently in Ethiopia a goat herd saw goats behaving more actively and energetically after eating from a particular bush. He then tried it himself and felt uplifted, awake and full of energy. Inaccurate - this is a legend with no substantial proof.  Kids can follow their mothers almost immediately after being born. They are very close to their mothers and are weaned after around 6 months. Inaccurate - some truth, but weaning is a far more complicated and varied process.  Goats are social animals, however unlike sheep, who they are closely related to, they are not flock-orientated. Pretty much flat out wrong.   Many of these have some grounding in truth, but on the whole, are inaccurate or incomplete."

Even some grain is fine as long as you watch the ratios of phosphorous:calcium (most feed is balanced before you buy it, but check it should be 2:1, I believe.)   You should find a vet nearby who deals in goats OR find a very experienced and find out what vaccinations they recommend and on what schedule for vaccines.

That is entirely too risky in causing major damage.   I have banded many horns quite successfully, but it is an ugly procedure and painful for the goat. The younger they are, the less the success rate when it comes to continued growth and scurs, but done properly, it can be extremely effective in removing the horn without the intense stress of surgery.   This link shows the basics: http://blog.henrymilker.com/2012/07/how-to-dehorn-goat.html  The further down you get the bands, the better. I usually put two bands. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to months - don't try to rush it. The goat will have a massive headache and suffer a loss of position in the herd, and care must be taken that she does not become parasite-ridden or sick.   Some goats hold grudges and won't let you handle them for some time after the procedure. Others don't connect it to you."
goats,35j4u9,Epona142,1 point,Sun May 10 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"Why no to the calf dehorner? I know a number of large breeders and even a couple of vets who use them routinely to get rid of largish scurs and disbud buck kids and it seems to work out very well.  ETA: I would not use a calf dehorner on a SMALL KID either due to the increased risk of brain damage, which what I assume you also meant. I've seen/had kids disbudded with a pretty decent horn growth already using a calf one and it seems to work a-okay.

goats,35j4u9,Dekonite,2,Mon May 11 03:06:13 2015 UTC,"Just noticed your edit as I was scrolling through.  In my personal opinion I believe that it is irresponsible to wait so long one needs a calf dehorner to disbud. Disbudding a day old kid takes me less than a minute on average and the healing time is accelerated when they are that young.   Using a calf dehorner on an older kid is a more intense process and causes far more stress.  However, I also understand there are many ways to do things, and my opinions carries the weight of my behavioral research behind it, which does tend to shift my opinions towards effective treatments with the least amount of stress possible.  If it works for one and one's animals, that is one's right to do."

She's a very friendly goat, and she'd be fine hanging with me for a few hours.  Can I just put a band on the tips (like 2-3"" from the end of the horn) so that she won't have sharp horns? The breeder we got her from saws off the horns, but that seems worse, idk. The other older goat has sawed horns and I love it, I don't get stabbed when I try to handle them.  Basically, leave the horns? I'm fine with horns. If it were up to me, I'd leave all my goats horned. But I'd like to show them, and to show them, can't have horns."
goats,35j4u9,Epona142,3,Mon May 11 06:15:56 2015 UTC,"I'll say that in every instance I've documented of a kid dying from disbudding, it was a calf dehorner used. I think it's rather sloppy for a breeder to wait so long to disbud that they need to use such a heavy tool. But that is simply my personal opinion.   I have documented six goats that were blinded by owners using the paste. It is extremely caustic and the goat must be restrained the entire time it is working. It is also extremely inefficient and the goat almost always scurs.   I would not band the tips of the horns. I can't see that working properly. You can saw the tips off if one must, or duct tape tennis balls to the end."
goats,35j4u9,sprocket,1 point,Mon May 11 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"She doesn't dehorn. We just got her and want her dehorned, but if it's too risky it's fine. She saws the tips off at a year, but otherwise leaves them horned.  That said, I've known some kids dying from improper use of a goat iron too. Niether is particularly safe when you're trying to burn off something so close to their brain.  Agh, I didn't wanna saw.. Any info in that? Or just start hacking away?"
goats,35j4u9,Epona142,2,Mon May 11 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"We always take the horns off our kids at around 10-14 days of age using an iron.  I agree with Epona142 - don't use the paste.  If you wait too long and the goats get too old, taking horns off is MUCH harder on them.  From the sounds of it, yours are past the point were I would feel comfortable doing it.  In my unsolicited opinion, they should have been done earlier, and now I'm almost inclined to say they shouldn't be done at all, save by a vet."
goats,35j4u9,crowbar032,1 point,Tue May 12 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"This is getting into the realm of more advanced advice, which I do try to avoid for the most part, because I am not a vet and if I cannot be hands on showing people these more advanced techniques, it makes me rather nervous.  Any tool in the wrong hands will cause damage - I have disbudded almost 1000 kids at this point and not a single one suffered any permanent problems (there were a few cases of minor infection and of course, some scurs in the beginning). But there is always the possibility, and the risk runs respectfully higher when using a tool developed for a different type of horn and animal.   In the future, I would look for a proper breeder who does the responsible thing and disbuds their kids - but again, this is just my opinion and either way, I'm sure you will find a solution that works for you and your goats.   Banding has been successful for me many times, but if you do them young, they occasionally need to be redone in a few years. But even if they continue to grow, the end of the horn will not be pointed."

goats,35i3yn,crowbar032,3,Mon May 11 13:23:01 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, we've tried a couple different kinds of wire that were intertwined with plastic - one was like a ""tape"", and the other was just twisted strands.  And we hated both.  The wires themselves are extremely fragile, you'll NEVER figure out where the break is (and it will break somewhere), and it just becomes a crimped, tangled mess.  Just use plain wire.  Simple is better.   Plus, that's much easier to recycle when/if you have sections of wire that become too crimped to use.  They keep selling the plastic stuff, however, so maybe someone has figured out how to keep it from sucking."

Multiple cases of massive rope burns because the goats got tangled which needed long term treatment.  Multiple cases of strangled goats that managed to get the rope around their neck in some manner.   Two cases of heat stroke because the goat became entangled and could no longer reach water or shade.  Three cases of badly injured goats by the neighbor's dog who came over when the owners ""looked away for a moment.""   Multiple cases of dead goats via predation when tied.   Three cases of stolen goats when left tethered.   I could keep going but that would mean pulling out my other harddrives and I think these are good enough.

goats,353c0s,isaidputontheglasses,5,Wed May 6 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Did you taste her milk before buying her? I encourage this whenever possible - while unusual, sometimes certain goats or certain lines can produce off tasting or ""goaty"" milk.   Stress of being moved will affect her milk production and change the composition of it so that it tastes different. Not common but it does happen.   Give her time, slowly adjust her over to your feed and see how she does. I know, I know, the usual answer that isn't very useful.  Other causes of ""goaty"" tasting milk are improper/dirty equipment, mastitis, estrus, not cooling the milk quickly enough. The last is generally the number one cause when people ask me about it."
goats,353c0s,Epona142,3,Wed May 6 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"It's not really ""goaty"" at all. I don't mind that flavor. I would equate that particular taste to a mild goat cheese flavor, which I actually like.  In this case, her milk actually tastes decent for a second, but once it reaches the back of your tongue it is this truly bitter taste that just stays with you for like a half hour afterwards. I literally spit it out each of the three times I tasted it. I tasted so many times only because I thought I might be going crazy. My wife tried it as well and confirmed that it was not just me that thought it was gross.  And no, I did not taste the milk before we bought her. I really should have, but the previous owners said she was nursing until the day we got her. They had never actually milked her, but the owner before them had and had reported no problems. They probably would not have let me taste anyway, because they seem to be overly cautious on accidentally selling raw milk, and they were not currently processing this doe's milk. Btw, They said they were getting rid of her only because she was picking on the mini nubians, and I have seen her nip at them.  I'm still waiting on the ADGA paperwork. Would this offer any clues on the taste in the lineage?  Lastly, she was not exposed to a lot of forage in her previous home. Could all the new forage be throwing her off? I've seen her dive in and eat stuff my other goat has long been uninterested in."
goats,353c0s,Epona142,7,Wed May 6 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, foraging will change the flavor of milk. Adds quite a lot of flavor to our cheese, but we do have to be careful of strong tasting plants - the first year here, the goats decimated the sage and their milk tasted...horrid.   I know what you're talking about - I detest the taste of milk completely (funny, right?) but have experienced that strange bitter aftertaste. In both cases, it was diet related.   It's unlikely you could pinpoint a genetic link through the paperwork - most folks won't advertise that their goat's milk tastes like shit.   I'm willing to bet the new diet has thrown off her flavor. It may or may not ""even out"" as she becomes accustomed to her new home - only time will tell!"

And selling milk is the hardest of them all - we do not sell milk because the regulations for it are just too much.   But if you're committed and stubborn and truly enjoy everything about goats, goat cheese, and everything that comes with it, it's one hell of a lifestyle.

I know this because the previous owners actually gave me some boluses for my old herd. The owners definitely  kept up on copper.  There are no signs of copper deficiency, but she is very bony like she needs to eat more. She also went CRAZY on grass and weeds as soon as she got here. I guess she had little access to greens before.  I'm happy to report that I tried her milk again today. This time I tried it straight from the udder to a drinking cup to eliminate any factors such as cooling issues or maybe container leaching. Anyway, it was better. Not great by any means, but I'd say halfway between unbearably bitter and normal. So... basically, it still tasted bad, but not enough to make me want to scrape my tongue and use mouthwash.  I think she will come around. I'll report back on this sub to you and Epona if she becomes normal. I think it will just take another week or so and I'll probably never discover the cause.

You also cannot go the ""holistic"" route very easily with any type of success. No offense to those of you who try that path, but it hasn't worked out well for 99% of the people I know who tried it. Goats are simply too delicate and were not evolved to live the way we keep them.  You need to practice coccidia prevention. This means starting at 21 days with the product that works well for your region. Some folks use di-methox, some use corid, some use sulfa mixes, and many folks are trying out Baycox with great success.   Keeping a closed herd and raising your own kids for future generations is the best way to do this in a ""natural"" fashion, because you will be breeding goats with a strong natural immunity against your farm's ""brand"" of coccidia. We rarely bring in new does to our farm - the majority of our new bloodlines comes from bucks.   Pasture rotation, unless you are following with other animal species or leaving the pastures fallow for at minimum a year is largely ineffective.  Here is a great article that will help you along; coccidia is a right pain in the ass. http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articles2/coccidiosis06.html"
goats,34y0ho,Epona142,2,Tue May 5 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, much as I would love the idea of ""holistic"" control, I agree that it's just not viable.  We will keep a closed herd.  I was hoping that simple pasture rotation would be more helpful, but we have certainly thought seriously about some kind of equine as a dead-end host as well.    So you're starting prevention at 21 days - say, for instance Di-Methox for 5 days. Then fecal testing and as-needed treatment after that?"
goats,34y0ho,Epona142,1 point,Tue May 5 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of ponies and tons of poultry that run with the goats and I do think it makes some kind of difference. Dead end hosts can be very useful for species specific internal parasites.  You'll find every breeder does something different just about - some people do three rounds, every 21 days. Some do two, some do four. We do one round of Di-methox and then 21 days later, we hit with one dose of Baycox, which is Toltrazuril. I have noted massive success using this method and fecals show no need to continue for the majority of kids.   Many folks have reported success using just one dose of Toltrazuril, but it's still up for debate in the goat world...like everything else!"

I had never hear that and wanted to confirm. I may have to get another milker soon I guess.  I'm super excited for the alpine. I hear she does between 3/4 and 1 gallon per day.
goats,3487cf,Epona142,6,Wed Apr 29 02:32:05 2015 UTC,Lol because I only do two things - play with goats and play on the computer. I lead a marvelously dull and wonderful life!   My specialty is goat behavior and I agree that three is the optimum minimum group of goats. But I also acknowledge that many pairs of goats live content lives together.

goats,346rbo,poorsoi,9,Tue Apr 28 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"What tinygoatlings said.  Note as well that vets will do their best, but they lack a lot of the education to properly handle goats and attempt to treat them as miniature cows.   Sounds like you had a lot of issues going on, not just one.   No person should keep breeding goats unless they are 200% committed. These animals are extremely delicate, delight in dying, and take joy in breaking your heart. Most people last an average of three years.  PET goats are easy - dry does or wethers. So a lot of my advice really depends on which direction you are going.  Regardless, if you are ready to give it another go, just keep doing what you're doing. You can research until the end of time and never know enough about goats. It is literally my full time 24/7 job to care for goats and research them and I learn more every single week.  Two goats is a minimum, three is optimal for small pet groups.   I am forever hanging around this subreddit and am always willing to help, give advice, answer questions, etc. I get a great deal of enjoyment from sharing my passion for these animals with others."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,6,Tue Apr 28 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"What you said! lol  I am forever reading, researching, on forums, etc., trying to do everything I can to keep my small dairy herd happy and healthy. It's a huge commitment and really needs to be passion."
goats,346rbo,tinygoatlings,4,Tue Apr 28 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  I think you're right about the vets. I called quite a few places in the country around us before finding a few that treated goats, and of these only two or three were willing to do a farm call. Of those, only one was able to make it out the same day when it was an emergency. This time I will try to find someone that doesn't just treat goats, but is well acquainted with them.  I have no intention of breeding or keeping more than a pair. Either dry girls or wethers would be fine, my only requirement at this point being that they're healthy! Smaller, like Nigerian Dwarf or Pygmies, would be preferable as our property is only 1.5 acres. Since our goats won't be used for breeding, it would be nice to rescue a couple of mixed breed adults in need of a home."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,3,Tue Apr 28 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yes...I shudder for the future of vets honestly. We are an approved farm for pre-vet students to earn intern hours. I've told the farm owners that there are several I do not want returning - I absolutely love to share my passion for the care and health of the animals on this farm and will spend all day with someone eager to learn.  But some of these students not only had absolutely no clue which end of the animal was the front end, but many would say things like ""eww gross"" during birthing or another procedure. They caused me more work and stress than they saved me and I do not get paid to babysit people, only goats.  And we're not talking kids here, we're talking students of one of the biggest agriculture colleges in the country in one of the biggest agriculture states.  Yes, go with dry does or wethers. Keeping goats as pets is pretty easy. You most likely know the basics by now, and we here in the subreddit are always here to help with specifics."
goats,346rbo,Dekonite,3,Tue Apr 28 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"We've all lost goats. There's not a goat keeper who can say otherwise. Goats are fickle and fragile. At the end of the day, I love my goats and I do my best to keep them healthy and that's all anyone can ask of us.  You seem to have done your due diligence for the ones you had and sometimes shit just doesn't go your way. Don't think you're a bad keeper for this. You did what you could and you learned from it."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,3,Tue Apr 28 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yes - it's a cold hard reality that goats die. A lot. Breeders may not advertise most of their deaths, because people judge, but we all experience it.   This is the nature of a prey animal that has multiple offspring in a birthing. Add in the difference in how we keep them vs the environment they evolved to live in, and there you are."
goats,346rbo,GroovyGoat,2,Tue Apr 28 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I really appreciate that.  I also keep chickens and they manage to die in the absolute dumbest ways. I once had one fall into an empty feed bucket and fail to jump out, so she died there due to exposure. Another took a nap in the woods by herself and got caught by a bobcat. It takes a lot of knowledge about a particular animal to know the difference between accident vs. error, and be confident enough not to blame yourself for things like this."
goats,346rbo,tinygoatlings,2,Tue Apr 28 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you had a rough time with your first goats.   If you are looking for a vet for future goats, I would recommend using the ""find a vet"" function on the American Association of Small Ruminant Practitioners website. http://aasrp.site-ym.com/  I'm a member myself, and it caters almost strictly toward sheep, goats, and camelids. You might not find someone close enough to see you on an emergency basis, but you'll have a better chance of finding someone with goat experience through them."
goats,346rbo,tinygoatlings,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"That looks like a great resource. Unfortunately in my case, it turned up no results, but hopefully it can help anyone else who may peruse this thread."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,4,Wed Apr 29 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"Goats can be much more challenging to raise than a lot of people expect. It sounds like you were sold unhealthy goats, and perhaps your vet isn't terribly goat knowledgeable. If the goats had bloat (what you're calling colic) it could have been a bad transition to new feed, ate something bad out in their pasture etc. The weight issues and scours could have been from any number of things from cocci that was never properly treated and did permanent internal damage, to Johnes disease.   Goats are a joy, but they can also be a lot of work. Your best bet would be to do the research and find a breeder with a wonderful reputation in your area and form a relationship with them. A good breeder will be open to helping you learn about owning goats, the parasites in your area, mineral deficiencies, etc. They can also be there for you when bad things happen and help to guide you.   If you ever have another animal pass away without a known cause, get a necropsy performed - most state extension offices will do it for free, and it will give you definite answers for future potential problems."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,2,Tue Apr 28 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's all very helpful information!  There is an amazing non-profit goat rescue in our city that accepts volunteers, so you're right, it would be a good idea to jump onto something like that and learn hands-on first. I'll certainly be more discriminating about where we get our animals in the future as well.  I've read a little more about Johne's disease and that seems like a possible candidate. I'll ask the vet who treated them whether she thinks that may've been the case, and shop around for other farm vets so I'll have a source for a second opinion.  Thanks again :)"
goats,346rbo,Epona142,2,Tue Apr 28 20:20:05 2015 UTC,"If you go on local goat forums and FB groups, you can easily get a lot of feedback on good, reputable breeders in your area.   Adding to what Epona142 said, a lot of people suggest starting with wethers as pets - if you can keep them happy and healthy for a good year, then think of building from there. Wethers are always in need of great homes, and they're easier to learn with :)  A rescue would be a great way to get hand on experience. Just be mindful of bio security concerns when you get your own goats - you don't want to bring anything contagious home with you.   I can't tell you how priceless it has been to me to have great goat mentors who I've bought fantastic goats from and can call in the middle of the night for advice or even emergency meds. I'm also lucky enough to have a super knowledgeable vet who has a herd of her own dairy goats :)  If you suspect Johnes, ask your vet about management strategies - it can be in the soil if you've had infected goats on your property.   Good luck!"
goats,346rbo,Epona142,2,Tue Apr 28 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"But be careful with forums and groups as well (aimed at OP but piggy backing off your comment) - one reason I left the majority of those groups is the excessive amount of outdated information being parroted. Just because someone says something happens for one reason and has been saying it for years doesn't make it correct, and what's worse, many refuse to update themselves with the information and facts that I work very hard to obtain.  A few times of being spit upon (figuratively speaking) when I reached out with facts and research to back up my knowledge by those with close minds was enough for me. I stick around here because it's very small scale and more about sharing goats with some questions sprinkled in. When people need help, they know where to find me."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,2,Tue Apr 28 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you all so much for your helpful responses. I'm indeed wary of Facebook groups and forums, and appreciate reddit for the fact that as a group in general we're very insistent on providing sources and correcting each other.  While I loved keeping goats, I have no intention of keeping a herd of 3+, but just a pair of happy and healthy wethers would be perfect!  Our vet was so attentive and seemingly knowledgeable, I'm reluctant to move on from her, but it is hard to ignore the fact that one of our goats died the day after she administered care :/ She's also the only mobile vet that I know of, and our last girls were too big for me to be able to move once they fell sick and immobile."
goats,346rbo,Epona142,2,Tue Apr 28 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"I try not to blame the vets - it's no fault of their own they don't receive the knowledge to treat goats - hell most owners don't have the knowledge. It's important to have a good working relationship with a vet who will give you the medications you need...even off label. Because most of what we as goat owners use is indeed off label. It can be tough.  I always recommend three as a minimum for a pet group, based on my behavioral research, but two get along well enough. I recommend a very hardy breed like the Nigerian Dwarf. They are small and easy for one person to handle, with good feet and a much better constitution for the way we keep goats.   Don't shy away from the top breeders with tons of show ribbons and obscene pictures of their goat's tits on the website. Even the best of us have an excess of little bucklings seeking those elusive pet homes, and generally for good pricing. In fact this year has been a massive buckling year - we had an abysmal amount of the little boogers."

goats,33wcd6,peenbuttt,4,Sun Apr 26 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Frothy bloat will cause foamy 'bubbles' of saliva around the mouth. Dry bloat will just distend rumen making it hard and hot to the touch, you'll see this with frothy bloat too.  A goat's rumen is located on it's left side.  If both sides are equally pooched it's likely not bloat, but if the rumen side is out more than the other, it likely is.   Fiasco Farms has a lot of info on dealing with bloat and we've found their methods pretty spot on. We sometimes administer a bloat drench med too if it's pretty severe when we catch it.  https://fiascofarm.com/goats/bloat.htm"

I've wondered about this for a long time - it's probably in everyone's best interest to have a stable hierarchy, because no one wants to be fighting day in, day out."
goats,33uvw1,melligator,3,Sat Apr 25 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"I've never done topical eye ointment on goats, but I have on cats, and it works rather well.   Have someone restrain the goat and secure the head to the best of their ability, either by holding the horns or more or less hugging the head and neck to their body. Use your thumb to lower the bottom half of the affected eyelid, and apply the ointment from the tube directly onto the eye at the point where the eyelid meets the the cornea. Apply to the point where you have enough ointment on the eye (generally speaking, you draw a line with the ointment along the area where the eyelid comes in contact with the cornea from one end of the eye to the other), and then allow the goat to close it's eye, and make the eye blink a few times to spread the ointment along the whole eye.  Another recommendation would be to take a wet rag or such with warm water, and clean off any gunk before applying the next dose to prevent any buildup."
goats,33uvw1,LegacyElite84,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"The vet and I were able to restrain him - if my husband can help me (he doesn't love manhandling them) we should get it done. The alternative is no meds and the goat may well lose an eye, so hopefully that is a persuasive argument for him! The vet had him round the neck and I held his horns, it worked but he was strong. I'm glad it wasn't our big guy, it would never have happened."
goats,33uvw1,LegacyElite84,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"Another alternative would be cornering the goat, or haltering and tying the goat off, and have someone handle the horns so you don't get whacked yourself.   I've been working with Boers for the past few months, and I feel your pain. I wish you luck."
goats,33uvw1,LegacyElite84,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"I got my husband to get hold of the horns while I sort of cuddled his neck and held his eye open with one hand and did the ointment with the other. I gotta say, he didn't love being grabbed but like with the vet, he didn't flip his shit over the ointment in the eye. I think he must know on some level we are helping? I think my cats are smart but any medication stuff and they are bastards - this goat was actually way cool about it. Or perhaps it was beginner's luck and tomorrow I get gored to death."

goats,33uvw1,Epona142,2,Sun Apr 26 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"If you do not have a milkstand (everyone who has goats should have a milkstand) then straddle him (if you are tall enough), put a hand under the head, tilt it back and wrap your arm gently around it. Pry open his eye and drop the drops in real quick. You may need help. You can also try doing it from the side of his body if you cannot get the base of his neck between your legs for more control. Depends on his temperament.   Having big scurs or horns like that actually makes it more dangerous to do things like this. He may not mean to hurt you when he flails about to get away from the unpleasant situation, but it can happen.    I should do a video of the various holds I have developed to work with these animals, since I do 99% of the care alone, and I am quite small. But then people will look at me and I am shy."

He did not enjoy the needles though! I just know this has the potential to be hilarious (and by hilarious I mean awful haha)."

I touch very briefly on the three main methods of wethering and more importantly, include some videos, in one of my blog posts from my neglected blog. http://texasgoatwhisperer.com/blog/?p=136"
goats,3354u6,Epona142,2,Sun Apr 19 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the blog link. The more videos I can watch the better I think I will feel about the whole situation. Most of the time I think people get goats and the whole wethering situation is already long over and done with. Here I am right in the middle of it all, lol. My payment for helping being two wethers.. As a fist time goat owner I find the prospect of improperly castrated males slightly intimidating.  If you do miss a testical your only clue that it is still operational is that he will go into rut?"
goats,3354u6,Epona142,3,Sun Apr 19 20:28:01 2015 UTC,"You're getting overpaid lol. Wethering really is easy, and once you have a feel for it, mistakes are unusual. Not that they don't happen, especially with a tool that is rather...hmm..clumsy, to use.   Banding, it's all about getting both testicles in the right place. If someone messes this up, they are being extremely sloppy.   Cutting is much the same, but not for the faint of heart.   I confess I have had very little experience with the tool - the few times I was able to handle it and try it, it was rather unwieldy for me (small hands) and I absolutely needed a helper, where the other two I could accomplish well enough on my own.  You need to really crush the cords and it can be difficult and they scream in a fashion they don't generally do when being banded or even cut. Dreadful, and I am not faint of heart at all when it comes to these things.   If you do it wrong, the testicle will continue to function. If you do it correctly, the testicles are supposed to shrink and harden."

goats,331xmf,Dekonite,2,Sat Apr 18 20:08:27 2015 UTC,Free choice baking soda probably wouldn't hurt. Pepto is good. If it's just stress related you might also give her some probios and powerpunch to pep up her rumen and digestion.  Watch her after this for a couple of days and she isn't making any progress you need to find a vet to run a fecal to check for worms and coccidia.
goats,331xmf,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:25:08 2015 UTC,How much pepto should I give?  Called a few vets to see if they can run a fecal. No local livestock vets here afaik.
goats,331xmf,Dekonite,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a mixture of diet related and stress related. I'd just go with the baking soda/pepto and see if it clears up. How much pepto is widely debated - I have given up to 30cc.   You can also try canned pumpkin, just a couple teaspoons.   Any competent vet should be able to run a fecal for you - thank goodness for small blessings, eh?   Continue to offer free choice forage (ie hay), it will help.  If you can give her some green leaves, (this is one of my little tricks) that is good too. Just a couple branches from a safe tree."
goats,331xmf,Dekonite,2,Sat Apr 18 22:11:27 2015 UTC,I always forget the pumpkin trick and really want try it. We always give pepto per the on label for adults. You can google the cc to tablespoon conversion. I think its 15.

And she was the one who really liked the grain, so, yeah. She's being locked up with just hay right now.  Nothing is green around here ): I can give her just branches. I could give her spinach, broccoli, or bok choy though.  The biggest syringe I have is 1 ml, lol. So, can I give like 5cc? Would that do anything?"
goats,331xmf,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"1ml is actually 1cc. You need to get ahold of a drench gun that holds around 30-50cc for meds like this.

I suggest you go out and invest in a big box of 3cc & 6cc syringes and needles of different sizes (I usually keep 22g and 18g on hand - one for normal stuff, one for thick solutions/drawing blood) you will need them!   You should also invest in a ""drencher"" like so: http://www.jefferspet.com/products/sharpvet-feeding-syringes  I order a lot from Jeffers and have always been happy, so if you can't get out to a feedstore, it's perfect.   It won't be long before your supply cabinet looks like a pharmacy.  You can give 5cc, it certainly can't hurt and may help. I always forget there are parts of the country still in winter...in Texas, summer is here. The good part of summer, not the dry horrid part.

A smaller herd will actually be a more risky environment, as the lowest ranked goat will always be the main target. Now! I still hold by the rule that 90% of the time it works out just fine. I ran horned and unhorned together for years, and there were only three goat on goat injuries directly related to horns. They were pretty bad ones, but there is a risk in almost everything we do. People could say that the risk we take letting our goats browse such a large tract of land is too much. Goats do get hurt on occasion.  Heck, can't stop the beasts from getting hurt. That's why I do my best to tell people, just because this is my way of doing it, doesn't mean it will be the best way for you."

goats,32topr,Chili_Maggot,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:53:23 2015 UTC,Most definitely! We expect another 13 ladies to give birth in the next few weeks here at our small goat dairy. Stay tuned!

I said after I got out of goats last time that if I ever get back into goats it will be registered Nubians with a pedigree or nothing.
goats,32p6pz,cowkong,7,Wed Apr 15 16:22:07 2015 UTC,I think it's a sheep. :x
goats,32p6pz,MKandtheforce,2,Thu Apr 16 00:09:59 2015 UTC,"Ya know, with all that wool I should have known right away. I just can't help but think goat when I see the horns (although I just did some research and found that many types of sheep have horns as well). Do you know what breed of sheep this might be? I'm honestly curious."
goats,32p6pz,MKandtheforce,3,Thu Apr 16 00:15:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, I only had a hunch because I have a friend who's into Jacob sheep and they often have multiple horns (like, four horns on a sheep wut) and I've never seen a goat with that much fiber before! Lol.   I'm more a goat person, so I'm not as familiar with sheep breeds. :c After a quick google search, though... I'm guessing Scottish Blackface?"
goats,32p6pz,MKandtheforce,2,Thu Apr 16 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"Scottish Blackface seems to be right! Thank you so much! And I saw a few links/pictures about that four horned and get that ""wut"". Without much knowledge about animals in general, it's easy to confuse goats and sheep since they share so many similarities."
goats,32p6pz,MKandtheforce,2,Thu Apr 16 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"Sweet! Glad I could be of service. :D I looked up the differences after hanging out with a mix of goats and Jacob sheep, so I could try telling the difference between them, hah.  Jacob sheep are so silly. I used to work with someone with developmental disabilities who would call them ""cows"", because they were all spotted. Those four horned ones are pretty dorky-looking."
goats,32p6pz,MKandtheforce,3,Thu Apr 16 00:37:57 2015 UTC,"You're part of the community of the internet I genuinely enjoy (there are a lot of jerks out there) so I appreciate you correcting me without being rude! I wouldn't even be able to tell the difference between a Neanderthal and a modern Homo Sapien, honestly."
goats,32p6pz,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Thu Apr 16 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"Baw, thanks! There are a lot of jerks out there. high-five for not being jerks  I couldn't tell you the difference between a dinosaur and an elephant, but hot dog, I could talk about goats till my face turns blue!"
goats,32p6pz,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Thu Apr 16 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"hahahaha you're awesome and give me hope for humanity. That's an interesting and unique set of knowledge! You keep following what interests you most because, like most things, it matters in some way that I'm sure I don't fully understand."
goats,32p6pz,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Thu Apr 16 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"Haha, you give me too much credit. You seem like a pretty nice person, yourself. ;)  And you betcha I will! Make sure to do so yourself."
goats,32p6pz,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is goats hold their tails upwards, and sheep downwards :)   Also, goats don't have wool like sheeps wool, there's is more of a shaggy long fur. Goats also tend to have ears that face more at an angle whereas sheeps are more straight out, front facing, but that's not always true."
goats,32p6pz,hotsauce_shivers,2,Thu Apr 16 03:02:52 2015 UTC,/u/cochinBrahmaLover makes me believe otherwise! What are these mammals???
goats,32p6pz,Epona142,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"Lol. I'm cochinbrahmalover.  And yes, but it's all shaggy. Did you not see the photo? Shaggy. Not shaggy. If the hair grows downward, sheep or goat, if it grows just out, it's a sheep. Cause some sheep are shaggy too. These are hair sheep.   Just look at the tail lol"
goats,32p6pz,narwhal_of_death,2,Thu Apr 16 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha, oops, misread that. Thanks for all the info but since I can't see the tail in my own photo, it doesn't really help much! But I get it, since the hair goes outward, rather than go down, it's a sheep. I appreciate all the help!"
goats,32p6pz,bathroomstalin,0,Thu Apr 16 03:20:11 2015 UTC,"Ya I know, just for future reference  They can be hard to tell without the tail. Eventually you basically learn all of the breeds and can tell if it's a sheep or goat. And there's subtle differences like ears and faces, but that's more just instinct after a certain point just guessing."
goats,32panv,youngpee,3,Wed Apr 15 16:51:44 2015 UTC,That's a ram - an ugly mean one. I don't get how people can allow their animals such ugly behavior. I'd eat that sucker before I let something that aggressive on my farm.

goats,32panv,jfastman,2,Thu Apr 16 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"I've always found the mean ones to taste the best...mostly. It's all in my head.  Funnily enough, I have several instances where that kind of thing happened.  The first I remember was a mean rooster. I was just a wee little sprat, and every day when I got off the bus, the evil bastard would attack me and chase me to the house.  One day, he wasn't there!   We had chicken and dumplings that night for dinner and it was the best ever.   My ""pet"" pig ended up on the oven when he started chasing me about and biting my boots and just being a total shit to everyone. He was delicious - nice and lean from being pastured.  The most recent was the steer (though he had a retained testicle I found upon butchering so I guess he wasn't a steer after all) that attempted to kill me in the barn.   He tasted awful but I made sure to eat him anyhow. Soaking gamy or strong tasting meat in milk helps."
goats,32ly4h,captpackrat,5,Tue Apr 14 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"Are goats climbing trees something that isn't considered normal?  Word of warning though - goats climbing trees often find the ONE spot to stick a foot in that they can't get out, often with dire consequences."
goats,32ly4h,Epona142,5,Tue Apr 14 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"Never had our goats climb any trees. Not many trees to climb though.  Hell, our goat had to lean on me just to reach the trees lol"

You can't share pics without me wanting to know more. It's a fine one too, all of mine suck because I didn't have a decent camera when I had them.  My Nigerian doe and my friends alpine who became mine + her stupid wether (the goitered one). When she kidded, he drank all of her milk, ha. Had to sell him. Our buck was lovely and produced blue eyed colorful babies. Seriously. she wasn't blue eyed but her brother was, can't find a pic of him though /: that's the Nigerian, the other one is the alpine x Nigerian cross  Sorry about all the pics. I had to get rid of these guys and I'm getting my new ones this week, so I'm a bit excited :P I miss goatees! And milk. I love goats milk."
goats,32ly4h,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Wed Apr 15 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yah those are two of our bucks. Our bucks lead pretty good lives between the ruts LOL. I am a sucker for color, there's no hiding that.   Good looking goats! Yes, blue eyes are dominant, so a blue eyed parent will pass those on their kids (50% chance). Most of my herd is blue eyed, another well known secret is how partial I am to my blue eyed beauties!

Otherwise it sounds like our towns are very similar, in that we're 30 minutes from the nearest grocery store and our most happenin' place is the gas station too.  My ISP got a ""broadband to the boonies"" grant from the federal government that got them to install fiber and I guess there was enough interest.

goats,327j1t,Sharnevain,2,Sat Apr 11 06:46:19 2015 UTC,"Scours can be caused by a hundred things. I am on my way to milk, but to help with scours while you try to pinpoint the cause (and treat it) - pepto bismal and/or a couple spoons of canned pumpkin will help."
goats,327j1t,Epona142,3,Sat Apr 11 12:07:04 2015 UTC,I am going to give him some pumpkin now. He has no other symptoms and I just got him last night. I don't want to rush to the vet if its just stress... But don't want to wait too long if it is something more.
goats,327j1t,Epona142,2,Sat Apr 11 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"Every person with animals should have canned pumpkin on hand. Just the regular old plain canned pumpkin. You can freeze it into an icecube try to have small amounts readily on hand without opening a can every time.  Canned pumpkin is awesome for digestive issues and most animals will readily eat it. A couple of tablespoons will help with scours AND with constipation. More than that though and you may get even more scours.   I'm done milking now, so let's see if I can help a bit more.  What color is the scours? How much? Is it running down his legs and causing a horrible mess, or just messy on the ground? How thick is it? Does it smell AWFUL or pretty much just smell like shit.   What color are the inside of his eyelids? Pale? White? Salmon pink? Somewhere in between?  How about his internal temperature?   Any wheezing, coughing, running nose, runny eyes, etc.  Just the basics.  Stress can indeed cause scours. Introducing a new feed, hay, or browse can set off a bout as well.  Is he eating? Hay? Grain? Browse? Or avoiding food?   How does he look? Bright eyed, alert? Does he act otherwise normal or is he lethargic? Is he avoiding the others, standing away?  There are sooo many variables, and so much one has to take note of when it comes to goats - the tiniest sign can be full of meaning!   Have any pictures? Obviously only so much can be told from a picture, but there are a few things that can be seen.   Regardless, I'm sure you'll get him sorted out and comfortable."
goats,327j1t,Epona142,2,Sat Apr 11 16:10:43 2015 UTC,I am keeping him away from my herd until I know he is healthy so for now he is alone. He is spirited and alert. He is following me around and crying out a lot. He is clearly upset to be away from his herd. He settles when I hold him.  He has nibbled on orchard grass and Purina goat chow but isn't gobbling it down like my goats. He didn't want the pumpkin but I did get him to suck some off my fingers.   The diarrhea is milk chocolate colored. No blood. No mucus. It doesn't particularly smell. It also hasn't been a lot of it. He splatted it out about 3x I would say.   He just now had his first semi solid dropping so that did make me feel a bit better but I am concerned now that I found he wasn't vaccinated appropriately.  He doesn't seem too interested in water. He had access through the night so he may have drank but the water level is the same. I did use a syringe to make sure he is getting some and he drank it down but wouldn't drink out of the bowl.  I haven't taken any pictures yet but I can in a bit.
goats,327j1t,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"I would give him a dose of thiamine/b12 if I had it on hand and just watch the next day or two to see how things go. From the sound of things, I think you'll find it continues to clear up."

goats,327j1t,GroovyGoat,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:01:05 2015 UTC,Has his feed changed?  This is common if they go from grass to alfalfa or suddenly are being fed grain.  You might want to isolate him from the rest until it's normalized just in case it's something else.  It's most likely scours like Epona142 said.
goats,327j1t,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:44:19 2015 UTC,I literally just brought him home last night. He had diarrhea just as we got home and again at night. He is urinating fine but no solid droppings yet. He ate a bit of orchard grass and Purina goat chow. Has access to water.
goats,327j1t,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:01:25 2015 UTC,Get him to a vet. May be parasitic or another disease process.
goats,327j1t,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:38:47 2015 UTC,"I will second what the other commenter said. While stress could be a component, he also could be carrying something like coccidia that you don't want infecting the rest of your herd. Better safe than sorry. In the meantime, find out his deworming and vaccination status. That can help rule-in or rule-out things like c. perfringens, parasites, etc. (If he hasn't been dewormed or vaccinated, then that should be done)."

goats,327j1t,Epona142,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely incorrect - that breeder should be ashamed.   We give CD/T to the does when they are pregnant, 2-4 weeks before kidding. The kids then receive a booster when they are disbudded, again in two weeks, and then come weaning time we boost once more. After that, they only receive a booster when pregnant.   If you have ever seen a kid die from enterotoxemia or tetanus, you realize just how valuable an inexpensive vial of CD/T really is, and there is no excuse to not give it. It causes no harm, has no milk withdrawal, and properly given, leaves no lump."
goats,327j1t,Epona142,2,Sat Apr 11 16:13:09 2015 UTC,I am going to the feed store today. What plan should I take for vaccinations since he has not been vaccinated? I breed dogs so definitely understand the importance but while venturing into goats I don't know everything yet and get a lot of mixed info.
goats,327j1t,GroovyGoat,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, you'll run into a ton of mixed information on goats.   Goats are what I do and I am very passionate about them, so I am always available to help. I generally hang around the subreddit and am usually on my computer if I'm not out working. Cause even my job revolves around goats. Lol.  Pick up a bottle of CD/T and 3cc syringes along with 20g 1/2 inch needles.  Give him 2cc straight into the thigh. Have you given intra-muscular injections before? You can give it Sub-q, as a dog breeder I'm sure you've done that before with pups, but giving it sub-q has a nasty habit of leaving an ugly (but harmless) lump, which can make uneducated people freak out over the possibility of CL.  If you need to give it Sub-q because you are more comfortable doing that, do it over the rib cage, as a lump in that location cannot be CL, safe guarding you from future suspicion.   Booster him in 3 weeks, and then again once more. Much the same as pups. If he (or any goat) injures themselves on metal, an update never hurts. Also if you have sudden rainstorms that cause your browsing areas to go very wet and green - better to take precaution."
goats,327j1t,mynameisnotemma,2,Sat Apr 11 17:06:25 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! He is doing great. I got him goat electrolytes from the feed store and fed him pumpkin. We are vaccinating him tonight. I will most likely do it sub-Q. I also got dewormer but wanted to make sure he was getting enough normal food in him before feeding him the dewormer. He is eating well now and has normal droppings. I'm going to wait a bit longer before introducing him to the herd to be safe.

goats,320hsq,Epona142,5,Thu Apr 9 16:25:53 2015 UTC,"Just another example of a freak accident that goats seem to gravitate towards.  She was playing on the back of the farm truck, like many of the babies do every day while their mothers go out and browse. Nothing abnormal at all.  By chance, she caught her hoof between the license plate and bumper, most likely when jumping down, and flipped over upside down, completely twisting her hock and ripping it out of the joint and fracturing the tibia. I tried to take pics of the xrays but nothing came out good. :(   Luckily she had not been hanging there long when I found her, as I had just been past there shortly before I went out again and heard her crying for help. I almost choked on my heart - this is one of the top favorites of the year for me (course I say that about almost all of them) and absolutely my boss' favorite.   The veterinarian met us at the clinic - we decided against surgery for multiple reasons, so the veterinarian and I set the leg (it went much better than I expected - this is a very bad break) and got her wrapped up. She was extremely calm through out the entire thing, never once fought. She cried a little as we were yanking her leg, but did not try to escape from the uncomfortable position, laying on her side. She just put her face in the crook of my arm.  Things look really good for a full recovery - she is on crate rest with limited visitation with big sis/adopted mom and exercise."

goats,32182r,Epona142,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"Wish I was in TX!  Quick question, Epona. I gave my goats each a bolus yesterday, but I didn't have the tube thing to inject into their throats. I ended up opening the capsules and giving them each one capsule's worth of copper mixed into a clump of veggie pulp.  Do you think any of the copper reached their rumen or correct location in their bodies?"
goats,32182r,isaidputontheglasses,3,Thu Apr 9 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"There is a massive amount of debate about this.  I will say that you should invest in a pill gun - very inexpensive, especially the small ones. Can order them right from Jeffers Pet/Livestock and have it in a couple days.   Doing it using the capsule and gun ensures you know exactly how much the goat got and you can avoid them chewing it (mostly). Chewing copper rods has resulted in broken and abscessed molars in several goats that I have examined.   To look at the other side (ie giving it with a marshmallow or other food source) there is this link: http://goatspots.com/articles/copper/  Now, they only examined one goat this way, and I for one have a large amount of trouble believing that some of the copper wouldn't come back up in cud using this method, but there it is.  I will however, greatly disagree that using a marshmallow is easier. I have done both. The bolus gun is faster. I also much prefer a pill gun and a pill than a sticky marshmallow mess and watching my goats wreck their teeth chewing them - not all just suck it down."

goats,31r2ur,iseeyouasperfect,6,Tue Apr 7 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, without a lot of other details, I can only narrow it down so far, but I'll ask first - is she alone or does she have goat companions?  If she is alone, well there's your obvious answer.  If not, then it does take time, sometimes a long time, for a new goat to be accepted fully into a herd. It will take time to find her footing.   If she is also used to being coddled and petted more often, she will take time to adjust to a new routine and schedule as well.   Nubians are also very notorious for being loud. A lot.   Chances are she will settle down eventually."
goats,31r2ur,Epona142,4,Tue Apr 7 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"No, she's not alone.  She has her new triplets, and my Saanen and her doe for company.  She had spent her entire previous life in a barn and dry-lot with about 30 other goats at a dairy.  I wonder if that isn't part of the problem.  She gets along well with my Saanen.  Does the nubian have to figure this out on her own, or is there something I can do for her to help her calm down?"
goats,31r2ur,Epona142,3,Tue Apr 7 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"This is one of those things they either adjust to or do not - most do with time. Goats grow very strong attachments, stronger than people realize, and understandably when separated they spend some time in distress, especially coupled with an entirely new routine and location.   I would be a liar indeed though if I don't say that the few instances where a goat simply had to be rehomed due to constant noise, it was always a Nubian. I still remember being able to hear my friend and neighbor's Nubian doe around milking time....from a mile down the road!  But those are far and few in between. She should settle down for you eventually."
goats,31r2ur,sprocket,3,Tue Apr 7 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"One of the most frequent phrases I've found myself uttering these days is, ""@#$%'ing Nubians."".  We had a great Nubian buck 3 years ago from whom we'd kept 25 kids for milking.  I don't know what sort of psychological trauma they had during rearing, but they REFUSE to go out to pasture.  I've succumbed to all the hollering for the last year or so and put hay out for them while everyone else went down to graze, but this year decided to dig in.  After a day and a half of not putting hay out during the day, they're still hooting and yelling, though I did manage to physically relocate 8 of them this morning and locked them into a field.  ARGH.  So...uh...any tips for getting some grass-o-phobic goats to go out without me having to carry them across the yard? ;)"
goats,31r2ur,Epona142,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:11:31 2015 UTC,"(not who you responded to)Goats are for sure different than cattle, but I've had some hay hounds when I kept cows.  In the late spring when I would open up the pasture, there were always a few who refused to go out there and just bawled at the manger for me to put out hay.  A day and a half was not enough.  It was usually the third day that they finally broke.  Of course these were beef cattle and didn't have the feed needs of dairy animals, so I didn't worry too much about them starving.  Alternately will they follow you if you have hay in your arms?"
goats,31r2ur,fluent_in_gibberish,2,Tue Apr 7 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what I was going to say...we just switched to a new hay and I had to listen to a hundred plus goats scream for three days straight. I was almost grateful I am going Deaf on one side. I told them multiple times, too bad too sad suck it up and eat or starve.   I'd like to say they ate it, but we've got them back on their browsing routine so now they just starve themselves until I let them out. Oh well.  /u/sprocket : Start feeding them something delicious and tasty like the crappy cheap sweet feed you can buy at any feed store. Give them a cup or two in a distinctive pail. Make sure you shake it at them before giving it. Associate the sound and sight of the pail with delicious.  Move the feed pail further and further into the field.   Food is the key with goats."
goats,31r2ur,kziv,5,Tue Apr 7 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the Nubians just tend to be loud.  We have Nubians, Alpines, and Nigerians.  The pure Nubians are without a doubt the loudest of all of our herd."
goats,31r2ur,kziv,3,Tue Apr 7 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"I once had two does (sisters) who came from a large herd and mostly ate hay instead of grass/browsing like we offered. Even with a mouth full of food they would scream at the house. One of them would only shut up if I was standing next to her.  We had them for over 2 years and they did not settle down one bit, even when they had babies. They are no longer with us."

However you see quit some modern and new buildings inland because the younger people build them for their parents or as weekend homes.  Someone ran out of money for sure.

You will notice a massive difference in the milk pail though, if that's what you want them for.  From what I HAVE seen, minis don't differ too much personality wise from standard lamanchas and that's a huge plus. Lamanchas are great companions and huge pets with huge personalities.  If you do start with standard breeds you can always up pick up a ND buck and breed your own minis down the line."

Great to hear that you like la manchas, I haven't spent much time with them but the few I've interacted with have been great.  The reason I'd go for these mini manchas specifically is because I've worked a bit with their breeders and they're really great, and their mini manchas are currently more affordable for me than their NGDs. I was hoping for NGDs to start but since these just happen to be on the table I think I might try it out. I do know of a good registered la mancha breeder in my state but since I hadn't been wanting to go with their breed I haven't looked around much. There are undoubtedly quite a few great goat breeders where I live, though! (WA State)  Ninja edit: I'm also interested in the potential for higher butterfat content from the NGD side, versus sheer quantity, as I only currently have two mouths to feed at my house and wouldn't be able to sell milk yet! But the higher yield from the mix could be beneficial too and I've had some truly heavenly cheese from purely la manchas as well."

goats,30usuq,Noclue55,26,Mon Mar 30 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"I....uh...no.  Goats do not kill themselves on purpose. That's a ridiculous notion. I am well fond of saying that goats spend all day imagining ways to die, because they are very prone to many illnesses that can be hard to identify and treat, as well as being quite notorious for finding themselves in sticky situations that can result in injury or death.   If a goat is in an extremely stressful situation and injured, it is possible for them to die from shock, but this is extremely unusual and cases are far between. I have personally handled goats under an immense amount of stress that went into shock, and none have actually died from it. Even the insanely wild ones that were in a panic to escape, crashing into fences with force. It's more likely that they will die in the days following a massive shock/injury, as any lingering parasite infestation or illness will explode to the surface.   A goat who is perfectly healthy but uncomfortable will not die. They cannot kill themselves out of sheer will. This is nonsense."
goats,30usuq,Epona142,4,Mon Mar 30 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, because the story i was told was that they gave a perfectly healthy goat to a neighbor. Neighbor feeds goats, within two hours goat dies after it tries to climb a tree and gets a hoof stuck. I remember most of the examples were either getting horns cut, hooves stuck or just stuck.  Would getting a hoof stuck in a tree induce shock that would kill  them?  Also for their notoriety, what are some examples of sticky situations that goats can be found in that can be damaging?"
goats,30usuq,Epona142,11,Mon Mar 30 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"She likely died of dehydration, or choked to death if she flipped herself upside down. Goats love to get themselves stuck. I could rattle off a massive list of deaths that come from a goat getting itself stuck somehow.  One particular one stands out in my mind, because I would have said it was impossible for the goat to get where it did. But she got there, my first little registered goat that I was so pleased with. Found her wedged upside down in a narrow space. Still can't fathom how it was done. So sad.  I could tell you a million stories that all have the same plot line: goat with horns gets them caught in fencing/netting/hay nets/hay feeder/you name it and dies. The ugliest stories are about goats that get their horns stuck and dogs find them.  Found one doe with her hind legs wedged through the fence. (???) No idea how she did it. It damaged to nerves in her legs so badly she never could walk again, and had to be put down.  A very expensive and gorgeous buck was found with a broken back in a creek. The goats cross this creek all the time. No clue what happened.   A young wether wedged himself into a hay feeder that he should not have been able to hurt himself on. Died. No idea what went on.  Doeling tried to slip under the gate, caught her collar on it, choked to death and died.   Small doelings, out and about being naughty, went into the hay barn. One was crushed by a bale that was somehow knocked down onto her. (Murder????)  Some of these are personal experiences, and some are anecdotes from friends and fellow breeders.   Goats have very good problem solving skills and are extremely curious. A recipe for trouble."

goats,30psii,Foremangrill1,14,Sun Mar 29 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"I copied this from another very recent post about getting goats.  You need two minimum, three better.  You want a backyard goat? Goats can successfully be kept in small settings, as long as they are legal. Look into the miniature breeds: Pygmy, Nigerian Dwarf.  You want wethers. These are neutered males. They are inexpensive and easy to care for.  You want to go to a good breeder. Don't shy away from breeders with fancy websites showing off all their show ribbons and obscene pictures of their goat's boobs. Not only do even the best breeders often have an excess of little bucklings looking for hard to find pet homes, but you're more likely to get a healthy pet. Speaking of, you want to buy from a breeder that tests for CAE at minimum. CL is a good thing to be tested for as well. You want a breeder who vaccinates and disbuds - this means your goats won't have horns.  You don't want horns. Horns do not belong on pet goats. This is my opinion and other people are welcome to disagree with me. I suggest you do a lot of research into the debate and decide for yourself. :)  You need good fencing. GOOD FENCING. I cannot stress this. If we are talking a small enclosure, you can spring for the extra expense of panels, that can easily be moved about and are sturdy and long lasting. You need shelter - waterproof and draft free. I've talked about the tanks I use, and you can also get large breed dog houses, or build something yourself.  Either bottle raise your new pets or buy from a farm where you can meet them and see how friendly they are. Starting with friendly goats will make loving your new pets far easier.  Feed? Oh yeah, you need to feed them. For wethers, especially one of the miniature breeds, all you need is a quality hay, fresh water, and a loose mineral. If you can offer them natural browse, that is awesome. Wethers, in most circumstances, do not need grain. A fat goat is an unhealthy goat.  If you have a small enclosure, your goats will need exercise. You can give them toys in their pen to play upon, and take them for walks. Goats can be leash trained very easily, and will wear collars (only use the collars when walking, or use cheap breakaway collars in the pen, so if they get caught it will break). You need to learn how to trim feet. It's easy. Invest in a quality milk stand. Trust me. Get some hoof trimmers, watch a few videos, study a few pictures. You'll get it.  Finally - be prepared to be amazed at how smart they are. Goats are excellent problem solvers. They love to make mischief. When raised lovingly, they are very affectionate and will follow you and rub against you like a dog. They can learn tricks and behaviors and are incredibly cuddly.  However, when goats get sick, they get sick quickly and die quickly, and your veterinarian will probably have no idea what to actually do and will attempt to treat your goat as if it was a miniature cow.  So - I think I covered a lot of bases. Any specific questions?"

Get a stanchion or milking stand before you get your goats and train them to stand on it. This will save you hassle when you need to trim hooves, shear, give shots, or milk them.   Also, make sure you own your property or won't be moving for a very long time. Goats live longer lives than dogs and are harder to take with you if you have to move. I have this problem now. I have to move and re-home my two pygmy wethers. It is heartbreaking and hard to find anyone who will take them."

Can't wait to see how Olivia improves on her dam.   Lol sorry, love my goats.  As for the tags - absolutely. Haha. Actually I cleaned that up the day I took a picture. All of the milking does wear a collar, and many wear a tag with a number (a bunch of them have lost theirs so we gave that idea up lol). She is also wearing a bell which denotes her as one of the ""queens"" in the herd. This means if they are on the huge browsing property, if the herd splits off, most groups should have a belled goat to help the Border Collies and I find them, since we only have on GPS collar.   The green and orange yarns were removed, but the orange meant that she had kidded and the green meant she was dewormed - leftovers from kidding season when things were happening extremely quickly and I needed a quick way to see who had kidded already and had their dewormer. I've been removing them as I catch them in the past week or so :)"

goats,300nuv,isaidputontheglasses,3,Mon Mar 23 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"Depends heavily on production lines, what you are feeding, age, number of freshenings, and the doe in particular.   Registration means you have a known pedigree to follow and can check in with the owners of the dam/sire's dam to find out peak production.   If you allowed kids to nurse without milking the does until now (very common) then her production adjusted to the needs of the kids and may be lower. I always recommend (especially for udder health) that you begin milking out your fresh does twice a day (or once if you only milk once a day by routine) immediately after kidding. Even if you don't separate kids. Demand that milk, every drop. The more you ask for, the more her body will make, up to her peak potential.  You can attempt to increase lowered production by going to 3x a day milking or more.  Look into adjusting the protein rate of her feed, and encouraging the consumption of more water by adding powdered fruit drinks. Make sure your does have access to a loose mineral and a salt source.  Here is a good article about feeding the milking doe:  http://www.milkproduction.com/Library/Scientific-articles/Other-milking-animals/Feeds-and-nutrition/"
goats,300nuv,Epona142,3,Mon Mar 23 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"All good advice.    What sort of hay do you have her on?  You may notice a significant difference in production on a good 2nd or 3rd cut hay, as compared to 1st cut.  We don't feed it ourselves, but an alfalfa hay will also help to boost production, as will the availability of good spring pasture.  How long has she been milking?  Lactation follows a curve, and you'll usually hit a peak in production a couple months after freshening.  Closer to the end of a lactation, milk quantities will start to fall off."
goats,300nuv,sprocket,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"Unsure of hay quality. I have a big roll of hay. I have also been giving alfalfa pellets and some alfalfa hay.  I recently learned of free choice minerals and had to add them after discovering a copper deficiency.  The first doe kidded Jan 1st, the second, January 20th, and the third was only 10 days ago.  Here's the thing though. The third one I have milked from day one because her kid was stillborn. I've only milked her once a day thus far. Sometimes twice, but I noticed the second milking was nearly nothing."
goats,300nuv,sprocket,2,Mon Mar 23 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"Was the 3rd one pregnant for the full 5-month term, or did she deliver early?  I have found that if they abort or deliver early than expected, it can (negatively) affect milk production, in terms of quantity.  Once-a-day milking may give her body the signal to start drying up.  Did she start off milking heavier, and is only now producing less?"

goats,300nuv,Epona142,2,Mon Mar 23 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"You can't ""sometimes"" milk twice.  They need to be milked on a regular schedule, at the same time, every day, whatever you choose to do.  The reason you received very little milk during a second milking is because her body has adapted to your needs, which has been once a day milking.   :)"
goats,300nuv,sprocket,2,Mon Mar 23 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"Am I screwed if I have milked once a day thus far? I mean, will they put out more if I start a more aggressive milk schedule? I just gave up on a second milking because she only put out 1/2 cup on the second milkings."
goats,300nuv,Epona142,2,Mon Mar 23 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to say without giving it a go but I've brought many does, if not into full production, than at least a higher production rate by increasing the amount of times milking and upping their feed.   :)"
goats,300nuv,Epona142,3,Mon Mar 23 20:18:53 2015 UTC,I've never milked any of the dwarf varieties - what is a good daily average for them?
goats,300nuv,Epona142,2,Mon Mar 23 20:42:09 2015 UTC,The heavy milking lines can produce up to 4lbs a day. Our girls average 2-3.5lbs a day at their peak. I've been working hard importing bucks from high quality herds to raise our average here - I would love to see everyone producing 3lbs on a first freshening - hey one can hope!   The real draw for the ND milk is the butterfat. It adds so much flavor to our cheese!
goats,300nuv,sprocket,2,Mon Mar 23 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"Hi Epona, I've been looking into getting my milk checked for diseases and the like. Do you have a standard list of things to check for? And, where would you get it tested?"
goats,300nuv,TrollaBot,2,Sat Mar 28 13:32:12 2015 UTC,You can test for CAE using blood (at least 3cc) and send it to Biotracking. That should be your #1 - it should be every goat breeder's #1.  CL can be tested for via blood. We don't do this test anymore or use the vaccine as any vaccinated goat will turn up positive for CL on any further tests.   We also test for Tuberculosis and Brucellosis as required by the state. These are done by your vet.   Good luck! :)
goats,300nuv,micoleslaw,2,Sat Mar 28 14:55:19 2015 UTC,Phew. Good to know! I mentioned some copper issues. Would a copper bolus help production?
goats,300nuv,Epona142,3,Mon Mar 23 20:21:51 2015 UTC,"It will in the way of giving you a healthier goat. Healthy goats = more milk! :)  All goat raisers should be copper bolusing (unless their area is rich in copper). We do it twice a year and are looking to go three times. Proper copper levels means a goat that has a stronger immune system and is more resistant to internal parasites. It also means healthier skin and hair, among many many other positive aspects."
goats,300nuv,Sorceress_of_Rossak,3,Mon Mar 23 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"We live in a VERY wet area (west coast of British Columbia) and I started copper bolusing last year, and feel it's made a big difference in terms of parasite control.  I had been buying the larger cow boluses and breaking them down, then sprinkling 2 grams at a time on top of grain during milking, as it was far easier than getting a goat to swallow one of the smaller gelcaps.  100% recommend them.  You can also get ones with added selenium, which depending on your area, may help as well.  Check with your local vet, but some areas are very low in selenium and you will need to supplement.  Caution is advised as there's a narrow band for proper selenium levels - too high and too low can both be fatal or cause health issues."

goats,300nuv,Epona142,0,Sun Mar 29 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"I would agree with the statement above about the does producing less after the kids are weaned.   I've never had any Nigerian dwarf milkers but raised plenty of regular dairy milkers.  Registration means little when it comes to milk production.   My best producers were all mixed breeds, ""mistakes"" that were practically given away as kids because their bloodlines weren't pure.   When it comes to any animal, papers are, in my opinion, just that...  Paper"
goats,300nuv,Epona142,3,Sun Mar 29 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"While cross bred unregistered goats are in no way inferior, registration papers are not just ""paper.""  Registration means I am able to go back generations and look at strengths and weaknesses in the line, enabling me to evaluate the goat better and match it with another line that will compliment each other, (hopefully) producing kids that are even better than the parents.   Our crossbreds sell just as well as the registered stock, but it would be a fallacy to adopt a stance that papers are ""worthless"" because they are far from it! :)"
goats,300nuv,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Mon Mar 23 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I was a bit insulted by above comment. Registration paperwork is an awesome tool to help any livestock breeder. All the work that goes into some of the top dairy producing lines and to say that it is all paper which doesn't mean anything to milk production is just being willfully ignorant. Not saying there aren't some awesome American or Experimental goats out there, but how would have any idea of their potential without all the work and info on their genetics, i.e., registration paperwork."
goats,300nuv,Epona142,3,Mon Mar 23 19:12:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. Milk stars are the sellers way of proving to me that those animals will produce.

It also doesn't help that I had to deal with one of these people yesterday. They were trying to get me to sell them one of my bucks for a pittance and had the same argument. I would rather take my bucks to market then sell them for less than what they are worth. It was very insulting.   Damn you hive mind! (shakes fist in air)   You are right though, just got to keep educating and getting the information out there that registration is a very helpful tool for any livestock breeding. :-)"

goats,300nuv,micoleslaw,-1,Mon Mar 23 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"Obviously there are perks to having papers, but as a breeder I'm sure you would agree the fact that an animal has papers doesn't make it a good animal.   There are plenty of breeders out there that only breed registered stock and they are junk.  Registration can show how good the lineage is but, the sole fact that an animal is registered doesn't guarantee good bloodlines or good qulaity.   That's all I was saying."
goats,300nuv,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Mon Mar 23 21:56:12 2015 UTC,"Of course not, but you cannot perpetuate the idea that ""papers"" are ""meaningless"" without being fully clear, else that is doing newcomers a disservice!  The train of thought that registration is ""worthless"" is why I have several extremely nice does who could be contributing to the betterment of their breed, but cannot, because a couple generations back, someone considered paperwork a ""waste of time."""
goats,300nuv,jfastman,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"I think it is also a disservice to newcomers to imply that registered=quality, but I know an awful lot of breeders that do.   Point to order...  Not every person purchasing a goat needs them to be registered.  Clearly you take registration pretty seriously.  I had my fair share of registered animals.   I did not say it was worthless.     Also not sure about what breed you are having issues with registration and maybe things have changed but when I raised goats there was a possibility to breed out to a certain fraction and could possibly register as American nubian for example.   Is that not still a possibility?"

goats,2zru9l,Epona142,2,Sat Mar 21 06:41:20 2015 UTC,"They are named using ""Herd name + name.""  For example, if your herd name is Iron Creek Dairy Goats, then you'd be registered as Iron Creek and your goats would all have Iron Creek in front of their names.  Iron Creek Bobby.   Some breeders add other qualifiers, sometimes to make note of sire. Say Bobby's sire is named Genghis Khan. Some breeders would name Iron Creek GK Bobby.  Or something like that."
goats,2zru9l,Epona142,3,Sat Mar 21 12:13:34 2015 UTC,"To add to this, sometimes breeders will stipulate conventions. Ours had to either have seven as part of the name or have 777 as a prefix and the name had to be space related."

goats,2zkohv,dogfacedlion,3,Thu Mar 19 11:18:15 2015 UTC,"Boers are not the hardiest of the breeds - we just lost our last old girl ourselves. She died the same way - came out one morning and she was curled up ""asleep.""  It's a little unnerving when you talk to goat breeders and realize very few goats in the production world die of old age. That is simply how it is.  But we've had several manage to die naturally despite their best efforts, and usually we just find them ""asleep"" until we realize they have actually passed.   I think you have nothing to feel guilty about and nothing to be sad about. You gave this goat 11 wonderful years with you, obviously loved. No matter what websites and whatnot say, a goat that lives to 20 years old is a very very rare goat indeed.  The oldest goat I have met was 18 and he was a wether pet belonging to a big time breeder. He passed away pretty recently.   Wethers, when properly fed, live longest.  Does live until they either die in kidding or after kidding unless retired, generally 8-15 years.  Bucks live 5-8 years on a general basis - the yearly rut takes a lot out of them and the more they are used, the shorter their lives tend to be."
goats,2zkohv,Epona142,2,Thu Mar 19 14:59:00 2015 UTC,We never had a goat ever make it anywhere close to 20 years.   12 is still pretty old.  I wouldn't beat yourself up over it.

Some waste away while others die very suddenly. I just recently had a saanen die very suddenly like this. Especially when considering it probably had Boer in it, which aren't bred for longevity, I don't think this reflects on your care or has anything to do with you."
goats,2zkohv,mynameisnotemma,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:19:00 2015 UTC,Should concentrate more on how you took care of this creature for 11 years rather than on how you could not prevent its death. Blame is a heavy burden.

goats,2zjwrg,leavetheinternetnerd,3,Thu Mar 19 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"You'll need to visit feed stores and speak to local breeders - prices can vary greatly. I will say that your area will have high costs for hay and feed so keep that in mind. How much the goat(s) eat will depend, again, on a massively wide variable of factors such as age, breed, hardiness, health. There is always a market for goat meat. The United States does not produce nearly enough to meet demand. If you have a mini breed, the pet market is always there, but you'll soon learn that many of the wethers you sell come to an ugly end. Depends on how many goats you have and your management. If you're only wanting one doe in milk, go for a heavy producing breed. Saanen, Nubian, La Mancha are the most popular. You'll want to see the dam and sire's granddam and know how much they produce.   If you're serious about getting into goats, know that it is an extremely challenging species to raise properly and successfully. You'll want to do an immense amount of research (you're off to a great start!) and you'll never stop doing that research, no matter how long you are into goats.  Find a mentor. Someone local who can help you. You will need it I promise.   Until then, I recommend the following links:  http://fiascofarm.com/goats/ http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/  Read everything. Then read it again. And a few more times for good measure!  Best of luck, and I am always hanging around here if you have more questions."

I grew up on a small goat dairy and we had our share of herd drama. After a while the goats stopped being livestock and started being pets, and we eventually stopped milking altogether. My wife and I are slowly working on creating the needed framework for having dairy goats again; until then we inherited the pets my parents had, including a young-ish american Nubian that will be a fantastic producer if/when we get around to breeding her.

I see she is rocking back on her heel on the forehoof - if you get those angles corrected it will mean a extended longevity before her knee and fetlock break down under the pressure. I wish I was close, this would be a very interesting case for me to study."

goats,2zdvv0,Epona142,3,Tue Mar 17 23:14:21 2015 UTC,Awesome - balance of hoof will really help her. I am the stock manager at a dairy but I also have begun some research papers/books - who knows if they'll ever be finished but I enjoy it so much. Goats are my passion.
goats,2zdvv0,Epona142,4,Tue Mar 17 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting!  Do you mind telling me more about her? How did she lose a leg? What surgery was using to remove it (if you know any details at all, anything). How long ago? How old was she? How did she recover from the anesthesia? What was the recovery time? How has she been getting along since?  This will be for my research notes, if you don't mind. :)"
goats,2zdvv0,Epona142,8,Tue Mar 17 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't mind, I could go on and on about her! This might be a little long though. She was about a year and a half roughly in November when two dogs managed to break into our fenced in yard. They killed half our chickens, and two of our three goats by the time my sister saw what was happening. She managed to rescue Korra, whose leg was being gnawed on. It was touch and go for a bit but we have a VERY kind and helpful vet who did everything she could to help us. Eventually the shoulder turned black and her skin was sloughing off. The skin was removed and we would bandage her up once a week to try and get the skin to grow back. It took her a couple weeks to be able to move around on her own. The shoulder healed very well but the skin on her elbow just wasn't growing back and her injured leg was tightened up, it couldn't be moved at all. After an incident where she almost bled out during a bandage change, we took her back to the vet where they finally decided it was time to amputate.  The vet guessed it would be 800 dollars to amputate. That's how much it costs to amputate a Large Dog's leg. Except our vet had never done it before. She said she would do a lot of research. About a few days before the amputation was scheduled, she called us saying Auburn University in Alabama has a teaching hospital for large animals, and they will give us a hefty discount. Our vet, who we love, was very excited about this opportunity. So we drove two hours west and anxiously left Korra with Auburn. They called us every other day to tell us how she was doing. The amputation was a success! I had been wringing my hands for five days, very worried about the toxic effects of the anesthesia. Within hours of having her leg removed, she was up and walking around, eating, etc. A few days later we drove back out and retrieved her. The cost was only $480.  She came home on March second. Instantly, she was headbutting our two (new) goats to remind them she was in charge. She was eating, even running, rearing up! She is definitely more energetic and can actually get around much easier without her leg. I'm very proud of her. I'm sorry if this was way more than you wanted! If you want to PM me your email address, I can send you graphic pictures of the beginning of the healing process and also pictures of her healing incision."

I would love to see the pictures as well - this is the first amputation case where I've been able to ask questions and get more information about it - very unusual procedure in stock animals in general, let alone goats."
goats,2zdvv0,Epona142,2,Wed Mar 18 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even the vet said not a lot of people would go through this just for a goat. But we don't really keep them as stock, we see them more as pets. We're going to begin breeding them (not Korra) sometime this year."
goats,2zdvv0,baldylox,4,Wed Mar 18 01:24:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely - it's tough for me to walk that line between pet and stock myself. So they are all pets who earn their keep! Lol. I am lucky enough to work at a dairy that puts the goats first - when our girls have earned retirement (or disability) they get it.   We have a doe that had a traumatic injury to a foreleg. It actually has ""died"" - she has no feeling to it. I was quite sure we'd have to put her down, but was willing to give her a chance as long as she kept fighting. They've surprised me before when it comes to healing from injury!  Now she stumps along quite happily, using it as a sort of peg leg. She can keep up with the herd just fine. She will no longer produce kids of course, but is on ""disability"" pay for her natural life span. :)"

Sadly, that's not something that happens a lot in this industry. I've noticed that the goats seem to be stubborn, nothing keeps them down. I'm glad your own tripedal goat is doing well. :)"
goats,2zdvv0,baldylox,2,Wed Mar 18 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's been a real boon for me, being able to work here. We also allow our herd to browse in a natural setting (or as natural as it can get I suppose LOL) between milkings. We also dam raise for the most part. This is especially great for me because I can observe a slightly more natural behavior and that has been awesome for my research.  The things I've seen them heal from!

goats,2z5zyo,simplyjessi,2,Mon Mar 16 08:25:55 2015 UTC,I adopted a Pyr that they assumed was done protecting and just wanted to be with humans. Anyway - we gave it 6 months. She missed her goats badly. She went back home. They decided to never try and rehome her again.
goats,2z5zyo,simplyjessi,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:31:32 2015 UTC,"Yes - even when they are very people friendly, they really need their flock/herd/job. They don't especially make good pets (as they were bred to be very independent) although I've met a handful who were fabulous at it. Funnily enough, all of them had a flock of children to guard!"
goats,2z5zyo,jfastman,2,Mon Mar 16 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she is missed it a lot. She was wonderful with people and as a companion with my mini donkey. But she really wanted to be with her goats. Miss her on horse back rides, if we ponied the mini, she'd be trotting along next to her :)"
goats,2z5zyo,jfastman,2,Mon Mar 16 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I could just google this, but do you need to do any type of training with a LGD?"
goats,2z5zyo,maggiesee,2,Mon Mar 16 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yes - when they are young, they often try to play with their charges, and this must be discouraged. They should be shown the boundaries of their territory and introduced to their wards slowly and patiently.   However, they cannot be ""trained"" so to speak. They were bred to be independent and think for themselves, not really to listen to us. So don't expect a sit and stay and come lol!  The best scenario is having an older dog to teach a younger, but obviously you have to start somewhere. An experienced older dog needing a home and a new flock can work out great.  They do not instinctively guard poultry so this needs to be introduced slowly until they understand this is part of their domain."

The correct term is Mini La Mancha or Mini Mancha and they are accepted for registration by the MDGA (Miniature Dairy Goat Association). I personally would not call it a new mix however if you look at it (and the Nigerian Dwarf) as opposed to the time ADGA has been around, then yes it would be, as they did not accept the ND until rather recently.  Mini Manchas are some of the best Mini crosses I've worked with - they get the hardiness and size of the Nigerian Dwarf and the temperament and milking ability from the LM.

After about a week let them together and let them sort it out. There will be much posturing, head butting, even blubbering and pawing possibly. Don't be alarmed if they really start to go at it with the headbutting and shoving - this is what they are born to do. Even slightly bloodied heads is not a cause for concern.  If this is a baby, then simply ensure baby has safe places to go for shelter that the adults cannot remove it from."

He'll likely bond with them and may never understand being a goat as opposed to a sheep, so be aware of this if you ever give him away or sell him - he will need a period of adjustment if ever returned to a goat herd environment.   You'll want to copper bolus him to make sure he gets the copper he needs without putting your sheep in danger.   He's really cute."

We’re not in the States and in this part of the world the electric fencing commonly used is far more rudimentary. It was very interesting for me to follow the link and see the options available, including the solar power one. I’m guessing that where you live it is mostly pasture-type land; we are up on a mountain and it is all steep and rocky.   I was just hoping/checking to see if there was an option other than keeping him in an enclosure. Thanks again for taking the time. : )"

goats,2xih6t,Xaneran,3,Sun Mar 1 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"I keep some goats in a 20X20 pen with a plastic dog house and another stucture made of 2X6s, 2X4s and plywood with a metal roof.   Now when I come home from work I let them out to run around but you could probably tether them.    I think mainly you need to shelter them from the wind and the rain and keep their feet as dry as possible."
goats,2xih6t,WyoVolunteer,3,Sun Mar 1 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"40 x 50 would work fine for a couple small goats, but I would make it about double that size for larger ones.    Since you are going to have a small enclosure, they are going to quickly eat any trace of grass or other greenery in it, and you are going to have to supply other things for them to eat every day.   Goats eat an amazingly large amount of plant material each day, and can't live on just hay alone all year round.   Mine get lawn clippings, weeds from the garden, kitchen waste, tree branches, rose bushes, blackberry canes, poison ivy, sumac, tree leaves, old Christmas trees, stale bread, halloween pumpkins, and anything else we or the neighbors want to get rid of.    I planted some Bamboo which stays green and leafy all year round, and give that and pine tree branches to them to supplement their hay all winter.   Goats are like little walking composters, and eat constantly while they are awake.  You want to make sure you do NOT give them any rhododendron, pokeweed, black walnut leaves, deadly niteshade, or rhubarb leaves as those are poisonous; check with someone in your area that knows what plants around you should not be fed to livestock.   If you do not know any farmers or people that have goats, your local dept of agriculture office will be happy to give you free advice.  If you are after milk, Pygmy goats are not going to give very much of it; perhaps Nubians would be a better choice?  Also, to get milk you are going to need to have your goats bred, so you are going to soon have more goats than you started with; another reason to make the enclosure a little bigger.    I would suggest taking them elsewhere to be bred and not getting an uncastrated male goat right from the beginning, as they can be pretty aggressive and unpleasant to be around when they are rutting.   They also will often kill the baby goats if you do not keep them in separate enclosures."

goats,2xih6t,AlternativeName,3,Sun Mar 1 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"You're going to want a shed to shelter these guys, and the smaller the better.  9 months out of the year just leave the doors open so they can come and go as they please, but for the winter months you'll need to close them up and keep the draft out when the sun is not shining.  Between their body heat and decomposing hay that'll pile up the temp should be comfortable for your goats.  I have 6 goats and I keep them in a plastic shed that is a little cramped for the group, but it beats being cold.  We let them out in the daylight, and close them in in the evening.  They're going a bit stir crazy, but it is better than freezing to death in this harsher than normal winter."
goats,2xih6t,Freekmagnet,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:25:29 2015 UTC,I bought one of those oil filled electric heaters that look like a steam radiator at an auction for $3 last summer.   I hung from the ceiling by wire in the  shed my goats live in; it keeps it above freezing since there is no ice in their water bucket in the morning.   When I open the door they are usually all standing under it.  For $50 a month in electricity I can sleep well at night knowing they are comfortable even though it has been as low as -10F here mornings for the last 2 months (north central PA).

I made my shelter out of palettes with more palette wood to cover the holes and some tin roofing. Our winters are very mild here in NC though.  You basically want around 10 sq ft per goat in a shelter that can keep them dry and shielded from wind.  Also, the amount of space you want to contain the goats in overall could work, but make sure to provide them with a ton of hay and mineral salts as well as something to play on."

goats,2xidlw,rocklobstr,3,Sat Feb 28 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"I keep horns on my goats so they can defend themselves. A stray dog came over once at night. I guess he thought he could eat a kid. The evidence pointed to goats that were perfectly fine and a dog that learned a lesson the hard way! Blood was everywhere, but not coming from the goats. That dog picked the wrong neighborhood.  Also, if you want to get goats for clearing brush, may I suggest a full size breed? Nigerian Dwarves and Pygmies generally only eat the leaves of forage while leaving most of the stems intact. Larger goats will usually eat stem and all creating a much clearer landscape."

These guys also aren't disbudded and won't be because its too late. For the purpose of these goats and the job we need them to do they need horns. I really appreciate the response from this sub!
goats,2xidlw,big_onion,2,Mon Mar 2 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"So you ended up with horned goats? If you want them for clearing brush, they do use their horns. We watched our buck use his horns to weaken a small tree by scraping it, then push it over with his feet so he could get all the leaves up top. As for protection, we're not in an area prone to big predators, but I imagine it'll give some defense. (Also, I think it's hilarious to watch them use their horns to reach some random itch waaaay back by their butt.)  Just remember to not handle them by the horns unless it is absolutely necessary. If they are young it might be tempting to engage in horn or head-butting play with them -- it's cute when they're small but will not be cute when they are bigger.  Remember that goats will often butt what they perceive to be smaller than them. If these are are young kids now, they will eventually outgrow your children. Just be careful. Horns or not, they can butt with some force.  Best of luck!"
goats,2xidlw,Epona142,1 point,Wed Mar 4 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, horned goats! Thanks to what everyone posted here, and talking with more people IRL, AND more reading, we settled with larger horned goats. We have ~5 acres that we will be moving them through for brush and we do have large predators (bobcats, mtn. lion, and bears) that occasionally roam through during certain parts of the year. Not that we will put them out of visual when we know the predators are out, but you never can be too protective. In the end the children will not be in the pen/paddock roaming about. In the future we do want dairy goats, and 4H, for obvious reasons those goats will be disbudded. Oh, and good article, seriously it really jogged our thinking :-)"
goats,2xidlw,big_onion,8,Wed Mar 4 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"Your husband is correct. The most friendly tame sweet goat can put out your eye or your children's eye with a swing of the head. Just trying to get that treat.   Is that really worth the risk? Sure many people have horned goats and never have a problem. I didn't have a problem for years. Until I did. I will tell you there are no horned goats on our property, either in my personal herd or the dairy herd.   People are turning you down because they are irresponsible breeders who don't have a disbudder. Keep looking, you'll find a good one. Don't shy away from big time show breeders - there is always an excess of little bucklings who are not good enough to be breeding stock who need loving pet homes. Nigerian Dwarf would be your best bet, but Nubians are quite popular."
goats,2xidlw,Dekonite,9,Sun Mar 1 00:15:51 2015 UTC,"We're in that group that have horned goats. We only have a small group (about 13), not nearly as many as you, but we have some pretty strict rules on how to handle and behave around goats. The one time I got nailed by a horned buck it was because he had spent most of his life getting dragged around by his horns, so he thought it was an appropriate way of communicating with me. Our most ornery doe has some massive horns and a horrible attitude, but she never uses them on us. We've had issues with heads getting stuck in the fence, but that's our fault for not having appropriate fencing. We've had some injuries, but they weren't the fault of the goat -- my wife can tell you about the horn she took to the roof of her mouth, but will openly admit that she shouldn't have been in that position. We've only been at this for a few years, but I'm not sure I could see us changing our stance.  My wife recently came across this blog post and I think it's worth a read for anyone considering their options. Is it right to permanently disfigure something just to make things more convenient for us? My dogs have the potential to bite people, but I would never consider pulling their teeth. My cats have the potential to scratch people and tear up our chairs (which they do, little buggers), but I would never take their claws. I'm not trying to say that I'm more right than anyone else -- this is just my personal opinion, and I think everyone has the right to decide for themselves. A friend of mine is the buyer for a fancy cheese monger -- he recently went to France and toured a number of large goat dairies. Not a single one disbudded their goats (and there were some massive horns!) and I feel like if they can manage it, then we can, too, with our small herd. They also believe that disbudding ""taints"" the milk ... not sure I buy that, but they do make good cheeses!   Raising them around children is a tricky situation, but I think common sense plays a big part. Goats will always push around the things that are smaller than them, whether they have horns or not. Keep the small kids away from the goats altogether, and the ones that do go near the goats need to be taught how to handle and interact with them. We have more experience with raising dogs than goats, but there are some parallels. Dogs can learn not to communicate with humans their mouths, just as goats can learn not communicate with humans with their horns. It takes work, but I believe it's possible."
goats,2xidlw,Epona142,6,Sun Mar 1 03:43:11 2015 UTC,Awesome reply. I  totally see where you are coming from with keeping their horns. Thanks for that viewpoint.
goats,2xidlw,sprocket,0,Sun Mar 1 06:36:30 2015 UTC,"Saying 'I suppose it's possible a horned goat could accidentally hurt you' is very akin to saying 'I suppose a gun could accidentally shoot you'. Of course if you follow all precautions 100% of the time and have some dose of luck nothing bad will ever happen. We have 13 adult goats and six kids, all disbudded and all fine.  I rest a little easier knowing that we can let our guard down even a little bit."

Five-for-the-price-of-one, and the first one's free, step right up! ;)  I agree with Epona - unless you have REALLY good reason to keep them (ie. you have meat goats roaming the back country unattended and they need to be able to defend themselves), don't deal with the horns.  Children are right at eye level with the horn points and it's too much of a risk."
goats,2xidlw,RabbdRabbt,2,Sun Mar 1 00:52:13 2015 UTC,"You might want to see if you can find some polled goats, it's the best of both worlds.  Half of my herd is polled (and don't believe the hype that polled goats are either infertile or hermaphrodites, because I can attest that it is 100% not true), and it makes disbudding so much easier since we don't have to.  Horns are a definite danger, especially to children; and if you ever decide that you want your kids to show them in 4-H, they have to be dehorned anyways."
goats,2xgjg5,LykkeStrom,9,Sat Feb 28 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Plenty of roaming space for two goats.  Feed wise, it'll depend on the flora, but it could be enough to keep them fed. Although you'll probable need to buy feed if you have winters. What are you looking for wrt goats?  Milk? Meat? Pets?  There's really a lot to look into before jumping in, e.g. housing, fencing, feed, breeding, health, etc."
goats,2xgjg5,goat-hoarder,8,Sat Feb 28 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"Flora might be ok, but I'd count on buying feed and, ideally, hay and/or alfalfa as well. You won't need much for two goats, especially not Nigerians. Nigerians are probably the best breed as well. They're incredibly manageable and fairly common so it should be easy to find people with experience to help you out should you run into any problems. I worked with Nubians and they're sweet but heavy and can be a true handful. Also they eat way more so they're a lot more expensive to keep. But basically I'd recommend what the first poster did - do a ton of research first to make sure you're fully prepared to take care of the little guys."
goats,2xgjg5,Dashtego,4,Sat Feb 28 16:22:14 2015 UTC,We had alpines.   The only sort of fence that worked was an electric fence.  I know my mom built her own milk stands and feeders.   You will need some sort of small barn for them too- and lots of straw in the winter.   Goats are pretty picky eaters so all of the stems in the alfalfa hay will not get eaten.  My mom used to be employed as the Alberta Goat Technician by Alberta Agriculture (Canada). She would go to peoples' farms all over the province and help them with planning and raising their goats. Maybe such a person exists for your area- check it out.
goats,2xgjg5,thyrza,3,Sat Feb 28 17:55:12 2015 UTC,We have a third of an acre and that is plenty for our two Nigerian dwarves.   I can't emphasize enough on how important fencing and poisonous plant look out is. Such as azaleas.   I suggest picking up a copy of raising goats for dummies. That book helped me a ton before I got my goats. And find a vet before you need one.

goats,2xd4jb,herman2,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:49:37 2015 UTC,Well she should still be bagged up so try rubbing the after birth on her like sprocket said and see if the kid will nurse.  Otherwise you can buy powder milk replacer and bottle feed.  Supposedly whole cow milk is fine as well though I haven't tried it. Edit:  I'm a moron.  Of course you won't have her after birth still.  only option is to bottle feed then
goats,2xd4jb,sprocket,3,Fri Feb 27 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"There MAY be a remote chance, albeit still possible, that the other mother would accept the kids.  I have some goats that have a very strong motherly instinct and will steal away other goat's kids a week or more after they've kidded.  You could try penning mom and kid in together and seeing what happens; if after an hour or two they're still on opposite sides of the pen ignoring one other, you're probably going to have to bottle feed."

It can be done, and there are ways to encourage it, but in this situation, you'd be best just making them into bottle kids."
goats,2xd4jb,Epona142,2,Fri Feb 27 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"True enough - though personally, the thought of bottle feeding just a single kid for three months would be enough to motivate me to at least try to get potential mother to accept it."

goats,2xd4jb,jelliknight,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:49:13 2015 UTC,I highly discourage using milk replacer that you have to mix! Its very difficult to mix correctly and I've heard only bad things about it. Get goats milk from the store. Its already pasteurized and I believe it to be the best alternative. Put it in baby bottles and have a separate bottle for each baby. Make sure to keep them warm at night! I don't know where you are but it's freezing in Ohio! Give them a blanket or even take them inside at night. I suggest talking to your vet to make sure they have the right vaccinations when they need it.

In late pregnancy, I would absolutely be thinking hypocalcelmia or ""milk fever"" if the above was mentioned.  If you cannot get a vet to come out who knows the proper way to administer an IV of calcium glucote, then you need to get your hands on some CMPK and drench her orally. Keep in mind, oral drenching is less effective and much harder on the goat then an IV drench, but sometimes this is what one must do, and it's a far better solution that any other alternative.   Depending on the breed, but if it is a standard doe, 30cc of CMPK orally two times a day at the very first sign of the above symptoms. If worse, then 3-4 times a day.   IMPORTANT! You need to give an injection of Vitamin D along with the CMPK. This helps the goat absorb and USE that calcium.   Injecting 40cc of anything into an animal is not something I recommend to anyone but someone fully confident in handling the animal, the medication, and the syringe. That is a lot of fluid that must be injected very slowly and carefully. A lot can go wrong using that method.   If it gets worse, you face the very real possibility of losing your doe and kids. If she begins to decline, you may want to consider inducing labor - better dead kids than a dead dam. This can be done using Rx medication Lutalyse."

However, every single goat keeper should at least have a veterinarian that they work with closely - some much needed medications are Rx only and you need to have a good working relationship with a vet who can provide you with what you need."

goats,2wq0bi,autowikibot,5,Sun Feb 22 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"Valais Blackneck:       The Valais Blackneck is a breed of domestic goat from the canton of Valais, in southern Switzerland, and neighbouring areas of northern Italy. The largest concentration is in the area of Visp (Viège). It is present in modest numbers in Austria and Germany. It is known by many names, including German: Walliser Schwarzhalsziege or Gletschergeiss; French: Col Noir du Valais, Chèvre des Glaciers or Race de Viège; and Italian: Vallesana or Vallese.  The Valais Blackneck has a distinctive colouring, black from the nose to behind the shoulder and white from there to the tail. The English Bagot goat, which is similarly coloured, is thought to derive from this breed by descent from one presented to Richard II of England in 1380.   Within Italy, the Vallesana is raised in the provinces of Verbania and Vercelli.  It is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.    At the end of 2013 the total numbers for the breed were 3000–3400 in Switzerland and either 191  or 446  in Italy. In 2012 Austria reported 100–300 head  and Germany 429.

Went to a breeder's facebook page and read a rant about how people who ask about blue eyes/moonspots ""disgusts"" her.  Well so sorry but you've lost a potential customer. Just because I am a color breeder doesn't make me a BAD breeder.   Didn't mean to rant at you lol, usually things like this don't bother me, because I stand behind the goats I produce not only for my herd but the dairy herd."
goats,2vy494,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sun Feb 15 17:52:50 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! You should breed for quality and color, lol. Just because a goat is pretty doesn't mean it can't work! Hell if it makes the goat a more desirable goat to sell on top of the quality, I don't know why you wouldn't want to breed for it. That breeder sounds like a pretentious ass-hat, which I have also met in the goat world, lol.   It is people like that who just irritate me in the goat world. Who cares if someone has a preference on how their goats look? I know a breeder who only has black and tan sundagau and she has some of the most top producing goats in milk as well as genetics (tons of SG, champions, and milk stars). It is just her preference and it has worked out wonderful for her.   Your rant is fine, I have a few of them about people and their goats. Especially those people who perpetuate the idea that goats are SO easy to take care of and can eat anything you give them. Those are usually the people who have goats that look like they are at deaths door (ugh! don't get me started on the cheap goat people).   Your goat is beautiful and you should be proud! If I was in the market for ND (pretty sure that is a ND?) that would be the goat I pick, not just for color, but the conformation on that goat is just gorgeous. You can tell that goat is not just for being pretty to look at.  :-)"
goats,2vy494,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sun Feb 15 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yes, there is still so many misconceptions about goats, and even breeders that perpetuate them. I've watched so many people get into goats and right back out. Average time is 3-4 years, just long enough for them to experience that year where coccidiosis kills all their babies and pneumonia half their herd. Goats break your heart.   I never understood why people look down their noses at others for such petty reasons. I like goats that are bright and flashy with bright blue peepers! This makes me happy! I am not breeding goats to please anyone but myself - this may be my full time job and hobby, but my goats are first pets. How does this make me lesser than anyone else? Oh, news flash, it doesn't. I hate to sound, er, conceited, but I have a name in the goat world and our goats have been extremely successful. I walked into this dairy and made their herd extremely popular. We kidded out almost 200 goats in the month of January and we are sold out out kids and only a couple adults left to sell. Every day I receive pictures and messages about the goats we produced. Yes, we've had our stumbling blocks, but we will always take care of our customer. We say, our goats come with tech support!  I'm sorry, normally I would never make such a frustrated outburst, but sometimes it's good to get it off your chest, and I sense a like minded individual in you, that's for sure.   Yes, Mistletoe is a Nigerian Dwarf. My personal herd is Nigerian Dwarves, and the dairy is a mix of Nigerian Dwarf, La Mancha, Mini Manchas, and a few other random bits here and there!"
goats,2vy494,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sun Feb 15 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Always glad to listen :-) I have witnessed a few of those scenarios with people and goats. One women I knew of bought a goat from a breeder I know and she breeds very nice goats (good for show and production). This women owned the goat for maybe one year (bred the doe too young, against the breeders advice and had difficulties with health). Then this women decided she didn't want standard breed goats and wanted to switch to NDs. She had been buying goats from other less health conscious breeders and had a small herd of 5 or 6 goats, all sick and just terrible looking. She tried to sell me the goat she had bought from the breeder and I just said ""no thanks"". It was just sad and the breeder was so pissed, but what can you do? Live, learn and hope it doesn't happen again.   It is the terrible truth with any animal whether they are livestock or pets. If you care about them, they will break your heart and the hurt stays with you forever. I know I had one hell of a year last year and I had to make some crappy decisions, but that is going to happen (hopefully not often).   You should breed goats the way you want and however makes you happy (as long as the animals are healthy and happy, who cares?). If you worked your butt off (which it sounds like still do) to make your herd the way it is now, then you should be proud. It is hard work maintaining a herd and it takes a ridiculous amount of time to get your herd the way you want them (and there is always something that you will find that you think needs improving). I am still working towards that, but I know I am going in a direction that will really make my goats beautiful and have awesome production.  With all your wonderful feedback and customer service, I would say you're up there with the best of the breeders. Which is how it should be, but you are always going to have those annoying people that like to cause conflict and turn their noses up at everybody.   I love the name! She really is a very nice doe and I really wish I had gotten into NDs sometimes, but then I look out and see my babies and I can't imagine not having them.

goats,2vlia6,isaidputontheglasses,2,Thu Feb 12 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Free choice poor quality hay. They'll waste a massive amount of it, which you can use for bedding, or compost.   During most of the year, our goats range over 50+ acres between morning and evening milking. When we pen them up in early winter to prep for kidding and allow everything to rest and regrow, they throw a temper tantrum. Just have to wait them out and having something to pick through and toss about really helps."
goats,2vlia6,Epona142,3,Thu Feb 12 02:07:00 2015 UTC,"So, you are saying that I can continue to lock them up with all that hay (3 huge rolls free choice) and they will be okay?  And this is just a fit they are throwing to get out and get into trouble? That thought had crossed my mind.  I just want to make sure I won't kill them by keeping them locked up. This is our first kidding season and winter with goats.  I read that insufficient forage can cause listeriosis, but hay counts as forage right?   Basically they are getting hay, pine, and some alfalfa pellets and vegetable pulp as treats.  So worried about screwing this up!"
goats,2vlia6,Epona142,3,Thu Feb 12 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yup. Goats are not shy about letting you know when they're pissed off about something. Oh boy, that first day the gate is closed...the screams! I can practically hear some of them swearing at me as I walk by.  Yes, hay is a forage feed :)   They'll get over it with time. Pretty soon their thoughts will turn to prepping for their coming kids and they'll want to do nothing other than lay by the feeders and stuff their faces."
goats,2vlia6,Epona142,1 point,Thu Feb 12 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"Why do you lock yours up only in Winter? Is it to rest before kidding?  Two of my does have had kids already, but I have 3 that haven't yet.  Here are some pics of their area in the Summer. They can eat this down in about 1.5 months. Do you think I'll be okay if I rotate them between this and another equal sized lot in the Summer along with free choice hay? If so, how often should I rotate them would you say?  I kind of have to keep them locked up from now on I think cause my landlord is pretty incompetent with land mgmt.  Also, do you avoid grains entirely? I read it is totally okay to make grains anywhere from 0-10% of their diet.  Sorry for all the questions. I still have a lot to learn."
goats,2vlia6,Epona142,2,Thu Feb 12 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, to prep for kidding and for the duration of kidding, and until we feel the kids are old enough to safely travel with the herd during their meanderings. We use a GPS tracking collar to keep an eye on them, as it's a very large property, partially pasture and partially heavy wooded areas.  This also enables the whole property to rest and recover over the winter, as the season is intended, and start to get some good growth in before the ravenous horde is let loose upon it once more. With so many goats, even 50+ acres gets picked pretty clean by winter! Thankfully, living in Texas, our growing season is quite long.  I remember seeing some of your pictures before - goats are really the only things I remember these days. Lol. It looks like they have a nice little area to live in. The water right there makes me nervous due to issues that come with it, but if you have been successful thus far, then I trust that it is safe. Management can vary so much from farm to farm, not just across the country, but even in the same state!   You could do two month rotations perhaps, or change that up depending on the season, but pasture rotation as parasite management is greatly overblown - a pasture must be unused for over a year to make a true difference. Now, when done with other animal species, it can be very successful, but that's a whole 'nother topic!  Only our milking does get grain. Many farms grain much heavier than we do - that is not to say that they are right and we are wrong or the opposite, just merely a difference in herd management. We grain during milking, so twice a day. A lactation pellet, alfalfa pellet, rice bran, yeast, dolomite, and kelp. They eat better than we do lol. This is to keep their milk production high enough both to feed their kids if we are keeping them, and for the cheese making.   But we don't grain them to their full potential, because of the fact our does roam the ""wilderness."" We don't want overextended udders dragging across anything that could injure it. So you see the reasoning behind our difference in management from other farms!   Nigerian Dwarves are hardy and easy keepers - they may need no grain at all, or grain during late pregnancy/lactation.   Never apologize for asking questions! How else will you learn? I devote a great deal of my time to helping other goat people, because when I got started, goat people helped me. And I have a passion for these animals - this is literally what I do for a living! :D"
goats,2vlia6,Epona142,2,Thu Feb 12 05:44:28 2015 UTC,We've been pretty good with the water. No one has ever jumped in or anything and it seems safe for drinking.  You do this for a living? That's awesome. How many and what kind do you have if you don't mind my asking? I'm planning on getting two alpine or saanen asap.  Have you ever had any luck using a portable electric fence? I'm thinking of getting one for controlled foraging.  I really hate constraining these little guys in anyway but it look like I hate to until I get my own land or rent another place. :(  That's really neat you already saw those pics! Here are some pics of the new kids if you're interested!
goats,2vlia6,Epona142,1 point,Thu Feb 12 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"I worry more about things like menengial worm, which is carried by deer species and slugs. It can be very ugly if it crops up.   Don't mind at all! I of course have my personal herd of Nigerian Dwarves (and soon a Nubian, but that will be my husband's!). I am the stock manager at a dairy, with Nigerian Dwarves and La Manchas, as well as Mini Manchas, and a few random breeders here and there - a Mini Nubian, a Boer, soon a couple Saanens.   There's about... 140 goats? Give or take? Not counting the babies that were born this year that we are keeping, and I did just sell a few older goats, so I am unsure of the exact number. Lol! But I would know in a moment if someone did not come in to be milked, or from pasture.   I would never use the portable netting electric fence with horned goats. Not only have I heard so many horror stories, but the dairy had a doe get herself tangled in the fence and she died. Goats are forever looking for a way to die however, so you do what you can.   They'll soon get used to their new living conditions, but they'll always be waiting for your back to turn so they can dart away to freedom. Lol.  Great looking kids! I am a huge fan of black/white."
goats,2vlia6,jfastman,2,Thu Feb 12 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"I really need some advice again! We've had six kids born so far and 5 out of the 6 are bucklings! I've got them listed on craigslist and had some interest, but they all seem to be impulse buyers that back out at the last second. I'm starting to get concerned cause the oldest is getting REALLY bucky already.  Do you have any advice on how to get rid of a bunch of bucklings? What do you do when you get too many?  As you know, they are dwarves so not really good for meat, but who knows? i guess I'd be open minded to it but only as a last resort. Not really something I'd want to do personally."
goats,2vlia6,jfastman,2,Mon Mar 9 20:22:55 2015 UTC,"It's been a really buck heavy year it seems.   Unfortunately, you do need to be open to the idea of selling for meat when raising goats - there are only so many pet homes, and even fewer breeding homes. Those little boys are always so cute and sweet, and it never stops causing a little twinge when the meat buyer shows up, but it's just the way it works.   Nigerian Dwarves have a far better shot at staying out of the stew pot, but as you're experiencing, the market can fluctuate quite quickly and sometimes you're left with kids you simply cannot sell on the pet/meat market.  You may also have to accept that you are overpricing? I find a lot of folks overprice for lots of reasons, very common and easy to do. There is so much that goes into consideration when selling goats, so much so that I am literally a goat broker and sell goats for three farms hands on and I also work with folks online among the network, connecting buyers with sellers. :)  You'll run into impulse buyers a lot and it gets difficult to judge who is going to actually put in the effort to research and do this right (sometimes impulse buys turn into passions) and who is going to dump their goats later or simply kill them out of ignorance.  I admit I deal with this in my own way - I screen buyers as best I reasonably can (I keep a DO NOT SELL TO list even) and then once they are off the farm, it's out of my hands.   It's always great to see pictures on Facebook or get them in messages and emails of happy customers with their goats, but I've also gotten some horror stories.   Is there anything else I can do to help?"
goats,2vlia6,jfastman,2,Mon Mar 9 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"hmmmm... My cost is $100 so maybe I should go $75 or $50. You never know if you'll offend someone by saying you'll eat goat in this country. I mean, I've eaten some really sweet chickens before so there really isn't a difference to me. Just a social stigma I guess!  I'll try reducing price and posting more places. I also just put cuter pictures on my CL ad. lol  Lastly, i think I'll be putting my oldest buckling in with his dad. :)  Thanks again!"

goats,2uzi97,DataPacRat,10,Fri Feb 6 14:26:05 2015 UTC,"Goats are very easy to care for. As long as they have plenty of water, food and a salt lick, they mostly take care of themselves.  Their hooves may require occasional trimming, depending on the ground they walk on (hard surfaces will wear the hooves down faster than soft grass).  Milking goats is a bit harder than cows.  Goats will climb on everything and they can jump well above their own height.  We had one car completely wrecked by goats jumping on it, and I've seen them climb onto the roof of our garage.  We had one pygmy goat who could jump over the Dutch door on our barn, about 4 feet high.  Goats are also quite capable of climbing trees.    Goats are very curious and can often find ways of escaping confinement.  We had one goat who would roll underneath a loose section of fence, and another pair of goats who figured out how to squeeze between two sections of a sliding gate to make their escape.  Goats learn by watching others, and once one goat discovers how to climb or escape, the others will invariably follow.  Goats are highly intelligent and can be trained.  We even had one goat who we managed to semi-housebreak (she would pee on a puppy training pad, but she still pooped everywhere).  Many owners dehorn their goats, particularly if they are going to be milked.  This must be done within a few days of birth.  A goat with horns is better able to protect itself, but the horns also increase the chance of injury to other goats or the owner. Horns are made of living bone covered with keratin and if damaged will bleed and cause pain.  Unlike antlers, horns normally do not fall off.  Both male and female goats usually grow beards, though the males are normally thicker and longer.  Many goats (particularly the dairy breeds, Boers and Pygmies) also have wattles, soft fleshy growths on either side of their head or necks.  All of our Pygmy goats have had them, usually on their necks but sometimes as high up as the base of their ears, and they seem to love having their wattles rubbed.  A goat's upper lip is prehensile and they will use it to feel and pick up objects, usually food-related objects.  Most female goats have an udder with two teats, compared to four on a cow.  Goat eyes have horizontal rectangular pupils.  Goats are ruminants, and like cows they have a four-chambered stomach and chew their cud.  They also produce prodigious amounts of gas from both ends and can become deathly ill if they cannot expel the excess gas, a condition known as bloat.  Healthy goat poops are small round pellets that look a lot like jelly beans.  Goats are herd animals and are absolutely miserable if they are forced to be alone.  Goats are happiest with other goats, but they get along very well with sheep, horses, donkeys, llamas and alpacas.  They will accept a human as a companion, especially if bottle-raised, but this can be rather hard on the human as they need constant companionship.  They tend to be uneasy around dogs and other predators, unless they were raised together.  Goats establish a dominance hierarchy within their herd, usually by headbutting contests.  Goat herds are generally matriarchal, with the dominant (and often oldest and largest) female leading the flock.  Male goats in rut will urinate on their face, particularly their beard.  They also have scent glands at the base of the horns, which are sometimes removed during dehorning.  Female goats can be stinky, but males much more so.  Northern and Swiss breeds of goats usually go into heat in the winter, while breeds from equatorial regions can breed year-round.  Estrus lasts 2 to 48 hours and occurs about every 21 days.  Gestation is usually about 5 months.   Females usually usually give birth to twins, though single and triple births are not uncommon, and we had one goat who had quadruplets.  A male goat is called a ""buck"" or ""billy"", a female is a ""doe"" or ""nanny"", and a baby is a ""kid"".  Meat from a young goat is called ""cabrito"", while meat from older animals is known as ""chevon"".  The most common breeds used as pack goats in the US include the Alpine, Toggenburg, Saanen, American Lamancha and Oberhasli, though just about any breed can be trained for packing, even Pygmies.    We have a Lamancha buck, he is about as large as a Great Dane and extremely strong.  Lamanchas are unusual because they have very short ""gopher"" ears.  They are also good milk producers.  Pygmy goats are among the smallest goats, but they are very hardy, produce a lot of milk and are quite strong for their size.  They are small, though, so despite their strength, they can't carry that much.  They do, however, require less food and water to survive than larger breeds, and Pygmies are polyestrus and able to breed year-round."
goats,2uzi97,captpackrat,3,Fri Feb 6 21:39:16 2015 UTC,Wow! Thanks for all the info I have had my goats for a few months now and have been trying to learn more about them! How do I tell what breed I have?
goats,2uzi97,shaninanigan,1 point,Sat Feb 7 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"There are literally hundreds of different breeds of goats, and most of them can be crossed. Your best bet would be to ask whoever you got your goats from.  Otherwise, you might try posting some photos of your goats and asking if anyone here recognizes the breed."
goats,2uzi97,captpackrat,4,Sat Feb 7 01:59:45 2015 UTC,"Things I've learned since meeting my goat loving girlfriend:  Goats are playful, mischievous, curious, and seem to lack even basic spacial awareness. They get themselves into trouble they can't get themselves out of. And they fall off / into things often. They're smart, with good memories and can remember people after long absences.   Their hooves need clipping and are stinky, theyre poisoned by some common weeds. EDIT: They don't just eat grass, but other vegetation / hay too! and milking them is a lot more tricky than a cow.  Oh and your dad's prized lavender bushes make a delicious midmorning snack. That and digestive biscuits"

goats,2uzi97,daisuke1639,3,Fri Feb 6 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"Or do you have any specific questions.   A few that come to mind:  How many goats would you recommend trying to buy, so that the owner can continue to breed a steady supply of new ones as the working ones get too old, are injured, eaten by wild animals, and so forth?  Are there any particular breeds worth mentioning, common enough to have survived an apocalypse, which are suitable for both milk and carrying?  When things have been set up and settled down, around how much time per day has to be focused on caring for the goats, as opposed to all the other chores needing to be done?"
goats,2uzi97,mintlydisturbed,6,Fri Feb 6 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"This is gonna be long... just rambling knowledge off the top of my head about goats...  Typically, you would have one or two bucks and then however many does you'd like. You keep your buck separate from your does unless they are in heat, because they'll pester them to death otherwise. A single buck can get lonely, so they're often kept with a wether, which is a castrated male. Castration is pretty easy - you just slip a special, tight rubber band around the testicles and they wither, die, and drop off cleanly.  You can breed goats at about 1.5 years of age, and their gestation period is 150 days (5 months) on average. They go into heat every 18-24 days. They commonly have singles, twins, and triplets. Does are usually bred in the late summer/early fall for an early spring delivery, but can also be bred in the spring for a fall delivery.   Does will only be milk-able after they've kidded. They will make enough milk to meet demand. I usually separate my does and kids during the night, bottle feeding the baby cow's milk or milk replacer so that in the morning the doe has a full udder is ready to be milked by me. Does typically stay ""in milk"" for 8 months or so if they're milked twice a day and are usually ""dryed off"" for two months before being bred again. Some does will milk through another breeding season, though. Just depends on the goat.  Doelings (baby females) are more desirable than bucklings (baby males). You could reserve bucklings for food or castrate them for pack goats, as males are stronger.  Alpine, Saanen, LaMancha, Oberhasli, Toggenburg, and Nubians are popular full-sized milking goats. I have Nigerian Dwarfs, which are a miniature milking goat.  It depends on how many goats you are planning to care for as to how long it takes. It takes about 30 minutes to milk a goat by hand. I use a milking stand with a bucket in front of the doe filled with her ration of goat feed and alfalfa pellets (makes the milk sweet). While she eats, I milk... about 15 minutes each teet, but it really depends on the doe and how much milk she gives. The bigger breeds will give more. Then, I filter the milk into an ice-cold mason jar with a coffee filter (it tends to get goat hairs in it) and pop that into the freezer. Quickly cooled milk tastes better - less goat-y.  After milking, I make sure they have clean water and hay for the day. Another 20-ish minutes? Some days I have to trim hooves or clean the water-trough. I have three does and one wether right now."

Lamancha are intelligent and careful animals, Nubians and Pygmy are slightly more intelligent than chickens.   Generally, the longer the ears the dumber the goat."

Both the goats I know LOVE to be scratched between their horns.  They live at the barn I ride at, and before I came there both goats were pretty much uninterested in being cozy with people.  Now they come up to me, give my hand a little sniff, then tip their head down a little, ""presenting"" the top of their heads.  While I'm scratching, they'll do the typical things dogs & cats do when they like how you're scratching/petting them - Half close their eyes, kind of lean into it, tip their head this way and that to show me the spots they really want to get scratched.

I had read plenty of accounts of solo goats going off feed and getting quite sick until they had a companion.  Also, the way other people freak out over goats is kind of hilarious. At least once a week someone shares with me on Facebook a link to some goat-related thing I've seen a hundred times. The songs, the little parkour jerk goat (Buttercup?), the goats on the sheet metal, and so on ... hehe.  I'm not sure how much space you have, but something I've learned from ours is that they make the best companions on a walk. We'll go out to our back field and they will insist on coming along and will just stay in our general vicinity. Never really getting up in our business, just keeping close by. I'll occasionally pull down a branch for them to snack on some leaves, but otherwise they're just happy to have the company. If you're having a bad day, this is some of the best therapy out there."

If anyone tells you breeding goats is easy, they are a liar or have no idea what they are talking about.  Goats were put on this earth to break our hearts. They are like dogs with hooves that are suicide machines. There is very little research done on them except by breeders like myself, and everything you use will likely be off label medication wise.  I have milking here in a bit, but will return this evening to see which way you plan on going, and I can give more information then. I know there are also many other goat owners on this subreddit who can help get you started!"
goats,2u0iou,Epona142,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking breeding stock, just as pets.  I guess milk for personal consumption would be an added but not necessary bonus, however I'm guessing is quite a bit more work."
goats,2u0iou,Epona142,4,Wed Jan 28 23:39:51 2015 UTC,"Well then, pets are easy!  You should have a safe, secure, enclosure. Don't skimp on fencing. Trust me - do not skimp on fencing.  Dry, safe form of shelter where the goat can get out of the rain and wind. A wet and cold goat is a dead goat. This can be anything from a big doghouse to a water tank with a hole cut in it (We use a lot of these - I should get some pictures!) or a fancy barn. Just needs to be draft free and dry.  What kind of pet are you looking for? Nigerian Dwarves are colorful, small, affectionate goats. A little snooty, with attitudes and an overabundance of personality. A pair or trio of wethers is easy to procure and in my opinion, the best option.   Pygmies are of course an option, though they've fallen out of popularity with the influx of Nigerian Dwarf breeders.  Nubians, with their long ears and roman noses are favored greatly by those who want a LARGE goat. Wethers get massive, and can be trained to pull a cart or carry a backpack.   There are many many breeds to choose from and you honestly cannot go wrong when it comes to wethers. You just want to follow the following set of ""rules.""  Buy from a reputable breeder. They should have paperwork showing health testing for things like CAE or CL. Any breeder worth their salt tests for CAE. Even the good small backyard breeders (which can produce AMAZING goats). All good breeders have a number of extra bucklings every year that would very much appreciate a home as pet wethers. They are generally on the inexpensive side.  Buy wethers that have been disbudded. They will not grow horns (and wethers are far less likely to scur when properly disbudded). This is safer for you and the goat.  Be careful with feed - wethers do not need grain or alfalfa. They will get fat and possibly suffer from urinary calci. Browse (if available) and decent quality hay. They might even get fat on that, depending on what breed you have.  Remember - goats are livestock. You can treat them like dogs with hooves, but just like with dogs, training is important. Do not encourage behavior that is cute while they are little, but wouldn't be when they are adults. Things like headbutting, jumping up, pawing. Don't reinforce negative behaviors. They can also be trained to walk on a leash politely - this can come in handy!  Bottle raise if you can - most people love the bond it gives them with the goats. Yes, they act like little piranhas when young, but they calm down when properly handled. Dam raised kids can also be friendly, but this will depend strongly on the breeder and how much effort they put into socializing their kids.   Hoof Trimming - you'll need to learn how. It's very easy and the tool you need is inexpensive. This will be a monthly chore - depending on your area. But again, a well trained goat makes it much easier.

goats,2t66mj,Epona142,2,Thu Jan 22 05:07:25 2015 UTC,"Not OP but we have quite a large herd of La Mancha here at the dairy.  Pros: Absolutely the sweetest most people oriented breed. Very willing to do what you want them to. Good milkers, average size. Generally good mothers and easy kidders.   Cons: Not the hardiest breed. More delicate and prone to catching pneumonia among other illness. More susceptible to ketosis and other pregnancy related problems. The lack of ears turns a lot of people off, making them more difficult to market - however, they are growing in popularity. Once you have one, you realize how awesome they are."
goats,2t66mj,Epona142,2,Thu Jan 22 05:27:41 2015 UTC,"That is weird my girls are super tough and parasite resistant. I have only had one pregnancy problem and that was because I did not know that doe was bred (she was never around the buck, but their fences were attached for a couple months when I was rearranging pastures. Yes, bucks can breed through fences, lesson learned lol).   I think a lot of problems with most breeds comes down in part to genetics. My herd was bred for hardiness and dairy qualities. As it turns out, the way they were bred also makes them a bit larger than other LaManchas I have encountered. My buck was 200lbs and he stood about  as tall as a 6ft post (never got out to measure him). My girls are big girls with large bones and lots of attitude (they are absolute divas, but they are my babies). I have seen some beautiful herds that are on the smaller side (Little Orchard LaManchas is a very exceptional herd), but I love my big beasts.   The Pros are all as stated above. In my area I have found that any time someone gets a LaMancha they never regret it and they always say how much they love their ear-less wonders. They really are a super awesome breed :-)"

Pneumonia is always a constant battle in the spring, when temperatures can swing from very cold to boiling hot in a single day.   We have some massive La Mancha in our herd, but most of the lines available in our location are the smaller type. We drove to Illinois to pick up our newest buck in an effort to expand the genetics and bring a little more diversity to Texan La Manchas."

He was from upstate NY, but a person I know who raises minis just bought him and only needed for a couple months. I ended up purchasing him because he had all the genetic lines I have been drooling over and I only had to drive 30 mins to pick him up.

Most of them went to the processor -- this lamb came from one of those orphans (who has never lambed in the couple years we've had her). I had honestly never heard of it before. Have you had any or much experience with it?  EDIT: Should add, we're planning on drawing blood tonight to test the flock, as we're wondering if some of our original stock that we got from this breeder may have come with it.

That would honestly be the first place I'd start - the stress from being castrated can cause the coccidia to explode in numbers and then you get this issue.  http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articles2/coccidiosis06.html
goats,2t2eqb,Epona142,3,Tue Jan 20 20:31:59 2015 UTC,Vet. Now. This is a danger period for goats. You need to kill the coccidia if he has it as it does permanent damage. What color is the stool? Black = danger.  Also when you say feed... do you mean milk or something else? You cant just swap from milk to feed. You have to wean.
goats,2t2eqb,the_last_fartbender,0,Tue Jan 20 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"I've begun weaning them, giving them a slightly dilution of milk and water, fewer times a day, as well as giving them grain and hay.

goats,2t2dah,bfhmandan,2,Tue Jan 20 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"Alfalfa pellets are great for goats, especially during lactation. Bear in mind though that most alfalfa is genetically modified now if it is not organic. Not sure if you mind that or not.  I feed my goats a variety of hays, forage, and alfalfa.   I'm not an expert by any means, but I'm told that a diet high in grain will put on the pounds, but will increase Omega 6 fatty acids, while a diet high in grass, forage, and hay will increase the Omega 3 fatty acids which is generally more desirable.  Grain feeding ruminant livestock really came into regular practice around WW2 when farmers needed to raise more meat in less space so they kept the animals confined and fed them mostly corn.  Another couple of things I have learned about grain feeding is that you have to be careful not to feed goats moldy food and never feed them horse feed as it is very prone to mold. Goats are portrayed as a very hearty animal, and they are to an extent, but they can't handle mold. I had a neighbor feed my goats moldy horse feed once and the smallest goat was immediately struck with polio and died.  I don't know. To me, I'd rather try to keep them as natural as possible, plus I can charge more for grassfed milk. Mine are nigerian dwarves btw so I don't really do meat with them. I'm planning on getting some alpine/boer crosses eventually.  Edit:  A bit more about goat polio   Causes of thiamine deficiency include feeding moldy hay or grain, using amprollium which is a thiamine inhibitor (brand name CoRid) when treating coccodiosis, feeding molasses-based grains which are prone to mold (horse & mule feeds), eating some species of ferns, sudden changes in diet, the dietary stress of weaning, and reactions to the de-wormers thiabendazole and levamisole. Each of these conditions can suppress Vitamin B1 production. The usage of antibiotics destroys flora in the rumen and can cause thiamine deficiency. It is important to repopulate the gut with live bacteria after using antibiotics or diarrhea (scour) medications.  Goat Polio generally occurs in weanlings and very young goats, while Listeriosis most frequently affects adult goats. An increase in Goat Polio occurs in North America during winter when the availability of forage and quality hay is low and producers start feeding increased amounts of grain or expect goats to survive on very poor pasture.   http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articles2/listeriosis.html"

When a goat is pregnant or newly freshened, obtaining a higher position is a priority. She wants to make sure the other goat knows SHE is top goat, and sometimes the other goat disagrees.   When a goat is separated from companion(s) it does take some readjustment.   Honestly, I would put them together and let them hash it out. Supervise and make sure the kids don't get trampled. They will learn quickly to leave the second doe alone - headbutting or even biting the kids is normal.   It will be an ugly looking fight as they bash heads and smash each other, but recall that goats have skulls meant for bashing. As long as the fighting does not continue for days, they will soon sort out who is queen and who is peon and will soon be friends again."

goats,2st23x,Epona142,4,Sun Jan 18 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but as the stock manager of a dairy, thought I'd answer some of your questions.   Do you know how goats get along with dogs?    Dogs are the #1 predator of goats. Sure, many get along fine with proper training and supervision, but more often I hear horror stories about pet dogs killing pet goats. Proceed with major caution. Even being chased can stress a goat enough to kill it.   What kind of lodging do they require?    Clean, dry, draft free.   How do they do in cold temps?    With the above mentioned shelter, just fine.   Are they social? Do they benefit from the companionship of another of their kind?    Absolutely. You should never have just one goat. Two at minimum, three optimal. More better.   Can they be indoor/outdoor pets?   No. Goats are livestock. They belong outside 98% of the time.   Why are you raising goats? For the milk? Do you make cheese? If I got goats, it would be for the experience of getting to know another species and for the cheese. I love goat-milk cheese.   We milk and make cheese for wholesale. Milking must be done on a schedule, every single day. You cannot miss a milking or change the time suddenly without risk of health consequences. Do not look into this if you are unable to be home every day for every milking or have someone that not only you trust but the goats trust as well to milk.   What breed of goats are the ones in your photos?   Those appear to be Nigerian Dwarf goats, the miniature milk breed.  Seriously though - breeding and raising goats is no walk in the park. Keeping a couple of wethers (neutered males) or dry does is pretty easy and they make awesome pets. But if anyone tells you breeding goats successfully is easy, they are either a liar or have no clue what they are talking about."

goats,2s5u9y,8mmthomas,7,Mon Jan 12 13:18:41 2015 UTC,They will absolutely strip those trees and kill them. They will glut themselves on fallen fruit and give themselves scours or bloat. They will not mow your grass. Ponds are a delightful host of all types of parasites and bacteria.  Maybe good idea to rethink this.   :)
goats,2s5u9y,Epona142,6,Mon Jan 12 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Goats are browsers (shrubs, trees, etc) not grazers (grass).  They'll eat grass if they absolutely have to, but they're no good as ""mowers"".  Sheep are sometimes used as grazers to keep grass trimmed, but not goats.  If you exclude the pond, will you be able to provide water for them?  What kind of shelter will they have?  What's the climate like where you live?  You'll still have to provide hay, and you'll absolutely have to provide minerals, baking soda, trim their hooves regularly, treat for parasites, protect from predators... are you sure that it isn't easier to let that area go to meadow and mow it once a year?  Meadows are beautiful, they're important habitats, and goats are a LOT of work."
goats,2s5u9y,lingben,2,Mon Jan 12 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"instead of a goat get 2 kunekune pigs and help this amazing breed become more popular  they are the only pig that loves to eat grass and they won't harm the tree, they also do not dig up the earth like most other pigs, eating the fruit won't harm them, although too much fruit is always a bad idea, you can also add kitchen scraps and compost stuff to the grass diet  bonus is they have an amazing temperament, more like puppy dogs than pigs  edit: watch this guy munch on grass"

It was her first year with me, but prior to this, I know she kidded at least once, maybe twice. Since this picture she's had twins 2 years in a row. My theory (based on absolutely nothing) is that she had a stressful transition year (living at another, much larger farm for 9 months, not getting the personal attention she was accustomed to) and that is why she had a single. Of the 6 does I bought that year (all seasoned does), 5 were pregnant, only one had twins, the rest singles."

We're feeding Pregnant Does, Doelings (Under a year), a couple Bucks and one wether. We've got a different feed program for each grouping adjusting quantity, additions etc as needed for age, stage and status. Actually we adjust per goat as we feed them individually much like you'd see probably with horses (I've never had a horse so just guessing).

goats,2q8tpi,828_Yosef,10,Wed Dec 24 03:52:52 2014 UTC,"Depends on an immense amount of factors which makes it impossible to say to be honest.  What breed(s) is the buck? How much larger is he? Has the doe(s) given birth before? How wide are their hips? How hardy are they? What is their diet like? Are they a healthy weight?   You can see what I mean by variables, and that's just a few. :)  Different breeds of goat generally cross with each other just fine. Most people avoid breeding a larger buck to a smaller doe because they believe the kids will grow too large for the doe.  I have found this to be false.  Diet, age, health, and kidding history of the doe will effect her ability to properly carry and deliver kids no matter what the breed.   We have both Nigerian Dwarf goats (a miniature dairy breed) and La Mancha (a standard dairy breed) and because bucks are entirely too clever about escaping during breeding season, occasionally a Nigerian Dwarf doe will be bred by a La Mancha buck. And once, when we still had Boers, we have a Nigerian Dwarf doe bred by a massive Boer buck.  Every single one of the does kidded perfectly fine. In fact the doe bred by the Boer buck had one of the easiest kiddings I've ever witnessed - they practically fell out!  We personally do not have problems with oversized kids because our does are allowed to roam a very large amount of property during most of the year (exercise) and we do not overfeed - we don't grain at all unless they are in milk. You'll find that most goat owners and dairies have pastured goats that are grained heavily.  I am not saying that their way of goat keeping is wrong and ours is right, as there are many different ways to do things properly. I will say that a great deal of goats are under exercised and overfed. Overfeeding pregnant does leads to the kids growing far too large before birth. This leads to problems during kidding.  We have well over 100 does kidding out every year and have never had a cesarean performed on a doe. That's not to say there haven't been issues, but none of the problems were related to oversized kids.  I have performed necropsies on goats that have died, both on our farm and on other farms, and the different in fat around the internal organs has shocked me many times. It's really quite fascinating.  That all being said, I hope you don't plan on housing these goats with your goats. Do you know anything about their health? CAE, CL, Johnes? Even when I buy from well known respected breeders, I quarantine and health test before they go into our main herd.   And you absolutely do not want to be putting a buck in with your does (unless you plan to breed). Be aware that every year a doe goes without being bred, it becomes more risky for her to become pregnant and to kid.   Either way, good on you for helping out your neighbor and caring for their goats - it's so important to have people to trust and help out!"
goats,2q8tpi,Epona142,3,Wed Dec 24 04:44:29 2014 UTC,"I'll have to show this to my wife. Although we love the Dwarf buck we have, the only reason we got him was out of concern of breeding a larger buck to our Dwarf girls."
goats,2q8tpi,big_onion,3,Wed Dec 24 23:44:21 2014 UTC,"Appreciate this response. I let my goats browse and only feed them hay when it snows and they can't get much else to eat. I give them a little scoop of grain as a treat maybe twice a week.  The neighbor's goats will be in with mine, essentially because I only have one pasture area. I only have a few goats and they only have two, one nanny and the billy being discussed. The billy is pretty small, it will be his first year breeding. The pygmies are a mom and kid pair. The kid is about a year old. I think the mom is around 3-4 years old.  I know these neighbors well and they take good care of the goats; with there only being the two of them and since I watched him worm them, not too concerned in terms of health."

Could this be a brain trauma (thinking hypothermia here) as opposed to a physical eyesight problem?   If he IS blind, what are you going to do? Cull him? Or let him try to figure out how to navigate and put the effort/time into helping him?  I had a kid who got too cold (wasn't expecting him for another week) who was listless and lethargic. He'd eat, but that was about it. Finally after two weeks he died, getting a little worse each day. It was horrible. :(  If you're willing to give him a chance, he might turn out just fine. If you're not, do him a favor and put him down humanely now. :/  Sucks, but it happens.  Edit to add: Hugs. Winter babies are rough, and I'm sure this is rough on you!

B12 as well.  I tell everyone, a cold and wet goat is a dead goat. Especially kids. Once they become chilled, their chances of surviving to adulthood plummet.

goats,2pjbax,shaninanigan,7,Wed Dec 17 02:34:35 2014 UTC,"I second the hot wire. Get the most powerful box you can afford - I'm not kidding. I ran a 50 mile charger on a 3 acre pen. It will not permanently harm them, although it'll give them a good bite! I also second the low impedance chargers.   Run three lines if you can. Bottom, middle, top.   Most importantly, teach them right away that the fence HURTS. It's cruel, but important. Most will touch it out of curiosity right away, but make sure you see each one get an ""experience."" Make them touch it if you must. This is for their safety as well - if they try to jump the fence and receive an unexpected shock, they may panic and become entangled.   Installing electric fencing is EASY! You need a charger as described above, a grounding rod (important!), the wire (I like a thicker gauge), and a means to attach it to your existing post. There are many options.   To keep a charger out of the elements, get a plastic storage tote from walmart and keep it inside there. You can make holes for the plug and for the wire to go to the fence and the grounding rod.  Do yourself a favor and get a fence tester right away as well, so you're not second guessing it."
goats,2pjbax,Epona142,2,Wed Dec 17 04:16:52 2014 UTC,Thirding this. Electric fence was the only thing that worked for us!
goats,2pjbax,big_onion,2,Wed Dec 17 06:30:41 2014 UTC,life of a goat farmer goes as such:  feed goats  water goats  fix fence where goats escaped  repeat daily
goats,2pjbax,bl33dy,4,Wed Dec 17 17:34:20 2014 UTC,"You could try a low impedence double strand electric fence.  It won't hurt them, but they will respect it.  When we first started keeping goats we didn't know a thing and we had a fat buck kid that would climb over our 4' tall dogwire fence and squash it down flat.  Hot wire fixed that problem and we have rarely had an escape since.    I'm judging from the time of night you mention that you are maybe east coast USA?? If so, Tractor Supply or your local mom and pop feed store can probably help you out."

goats,2pjbax,olearlearlear,1 point,Wed Dec 17 13:59:41 2014 UTC,I hope you've tracked them down by now.  When ours escape we can put a little feed in the bottom of a bucket and just rattle it and walk to the pen and they will follow us right in there.   They're all about that feed bucket.

goats,2pe0ac,jfastman,3,Mon Dec 15 19:46:39 2014 UTC,"Pumpkins are awesome! They are actually a natural dewormer (the seeds mostly) although I certainly do not recommend anyone trying to use it as such on it's own.  The meat of the pumpkin is amazing for digestive problems. We always keep cans of pumpkin (no sugar, just plain canned pumpkin) and have used it for both constipation and scours. It's effective and safe for most animals we keep (dogs and cats included) and it only takes a small amount.  For example, when we had a young doe with a rectal prolapse, after placing a stitch to strengthen her rectum and hold the prolapse in, her poor backside was so swollen and she became constipated. Liquefied pumpkin drench got her ""moving"" again and now she is a happy healthy girl, expecting her first babies!"
goats,2pe0ac,Epona142,3,Mon Dec 15 20:08:16 2014 UTC,They didn't care for the seeds at all. They actually would eat all the around the seeds. I cleaned and saved the seeds for planting in the spring. I was concerned that they might eat too much pumpkin and have a belly ache or something. Is there any reason for concern?
goats,2pe0ac,Epona142,2,Mon Dec 15 20:12:34 2014 UTC,"Sure - like with any new food, too much will cause upset stomachs. They might have some scours depending on how much they got, but I wouldn't be overly concerned with it. It will pass quickly."
goats,2pe0ac,Epona142,2,Mon Dec 15 20:17:34 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'll look around and check them. This isn't the first time they've had pumpkins so I figure they should be ok. It was however a different type of pumpkin, not a jack o'lantern type but a crookneck is what I think it's called. The market I got them from told me that this is the type of pumpkin used in canned pumpkin. I can't wait to see all the babies you have coming!"

goats,2pabyk,Sorceress_of_Rossak,7,Sun Dec 14 22:55:57 2014 UTC,"Well it depends. We have two main breeds here at the dairy, La Mancha and Nigerian Dwarf.   When it comes to the La Manchas, I'd say for doelings, it's a pretty even split between pet/home milker homes and show/brood doe homes.  The La Mancha bucklings mostly go for meat - a small amount end up as pets. A very small number end up as breeding bucks.   Nigerian Dwarf (which is what Witchcraft is) doe kids are much the same as La Mancha - a fair split between pet homes and show homes.   A much higher percentage of the Nigerian Dwarf bucklings go to pet homes. A smaller portion become breeding bucks. A very small portion end up sold for meat.   And as always, a few stay on the farm and join the herd. We kept quite a lot the last two years - probably won't keep very many this year, and will likely be selling some older goats as well."

Obviously I cannot say with certainty because I cannot place my hands on the animal in question, but going by what I can see, I do not believe this animal to be overweight.   Dairy goats are not supposed to carry extra flesh. When they gain weight, goats develop fat around their internal organs initially at a greater rate than they do under their skin. I have observed this first hand many times during butchering and necropsies.   A goat that is overweight is at risk for many health issues.   My biggest clue to this goat is not underweight? The ""chicken cutlet"" in her armpit. The second clue? How healthy and sleek her coat is.   Of course, this is just my thoughts.   As for the actual picture - it's hard not to love those silly Nubian faces! I finally caved and promised my husband a Nubian doe of his very own. Helps that a spot on a waiting list for a specific breeder became available. :P"

LGDs (Livestock Guardian Dogs) are breeds specifically bred to live and protect stock. German Shepherd Dogs were bred to herd and hold, and Huskies were bred to work and be independent - both of those breeds can have extremely high prey drives (as they should) and while they CAN be trained to be around stock, I would never trust these breeds (among many others) alone with any prey animal.   I've had problems with dogs attacking my stock before we used LGDs and the majority of the trouble makers were husky and northern bred mixes - they are good at escaping, problem solvers, and love to chase and kill."

goats,2m34l1,Epona142,3,Wed Nov 12 18:41:41 2014 UTC,I've been meaning to ask about supplemental feed for the winter. My ND's are still foraging out in the woods when I let them out of their pen daily. Do I need to buy goat feed for them during the winter? I feed good quality hay and give them some black sunflower seeds right now along with allowing them to roam daily under my loose supervision.

goats,2m34l1,jfastman,2,Wed Nov 12 20:40:40 2014 UTC,"Remind me - they're wethers right? If so, then all they need is free choice quality hay. You absolutely want to avoid grain/pellet feeds + hay. That is an unbalanced diet (phosphorous vs calcium) and will cause problems with urinary calci.   If you want to grain, you will need to balance it properly with calcium rich feeds (eg alfalfa) but with wethers you should not have any need for extreme feeding like that - I've yet to meet a healthy wether that doesn't stay fat on hay."

goats,2l0lyy,The_Lunatic,5,Sat Nov 1 22:53:45 2014 UTC,"Also, you should probably stop worming ""regularly"". That just causes a whole mess of problems, i.e., wormer resistance, could be something else and wormer is making issue worse, and always do a fecal before you start dosing with wormers. Check eyelids and temp too before you even consider wormer, are they pale? If yes, get fecal to see why goat is anemic, could be worms, could be something else.   Have you had bloodwork done to check for any of the various diseases goats are susceptible to, Johnnes, CAE, CL, Brucilosis, etc. Some of these can cause the issues you described. Also, fecals are important in case of Coccidia overloads, which causes diarrhea.   Goats in milk require a higher food intake compared to goats that are dry. Everything they have is going into the milk and if you aren't keeping up with their feed needs they will lose weight, get weak, and become more at risk for health issues. The coughing could have been a sign of this, possible pneumonia or other bacterial problem (neomycin is an antibiotic so this could be why it helped).  If you don't have a vet available and you have a facebook account, there are groups that are composed of strictly livestock vets who are there for this reason. Here is a particular group that has vets from all over: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1516191428627267/?fref=nf"
goats,2l0lyy,Sorceress_of_Rossak,4,Sun Nov 2 13:38:56 2014 UTC,"Sorry, forgot to say that worming is one of those subjects everyone is going to have a different opinion on. I only worm if it is necessary (after fecal checks and when I am absolutely sure it is case of worm overload), I don't have a schedule. I do know when parasites are going to be a problem, usually when we have an overly wet spring, right after a doe gives birth, or when a goat is already sick and weak. But again, I keep an eye on the herd or particular animal in those situations and check for signs of worms (pale eyelid, positive fecal, losing weight, etc.) before I actually dose with wormer. Make sure you are using the correct DOSAGE for the wormer you are using too, not enough and the wormer won't work effectively, too much and you can hurt the goat."
goats,2l0lyy,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sun Nov 2 13:51:42 2014 UTC,"Her gums were very very light pink, which is why I wormed her and drenched her.

I am totally joining that group.  It looks awesome and so helpful."
goats,2l0lyy,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sun Nov 2 22:29:48 2014 UTC,"Look into FAMANCHA training, it will help with determining the level of anemia in a goat. Here is an interesting PDF with some info on FAMANCHA scores and worming: http://www.jackmauldin.com/FAMACHA_Postels.pdf  Also check out the website: http://fiascofarm.com/goats/index.htm It has some awesome info for beginners and just some general things to keep in mind when owning goats."
goats,2l0lyy,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sun Nov 2 23:06:53 2014 UTC,"Thank you for this.  We actually rotated her grazing also.  We have plenty of land for them to rotate on, so they shouldn't be in the same place for more than a month and not return for more than 4 months.  We can go back and burn whatever pasture they were on to make sure the parasites are gone, like we do to prevent weeds from growing in our garden areas.  Then when they grass grows back it should be close to parasite free.  We have a small herd of only 3 and plan to keep it small too.  I don't want more than 9 goats at a time on ten acres.  (This includes baby goats that are growing for the sale barn or the freezer, or to replace an older Mamma goat.)    I was taught to look at the gums in the mouth to see how pink it is.  The article you gave to me was very specific and wonderful to help me better spot any problems.  Also thanks for the website, I see a lot of things that will help me be a better goat farmer.    By the way Mamma goat was getting extra grain rations when she was milking.  We gave her about 1/2 a pound a day because any more made her have ""human poops"" as the kids call it, but constipation is what everyone else would call it.  She couldn't seem to get enough grain to stay well fed, without having issues.  I used ""All-Grain"" which is the same thing her old owner used."
goats,2l0lyy,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Mon Nov 3 00:14:55 2014 UTC,"You are welcome, I remember what it was like to be a new goat owner and have no vet in a crisis. Small herds are great, I have 11 currently on about 20 acres a mix of wood and pasture.   That sounds like a good plan for pasture management. I had a problem with (stupidly trusting someone that I shouldn't have) bringing in resistant parasites, luckily it was on my quarantine field. Had to keep the grass cut down so short and just let the sun bake it for 4 months. As well as getting rid of the overloaded goat. The websites and the facebook groups I have found have been super helpful in finding info on different methods of care for goats.   Check your fiber to protein ratio in your feed with your milking does (for the ""human poops""). I mix my own feed which has a higher fiber ratio to protein, I have found my girls do better with more fiber. My feed mix is beet pulp shreds, alfalfa pellets, BOSS (black oil sunflower seeds), hay stretcher (lots of fiber), blue seal dairy goat pellets (protein), and very little (high fiber horse) sweet feed (my girls are spoiled rotten).   Also a really nice Alfalfa hay really helps with the weight on Milking does. As well as can help increase milk production, if you are looking for that. Switch feeds very gradually as to not upset rumen. You can add a probiotic to your food too, which can also help with clumpy stool.  The Fiasco farm website has great info on feeds and ratios and how much to feed each particular goat. I have standard breed goats (LaMancha), so a doe in milk needs about 2+lbs of feed a day to keep her conditioning and keep her milk production up (this fluctuates too, depending on so many factors).     Check your area for copper deficiency, that can also bring a goat down without proper supplementing. I have free choice minerals and I have to treat with a copper supplement, I use replamin it is super easy. Most people just copper bolus about once a year.   Sorry to keep writing book length responses, but I always appreciated all the info I could get from all different kinds of sources. I also know how finicky goats can be, even though I love my girls to death, they are total divas with some things. :-)"
goats,2l0lyy,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Mon Nov 3 01:27:35 2014 UTC,"WoW!  Your girls are spoiled.  I see now that I probably wasn't adding enough feed, even though she is free to browse the fields as much as she wants.  I have a salt/mineral block to help with any deficiencies.    Sugar is a Nubian and she is a super milker even though this is her first kidding.  Her mother was a great milker too.  Her daughter, Mae, probably will be a great milker also.  She is as big as her mother now.  She is more like a member of the family than a pet.  She walks right into the house like she owns it.    I do have a question, how old should a goat be to mate them?  Mae's mother was less than a year old when I got her and already pregnant.  The lady said she didn't intend to mate her it just happened.  She was a little upset she sold us a pregnant doe for so little.    Is it unusual for them to mate that young?  Mae's mother was born in June of the year before Mae was born.  Mae was born in May."

Not saying they should be bred that young, just that it can happen and accidents do happen, especially with bucks in rut. Don't get me started on bucks in rut ugh!   The general rule for breeding a standard size doe is if she weighs enough and is healthy then it is okay to breed her. A standard doe should weigh at least 80+ pounds to breed. This is usually when they are about 8 months of age, unless you have a slower maturing doe who sometimes you just have to wait until they are over 1 1/2 years. As long as they are the appropriate weight and are healthy they can be bred.   If she is a good milker with good milk lines, then yes you should up your feeding. A good milking goat needs 5-7% of her body weight daily. So, hay, grain, and browse need to increase with milk production.   Nubians are such cool goats, I always loved their roman noses! I am also sure that the breeder was upset she sold you a bred doe for less, lol. A bred doe, depending on bloodlines and milking abilities, can go for over $600. But that is the breeders problem, I am sure it was a shock when your not supposed to be pregnant goat went into labor, lol (and a first freshener no less)."
goats,2l0lyy,var23,2,Mon Nov 3 23:18:11 2014 UTC,"Oh my was it ever a shock.  I woke up to a small baby goat baaing at me and her mother trying to feed her.  She was not a great mom the first day or so...but she was a new mom so I forgive her.    The first two weeks after we started milking her she would kick us, cry out, and put her foot in the milk pail.  If we didn't milk her though she would cry out because her udders were hard.  One time they got hard and hot, so we had to milk her out and dump the milk every two hours.  We also put hot rags on the udders after every milking, every two hours.  Luckily I had breast fed my own children or I wouldn't have known what to do.  It was fun getting up every two hours, throw on some shoes, grab a flash light, microwave a few wet rags, go to the barn, wash her udders with warm rags, and then try to milk her while she kicked and cried out like mad.  We followed this milking routine for about 3 days, then slowly tapered off to 4 times a day, then 3 times, then twice.    After that she pretty much welcomed us milking her.  It was a relief she looked forward too.  Even still, I want a proper milking stanchion.    It would have helped so much."
goats,2l0lyy,var23,1 point,Mon Nov 3 23:56:05 2014 UTC,"Forgot to mention that there are options if you have an accidental breeding and you just can't let the doe stay pregnant. Now I am unsure whether a regular vet would have this, but the cattle vet you mentioned should be able to get it: Lutalyse, given at 2mls IM 7-10 days after buck exposure. It will cause the doe to go into a raging heat 24-72 hours after injection, but heat will only last for normal heat range of 2-3 days (just make there isn't a re-exposure to the buck after injection)."
goats,2l0lyy,var23,5,Mon Nov 3 23:30:12 2014 UTC,"yep, take a fecal sample. it doesn't cost a whole lot to know what the problem is.  sounds like a high worm load in either case.  and seconding the need for having a vet you work with who can come to you. ask other goat people in your area who works with goats. also people at your feed store might be able to give you some tips on good vets. it'll probably be an equine vet but not to say they don't know goats, too."
goats,2l0lyy,loopsdefruit,1 point,Sun Nov 2 01:04:43 2014 UTC,"The woman I got them from believes the worms have become immune to the wormer I was using which is why this happened.  She has hooked me up with a live stock vet that will do goats, but he is far away.  I will have to call him Monday.    I will ask around for one that is closer.  I really want a vet that can inspect my girls."

goats,2kkmpr,Epona142,5,Tue Oct 28 14:53:40 2014 UTC,"Does he have access to wet pasture? Ponds? Streams? Rivers? Places where deer travel?  Mange is a possibility HOWEVER my first thought would be something we've struggled with on and off this year - meningeal worm. Which can be VERY serious.   http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articles2/meningealworm.html  For us, it presented mostly with sudden lesions on the neck and back - evidence of the larvae leaving the skin. This itches badly so the goats rub and chew these places into an ugly sore bare patch. Sometimes they are raw red, and sometimes not.  Either way, I would treat with ten (yes, 10) times the normal dose of Safeguard aka Panacur aka fenbenzadole. 23ML per 100lbs. Overdose - don't underdose.  I would also treat ALL of your goats with this, and then follow up with a second dose AND Ivomec Plus or equivalent in 10 days.   While these worms are specific to deer, they can lodge in the spine of your goat and cause temporary lameness or in the worst case, permanent paralysis. We had several does present with wobbly hind ends that had to be aggressively treated and recovered, and one doe whose hindquarters became paralyzed and no treatment could help. We ended up putting that doe down."

They do have access to woods where there's a fair amount of deer. There's a creek on my property and a pond. They haven't visited down there yet and I try not to let them go down there because it's near the road. I haven't seen signs of parasites, worms or anything other than what appears to be a rug burn. I just checked on him this morning and found that he's still itching at it with his left hind foot and it's now getting a bit dirty in the fur surrounding it.  Thank you for the link and the advice.

Some pictures are of very fresh lesions - the skin is raw and red. Some are of the lesions as they healed - they heal fairly quickly and we never had any secondary infections. But as one would heal, another would pop up.   These are the locations where the larvae was exiting the skin, and the goats would rub themselves raw overnight.

There were so many variables in them that it is impossible to describe them under one generalization.   It made diagnosing it very difficult, as you can imagine!"

goats,2ichur,the_last_fartbender,1 point,Sun Oct 5 09:36:12 2014 UTC,Wheaten chaff and goat pellets. She is back to normal again this morning. Scours started off yellow and went dark brown then just yellowy water. We are putting it down to Divetelact given to her 2 days ago. Scours while she had coccidiosis were black and tarry.  She had pretty much weaned herself before we got her so she is on normal feed very early. Her brother and sister wouldnt let her near the teat and she is a runt of triplets.
goats,2ichur,Epona142,2,Sun Oct 5 13:43:48 2014 UTC,"Yes coccidia can return, especially when incorrect dosage, medication, is used. I am unfamiliar with using trisoprim for goats so I am unsure of the dose, but it should be a multiple day regimen that is repeated every twenty one days for at least three cycles.  Baycox (toltrazuril) is the only one dose treatment I've used that proved itself effective in one-two doses. (Backed up via before/after fecaling)."
goats,2ichur,Epona142,2,Mon Oct 6 04:35:44 2014 UTC,Vet confirmed today she was also given baycox. Her scours are gone today. It may have just been milk scours from Divetelact.

Smell me! Let me make baby kids with you and EVERYONE ELSE.""  The females are extremely attracted to the smell and it will bring them into season (the ""buck effect"").  The ""chomping"" thing was most likely blubbering, another buck behavior that says ""Hey I'm so sexy!""  It's urine and you won't be harmed from it.

goats,2hakps,I_ATE_TODAY,12,Wed Sep 24 02:47:47 2014 UTC,"When you put goats in a pen, their entire purpose in life becomes to get over that fence. For example: This goat can't get over that fence, but that other goat, standing on this goat, can then jump over the fence."

goats,2hakps,Epona142,15,Wed Sep 24 03:16:57 2014 UTC,"Not just over the fence. Under the fence. Through the fence. Around the fence. Goats find a way.  However! Proper fencing will go a long way. Along with a few other things.  Not one goat. Never just one goat. A single goat is a lonely goat and a lonely goat is a goat that goes looking for trouble.  Invest in high quality fencing and posts right away. If your goat is an adult, cattle panels are excellent. They are super strong, cannot be bent or stretched by the most ambitious of goats, and last forever. They generally come in 16ft lengths and need a t-post on each end and one in the middle.  Depending on your area, they are generally $20-30 each. A little pricey per foot but they are extremely easy to set up and take down, and if you want to add on later, it's very easy to add a few more panels.  Pygmies would have one heck of a time getting out of properly installed cattle panel! However, make sure you have disbudded goats, as the holes in cattle panel are large enough to fit their heads through, and horns can get caught.   The great thing about them being able to fit their heads through means you can set up the feed trough on the outside of the fence, meaning they cannot step in their feed - they just poke their heads through and get their meal. This can go for hay as well. Keeping dirty goat feet out of feed/hay is super important to keep internal parasites down.  To make it doubly sure your goats cannot get out, you can run a line of electrified wire (pretty simple to do) around the top and bottom. One in the middle as well will keep them off the fence as well.  And as a last note - make sure nothing they can jump on is anywhere near the fencing!"

Watch out for places they can get their heads and legs stuck in.    Also, I second getting at least 2 goats.  They are pack animals and need a friend.  Goats are absolutely awesome, but they are a lot of work just like any other pet."

goats,2hakps,Bonzo451,2,Wed Sep 24 14:08:28 2014 UTC,"If a goat wants to get out of a fence, it probably will. We focus more on giving them a place that they don't feel the need to escape from. We don't even use very sturdy fencing -- we just put in T-posts and sheep panels, and hold it together with zip ties, so if they do bust out, it is an easy fix.   So how do we make them want to stay? Give them good food, a water supply, a mix of shade and sun so they can choose where to hang out, shelter from rain and wind, have more than one goat, a large enough pasture, and go visit them multiple times a day and give them some attention. We also move the pasture around a few times a year to give them a fresh place to eat.   Ours only try to get out if a motor vehicle comes through the property, or fireworks go off nearby. We normally know of those things ahead of time, and just close the goats in the barn at those times."
goats,2hakps,baldylox,1 point,Mon Oct 27 23:15:15 2014 UTC,"If there is more than one goat in the pen, and the goat has enough space, it won't usually try to get out. A pygmy goat will not be able to jump a 4' fence. However, they are good at going under and finding things to climb to get over a fence. I second the comment about running a low hot wire, it's a great way to keep them from crawling out. However, I would avoid cattle panels, unless you put boards across the gaps. The gaps in cattle panels are generally too large to contain pygmy goats.   If you decide what kind of fence you're building and want some advice, message me. We have about 100 goats at a given time, so I've built my share of fences."

goats,2h8e67,jetermtnpkr,1 point,Tue Sep 23 23:00:15 2014 UTC,Why do you say that?
goats,2h8e67,thefrenchllama,3,Wed Sep 24 03:43:56 2014 UTC,"Welded wire can be used in some cases, but in the majority of cases, it is generally not recommended. It is generally a ""weak"" fencing and goats are very hard on their fencing. It means more replacement and repair as time goes on as compared to other types of fencing.   You can see already that the wire has started to bend - this is just the start. Goats love to lean against their fencing and put their feet on it - the weakness of welded wire means it begins to bend and then break under normal goat wear and tear. This can create pieces of wire that break off and point out, potentially causing damage to delicate eyes and udders. It can also potentially bend enough to catch a hoof through it and trap a leg.  It can be used in cases like this where it is against a different type of fencing (like this wood fencing) however I would have put it on the outside - this way they cannot get out through the wood and yet cannot put as much wear and tear on the fencing.  Regardless, there are a thousand ways to do things and this is only my thoughts on the matter to answer the question asked, and in no way judgement upon the person who posted this picture, as it's their business what they use and their goats look lovely and healthy."
goats,2h8e67,Epona142,3,Wed Sep 24 03:56:06 2014 UTC,Good points! I have two Pygmy goats and they have definitely worn their fence down. I suppose with a large herd it wouldn't be too efficient. I'm actually planning on building a new fence soon to expand and repair. I don't have much money so I have only been looking at welded wire. What other inexpensive options are there?
goats,2h8e67,thefrenchllama,2,Wed Sep 24 04:25:51 2014 UTC,"When it comes to fencing, none. Buy the best you can to begin with, as it will always be your biggest expense! I talked about cattle panel and it's benefits on a thread asking about fencing here on our subreddit. :)"
goats,2h8e67,Epona142,1 point,Wed Sep 24 04:33:30 2014 UTC,You could put one strand of hot wire about a foot off the ground on the inside of the fence to keep them away from it. That's what I ended up doing to limp the old fence along until I could afford to refence it.
goats,2h8e67,jetermtnpkr,2,Wed Sep 24 11:01:16 2014 UTC,Great answer. I couldn't have said it better myself. When I set up the pasture that surrounds my barn I thought that I'd use 4x2 welded wire because that's where the kids would be born and 4x4 woven around the rest of the property. It only lasted two years. Live and learn.

goats,2h8sh4,Epona142,7,Tue Sep 23 17:00:37 2014 UTC,"Sanitation and illness absolutely can change the taste of milk. However, I trust in your words that your animals are healthy and your cleaning procedure is correct!  Obviously without being able to taste and milk and have a look, it makes it ten times more difficult, but I can offer a few possibilities.  First - some goats simply have bad tasting milk. It's unusual, but it happens. And it is genetic - offspring often follow in their dam's hoofsteps.   The second biggest cause of this is handling of the milk. Agitating and handling it roughly will cause that terrible goaty flavor. This is why goat's milk in the store is often so terrible - it becomes damaged. Dairy operations that use pipe lines to force milk from one place to the other often have this problem. We hand pour milk which is a pain and takes more time, but worth it in the end.   Also the cooling of the milk is extremely important. You have an hour to get that milk down to a very cold temperature. We aim for 35*F in our chiller. Not doing so can result in this problem with your soft cheeses, as the milk will spoil faster. I recommend that small amounts go into the freezer first to get it chilled quickly.   We are a licensed cheese producing facility and I tell you - it's a far more challenging goal than I ever would have thought! The regulations for your facility and equipment are extremely strict (as they should be!) Doesn't help that our state inspector is extremely rude and as unhelpful as it gets."
goats,2h8sh4,mylittlesoapbox,2,Tue Sep 23 18:12:14 2014 UTC,Not the OP but I'm looking at our milking season and cooling was one of the things on the list. We hand pour because we're not mechanized at all but then I'm just making milk/cheese for the family. Nice to know that is benefiting us.  But I've considered getting a small freezer just for milk and this helped me a solidify my thinking so thanks! :D
goats,2h8sh4,ControlledJibe,2,Sat Sep 27 21:34:19 2014 UTC,"Hi guys,     What is your time frame and method for cooling the milk right after milking?  Is the goaty-ness evident in the chilled milk or just the aged cheeses?  We're likely way more beginners at this than you are, but we've had no problems with goaty flavors in our milk or soft cheeses.  We also have nigerians, not alpines.  Good luck and let us know if you find any solutions. Katie and Mark"
goats,2h8sh4,jfastman,2,Tue Sep 23 18:14:15 2014 UTC,"This is good stuff!  So as a first impression, I'm going to bet we need to look at our chilling procedures. We use a milking machine with belly pails (less tubing to clean!), hand pour into half-gallon jars, then right into a fridge.  I think we're keeping it at 40 degrees, but we should make sure it's calibrated correctly, and then try cranking it down a few degrees.  Last year we used an intermediate step, we put the jars in an alcohol/water slurry in the freezer, for a fast chill-down pre-fridge, but we weren't sure it was making enough of a difference. We oughta revisit that...  Our fresh milk and our aged cheeses are fantastic... it's the soft cheeses, the chevre and mozzarella, etc, that are the problem.  Glorious for a couple of days, then pow - sharp and goaty.    And you know, although I swear by our sanitation methods enough that I certainly eat and drink our stuff every day, and often serve it to friends and family, we could have built up populations of some microbe in our handling areas that's not pathogenic, but nevertheless undesirable... Hmm.  And finally, yeah, I'm tremendously worried about the move to becoming regulated.  Strict is good, but I don't believe that the FDA is guided by good science and public health, but rather by manufacturer liability.  The FDA longs for a world in which we're only eating plastic-wrapped, chlorine-soaked Kraft cheese slices.  Which will kill you as surely as salmonella will, but so slowly that you'll never be able to sue Kraft for damages. But I digress... :-)"
goats,2h8sh4,Epona142,1 point,Tue Sep 23 19:05:20 2014 UTC,Water chilling will get the milk down to the 35-40 range quicker than the air in a refrigerator can. I'd revisit that method.   Is it possible for you to keep each goat's milk seperate to see if there's one gal that may be causing the issue?
goats,2h1rl6,SmokesWithBear,12,Sun Sep 21 17:34:13 2014 UTC,"It depends on how you're planning on doing it. MY suggestion would be to buy some quality Nubian (dairy) does. They're big, tall enough to reach almost anything (helpful with vines and vegetation that is higher up), tend to make good moms, and make enough milk for her to raise her own kid(s) and to supply you with milk to do whatever with at the same time.   You can breed them twice a year, but I don't recommend it. It breaks the does down too quickly. Breed them once a year, and let them be the rest of the time.   I don't know how much time you've spent around goats, but bucks are gross. They smell, they're usually not all that friendly, and they tear things up: fencing, buildings, etc, because they want to be with their ladies all the time. HOWEVER, to breed your does once a year, you can't just leave a buck with them all the time. They will all literally stay pregnant, all the time. And it just isn't good for the does.   My recommendation on the buck is that if you have just a few females, I would find a quality Boer breeder near you and find out if you could come and leave your does with one of their bucks for X amount of dollars for a set period of time, such as two weeks. You would be paying for the stud fee, plus their ""room and board"" while they are at that farm.  When that two weeks is up, if the buck is any good, you'll pick up all your girls and they will all be pregnant. There is also a chance that you may find a breeder that is willing to let you keep one of their bucks for a set amount of time at your property, as well. Then you yourself can actually make sure that he covers each doe a few times to ensure each of them is actually pregnant before you take him back home.  I recommend the Nubian x Boer cross with the buck being the heavy meat type because in my experience, the kids tend to turn out bigger and heavier muscled, obviously better for eating. I raised and showed Boers and Nubians all through high school and college.   Goats are a great addition to any property. They're useful, easy to handle, can be incredibly friendly and sweet, and they are actually quite smart. But I highly recommend putting your emphasis on big, hardy, dairy goat does that you can handle every day and keep forever, and ""renting"" a buck once a year. Bucks are really more trouble than they are worth most of the year. Plus you have to feed him and keep him separate from your does most of the time when he's not doing his job, which will cost extra to keep up. At the end of the day, its more cost effective and less of a headache to not have your own buck. (And also, they smell. Bad. And usually the BEST bucks smell the absolute worst. Think the Bog of Eternal Stench, because that shit never comes out of your clothes and whatnot.)  All thoughts to consider! I hope this helps! Always excited when people decide to get goats! Good luck!"
goats,2h1rl6,littlemissdisaster,4,Sun Sep 21 20:24:39 2014 UTC,"I wanted to dance around this issue so as to not piss anyone off, but I guess I can't. I absolutely, positively would not ever leave one of my girls with a boer breeder that I didn't know personally and very well. Most meat breeders don't test or really watch for CL or CAE. Nothing wrong with how they do things. Meat breeds are hardier and usually don't live as long. Because they're meat.  I'd be hesitant to buy a buck, and probably keep one in quarantine for a very, very long time before I put it anymore near my herd. I'm talking 10-12 months, with testings probably every 3-4 and watching for any abnormal cysts or lumps.   These diseases will straight up wreck a small dairy herd. Any dairy herd really."
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,5,Sun Sep 21 20:30:55 2014 UTC,"That's not entirely true. Meat or dairy, some people just don't do things. I never tested for it. I just quarantined, vaccinated and if a cyst comes up, you just wait for the hair to fall off, lance it, clean it, and start all over. It's not really all THAT bad. The cleaning of all of the shit in your entire barn is really the worst bit.   My point wasn't to just drop your goats off with strangers. Just like with your pets, or dare I say even children, you absolutely must know who you're doing business with. That's why I made the point to say quality. In the goat business, your best friends will be the honest, hard working people that also raise goats that you will come to know that are doing it the way you should be doing it, too.   When I got started, I met so many farmers that became friends that helped me in so many ways. From cutting me deals on stock, giving me valuable advice, letting me borrow a buck, to even lending me equipment when I couldn't possibly have purchased what I needed at the time.  It's all about who you know."
goats,2h1rl6,littlemissdisaster,2,Sun Sep 21 21:17:37 2014 UTC,"Not entirely true, no. But the majority of CL/CAE animals I seem to encounter in the southeast are certainly from meat herds.  I've also seen it in a large lamancha herd down here and it breaks my heart because they have some amazingly good looking animals, but I won't ever have one. Because that's just how I feel on the subject.  I'm also not sure about the viability of cross-species infection and that makes me leery about CL. It's bacterial..nothing says even if it can't currently cross-species that a strain won't develop soon that will.  I don't know about you, but i'd never drop my kids with anyone who wanted to breed them out and milk them. MAYBE i'm the strange one though. (That's jokes.)  P.S. I love that everyone here is debating and not throwing an online tantrum. Kudos."
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,2,Sun Sep 21 21:38:49 2014 UTC,"Agreed Dekonite :-)   And very much appreciate the discussion.  I do think that CL is not the tremendous evil it's often claimed to be, and I sometimes thought I must be the only one. :-)  What I'm absolutley neurotic about is the overtreatment of bacteria and parasites, and think that a devastatingly resistant strain of either one is just around the corner.  I wish that many of the goat people I know were at least just as fearful of treatment resistance as they are of CL itself.  That said, an excellent way to avoid both nasty bugs and nasty treatments is to try to be judicious about who you let your goats rub up against. :-)"
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,1 point,Sun Sep 21 23:47:57 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for anyone else, but the general feeling about vaccination here is that it's mostly useless. As you said, it only delays and sort of weakens if the disease is present.  Mostly I see a cull and replace ethos about it here."
goats,2h1rl6,Epona142,1 point,Sun Sep 21 23:49:52 2014 UTC,We do not vaccinate for CL because it's fairly ineffective and your goats will forever more test positive for CL. The cons currently outweigh the pros.
goats,2h1rl6,littlemissdisaster,7,Mon Sep 22 21:02:48 2014 UTC,Exactly! Things have a way of working themselves out. Goats CAN be hardy animals. A lot of people just don't let them be.
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,2,Mon Sep 22 21:28:56 2014 UTC,"I agree that it's not a ""Kill 'em all and break their stuff"" scenario. But WHY risk it when it is 100% not a necessary risk? I COULD potentially not catch an STD from partners with weird bumps on their junk, but i'm simply going to avoid it when I can.  CL can be spread by bird feces, flies and a hundred other natural mechanisms. Why on Earth would I want to put something in my care in harm's way just because I think it's not a big deal? CL is crippling and probably doesn't feel too peachy for the animal.  I don't know if you can develop a genetic line that is resistant to a bacteria and I can't find any sources to refute me or back me up, but my gut feeling is probably not.  Like I said, no offense to how anyone else raises their animals. Just not my style of doing it."
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,2,Sun Sep 21 20:51:36 2014 UTC,"I don't know. Honestly. I've seen pictures of internal organs ate up with abscesses and that bothers me a lot. It doesn't look pleasant. That's my biggest issue with CL.  Breed might have something to do with it too. We raise Lamanchas, which aren't incredibly hardy animals from what i've seen. I imagine a Saanen or Nubian might have an easier time of it. I don't know though."
goats,2h1rl6,Epona142,2,Sun Sep 21 21:20:11 2014 UTC,"I'm with you. No, it's not the ""end of the world"" but CL can spread to not only horses but people as well.  Plus let it get ""out"" that you have CL or CAE in your herd and good luck selling to anyone on the upper market. You'll be reduced to selling to either people who don't realize/know or to the ""low-end"" market.   The goat world is still small and word spreads very quickly. Dealt with it myself when we had a CAE issue that we thankfully were able to get cleared up.  Of course, that's why it's more prevalent in the meat industry - meat is meat. But dairy folks are a whole 'nother ball game, and not always in a pleasant sense!"
goats,2h1rl6,Epona142,7,Sun Sep 21 21:11:10 2014 UTC,"I would look into Kinder goats (if you can find them) - they are a cross between Nubians and Pygmies and tend to be rather dual purpose and fairly hardy.  Other cross-breds that have been successful as dual purpose include Boer x Nubian crosses, which are extremely popular in my area.   Most dairy goats are not very efficient for meat, though we do butcher and eat our extra males. Nubians tend to be the heaviest and meatiest of the dairy breeds and good producers of milk.  Any breed will gleefully gobble down weeds, but do know what you're getting into. Raising goats is not easy or inexpensive at all. And anyone who tells you raising and breeding goats is either lying or has no idea what they're talking about."
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,7,Sun Sep 21 23:28:19 2014 UTC,"This is truth. Goats are hard work. It's not just as easy 'throw 'em in a field and let 'em eat'. You need to make sure they're getting minerals and nutrition and yadda yadda.  Also, just looked up Kinder. That's pretty awesome combo if even half the information on dress out and milk butterfat is true. I guess we DO have dual purpose breeds. Learn something everyday."
goats,2h1rl6,Epona142,5,Mon Sep 22 21:06:47 2014 UTC,"Goats have easily been the most challenging animal I've ever worked with (and my resume is miles long) and I think that's part of the reason they hooked me in and became my passion and my livelihood.   There are so many ""unrecognized"" breeds and cross breeds out there! Plus some very awesome breeds in other countries. Boy what I wouldn't give to win the lottery and import some Golden Guernseys."
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,3,Mon Sep 22 21:27:08 2014 UTC,"Never worked with livestock until I met my (now) wife a few years ago, not really anyways. I agree, I love the goats now. We're currently working on a Lamancha herd and hopefully going to start an Alpine herd in ~2016 when we have some of the flaws in our current girls fixed.  We might be hooked now. Also want Toggs and saanens."
goats,2h1rl6,Epona142,8,Sun Sep 21 18:48:01 2014 UTC,"The biggest problem in goats is the lack of ""official"" research done on them. Veterinarians often have no idea on how to properly treat them and will proceed as if they are little cows. It's simply a lack of education and no fault of theirs - they do the best they can - but the horror stories of veterinarians prescribing treatment that can or does kill someone's goat are numerous indeed.  Your best information and help will come from the long time breeders - folks like myself who try everything and do our best to spread the information on what works and what doesn't. For example, if a goat dies here, I perform a necropsy to find out why. I have had liver biopsies done to test the effectiveness of things like copper bolusing (and different methods of doing so) and different types of mineral. I am very lucky to live so close to Texas A&M and have these things at my disposal.   Absolutely find yourself a goat mentor or fifty! There are a thousand ways to do something, and few are ""right"" or ""wrong"" in the simplest sense. Your location will make a lot of difference as well - what works up north will not work the same down south.   Goats will break your heart over and over again, but they are well worth it to those of us who fall in love with them."
goats,2h1rl6,Sorceress_of_Rossak,3,Sun Sep 21 18:59:16 2014 UTC,"This, so much this. Find a Vet that knows how to work on goats, which is very difficult. Get on some Facebook groups that are in your area that deal with goats. I have found some very helpful and wonderful connections/people/breeders on the Facebook groups I have found.   Kinder and Guernseys are really neat, if I hadn't gotten into LaManchas I would have gone with one of them. They do have some Guernsey breeders here in the US."
goats,2h1rl6,mylittlesoapbox,2,Sun Sep 21 19:06:56 2014 UTC,Your meat to bone ratio combined with grow out rates in dairy breeds make them terribly unsuited for meat. Sure I can put a dairy buckling in the freezer and have but I'm not going to again. Truthfully I am inclined based on experience to run dual-herds.  I presently have some Oberhasli dairy and am looking to pick up a couple Savannahs meat breed. Our meat goat will run nearly fully separate from our dairy goats.   You will find that the best way to pick which goat is right for you is to visit someone with them. For instance I think Nubians are incredibly loud and often rather unintelligent. Aplines and Saanens jump and were an extreme challenge to keep fenced in. It's all in the experience and preferences of the individual recommending/commenting.
goats,2h1rl6,butcher99,2,Sun Sep 21 19:16:17 2014 UTC,I had a Sanan goat years ago.   Talk about milk production.   We drank and gave away all we could and could not keep up.   Made cheese twice a week as well.   They are monster producers.
goats,2h1rl6,MrsVague,2,Sun Sep 21 22:28:55 2014 UTC,I'm not familiar with the strengths of different breeds but I want you to consider x posting to /r/homestead
goats,2h1rl6,Dekonite,6,Sun Sep 21 22:36:27 2014 UTC,"The thing about goats is there is no true 'dual purpose' like you'll find in some cattle. That being said, there are some big bodied dairy breeds out there who will make perfectly fine wethers for meat. You might want to look into Nubians, for example. Heavy bodied, lots of high quality milk, probably good for your situation.  Saanens might fit the bill too, but i'm not sure how their boys grow out.  You MIGHT look into crossing a meat breed buck over a dairy doe for kids to eat...but, bringing in meat breeds tends to bring in some diseases."
goats,2h1rl6,Scottmk4,2,Mon Sep 22 00:26:17 2014 UTC,"I think this is the right approach.  Pick a larger dairy breed. The large size will probably help them deal with cold and predators better. They will also be able to reach higher up for weed control. The larger breeds will need taller stronger fencing to contain them which is a potential down side.  After you breed them in order to get a milk supply, you'll inevitably end up with male goats. The market for bucks as breeding stock is pretty small, because one buck can service a hundred or more does in a commercial operation. That means the other 99 are unwelcome to most people.  That means meat is the primary market you'll find for them. Yes, a few people will want wethers for pets or weed control, but not half a dozen a year unless your market is different than mine.  A dairy goat won't have the same feed to meat conversion ratio that purpose bred meat goats will have, but I don't think that's too big an issue for the use you have in mind."
goats,2h1rl6,flower71,1 point,Sun Sep 21 23:38:20 2014 UTC,"If you do want crosses and you're in SW Oregon, I can point you to a few people in the area who are doing Nubian x Boer or Saanen x Boer crosses - that would get you a generation's headstart on the cross.  Generally, they sell all the offspring as meat goats so they don't have second-generation, etc. but it would give you the option."
goats,2h1rl6,Sorceress_of_Rossak,1 point,Sat Sep 27 01:14:26 2014 UTC,"There are also some dairy breeders who breed for the long, tall, larger bones. I raise LaManchas and the breeder I got my seed stock from liked them to be big solid, long, and tall. So, all my girls are big beasts and my buck is 200 lbs of muscle.   I prefer LaManchas because they have a better butterfat percentage compared to other standard size breeds. Look into different genetics and breeders who breed for good size and conformation.   Diseases are really a problem with crap breeders or those CAFO styled breeders. Find a good breeder and you can usually find healthy goats. But again, livestock should be checked from nose to tail before they are purchased and vet checked with blood work making sure they don't have any of the wonderful contagious diseases that can decimate a herd (CAE, CL, Brucellosis, and Johnes are the big ones)."

goats,2gh8as,Dizzypagan,9,Mon Sep 15 17:47:19 2014 UTC,"No. Corn is a bad idea, though it's hard to get away from it since most sacked feeds have corn in some form or fashion. Corn is a very ""hot"" feed and not something goats should be eating.  To quote Tennesseemeatgoats.com   Goats can overeat and die. Shell (deer) corn is a favorite with goats . . . it is goat ""candy""... and should be fed very sparingly and only as an inducement to bring the herd into the barn area. Pour water on a bowl of shell corn and watch it swell. That is precisely what occurs in a goat's stomach when it eats too much shell corn. Sack feed already has a proper amount of corn product in it.  Breeders in the southeastern part of the United States have lost lots of goats by feeding them sileage. NEVER FEED SILEAGE TO GOATS! Sileage is green chopped corn or grass or virtually any other forage that is cut and only partially dried, chopped into small pieces, and packed down tightly into a pit silo or airtight bag. Air tight is the key to producing useable sileage. Then it is allowed to ferment, going through an alcohol stage and then a pickled stage. When air gets to sileage, it molds, and that kills goats. Sileage is a real hazard in the warm South. It spoils faster than it can be eaten. Under the best of circumstances, sileage is fed to cattle at a rate that keeps exposure to air at an absolute minimum. Only really experienced producers, used to handling and feeding sileage, should feed it to goats. Many folks are very new to raising goats and don't know enough about sileage to warrant risking its disadvantages. DON'T TAKE CHANCES. DON'T FEED SILEAGE TO GOATS."

She had me hold them down while she tried saving them by puncturing a whole in the stomach to let the gas escape. It was heart breaking. If you need feed for the winter, alfalfa hay is good.

I'm not as tired and frustrated with my own goats as I was yesterday, so hopefully I can manage a better answer this time. :-)  Before you start thinking about female goats, get a couple of neutered males, called ""wethers"".  If you get females now, then decide ""in a few years"" to breed them, it may very well be too late for a healthy pregnancy.  Wethers are great companions, and because you can't milk 'em, dairy farms don't keep the male offspring, so there are plenty to spare.  I'd say spend the coming year researching and getting everything ready... fence, barn, a vet, a hay supplier, all that good stuff.  Put together a first-aid kit, a supply cabinet with clippers and such.  Geek out on the preparation stage.  Next summer, hit your county and state fairs, and talk to the goat people.  I guarantee you'll have lots of people offering you healthy, hungry wethers who will be thrilled to have a nice couple of acres to clear!  Then when you're ready to go dairy, you'll have great connections who can help you choose good does.    Anybody here got any good book recommendations?

goats,2g86nu,Sorceress_of_Rossak,2,Sat Sep 13 00:08:28 2014 UTC,"In that sense she could always get a female goat and a wether companion. If she gets a female that is only 1 or 2 years old, she will have a goat (as long at it is kept healthy and sound) that will be capable of breeding and milking for 8-9 years.   Also, she should do a lot of research on diseases and genetic problems before buying a goat from anyone. You can get seriously burned by auction, fair, and just general goat sellers. If something doesn't feel right or you have doubts about a seller DO NOT BUY. Check any animal you are going to buy from tail to mouth (or see if you can get a vet check) and if you can check out where they raise and keep them, do it. You are going to basically get what you pay for when it comes to livestock, buy a cheap goat and you'll get a cheap goat.   Wethers are usually less because either someone is selling them with the intent that they will be butchered or they don't want/can't feed another mouth.  As far as books I love my Veterinary Guide for Animal Owners and I have Storey's Guide Raising Dairy Goats, which is good for quick references and some good recipes.

goats,2fh3mn,The_Lunatic,3,Thu Sep 4 18:05:32 2014 UTC,"How old is she? Breed? Weight? Is she running a temperature? What color are the inside of her eyelids?  Okay. Do you have any canned pumpkin? Not pumpkin pie filling, just canned pumpkin. No? Go get some.  Mix a couple teaspoons with water and drench her. You should have a drencher. If not, use a big syringe. Pumpkin should be in every pet and stock owner's cabinet. You can even freeze the extra. It helps both with scours and constipation. You can give this mixture two-three times a day.  You can also give her a salt water enema. Warm salted water in a big syringe or drencher. Gently inset into the rectum using vaseline or other lubrication.  Slowly SLOWLY express the water into her rectum to help soften any hard stool. This can be done several times a day.  It's very important to help her - if she continues to strain to push out hard or impacted feces, she can prolapse her rectum. And that can be an ugly thing to deal with.  Is she overweight? Overweight goats are at very high risk for this. We had one ourselves this year - fat little easy keeper. Ended up having to put a stitch in her rectum to retrain her muscles to hold it in.  What is she being fed? How much? Important to know why she is getting impacted to prevent future occurrence.   Hope this helps."
goats,2fh3mn,Epona142,2,Thu Sep 4 18:31:28 2014 UTC,"I got her from another breeder that did not specify age.  She is heavy about 120 to 150 pounds.  The breeder said she was a meat crossed with a milker.  Non-specific on the breed as she was given to her.    I do have pumpkin pie filling.  No drencher, but I have a big syringe.  I can do the salt water enema.    She is fat.  She is a round fat little goat that likes to eat a lot.  We let her free browse on brush all day.  When she first came to us she was on All grain about 2 cups twice a day.  We tapered it off slowly because she was a lot fatter.  Now it's 2 cups once a day.  She is not milking and has free access to water and a salt block.  Not to mention shelter all the time.  She also has two other goats to hang out with that are unaffected."
goats,2fh3mn,Epona142,3,Thu Sep 4 20:21:31 2014 UTC,"Not pumpkin pie filling. Canned pumpkin.   No more grain. She is too fat. It's a rare goat that needs grain while not being productive. Browse and good hay. Goats develop fat around their organs before they get body fat. Imagine what must be around her organs now if she is carrying a lot of excess weight. She will live a much shorter life full of problems unless you get her weight down. All grain is nothing but sugar and starches. Candy in a bag. It's good that you've already taken steps in that direction.  Some goats are just ""easy keepers"" and can blow up like blimps."

Your goat cannot get worms from your dog. However, Hawaii is a warm wet climate and that's a perfect environment for internal parasites to thrive in.  Feed through dewormer is useless. Throw it out.  Do you have a local vet capable of running a fecal smear for you? You need to know what you're facing. It could be any of a large number of parasites, including coccidia.   For now, get pepto bismal in her. Yes, pepto bismal. It will help sooth the stomach.  Get Quest Plus from your local feed store if you can get it. It's made for horses, comes in a tube. Give her three times the normal dose (for horses). If she weights 100lbs, give her 300+ lbs worth of dewormer. Always overdose, never underdose. Repeat the dose in ten days.   If you're dealing with coccidia, you need a sulfa based medication. Di-methox, Sulmet, etc. Coccidia is notorious for causing terrible scours (diarrhea) and it will kill."

I would check her temp, but there is no thermometer here.  Her eyes are more white/pink vs. dark pink.  They are pretty goopy too.  Other than her dirty bottom, she appears fine.  Since we started caring for her we have noticed that she is definitely the lowest on the totem pole and gets butted regularly, and it only increases as she has gotten sicker  She is still generally cheery and quick to come to the milking stand.  Though now, her milk production has declined significantly.  Thanks again."

Are you aware of the FAMANCHA system? http://texasgoatwhisperer.com/blog/?p=91  Now, if you're wanting to hit them with a good punch I would suggest Cydectin which can be obtained by purchasing Quest Plus horse dewormer. Comes in a tube. This is great for people with just a few goats.  Dose them at 3x the recommended dose. For instance, if your goat is 100lbs, give them 300+ lbs worth of dewormer. Follow up with a second dose in 10 days.  Always overdose! Never underdose! Under dosing dewormers is one of the major causes of dewormer resistant parasites. And parasites are the most difficult thing to deal with in goats.  Now, if you want to go the ""top tier"" route, get a fresh fecal sample and run a fecal smear. You can do this yourself with the proper equipment, or your vet can do it. Once you find out exactly what parasites you are dealing with, you can administer a dewormer targeted at those species."

It also is great for mixing with hay to neutralize mold spores that may be present.   But for internal, it does nothing.

goats,2edf6i,rm573849,7,Sat Aug 23 16:01:38 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear this and have seen it posted all over, but I have to point out some misinformation here.  I have no idea what you mean by breeding horned to hornless goats to prevent inbreeding. This makes absolutely no sense at all. All goats have horns unless they are polled, which means they are naturally born hornless. This is a dominant trait - when breeding horned x polled, all kids have a 50% chance of being born polled as well.  Now, if you simply are misinformed, there is a myth that breeding polled to polled with result in hermaphrodites.   This is untrue. Hermaphrodites are not uncommon in the goat species and can be produced out of horned x horned breedings, horned x polled, and polled x polled, with equal chance of resulting in a hermaphrodite kid.   Unfortunately, with misinformation like that being spread, it calls into question the legitimacy and research done by the farm owner. Which is very sad!  I hope she pulls through, knowing well the costs of dairy equipment and licensing to produce cheese for sell, but when your debts have gathered to $90,000+ then there is more than just what meets the eye. The problem with a lot of these folks is they don't know how to self regulate. If you cannot afford to care for 400 goats, then you shouldn't grow that large.   I understand the passion - it's a passion that is in my own heart. But there is a limit as well, and not understanding and abiding by that lands people in trouble just like this.  Others may call me cruel and insensitive, but first and foremost, I am a farmer. The health and well-being of the goats themselves come first. This means knowing the limit. Because without it, it's the goats themselves that suffer, as in this case.  How long until this situation is repeated again? With no support system, no workers, no family or friends with the passion, who takes up this mantle when she is gone or retired?  Regardless, I wish her the best of luck. I would love to see Iceland someday - what a beautiful country."

goats,2e5fqf,McPuppinstuff,3,Thu Aug 21 04:15:41 2014 UTC,"This is actually a smart mechanism. Goats are very susceptible to internal parasites and have evolved as browsers. They eat food from high off the ground, trees and brush and shrubs. Less chance of picking up internal parasites.  Eating food off the ground is a way of picking up these internal parasites, as it is much more likely to be harboring eggs from fecal matter, or slugs or other insects which carry parasites."

Now, if you're talking scurs, that can be a different story, but this is still not something I could ever recommend anyone doing on their own without experience.   However, I also know that sometimes you have no choice.  I recently did something similar - a bad scur growing into the buck's head.  We put him on the ground on his side and I had two big guys hold him down and covered his face and head with a blanket/towel. It was stressful and unpleasant but better than a twisted scur growing into his skull."

He's got a bit of time but they are getting awful close to his head and bothering him.

goats,2cxy8y,baldylox,2,Fri Aug 8 02:10:54 2014 UTC,"Alice here is a 5 year old Boer goat that we ended up with. She's a real character.  She'll jump a 4-foot fence like it's a hurdle. There's simply no fencing her in.   She knows how to open gates and doors.  This leaves Alice the Goat with two options: live on a chain alone, or die in a bunch of tacos.  She lives in our big front yard now. I built her a mobile A-frame house with wheels so that she can be moved around. She's learned that if she stands on top, she gets more attention.  We live out in the country 30 miles south of Nashville and have a few neighbors that are famous musicians.   Part of the cheezy tourist stops has been to meet Alice. She gets loving and treats all day. Locals that drive by honk at her. Tourists drive up our long drive to take photos of her and give her some raisins or other treats.   Everyone in our community knows Alice.   Someday I'll tell the story of how we wound up with her.   For now just enjoy Alice the Goat."

goats,2cxy8y,jfastman,3,Fri Aug 8 19:16:21 2014 UTC,"Alice hurdles a 4-foot fence as if it's not even there. A 6-foot fence wouldn't hold her in. She could and would jump it.   So, I can't keep her with my other goats and sheep because she'll just teach them how to do that.  When I say 'tacos', yes, I mean actual tacos. She's a Boer goat. That's a meat goat. There is a large Kurdish and Mexican population where I live that eats a lot of goat. A lot of folks around here raise Boers for precisely that reason.   Just a week ago a couple guys stopped over wanting to buy Alice for a quinceañera. So yes, tacos.   She's too sweet to eat.  She's happy in her live on the chain. It's 60 feet long or so. She has a lot of room to run around. She loves to play with our dogs. When she's being supervised and played with we'll let her off the chain. Sometimes my wife even lets her come into the house for a bit.   She's not lacking for attention. Strangers stop by all day long and pet her and give her treats. I built her a nice house that she likes to destroy.   In general, you don't want to chain goats, because they can be very vulnerable to predators - especially coyotes.  She is inside of a very good sturdy fence protected by her doggie friends, plus I've seen Alice in action before. I don't like the coyote's odds. She lives in our front lawn, which is about 1.5 acres and fenced in like a dog park.   We have miniature donkeys that watch over our goats and sheep. They're very cute and wonderful pets that are the best guard animals. A coyote won't come within a mile of a donkey.   You'd think it was sad that she has to live most of her life on the chain, but believe me, Alice is happy as a clam.   Nigerian Dwarf goats aren't physically capable of hurdling a fence like that. Too small. I've never hear of that happening.  We mostly raise fainting goats, same thing. They're much smaller than Boer goats, and jumping that high would probably make them faint.   Maaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaa >WHONK<  I'm sorry but that never gets old."

goats,2bpz0h,Emazinng,12,Fri Jul 25 19:59:54 2014 UTC,"Well, while the picture is loading, first and foremost, the only way to tell if an animal is pregnant is if it's giving birth. In which case it's rarely pregnant for much longer!   Now, this is an exaggeration, because I can put my hands on a goat three months pregnant and tell you. But that doesn't mean I am always right or that I don't miss some. We had a little La Mancha doe who showed not one single sign of being pregnant. I was assisting another doe when she laid down and out popped two doelings. Talk about shocker.  The easiest way to know for sure is to draw blood and send it to Bio-tracking for pregnancy testing. Do it 32 days after you acquired them for most accurate results.   Knowing for sure is important - That way you know to give a proper diet towards the end of their pregnancy and dry them off in preparation.   Okay, pictures loaded. (Oh, rural internet how I despite you)  I couldn't tell you either way. If she is, she is not far enough along to show the typical signs I look for. Although, please watch her udder - she has very weak attachments and each freshening will cause her to sag more and more. You'll want to watch that she does not develop mastitis or step on it and injure it. It's pretty typical in Boers. Which is what that doe is - a meat goat. She is not a dairy doe. But there's plenty of people who milk Boers, so no big deal.  Drawing blood on goats is very easy - no need for an expensive vet bill. You can buy redtop tubes from ebay, or I will sell you just a couple if you like. We buy them in bulk for our yearly testing.  Here's a blog post I did on drawing blood. It includes a video. http://texasgoatwhisperer.com/blog/?p=140"
goats,2bpz0h,Epona142,3,Fri Jul 25 20:45:15 2014 UTC,"Healthy goats should have big round tummies. They have a special stomach compartment called a rumen where they digest fibre and generate a lot of burps. Generally speaking the left side bulges more for the rumen, and the right for the uterus, but that's not 100% accurate. Also, as pregnancy advances, sometimes the kids will kick back if you press on the doe ' s side. Make sure you are giving them proper goat food and lots of fresh clean water. Mine always pooped in their water when they wanted a fresh bucket (which was often). Check out fiasco farms - excellent resource site and lots of pictures of happy, healthy goats!!"
goats,2bpz0h,dancingmillie,2,Sat Jul 26 13:44:25 2014 UTC,"It's hard to tell if a goat is pregnant.  It also depends on the type of goat it is.  If it is a Nubian, they will usually stick to a seasonal breeding schedule.  It's not out of the question that they could breed in early spring, it's just not as common.  Most dairy goats stick to a August to December breeding cycle.  The reason why your goat's side are protruding may be due to dietary changes or crate stress.  If you are feeding them free-choice hay, they'll develop a grass belly (completely normal).  Since they are from an auction, they may have a worm load due to the stress of the sale (crate stress).  This too is common when goats are moved into a new location, sold, or just gave birth.  I would suggest taking a fecal sample and seeing what the worm load is.  A local vet can do this for you and provide advice on what wormers work for your location.  If a fecal can't be done and these are your only two goats, I would suggest worming them for both tape and intestinal worms.  Safeguard does well for tapeworms and Cydectin is the leading choice for wormers at this time.  A fecal count is the safe bet and shouldn't be that expensive.  Worming indiscriminately is not the best way to go about things, but sometimes your choices are limited.    The photos look normal to me.  I've had goats who I had no idea were pregnant give birth and others who look like they're pregnant all the time.  As far as milk production goes, grain and feed are your friends.  Lactating does need that extra kick to stay in milk.  You can try to increase their feed or it could just be simply drying out."

Just want to add my standard sized does that are in milk get about 3lbs +/- of grain a day. Because when a goat is in milk most of their food consumption goes to making milk. There is a technique called ""bouncing"" they could try in order to determine if the goat is pregnant, check out the website http://fiascofarm.com/  It has tons of good info for new goat owners."

goats,2bf4p9,morkie,10,Tue Jul 22 18:55:20 2014 UTC,"Hello neighbor! I am east of you, a little ways past College Station/Bryan. I am the stock manager at a dairy and we have, combined, almost 200 goats.  We do not shave. We ensure our goats have free access to the barn, which we open up many of the walls during summer time. Free access to water of course. We very rarely have issues with heat distress, and only when it's blazing and the goats have gone out on the big pastures. Which is rare, because we do not allow them out during those times. Too much risk.  Yes, there is a lot of conflicting information about shaving. As an ex-groomer, I know that fur not only keeps an animal warm, but also insulates the animal. I detest the idea of shaving a double coated dog, for instance. I have first hand seen a Saint Bernard that went into heat distress after being shaved and losing his insulation.   However - many many people shave their goats every year and I very rarely hear of any issues.   So I think this is a personal choice.  If you are looking to quickly cool a goat that is in heat distress (lethargic, open mouth panting, very hot to the touch), run cool (not cold) water over their legs. Water from the hose works. Never run it over their main body or head - this can cause them to go into shock. Running it over their legs cools them with much less risk!"
goats,2bf4p9,Epona142,3,Tue Jul 22 19:18:26 2014 UTC,Hello neighbor! Thanks for the reply- confirmed my logic behind not shaving them.
goats,2bf4p9,Sorceress_of_Rossak,4,Thu Jul 31 02:10:35 2014 UTC,"I do shave my goats in the summer. I live in the NE and the temps here have been fluctuating from 92 (heat index over 100) to upper 70s, with lots of humidity. I think my goats are more comfortable when I shave them, especially my fat black lady. I raise dairy/show goats, so there is also an aesthetic factor to shaving my herd. I think it is mostly just personal preference and how well your goats are handling the heat. I also think it really wouldn't hurt them if you do decide to shave them. Shaving is useful for seeing the conformation and color of your goats. For example I have a doe that looks like a white woolly mammoth in the winter, but when I shave her she turns into this beautiful apricot dairy doe."
goats,2bf4p9,Sorceress_of_Rossak,3,Tue Jul 22 21:44:44 2014 UTC,"Another Northeasterner here, and we shave most of our goats.  We've got some white Nigerians who are more at risk of sunburn than heat stroke and love nothing more than to sit out in the sun on the hottest days.  But our Alpines - especially the black sundgaus - love being shaved.  We wait until late May usually.  And by then, there have already been some hot days.  After we shave off the long winter coats you can see a real change in behavior - they're bonkers with delight right after a shave, and much more frisky and playful for a few days afterwards.    I also agree that it's fascinating to see the differences in color and conformation when you shave them.  And there are other minor benefits - easier to see if someone's got a tick or an injury, for instance.  But we shave or don't shave based on what works best for the animal's comfort."

goats,2az6aj,Dizzypagan,7,Thu Jul 17 18:39:06 2014 UTC,"My friends at Onion Creek Ranch covered this better than I could hope to.  The Livestock Guardian Dog is stubborn, single-minded, and focused solely on its herd and its protection. We Texans call this characteristic ""hard-headedness."" Livestock Guardian Dogs are often not especially social animals, tending instead to stay with the goat herd. Although some folks manage to make pets and companion animals of them, their ""alpha"" nature does not particularly suit them for this role. They should never be left unsupervised with children, pets, or livestock other than those which they are guarding.  It is critical that you work with the dog and socialize it to you so that it is manageable. If you have dogs, cats, poultry, or other livestock, you must be careful with the introduction of the LGD to these animals. Unless the Livestock Guardian Dog is taught otherwise, all other animals, even other Livestock Guardian Dogs, are enemies to its livestock. A LGD puppy raised with your pets and other livestock generally provides the best opportunity to have them all get along. There are drawbacks to beginning with a puppy, particularly if predators are a current problem. A puppy isn't ready to handle predators on its own and won't be until it is about eighteen (18) months old.  LGD's work best in pairs. A male-female pair, at least one of which has been neutered or spayed, works well together. An older dog works well with a younger, less-experienced animal, teaching the pup how to refine its instincts. Do not run two unspayed females or two intact males together. When one of them comes into heat, fights will occur. It is dangerous to physically get between two fighting LGD's. To separate two fighting dogs, use the strong spray from a water hose. Do not put yourself between them or you will need medical attention. In most instances, running littermates together is not successful because sibling rivalry arises.  Livestock Guardian Dogs are sensitive animals -- the ability to sense what is happening makes them good at their jobs. Don't shout at them and never strike them with any object, including your hand. Speak calmly and slowly when instructing or correcting the actions of the LGD. You must at all times be the 'alpha' -- the dominant one -- in the relationship. Take a misbehaving LGD by the scruff of the neck and turn it upsidedown on the ground to indicate to the dog that you are in control. Ninety-nine percent of the dog's activities will be the result of instinct bred into it. That other 1% can make or break its effectiveness, and that is where the 'alpha' human's role is critical.  LGD's are big animals. They grow fast, often achieving weights of over 100 pounds in 12 months or less. Their bodies mature faster than their minds, so remember that you will have a very large puppy on your hands for some time. Livestock Guardian Dogs under eighteen months of age should work in tandem with an older LGD. Don't be alarmed when the adult Livestock Guardian Dog goes up to each goat in its newly-acquired herd and licks or gently paws its face. This is normal get-acquainted behavior. Newly-acquired weaned puppies should be put in a pen separate from but adjacent to goats before being introduced into a goat herd. After several weeks of this arrangement, carefully introduce the young LGD into a small group of goats in a location where the producer can monitor all activities. Don't put pups in with juveniles under a year of age, kids, pregnant does, or does that are nursing kids. Don't put multiple puppies in with the same group of goats; their rough-housing will wind up hurting some goats. Put a pup with an older experienced LGD who is assigned to a herd of mature bucks or does. The pup needs to get banged around a bit by the bigger goats for him to learn his place in the pecking order.  The biggest challenge facing most LGD owners is making sure that the dogs get properly fed. The Livestock Guardian Dog thinks of itself as one of the goats in the herd. In fact, the dog will assume a subservient place in the herd and will sometimes give up its food to its goats. Some Livestock Guardian Dogs will eat goat food at the trough with the goats it is guarding and will even try to eat hay. Obviously, this nutritional level is much too low for a canine. Establish a location where the dog can eat undisturbed by the livestock, and feed the dog at the same time that the goats are fed. Don't be surprised if the LGD eats one day, then skips eating for several days. Some Livestock Guardian Dogs tend to eat like wolves . . . gorging when food is plentiful to hold them over until the next meal is available. This is instinct-in-action.  Some LDG's (Anatolian Shepherd comes to mind) have a body build similar to that of a Greyhound . . . long and lanky. It always looks like it needs to gain weight. Any animal which can run 35 to 40 miles per hour has to be lithe of build.item14a2b1a  The Livestock Guardian Dog often looks like it is doing nothing. Don't be fooled. The LGD is always on watch. During the daylight hours, the dog will be hard to find and, if located, will appear to be sleeping. In fact, it is resting and watching everything. Two or three dogs working together will be spread out around the pasture at strategic points and inconspicious to all but those who know how to look for them. Introduce a strange animal, person, or object into that pasture and watch what happens. A huge ruckus ensues as the dogs make their presence known by calling out to the intruders and to each other. This writer has observed one of her LGD's become suddenly upset by the presence of a spider underneath a board in the back of the goat shelter. The spider was hard to find and barely visible, but the dog saw it and didn't like its being there.  Nighttime is when the Livestock Guardian Dog becomes active, vocal, and really goes to work. As dusk approaches, the dogs begin to call out to each other and to predators. The LGD has sounds for each situation; when predators are around, it makes a distinctly recognizable bark that is quite different from the sounds made when the goat producer comes with feed or when a goat is down. Specific sounds are vital for protecting the herd from predators. LGD's are barking machines. If the sounds of dogs barking all night bothers you or your neighbors, then Livestock Guardian Dogs are not for you. Some LGD's are guarders and some are patrollers; the goat producer won't know the difference until he observes the mature dog at work. Remember that the dog will likely be 18 months of age before it is a successful working animal. A patroller does not become a guarder easily -- if at all. Patrollers need acreage over which to roam. Patrollers don't know your goats from your neighbors' goats -- they are all goats in need of his protection.  If you are on small acreage or in a semi-urban or suburban area, predator protection other than Livestock Guardian Dogs may be your best choice. Although this writer has no experience with the product, the NiteGuard solar-powered predator light has been reported by some goat producers to be the solution to their predator problems on small acreage or in suburban areas where ""patroller"" LGD's will not stay home. Check the product out for yourself at www.niteguard.com. Price is under $50.00 per light. If none of these options works for you, ask a male family member to walk the perimeter of your property and urinate along the fence line and on the wooden fence posts. Predators rely on their sense of smell; unfamiliar smells cause them to shy away. Can't hurt and might help. This is not a joke.  Behavioral traits of Livestock Guardian Dogs can be confusing to people unfamiliar with them. Example: A doe gives birth in the pasture and the kid is stillborn or dies. To protect the rest of the goats, the LGD will eat the dead kid so that predators are not drawn to the herd. It would be easy to misinterpret this situation as one in which the dog killed the kid, when in fact that is not the case. Another example: The Livestock Guardian Dog will stay with a sick or lame animal and sometimes appear to be harrassing it, when in fact the LGD is trying to separate it from the herd for the herd's overall protection, or the dog will force the downed goat to move towards its herd for protection. A good Livestock Guardian Dog will sense if the goat is dying or has a good chance to survive.  This writer had the following personal experience in November 2009: Breeding-age does were being found at daybreak with bloody tails. Two of them actually had their tails bitten off. Two weeks of investigation revealed that the buck placed with the does was so eager to breed them that he was chasing and catching them by their tails as they ran from him. It would have been easy to blame the dogs -- who were running among the goats at night -- but careful investigation proved that the Livestock Guardian Dogs were trying to stop the buck from hurting the does. Too many producers would have blamed and punished or destroyed the dogs.  Livestock Guardian Dogs are independent and self-sufficient. They can survive for days in pasture conditions with their goats. They will catch and eat rabbits, squirrels, and other small animals -- but it is always necessary to provide dog food for them. LGD's should be vaccinated against rabies, parvo, distemper, and other serious diseases annually since their exposure to these diseases is high. They seldom sleep under shelter. Indeed, Livestock Guardian Dogs do not need us. It is WE that need THEM.  Suzanne W. Gasparotto ONION CREEK RANCH 11/13/09  Source: http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articles2/livestockguard06.html"
goats,2az6aj,Epona142,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:02:46 2014 UTC,Just be ready for naughty puppy behavior to emerge. When it does putting them in with a herd queen that won't put up worth b.s. Is effective. Our gp is a year and a half and the puppy behavior has decreased significantly in the last several months. Don't leave her alone with little goats until you can fully trust them. Have had a friend whose goat had a heart attack from being chased by threetheir lgd
goats,2az6aj,Dalebssr,1 point,Fri Jul 18 05:21:08 2014 UTC,"Most definitely this.  I agree with the other post about having a pair of Pyrs to work as a team.  If they are young and still pups, they will tag team kids for fun and kill unattended kids.  Once they get past two years old the dogs settle down quite a bit.  Make sure that all dog/kid (especially bottle kids) interactions are supervised.  If you can afford it, I would suggest a remote training collar with a range of a 1/4 mile.  I have one for a German Shorthair that was trained for upland bird hunting.  When our Pyr was away from us harassing a kid, a simple push of the button immediately corrected the action.  Like most dogs, Pyrs can figure out what they can and can't do when the e-collar comes off.  A fake e-collar can be placed on them in-between charging cycles to prohibit negative behavior.    It's a lot of work to train them as Pyrs are independent and occasionally bull-headed.  Once they are trained, they are great guardians.  We no longer have dogs in the field and went with a llama."
goats,2az6aj,flower71,1 point,Fri Jul 18 15:21:55 2014 UTC,"I only wish I had a mean herd queen!  I've been considering borrowing a bad-tempered goat from a friend just for this reason.    My mature goats are all so terrified of my LGD that I couldn't even put him in with them at 2 months old.  He grew up with a goat herd and just wanted to be one of the goats, but even putting him in an adjacent run ended up causing one of the (4 months pregnant) goats to miscarry because they'd spook every time he moved - I had to move him to a pen out of sight.  Our LGD definitely thinks he is a goat.  When he does spend (supervised) time with this year's babies (who are not afraid of him), he walks around trying to eat what they eat.  He's spent a lot of time throwing up dried grass or poison oak leaves.  (I think it's getting better as he matures.)  Even though the baby goats aren't afraid of him, and he's very protective, I definitely wouldn't leave him alone with them.  Everything's fine until they start playing follow-the-leader and streaming around the pasture in a group.  Our puppy gets way overexcited and tries to play with them too, but while the goats think they're playing follow-the-leader, he thinks they're playing tackle football.  Pretty soon we've got a batch of scared goats running as fast as they can, and a dog who thinks they're all still having fun."

goats,2axcd3,jealouseviction,5,Thu Jul 17 04:14:13 2014 UTC,"No.   Why are you getting an intact buck? Do you have other goats or will he be alone? A goat should never be alone - and an intact buck is generally not recommended as a pet, although one can be kept without any danger to yourself or others if one is so inclined. If you already have goats, please disregard the previous. :)  Horns are dangerous. Even in the most gentle, mild mannered goat, they are dangerous. Not just to you but to children, dogs, other goats, and to the goat himself.  I cannot count the number of first person testimonials I have read or have told to be about a goat that seriously injured someone or something else, or died due to horns.   I have experienced it myself. My very first goat had beautiful horns, and she was very smart about them. Even so, she broke the hip of another goat, put a scar on my thigh swinging her head at another goat, and ultimately, died from becoming entangled by her horns in a freak accident.   Another goat here at the dairy I am the manager of had malformed horns from a bad disbudding. She got caught up in netting someone (poachers?) left on our large property. She died.   Yet another doe here with horns has now badly injured three goats and I am removing her horns through the banding method which is very unpleasant for her. However, the alternative is to sell her to heaven knows where or slaughter her.   Dairy goat horns tend to grow up and out, with sharp ends that could easily injure your child on accident.   Since you are already heading to get him, I recommend duct taping tennis balls to the ends of his horns, and ensuring there is no location in the fencing or his paddock where he can get his head through. These precautions will help prevent accident or injury to the goat or others."
goats,2axcd3,Epona142,2,Thu Jul 17 07:31:33 2014 UTC,"You can have them and the scent glands surgically removed. The risk of surgery vs banding is that it leaves gaping holes in the skull, whereas with banding it's already partially grown over and there is a clot base. Horns are dangerous and bucks are a dime a dozen. Skip this guy and pay the money to get a properly socialized, disbudded pair of goats. Sketchy goats are no fun."
goats,2artvl,zippy1981,5,Tue Jul 15 16:13:36 2014 UTC,"You can develop Sumac or Poison Ivy rashes on your hands from handling goats that are going through it and eating. I've had it happen a few times - our dairy does have quite a large area they are allowed to browse upon daily, unusual for a dairy operation.  For milking, you should be cleaning and disinfecting the udder before hand anyhow. Just be thorough, and of course, express the milk that is in the teat to clear it before beginning actual milking."
goats,2artvl,Epona142,3,Tue Jul 15 17:17:37 2014 UTC,"So what your saying is any oil they ingest would not make it into the milk. My only concern would be surface contamination of their udders during the milking process?  I'll have to talk to the pediatrician about unpasturized goats milk, but I assume it would not be terrible expensive to home pasteurize small batches if it came down to that."
goats,2artvl,Epona142,6,Tue Jul 15 18:20:12 2014 UTC,"Correct. :) It will not be on the milk, but the oils can contaminate the milk if left on the udder, teats, or your hands. Sanitizing and cleanliness of not only the udder, but your hands, and of course milking equipment, is #1 of proper milk safety and handling.   I do not recommend raw milk for children simply due to liability but properly handled clean raw milk should not cause harm to healthy adults or older children.  There are many methods to home pasteurization that are easy. :)"
goats,2artvl,up2late,4,Tue Jul 15 19:35:13 2014 UTC,I was raised on unpasteurized goats milk and I survived. :) Most health care people today seem to go with caution and say any raw milk is risky.  With goats remember they are very social so you'll need at least 2 for them to be happy.
goats,2artvl,Dashtego,1 point,Tue Jul 15 19:20:29 2014 UTC,"Both of those are good points. I worked on a goat farm for a while and the woman that ran it raised her daughter on raw goat milk from her herd. I suppose it's potentially risky, though. You definitely need to get at least two though, although a sheep or sociable herd-type dog might work as well. Goats just need animal company."
goats,2artvl,lazytranch,2,Wed Jul 16 03:54:34 2014 UTC,"we have a raw goat milk dairy, and some of our herdshare members pay a premium to have our does graze on poison oak patches. Apparently, it helps people who have a tendency to get rashes build up a natural immunity. On the other hand, my wife (who milks the goats) tends to live with small poison oak outbreaks all summer long, but that is also from chasing our goat kids through the forest and petting our dogs. I drink more of the milk than she does and don't get it so bad except for once in the spring before we begin milking, so maybe there's some truth in it. I've been very sensitive to it all my life until we got goats. And just to fully answer your question: Not only do goats not mind poison oak/ivy/sumac... they thrive on it!"

They have fifteen acres to roams with no fencing except for a back fence where our 300 acres are. But other than that they have a southern border, the river, an eastern border, a creek, and a western border, mountain range. And other than those they eat whatever they want. But believe it or not goats are very smart animals. They understand poison and know what not to eat. They also don't eat everything, contrary to popular belief. But to answer your question, it should not be a problem, but if you do see them eating it, it's best to fence off that tree or cut it down all together. Hope this helps, and happy ranching! :)"

However, there are a few things you can check.  Temperature. You should have a thermometer.   Eyelid color - knowing how to judge a goat's FAMANCHA is extremely important.   Is she able to get up? What do her feces look like? Her urine? Any strange smells? Does her breath smell strange? Fruity? Is she pregnant? How far long? Is she nursing kids?   What did you deworm with? When? How much?  Where are you located? What is your average temperature during the day and during the night?  Does she have an udder? What does it feel like? Is it hot? Hard? Soft?   What about her behavior? Can she get up on her own? Is she eating, drinking? Does she wobble? Stumble? Weakness in the hind end? Is she star-gazing or is her head turning back towards her spine?  When you come to us (us being other goat people) for help, please give us as much information as possible. Not aiming this at you, but everyone. We all must band together, as goats are very under researched and are already a very challenging species to keep and raise. Information and education that we goat keepers pass to one another is invaluable.  Here is my blog post on the basics of deworming - http://texasgoatwhisperer.com/blog/?p=91  It could be worms, or it could be one of a million other things goats can and do die from. I'm going to be honest - once a goat reaches the stage you are describing, your chances of saving her are very slim, unfortunately."

goats,29ljea,Lvl15TechNinja,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:42:48 2014 UTC,"This isn't uncommon. I'm guessing Solo is a single (no siblings)? And you feed your doe really well? :)  With ~200 kids being born every year, I see this a lot. Single kids (especially little bucklings) are born larger and grow faster. We have a single born Nigerian Dwarf doeling who is now nearly as large as our yearlings. We also have a doeling who was one of four, but her siblings were all sold quite early on and she shot up in growth, catching up to the monster girl.  I'm not really sure what your vet means about his knees. Unfortunately, veterinarians get very little education on goats, through no fault of their own. There just isn't enough ""official"" research out there for them to study during school.  Breeds vary greatly in size as well - even lines within a breed. Some are born large and grow large, some are born small and grow slowly but end up just as large."
goats,29ljea,Epona142,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:57:55 2014 UTC,"I think the vet just meant that if he grows too fast he will have leg problems. I think he was just born late and being a single to boot, he is just big. Plus, he is a boer which, as I understand, grow quickly anyways."
goats,29ljea,Epona142,1 point,Tue Jul 1 22:09:05 2014 UTC,"I've never heard of that happening in goats before except in the case of very fat goats. When goats gain weight, they first gain fat around their internal organs. This is why a fat goat is a very unhealthy goat.  Boers of course are bred to grow a lot of meat to bone ratio but fat remains the same across the breeds.   Power-feeding, a technique some meat breeders and even a few dairy breeders use, can lead to issues that would affect leg and knee structure I imagine.   However, if your boy is just shooting right along, then I agree again - just a big single kid growing fast, with all mama's milk to himself."

goats,292qek,Epona142,2,Wed Jun 25 17:50:09 2014 UTC,"I have three generations of does that roll together in the pasture.  All are Boers, being bred, and have kidded this year.  It is not uncommon for grandma to watch all of the kids while daughter and granddaughter go off to graze.  When we are feeding them, tempers flare as all of the goats vie for grain.  However, if the extended family is feeding together, less aggressive stances are taken with each other.  They still push each other out of the way, but not to the degree of trying to inflict pain.    Their intelligence really needs to be studied.  You can only fool a goat once with a lasso, a shepherd's hook, or a corral.  Any doe or buck that has a shred of common sense is a true pain in the ass."

goats,2902vm,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 24 21:29:14 2014 UTC,A little video from the past. Taught a bottle kid a bunch of cute tricks - this was her grand finale. :) Makes me miss the days when I had a lot more time on my hands!
goats,2902vm,jfastman,2,Tue Jun 24 21:29:43 2014 UTC,What did you use to get it to jump onto the stump?
goats,2902vm,jfastman,1 point,Wed Jun 25 14:22:30 2014 UTC,"Baby (I know, original name right?) was very affection motivated. She learned all of her little tricks with scratches and patting as a reward. I have a yearling now who is very similar and learned to ""shake hands"" recently with the same reward. If I had more time, no doubt she too could learn some more tricks.   But if you're looking for a treat for a food motivated goat (which is the majority of goats!) I would recommend raisins. Our goats will do anything to get a raisin. Plus it's small and perfect for training."
goats,2902vm,jfastman,2,Wed Jun 25 17:40:45 2014 UTC,Oh nice! It's funny that something as simple as a wrinkly little raisin gets their attention. I'll try this with my boys tonight when I get home.

goats,2901go,tracybaby09,1 point,Tue Jun 24 23:43:45 2014 UTC,"This is a blog post I've been meaning to write up - the essentials of a kidding kit!   Really, ours is quite simple. We produce on average ~200 kids per year between my personal herd and the dairy herd.   I have a toolbox that is filled with the following items:  Towels. A lot of towels. Many people use puppy pads or paper towels. I am cheap so I use towels, which are then hosed off, washed and dried.   Lubrication, in the event I need to assist a doe during birth. They make lubrication specifically for livestock, but any safe lubrication should be fine.  A small hairdryer, in the event I need to warm a chilled kid.  Iodine for dipping the navel.  Bo-Se and/or Vit E/Selenium gel caps/liquid for kids after birth.   Small knife, because everyone needs a small knife in every kit.   Syringes, because you never know when you might need a syringe.  Leashes, to restrain a doe if need be.  Dewormer - this is the only time of the year we deworm everyone routinely, as giving birth lowers the doe's immune system, leaving open footholds for a parasite infestation. Any other time of the year, we fecal and deworm as needed.  A clipboard with our kidding records on it - every birth is noted with details as to date, how many kids born alive, how many dead, coloration, dam, etc. A copy is made every evening as the goats have been known to steal and eat this list when our backs are turned for two seconds.  Numbered tags - every kid is assigned a number and tagged. With so many, it's nearly impossible to remember who belongs to who without them! Especially as our does quite happily share kids.  There are many many other things that people often keep in their kits, but as you can see, mine is very simple. I do not use ""kid/lamb pullers"" - we own a couple, but I prefer to use my hands to feel inside the vagina/uterus when sorting out tangled kids and assisting. Many people wear gloves to do this, I do not.  We do have many many other items, but they are all in the medical/supply cabinet and can be retrieved as needed."
goats,2901go,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 24 21:25:23 2014 UTC,Thank you - it looks like I have all of those items in my 'kidding tub' right now.  I just want to be sure I'm not leaving something out.  Do you have a blog that we could follow?  It looks like there is oodles we could learn from you! - Katie
goats,2901go,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 24 21:34:01 2014 UTC,"It's been terribly neglected lately, but this is my little blog: http://texasgoatwhisperer.com/blog/   I also have a Facebook page - I am always available to anyone who needs assistance with their goat(s) or even just has a question! Goats are my passion and I work with them almost literally 24/7/365.   https://www.facebook.com/knsfarm  I was new to this once too, and I remember very clearly how it is - in fact, I still feel that way sometimes, because with goats, there is literally no end to learning more about them. They are a very under researched and under represented species."
goats,2901go,jfastman,2,Tue Jun 24 21:43:19 2014 UTC,I recently joined this group. The person I got my two wethers from recommended this site. Best of luck in the coming days.
goats,2901go,Epona142,3,Wed Jun 25 14:44:24 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  Yes, we also got that link to Fiasco Farms from the folks we bought our goats from too.  It seems to be the best reference out there for goats.  Also we found that forums (the goat spot for one) were actually a better resource for health problems then our local vet.  That was an expensive lesson to learn!  Hopefully you guys have better goat vets out there in Pennsylvania....or better yet hopefully you won't ever need one! - Katie"
goats,2901go,Lvl15TechNinja,2,Wed Jun 25 15:21:35 2014 UTC,"Yes, we all very quickly learn that it's other goat breeders we should go to for our information - not vets in most cases.  I have had veterinarians recommend treatment that could kill my goat, or diagnose a goat completely wrong. It's not their fault, they're not doing it on purpose of course, they just do not have access to research and education on caprines, because there simply is barely any! They then attempt to treat the goat like a little cow, and that simply does not work.   However, a working relationship with a vet is so important - there are medications you will at some point need that are Rx only: oxytocin, Bo-Se, Bamamine, etc...probably misspelled some of them but you get the idea.  I started out on the Goat Spot too - was quite active for a long time, but then the forum got really big and I just couldn't keep up anymore. I tried to go back later, but so many new faces - I just couldn't get back into the ""groove."" I'm still friends with the creator and original owner and many of the veterans!   There is also Dairygoatinfo.com - their forum is also growing with a lot of new folks, but it is the home of some of the best long time breeders. I have learned (and continue to learn) a lot from them."
goats,2901go,Lvl15TechNinja,2,Wed Jun 25 17:45:15 2014 UTC,"Great to know Epona!  I'll put the dairygoatinfo.com on my bookmarks.  More information is always better.  We think we have found a bit better vet, who is on call for our due doe, just in case.  He seems to have a bit better understanding of goats, but like you say, there just isn't a ton of info out there.  We've found the forums and Fiasco Farm invaluable.  Thanks again! - Katie"
goats,2901go,Lvl15TechNinja,1 point,Wed Jun 25 18:10:58 2014 UTC,"We just had a kid on Sun. We had the kit: towels, scissors, iodine, snot suckers. All we needed was the towels and iodine and only used the towels so we could hold a slippery kid while we dipped the cord and hooves. I suppose, like a handgun, it is better to have it and not need it than vice versa. Momma (and nature) knew what to do."

I am well known for my affinity for the blue eyes and color combinations in our breed. We call them my ""Blue eyed beauties."" lol  Each of your kiddos has a 50% shot of having blue eyes (unless the dam also has blue eyes, in which it goes up to 75%) so fingers crossed for lots of them for you. :)  http://texasgoatwhisperer.com/blog/?p=20"

I have the baby monitor in her stall and jumping at every strange sound.  The things we do for our critters!  Thanks again! Katie"
goats,28z4ky,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 24 20:31:13 2014 UTC,"Oh gosh yes...I deliver on average ~200 goat kids every year, but it never gets any less nerve wracking!  I've got a little pen set up right outside my door for what I call ""high risk"" does - does that need extra supervision in the late stages of pregnancy for whatever reason (age, size, tendency to have difficulties or high multiples, previous injury, etc..) which is super helpful.  During the normal kidding season, I pretty much just stay out in the barn. Lol! It's a 24/7 job!"
goats,28z4ky,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 24 21:11:27 2014 UTC,"Oh my, I at least hoped it would get less stressful with more experience!  :)  Oh well.  Our doe that is due now has a prolapsed vagina (goes back in when she stands), but we're still nervous about complications with that.  Do you have any experience with that issue in particular?  Hopefully things will go smoothly and we just get to sit back, provide moral support and watch.  Fingers crossed! - Katie"
goats,28z4ky,p8tra,3,Tue Jun 24 21:31:32 2014 UTC,"Well, I say nervewracking, but as your experience grows, so will your confidence. Even in the event of a problem, knowing that I am capable of doing the best I can for the does keeps everything on an even keel. The dairy owners think I'm some kind of magic, as they've not lost a single doe in birthing since I starting working here, but really it's been a lot of luck and experience. Breeding goats is not for the faint of heart!   This is not terribly uncommon in Nigerians (the prolapsed vagina) especially in older does or does that are carrying multiples.  This was ""Lily"" - she was a very small stout girl carrying triplets, and my first experience with prolapsing.  Picture  Lily  You are correct to keep an eye on it, but in the majority of these cases, there are few if any complications and the doe kids out without an issue. Lily kidded the morning after that picture was taken, all by herself (sneaky girl) with healthy triplets.   If it protrudes more, or remains protruded when the doe stands, you can press wet sugar against it and a warm damn cloth - this helps with any type of prolapse.  I have a couple of videos of does kidding I would be happy to share - if you're anything like me, there is never a limit to the amount of education and research to search for and enjoy!"

goats,28xkl9,Epona142,2,Tue Jun 24 03:06:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah this tends to happen with single babies. They nurse off one side and the other becomes engorged, stretching out the shape of the teat. Unsightly, but as long as there is no discomfort, heat, hardness, or extreme tightness to it, there is no true harm.  If you want to keep her as even as possible, milk her at least once a day. Completely milk her out, bumping and massaging the udder to get every last drop. This will keep her in production.  If you do not wish to milk, you can let her be, and she will likely dry up on one side, which is unsightly but not a big deal."
goats,28xkl9,BiphTheNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 24 05:06:22 2014 UTC,"I used to work at a petting zoo. This was fairly common when a doe had one baby. We would milk the big side a little bit once or twice a day for a week or two to ease the discomfort a little. Unfortunately, the more you milk, the more milk they make, so we weaned them off of this over the 1-2 weeks. That being said, I'm far from a goat professional and you might want to consult your vet."

goats,28ueo1,ControlledJibe,1 point,Wed Jun 25 14:53:23 2014 UTC,"So sweet!!  I'm (not so) patiently awaiting our Nigerian Dwarf doe to give birth.  Her due date is tomorrow, but likely has triplets or quads, so we're expecting her to go into labor any minute (literally, I'm listening to the baby monitor in her stall now!).  It's our first goat delivery experience and we're thrilled, but pretty nervous at the same time.  Did your Nubian deliver smoothly? Hopefully all goes smoothly and we just get to sit back and watch the miracle of birth! - Katie"
goats,28ueo1,ControlledJibe,1 point,Wed Jun 25 15:24:19 2014 UTC,"I anxiously await your cute baby goat pictures on r/goats! We had 9 does deliver this year - 6 sets of triplets (our first triplets in the three years we've been doing this.) Almost all went smoothly. River here was born with some physical issues, but she's improving daily. And we had one from a set of triplets that didn't survive past the first night. (Lesson learned from that: if a baby isn't up and about within 15-20 minutes, take a temperature. If it's low, get the kid in a warm bath right away. Doing that sooner might have saved her, although it's also possible she had other health issues.) Good luck!"

goats,28r3xy,big_onion,6,Sun Jun 22 02:30:07 2014 UTC,"They cannot be Saanen because Saanen are white in color. There are, however, ""colored"" Saanens, called Sables. It's rather complicated, that whole thing...  Anyhow, those are most likely Toggenburg or Toggenburg crosses.   To be honest, with the price of goat meat soaring into the sky, the kind of goats that are free are generally ones you want to be wary of. Be sure to watch for any lumps (CL which can get into your soil and stay and is also contageious to humans) and if you plan on breeding, you'd want to test for CAE.  But awesome stuff does sometimes fall from the sky, too! :D"
goats,28r3xy,kziv,3,Sun Jun 22 03:19:49 2014 UTC,"Seconding testing for CAE. We learned the hard way with that. If you'll be using then as nannies, especially."
goats,28r3xy,Dalebssr,1 point,Sun Jun 22 14:15:54 2014 UTC,I raised Sables until recently. I got rid of them because no one had heard of the breed around here (FL) and then ADGA changed the rules about which goats qualify.  Otherwise they were exactly like Saanens but colored anywhere between Alpine to Togg.

goats,280mbk,nk7,2,Fri Jun 13 01:50:58 2014 UTC,"This is called precocious udder, and isn't that uncommon.  Is it coming in uneven? If so, then the fluid within needs to be tested for staph - a typical sign of staph infection within the udder is an uneven precocious udder.  Is it soft or hard? Soft is good, hard is bad. So is heat in the udder - it shouldn't feel hot to the touch, merely warm like any other part of the goat.   If it it just a plain precocious udder, I would just let it be. We get them from time to time here at the dairy - in fact we have an old girl about the same age as yours with one. She has not been bred in two years, but since we all love her and she is enjoying a good retirement, she still comes into the dairy to get a little bit of grain.  This has encouraged her to bag up and even produce milk, but we just let it be."

goats,27sqpy,J973,6,Tue Jun 10 16:43:07 2014 UTC,"I'm very sorry to hear this.  I personally don't think you're out of line, but if the breeder chooses not to compensate you in some way, there is nothing you can do. An expensive learning experience - ask to visually see CAE- testing results from now on. Any good breeder should be more than happy to show you!  I'll share a similar story: We allowed a handful of goats from an elderly lady and friend to come to our dairy, so that they could be milked and cared for. All of the goats were tested beforehand. Later she brought us another doe after she kidded, and we stupidly assumed the doe was also CAE- like the rest.  We contaminated an entire crop of kids with her milk. It was a devastating experience. When we tested and discovered that the majority of our now yearlings as well as that one doe were CAE+ it was like a kick in the gut.  We culled the entire lot right away, some of which were just the sweetest most beautiful girls. We contacted several buyers and refunded their money and allowed them to decide what to do with the contaminated does they now own. It was a several thousand dollar mistake.   I'm very sad that this breeder is not doing right by you - as a breeder I can't imagine not compensating you somehow. Even if I didn't have the extra cash, giving you a free (TESTED!) goat would be at the top of my list.  An expensive learning experience for us, and looks like you're in the same boat, just on the other side.   What breeds do you keep? If you are in Texas or willing to travel, I will hook you up with a free registered Nigerian Dwarf or La Mancha bottle kid next kidding season. We also often have F1 Mini-Manchas and might have quite a few this coming year - trying to convince the dairy owners to breed for them, as they are getting very popular."
goats,27sqpy,Epona142,3,Tue Jun 10 17:59:16 2014 UTC,"I'm looking into raising dairy goats for myself, and am trying to learn more about it before I spend the money.   What is CAE? How does it spread and how does it affect the milk? Is this a common issue with goats?"
goats,27sqpy,Abstker,2,Wed Jun 11 02:02:46 2014 UTC,"Now there's a loaded question!  Here's an excellent article (in fact this entire website is full of awesome information) about it: http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articles2/CAE.html  It is spread through bodily fluids, most commonly colostrum and milk. It only affects goats - drinking the milk of a CAE+ doe will not harm you.  It is, sadly, a fairly common issue. One that could be stamped out if more people tested every year and culled CAE+ goats, as well as practiced prevention.   That being said, some 80% of CAE+ goats never show a single sign of the disease and live long full lives. However, the 10% that do can be very sad."
goats,27sqpy,Epona142,3,Wed Jun 11 02:26:53 2014 UTC,"I bought a couple of ADGA registered Sable does from the one person within a few hundred miles who has that breed and after a couple years of health issues I figured out that the bad plague of worms that the previous owner's herd had left these does with some permanent intestinal damage so that they couldn't really put on weight easily and were effectively malnourished. I just sold my herd to a livestock dealer who will resell them for meat, at a fraction of the cost that they're worth as registered dairy goats.   Sadly, while I agree it would be a nice gesture, it's caveat emptor in the livestock world. And either way, I wouldn't accept another goat from the person I dealt with previously because I just don't trust them."

If yes, it will be goat food in a heartbeat. 1500m2 isn't very big and I would really recommend a miniature breed or you are going to be supplementing all their feed as soon as they over graze your field like crazy. Even with a miniature, depending on pasture quality, I wouldn't run more than 2-3 goats or you are going to have long term pasture issues."

goats,25dst1,supersmashhoe,9,Mon May 12 19:19:26 2014 UTC,"Better fences. I don't care how good your fences are, you are going to need better. Someone once told me the way to test your fences to make sure they will keep a goat in is to take a glass of water and throw it at the fence, if any of the water goes through, you need a better fence! All joking aside, unless you have high, tight fences, consider running electric fencing. Works like a charm.   Check your property for any toxic plants. Generally the goats will avoid eating anything bad for them, but as someone who just lost the world's sweetest little boy because of a tiny chunk of elephant ear trunk, trust me when I say it's worth the time to check what you have growing.   Try to find a local vet who is familiar with goats for emergencies.   As far as supplies, you will need two or three types of wormer. We use cydectin, panacur, prohibit, and strongid in rotation, but only when needed. Activated charcoal is good to have on hand if they do ingest something toxic."

goats,24tnkw,SWATyouTalkinAbout,8,Tue May 6 00:41:41 2014 UTC,Don't! You need to wait until the kids are born. That first day or so of milk is colostrum and the babies need it to survive. Milk after they are born.
goats,24tnkw,var23,1 point,Tue May 6 01:20:11 2014 UTC,"Gotcha! We're already planning to ask the owners of the farm where we bought the goats on how to take care of them when they're pregnant, I just could've sworn they said that they start milking bbefore the kids are born. But if what you said is true, then we won't so much as touch her until the kids have drank for AT LEAST the first day."
goats,24tnkw,Dalebssr,3,Tue May 6 05:01:39 2014 UTC,"I would wait until after the first week.  The kid will need the colostrum and the doe can produce this for up to a week.  Be sure to feed her some good grain as it will keep milk production up.  If this is the doe's fist kid, it would be a good idea to keep an eye on her when kidding starts.  An in-experienced mother has a higher chance of abandoning her kid.  If she does, you'll have to step in and be a surrogate.     I too, would also recommend doing as much research as possible.  You never really stop learning about goats.  There are so many little things that go wrong that can turn into a serious situation if you are not aware of what's going on."
goats,24tnkw,var23,1 point,Tue May 6 13:51:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah it's her first kid, so we may even end up taking her to the farm to get the guidance of the people we bought her from."
goats,24tnkw,Epona142,5,Tue May 6 16:24:07 2014 UTC,Please do some basic research on care and what to expect with pregnancy of a goat. It's life and it's kids lives are in your hands. You're asking for trouble and unnecessary pain and suffering if you've not got some basic knowledge on what to expect. Reddit is a poor place for this. There are hundreds of good sites devoted to goat care. Google is your friend.
goats,24tnkw,Epona142,3,Tue May 6 01:30:16 2014 UTC,"As you've been told, do not milk a doe before she kids. I hope you dipped her teats with a proper solution afterward.  By milking her, you removed her wax plugs and opened her teat up to potential mastitis and infection. When a kid nurses, their saliva seals the orifice, and when you milk, you always dip the teats in a teat dip afterward for the same reason.  If she has a good udder and full teats, I expect you will have kids fairly soon, although without seeing her in person, I cannot narrow it down. You'll want to look for posty back legs, the tail ligaments to loosen to mush, her vulva to elongate, and the udder to become tight with milk.  Check out this link (and entire website): https://fiascofarm.com/goats/prenatalcare.html  Once the kids are born, they will nurse the colostrum. We begin separating kids at night when they are two weeks old (we are an unusual dairy as we do dam raise) and milking the dams out in the morning. We also milk in the evenings, just to ensure their milk production stays at it's full potential, and many of our does produce far more milk than their kids can drink.  I agree with var; you should do a lot more research and hopefully find a local goat breeder to mentor you. There are a hundred and ten things that can go wrong with not just the kidding itself, but the health of the doe before and after, as well as the health of the kids.  Goats are extremely complicated animals who are very challenging to raise and keep at their optimum. Anytime a person claims that raising and breeding goats is easy, it's a very big sign to me that they are not doing it right!"

goats,24q1fu,Dizzypagan,6,Sun May 4 21:33:25 2014 UTC,"It's normal to only have two teats, not four. I have never seen this on a goat before; however it might not actually be a huge problem in terms of feeding her kids in the future. It would probably all depend on how her udders grow...The smaller nipples might just be like extra skin tags. I'd probably have my vet look at the doeling though."
goats,24q1fu,kelly_andthecheese,6,Sun May 4 23:43:57 2014 UTC,"Two is normal. I had a doe with 3 teets at one point. She got mastitis every time I bred her. Stopped breeding her, and no more issues. My vet said it was likely because she had a partial mammary to go with the extra teet, but the teet was unproductive.  As far as conformation goes, extra teets are disqualifying faults."
goats,24q1fu,Shearaha1,3,Mon May 5 01:28:28 2014 UTC,"This is more common than people think. We usually have a couple crop up every year. (We have a very large dairy herd.)  Boer goats and meat goats often have supernumerary teats and it's not as large of a fault.  However, in dairy goats, this is considered a very serious fault and should not be perpetuated. There is a genetic link to it.   Is this a purebred/registered doeling or a crossbred? If you paid good money for this doe and were not informed of such a serious flaw, you were, as they say, screwed.  We always check teats, and pull papers and sell doelings with supernumerary teats at a much lower price, to become pets or butchered for sustenance. They are not suitable for showing or dairy production (the extra teats interfere with the milking machine).  However, 9 times out of 10, this fault will not prevent her from nursing and being milked by hand. Mastitis will be an ongoing concern, as she has twice the chances to introduce bacteria into a teat duct. You also must weight the pros and cons of passing this on to offspring.  So sorry that your little doe has such a bad fault."
goats,24q1fu,Epona142,3,Mon May 5 04:10:47 2014 UTC,I think she's probably some kind of Nigerian cross. I bought her about 4 months ago as a tiny baby at a flea market on an impulse and bottle fed her. She's my first real goat experience. After a little research of her supposed breed I thought maybe I could use her for milking when she was older. Regardless she's a cherished family pet. :)
goats,24q1fu,Epona142,4,Mon May 5 04:26:47 2014 UTC,"Ah yes I remember now! I tend to not notice user names when I'm looking at posts. :)  You could certainly breed her and milk her, though it may take an interesting technique with teats like that, and I agree with you, after looking at her pictures again, that she is a Nigerian Dwarf cross."
goats,24q1fu,Epona142,2,Mon May 5 05:39:54 2014 UTC,That's good to know. I wouldn't breed her more than a couple times and any babies would be whethered and new homes screened or just kept by us. It would just be so much fun to watch her grow up and then get to have baby Clovers later. :)

goats,24ific,JHagedorn0125,6,Fri May 2 02:45:49 2014 UTC,"As someone who works at a licensed goat dairy, I agree with this article.  Babies should not be fed raw undiluted goat's milk. While raw milk can be completely safe for adults when produced in a dairy that is very strict about cleanliness and proper handling, the risks are still there. Raw milk can easily carry bacteria and infections.  We test for Tuberculosis and Brucellosis, as well as goat diseases such as CAE, CL, and Johnes. We are extremely strict about our cleanliness, with a very rigid standard in place. Just tonight I disposed of 32lbs of milk because one doe had a scratched teat with blood on it that I didn't see until after I was done milking her. We never take any risks of contamination.   Our milk is chilled to the proper temperature and never allowed to be in an open container. It's strained twice, once while going into the container during milker, and again when transferred to the chiller.  And yet we still pasteurize before making cheese, unless we are making a cheese that will be aged for more than 90 days.   While we gladly and happily drink raw milk, I would not be comfortable feeding it to any infant, and that is even with our strict standards.  Goats produce milk that is formulated for kids, not children. The protein levels are high to ensure kids that grow quickly and are able to escape predators. Human milk is meant to grow not just the body, but the brain as well.   That isn't to say goat's milk isn't awesome, and can't be used in formulas with great success. I have used goat's milk to raise many other orphan animals as well, as it's digestibility just can't be beat.  But this is one of those cases where a movement (eg the ""Raw Milk Movement"") can hurt itself by not also recognizing the possible negatives. They spend so much time lauding the great aspects of raw milk that they forget to warn people just how important the handling of raw milk is, and what can happen if it's handled improperly, or comes from a source that isn't very strict in not only cleanliness, but testing of the dairy animals.  Everything has it's pros and cons, and in the end, we all have a personal responsibility to do our own research and decide for ourselves. Sadly, personal responsibility is harder and harder to come by these days, which is why the laws on dairy products have become so strict, in an effort to protect people from themselves."

goats,24b56h,msfrance,1 point,Wed Apr 30 15:18:51 2014 UTC,I've been trying to find it again since it was for last year. I was so sad when the year ended haha
goats,24b56h,alittletooquiet,3,Tue Apr 29 23:04:34 2014 UTC,You can find them on Amazon. I get one every year.
goats,24b56h,Dalebssr,3,Wed Apr 30 00:43:02 2014 UTC,"Yes, yes it is.  These little... goats will climb trees, cars, fences, houses, basically anything that can hold their weight.  I put a T-post across two saw horses, just to see what would happen.  The kids tight-roped it from one side to another."
