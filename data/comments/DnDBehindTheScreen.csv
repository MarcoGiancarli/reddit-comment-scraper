DnDBehindTheScreen,3e2uro,micka190,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:06 2015 UTC,"For negative effects, you could use the Mixing Potions table or Scroll Mishaps table in the DMG. I came up with some alchemical and scroll scribing mishaps in this supplement, though they are all negative effects.  Scaling it to 100 souls is a lot of bookkeeping. I might try something simpler. Make a random table of effects 1-30. Put the worst/most negative effects at the bottom and the best effects at the top. Roll 1d20 + number souls consumed that day, with a maximum bonus of +10.  Here's my rationale:   You could have 10 negative effects (result 1-10), 10 neutral to modestly positive effects (11-20), and 10 very good/excellent effects (21-30). The very best few effects would only be achieved on days when the soul-eating rock has feasted on many souls. The very worst effects would only happen when there aren't many souls to eat.   Incomplete partial table (without flavor, without proper durations on effects):   3d6 necrotic damage and two levels of exhaustion. 2d6 necrotic damage and one level of exhaustion. 2d6 necrotic damage and diseased (poisoned until cured). Disadvantage on Con saves. Disadvantage on Dex saves. Disadvantage on Wis saves. Disadvantage on Str ability checks. Disadvantage on Dex ability checks. Disadvantage on Wis ability checks. Disadvantage on Int ability checks. Advantage on Str (Athletics) checks. Advantage on Dex (Acrobatics) checks. Advantage on Int (Investigation) checks. Advantage on Wis (Insight) checks. ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? Cast cure wounds once before next long rest without expending a spell slot. Cast inflict wounds once before next long rest without expending a spell slot. Cast bless once before next long rest without expending a spell slot. Advantage on melee weapon attacks. Advantage on ranged weapon attacks. Advantage on weapon and spell attacks. Gain a spell slot of the highest level for which you have a spell slot.   ...you get the idea (and the exact effects and flavor of them, obviously would need to a little more thought than this).  Update: I just re-read your post... the damage is way too high for 1st-level, but you could maybe have the stone's effects scale with level in some ways ... dealing 1d6 damage per character level, spells cast without spell slot are cast at that characters maximum spell slot level. Something like that."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3e2uro,OrkishBlade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was going for a table that would scale every ten souls. Like, between 1 and 10 souls, you have ""Effects list A"" that could be 3-5 effects, then from 11-20 you could have ""Effects list B"" that could be another 3-5 effects, and so on. I do like the idea of the potion mixing table and using some of the spells from the corresponding tables (i.e. 1-10 souls = Level 1 spells, etc.)"

The target takes an additional 1d4 necrotic damage. The souls lash out at you in vengance. Make a DC10 wisdom saving throw. Player takes 1d4 +1 psycic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Chaotic energy bursts from the stone, transforming the nearest object not being held into a small chunk of silver. (DM sets value) The stone glows a brilliant red as it drains the wearers strength. Player looses 1d6 strength and has disadvantage on althetics checks until they finish a long rest. A small burst of energy from the stone turns the skin of the user pale, virtually translucent. Vains and muscle can be clearly seen, causing obvious social issues. The stone glows a soft red as it empowers a random creature within 30ft. That creature gain +2 to all stats and has advantage on perception rolls for 1d6 hours.    For things like this I like to make the effects fleeting. Also, in what situations do you think the player will be using the stone? Is it more likely to be called upon in the heat of battle or during down time? Setting the effects of the stone can sway the player to use them a specific times."

I understand WHY you'd like to keep them from self-stabilizing but when I have all these options not healing myself seems like a fake obstacle you're throwing up.  You're already taking away a limitation that would normally be imposed by being knocked below 0 by allowing possible actions why stop the one that is by instinct the most important and useful?  I'd modify this as follows:  -a first success keeps you up but if you are taken down again before your next turn you are on your 2nd death save.  And this can only happen once per long rest.  -movement for last stand has to be crawling  -after an attack or spell cast last stand action you fall prone and receive 1 failed death save from the exertion   -You may attempt to buy yourself some time/luck by using a stabilizing cantrip, object, or skill.  You are however only partially successful in your efforts and you gain advantage on your following deaths saves provided you don't fail another or take any more damage."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3e15ul,WickThePriest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't like the non-healing option either. But I have to impose that restriction, otherwise it becomes too easy to stabilize and nobody will do any heroic Last Stand actions.   If healing is an option, everyone will save just one health potion, just one healing kit, or they will all take Magic Initiate Initiate for Spare the Dying. The risk disappears and a mechanic designed to increase the stakes and be a hero suddenly becomes a Get Out of Jail Free Card and death saves become meaningless.   If this was a low-magic campaign, I would make that change and the risk would remain. It kills me, but I think I have to make that call and rule that self healing is not allowed. My players will understand the intent. They're cool like that."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3e15ul,HomicidalHotdog,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"As much as I like it in theory, I have to agree with /u/WickThePriest : The object-restriction makes no sense. If they have a potion on their belt it would be easier to drink that than make a weapon attack or do an Acrobatics check to jump over a pit. I get that letting them heal could seem OP, but I like my mechanics and my fluff to make sense together by reflecting each other.  I also think the idea from /u/WickThePriest of granting advantage on death saves is also a really good option. It brings the odds from 55% to 80% of making those saves at the cost of using an action and resource healing. Just scraping by is more fun than dying anyway. It is elegant and uses the 5e advantage core mechanic. You could just use your rules plus the option that healing attempts grant advantage on future death saves.  Consider the movie Crank. IIRC the main character injects himself with adrenaline, which basically acts like a healing potion, or at least temporary HP. So here is my inelegant but also simple option to consider: Drinking a healing potion as a Last Stand restores HP, but the character still has to make death saves. It could be fluffed that they try to drink the potion, but cough part of it up because they are dying. It grants them enough energy to act normally, but on each turn they still make death saves normally: after three failures they die-die; after three successes, they fall unconscious. If they get reduced below zero HP again they take a failed save and that's it for them, no more Last Stand actions, only death saves. Maybe if they drink a second healing potion on a subsequent turn it works normally; the balance is that it costs them two actions to do and two potions so it is an ""expensive"" way to prevent death, plus they are likely to get hit after drinking the first one anyway. It would not be a Get Out Of Jail Free Card, it would be a bribe-death-with-resources-and-maybe-get-lucky card.    I love your idea as a start, but I think it needs some work. I am not saying either of our solutions is perfect, and they would need thorough thought and playtesting. You have a really awesome start with the concept, though."

My campaign has a steampunk theme to it and all the Health Potions will be in the form of hypodermic injections (Bioshock style). Taking a shot on the doors of death makes a great cinematic image.   Brainstorming here, feel free to jump in.  Perhaps the healing hypoderms don't act fast enough to prevent you from bleeding out. However, players can find/purchase/steal adrenaline hypoderms and use them on their last stand to gain advantage on their next save.   Thoughts?"

Instead you want to ease the sin onto them until it ruins everything they touch.  First whatever blood sprayed on the gnome at the time of kill, likely drenching his hands, returns. Pass him a note saying that when he wakes up in the morning his hands are covered in blood, but when he goes to the other players with this describe to them they see nothing.  Then food starts to taste bad. Water tastes like sewage. Meat tastes rotten. Eyes from dark windows and alleys seem to stare at the gnome, but nobody else ever sees them.

If he doesn't, then he's going to deal with the realistic consequences.  Have you talked to the two players about it? I just got a new player in my campaign, and he doesn't seem to understand that by eating everyone he comes across, he's de-railing the plot.

I like Akuma_Reiten's ghost idea.  Also, I tend to be harsh with my paladin's and murder (because that is what it was, murder. Unarmed, not evil civilian defending his family from Kobolds who's wife fell unconscious doing the same).  Paladin would immediately lose all abilities without atonement. This is in the heat of a dragon attack, there aren't many priests around."

Your suggestion of rebirth at the Temple of Chauntea is very nice, and a good road to redemption with a lot of flavor and a nice little hook to tie your paladin PC to the storyline.  That said, you will need cooperation on behalf of your PCs.  To not hesitate to smite them righteously if they do something as stupid as a Paladin killing innoncents."

I mean, if this is a good aligned Paladin and the husband was doing nothing wrong, and they just did it because they felt like it, that's a talk to the player and see if they even want to play a paladin type thing. There are certainly ways for a Paladin to kill someone, even an unarmed person, because they believe in the greater good, or because they were previously fighting the person, etc., that might be interesting RPing opportunities with the Paladin having to come to terms with potentially violating their oath, but brutally murdering a random civilian for no apparent reason and then lying about it (if that's what happened) is way beyond that to me, and would pretty much be an immediate turn to evil and losing of all abilities with me asking the player if they prefer to roll a different character.

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dy56b,TinCanKing,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"Man, if I were the DM, that Paladin better have an incredible reason why he just slaughtered an innocent, unarmed, and injured man. If not, I would've dropped the Holy F-Bomb on him right there and then, stripped him of his Paladin powers, and actually gone so far as to make him re-class as a Fighter (as it was in the olden days). I get murderhobo-ism for some characters (my Lawful Evil Cleric of Death strays towards it sometimes), but a Paladin? Those guys are normally the bastions of good AGAINST murderhobos. So, definitely strip him of his powers, I am all for that.  As for fixing the general murderhobo issue, there are a few approaches. First is to put an incredibly powerful, good-aligned being in their way who just acts like a total asshole to the murderhobos. Then, when they try to kill him, the guy turns out to be a Solar and he just Flamestrikes the lot of them. But that's a bit mean, so we'll tone it down a bit.       So, here's some more reasonable options: * The HotDQ adventure makes liberal use of good-aligned organizations and characters to be supporters of the party. Several parts of the campaign depend on support from these organizations. If your party really gets into the murderhobo lifestyle, have these organizations withdraw, quite openly, from the party's side. Hopefully that'll be a good way to tell them ""stop being a bunch of asshole murderhobos"" without you literally pausing the game and telling them ""stop being a bunch of asshole murderhobos.""     As others have suggested, have their evil deeds catch up with them. Strip the paladin of his powers (as stated above) or just have people not trust the party. Word gets 'round, you know? And no matter how good the Persuasion roll is at the time, eventually those kids are gonna get through to the mother that the paladin murdered her husband.   Or, to make it simple, have the characters face trial, as you suggested. Except, instead of them stringing up the offending Paladin and Cleric, have them move towards stringing up the entire party. One major source of murderhobo behavior is the lack of controls set by the other party members (which may not be the case here, but still). Plus, having the entire party face execution sounds exciting and fun.   Last suggestion: just listen to u/egamma. Revenants solve everything."

Then. the most brash of the children, youngest oldest whatever, refuses to buy his mothers explanation that the bandits killed the husband (the dad), having witnessed the PCs do it.   So some time goes by, duration up to you, and, sick of his mother not listening to him and his siblings not backing him up, he makes a plea for vengeance for the injustice of his father's murder. ( could be something along the lines of praying at a specific temple, praying by his bedside, or just angrily shouting in the woods, really whatever you decide) This plea could be answered by a devil, with whom the boy trades his pure soul (not knowing what that entails) for the devil (daemon, demon) to extract vengeance on the party. Alternates to the dark pact could be a good aligned god taking pity, or some powerful undead ""intercepting"" his plea and possibly possessing the boy. Or it could just be a guard overhearing him and deciding that the party is worth interrogating, so he puts in a word with his seniors and bam, a bounty is out for the capture (alive) of the PC supposedly responsible for his father's murder. Or word gets around to the party that the town is looking for them in relation to a death.  Now, this is where it is entirely up to you. Is the party now being hunted by a possessed child, creepily showing up when it is least convenient, harrying the party's every move? Is the word getting out that the PCs are wanted for questioning by a town guard? Or has a powerful devil taken interest and sent his minions to bring the PCs to him? My favorite of all the possibilities is the good aligned god taking pity and giving word to a pair of holy warriors (a paladin and a cleric) that there are powerful individuals who need redemption."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dy56b,Minecraftshenanigans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"The Paladin absolutely loses his status (Assuming they are a Paladin of a good religion). There is very little a Paladin can do after an outright act of murder to regain their status, what you should do is give the Paladin a chance at redemption IF and only if they are willing to die to earn that redemption. Obviously the twist is that they don't really die permenantly, the God resurrects them as a reward for the sacrifice. I would suggest that the Paladin has to die saving the children.  Edit: When offered this chance by an avatar of his God if even for a micro second he does anything other than grovel on his belly like a worm he is instantly destroyed and cast down. NEVER to return."

Too much of the game now assumes the use of those powers as part of just functioning every day.  tl;dr for the remaining text is at the end of the post.  First, determine if this is a player problem or a character problem. If it's a player problem... wait for the megathread. :P  If it's a character problem?   The short version is that Greenest would oust them. Basically pay them off for the service/damage they did, just out of fear of the murderhoeboes. No one would ask them to help find or rout the camp. None of the organizations, even the Zhent, would give them the time of day.  They just blew all their introductory plot hooks right there. They don't get to participate in hunting down the Cult of the Dragon, or helping to thwart whatever it is they're achieving.  So, if it's a character problem, they're going to have to find some adventures of their own from here on out, because they sure won't be getting employed anywhere along the Sword Coast. Anyone who was within a mile of Greenest will have heard of what happened, since the refugees will caravan north up toward Baldur's Gate and Daggerford.  They need to head south, towards Amn, or Calimshan, where people don't really give two shakes how brutal you are. Maybe jump the continent and head to Chult or Maztica.  tl;ldr - They screwed themselves out of being heroes, or even playing in the mod. Reboot, retcon, or just put the book down, and tell them to find their own way."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dy56b,forgotaltpwatwork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:54:27 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with just telling the players not to have their characters be psychopaths. In fact that is probably the easiest and most straight forward solution.   In my experience players who do this are metagaming the system for cheap laughs. If they wanted to play serial killers the least they could do is plan out their crime and perform it without a hitch. At least then it would interesting and perhaps fun to DM.

DnDBehindTheScreen,3e0izv,famoushippopotamus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:55 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on the assassinate were that the Rogue based ones would use melee weapons, in that way it gives an edge to one hit before the creature bolts.

I have a few nit picks.  Why do rogues have the Nature's Mask and Dhukau Senses features delayed compared to the other classes?  I don't see a balance reason and frankly I don't see a fluff reason either.  Why do all three classes get Honed Skills at different levels?  And another question, why does it seem like rangers get something incredibly good here and rogues get screwed over?  An extra fighting style as well as the Colossus Slayer feature can give the ranger some serious extra hurt compared to the rogue, who not only gets his feature delayed, but also gets a weaker upgrade.  Do you just not like rogues or something?  I'm confused by this bit right here:   ""...you gain proficiency in Stealth, if you already have this you can gain procifiency in Survival, Nature, or Perception.""   Why do you have to get stealth?  Why not just give the option of all four skills?  Aside from that the archetype seems fairly underwhelming.  Waiting 15/17 levels just to be able to cast a few spells once a day (a few of which a ranger at least might already have at that point!) is disappointing.  Nature's Mask is a rather nifty feature though and I do like the idea.    edit: I will say I do like the idea of a multi-class encompassing archetype.  I think it could be implemented a bit better though."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3e0izv,wuz_lee,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:30 2015 UTC,"All good points, I'll have to look it back over.   I based the levels off of when they classes get archetype features regularly. Good point to make them consistent. I don't hate Rogues, although it does look like that. :P  And you're right, I just noticed they're on the ranger spell list. I took some utility spells that would help hunting and went with those."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3e0izv,wuz_lee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"By the way thanks! I'm thinking giving colossus slayer to Rogues as well or a fighting style, something to bring it back up to the others strength wise.   I think Stealth should be mandatory, and didn't want to stiff those that already had it. Any ideas?   I'm going to go with the feature levels as 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th. That way it addresses the issue of Rogues getting a short stick.   Any ideas to improve Dhukau senses? I'm drawing a blank for some reason."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3e0izv,famoushippopotamus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"I think if you just gave Rogues colossus slayer it'd make fighter fall a bit behind although not by much.  In the end though I think it's hard finding enough features that fit both the fluff of the classes and the fluff of the archetype and even harder to find a way to balance it without basically giving each class the exact same thing.  As far as that goes, I can't think of a solution right of the top of my head.  While you may think stealth may be manditory, the DEX requirement and the fluff hints towards the fact that this is a more stealth oriented archetype and fighter is the only class out of the 3 that already doesn't have stealth in their class list.  Chances are if you're playing ranger or rogue, you grabbed stealth, and some fighters may get stealth via a feat.  Even if they don't have it, they'll get it at this point likely anyways even if they had the choice for the other skills since they already have perception and survival in their skill list too.  Alternatively you could just give them stealth and a choice of one other.  One way to improve Dhukau Senses is to allow it to be cast more than once a day.  I think a better solution would to just make them be able to choose three spells from the Ranger list up to a certain level (probably 3), that way Rangers can dodge getting the same spell twice."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dza1n,Crossfiyah,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"Nothing major; this should work well enough as written.  Obviously, you will need to either still include base enhancement items (and I'd tack on stuff like the Armbands or Elven Chain Shirts) or create a progression that lets you increase the numbers without having to find new magic items every couple weeks.  Also: I'd try to make gems that can fit in either weapons or armor, but have different (related) properties depending on where they're used. For instance, a basic flame gem might convert weapon damage to fire damage if put into a weapon, but will grant fire resistance if installed into armor.   You'll need to work out the interactions between gems on a case-by-case basis.  BTW, why roll percentage instead of a d20 if everything is in 5% increments?"

That would make for more powerful characters than average.  It doesn't stop players from crafting optimal items because they're still getting residuum 90% of the time. If they ever hit the edge case where residuum is more important than the gem, they can vendor the gem for its residuum price (1/5 the item's cost) and buy their next item with gold."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dwaxy,WeaponsofPeace,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for commenting! That's the type of discussion I wanted to spring.  My reasoning behind putting Cunning Initiative at lv10 is the following:   3rd Level in a class is when your character should have all the very flavorful and unique features. Always-prepared-to-fight didn't seem to me like a thematic inquisitor thingy so it could wait :D ! Powerspike repartition. Lvl3 is already a pretty big deal. Bonus to initiative is a potent thing, especially early on.  The two other classes getting a bonus to their initiative is Barbarian at lv7 (advantage on the roll) and Bard (lv2, Jack of All Trades applying to ""any ability check""). It seemed to me a ""5e thing"" not to increase characters' initiative too much, maybe considering the Alert feat.   Now I agree that as a 10th level feature it might feel a bit weak, but tbh so would Track Heresy at this point, and the class already has pretty cool features to play with at 10th.  I don't know if you were implying giving Sneak Attack to the class, but that would be a big no-no to me :b Taking an unique rogue mechanic wouldn't feel right, especially since Trickery Inquisitors already gets Thieves' tools proficiency at 7th. I learned not to steal from thieves and thugs."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dwaxy,WeaponsofPeace,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"3rd Level in a class is when your character should have all the very flavorful and unique features. Always-prepared-to-fight didn't seem to me like a thematic inquisitor thingy so it could wait :D !    to me it always seemed that that usually came with the selection of domain/path/archetype etc. more than a specific level. I like that level 3 gives you out of combat utility and flavor here especially since much of the non-domain class features are fairly combat heavy.   Powerspike repartition. Lvl3 is already a pretty big deal. Bonus to initiative is a potent thing, especially early on.   I agree that the features granted at level 3 are very good. I do not agree though that the bonus to initiative is as strong as I think you think it is. Going first has inherent advantages but the longer a battle goes the less important it tends to be.     The two other classes getting a bonus to their initiative is Barbarian at lv7 (advantage on the roll) and Bard (lv2, Jack of All Trades applying to ""any ability check""). It seemed to me a ""5e thing"" not to increase characters' initiative too much, maybe considering the Alert feat.   A barbarian gets this because of it's natural reckless abandon. A bard is the best at being above average thematically so I guess that's why they get it. I feel like the Inquisitor gets it because of its innate decisiveness when it comes to right and wrong. He/she is compelled to jump into battle.   Now I agree that as a 10th level feature it might feel a bit weak, but tbh so would Track Heresy at this point, and the class already has pretty cool features to play with at 10th.   Personally I'd rather it feel weak than overbearing (It's easier to add power later than take it away from a PC using a home-brewed class).

I learned not to steal from thieves and thugs.   No not at all haha! I just listed the whole ability from the rogueish archetype.  Now on to some other questions:  Why do you feel this half-caster class in particular needs cantrips? On this note I wanted to mention is that I think this class may be having a sort of split identity:  On one hand you have ranged damage oriented cantrips and spells and on the other you have multi-attack as a core class feature.  While this allows you many decisions as far as what you want to do at a specific time it also might make your character feel as though he/she is having a conflict of interests. Does your character typically use a bow/crossbow, melee weaponry, or spells? Do you think this could be somehow built into the domains?  Edit: excuse the formatting plz :("

Come up with the details of the execution scene, such as guard locations and such, but don't plan for the players how they are going to rescue him or what the right way is.

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dvy22,dududf,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:29 2015 UTC,"Survivors intuition seems pretty weak. It's an extremely gimped half of the Outlander Wanderer feature. Knowing if a natural disaster is coming or not could be good, but a druid would already know that from paying attention to fleeing animals. Also, a druid has access to good berry so feeding 5 people is a trivial task. If this is a compensation for the powerful 10th level feature, then it perhaps could use more flavour. As is you don't know anthing about the natural disaster, merely that ""A natural Disaster is coming"" and what to do after wards. You don't know where to run, what to do to prepare, what disaster is coming e.t.c. Give that information and it'll feel much more flavourful then what you currently have. Also anyone can forage for food given enough time, and considering how weak the penalties to not eating in 5e is, it's not really a real concern for any nature crawls.  Other than that, it seems fine, only having 1 spell per catastrophe level (3rd, 4th, 7th e.t.c.) seems fine, although I hesitate to say that the 15th level one might push it over the edge in higher level games but probably not. It has enough loaded power to go without the 15th level one considering everything this subclass already has.  I would prefer that earthquake and typhoon had different bonuses however for the 10th level boon however, also the 14th level volcano ability needs to be looked at.  Remember that the resistance you get from earthquake + typhoon carries over to wildshape, effectively doubling their effective health against some of the most common damage types. This would be a power issue, as you have to consider what sacrifices are being made to add metamagic, albeit limited, to what the subclass offers. I would personally suggest dropping this, resistance to cold, fine, resistance to fire, fine, they're niche damages. But it would just all in all make wildshaping much stronger for this druid vs land, at the only cost of a few less circle spells."

I'll definitely have to re-write the Survivor's Intuition feature (it was deliberately weak, but perhaps not even flavorfully useful). And I will think about changing the resistances, my intent was not to beef up Wild Shape.  I was thinking of giving Metamagic a modest boost and walking back some of the other features, what would you think to this progression (which is still nerfed greatly from Sorcerer, but might be giving too much):    Use ""primal power points"" to fuel Metamagic (sorcery points by another name), maximum number druid level/3 (minimum 1), regain all with long rest. (Sorcerer has more points at all levels, gains more faster.) No feature to convert primal power points to spell slots and vice versa. Learn Metamagic options at levels 2, 6, and 14, and open up all Metamagic options. (Sorcerer has more Metamagic options levels 3-5, equal levels 6-9, and more 10+.)  Do away with Circle Spells as always being prepared, but add a few of spells to the druid's spell list based on category (ice wall, incendiary cloud, etc.). This avoids the questionably-unbalancing always-having-a-high-level-spell-prepared situation, doesn't step on the Circle of the Land as much, and still gives catastrophe druid a little bit of extra destructive spellcasting oomph and flavor. Rearrange/trim some of the other features."

But it's still extra hit points, and even a non-Circle of the Moon druid has a good boost to them with Wild Shape.  I think I'll change it to typed damage--acid and poison for earthquake (this may be a stretch) and lightning and thunder for typhoon. Or else change to something non-resistance, but I'll have to think on it.  I went with the latter option and updated the pdf, check it out!"

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv9ju,WonderfulStarfish,6,Sun Jul 19 20:27:16 2015 UTC,TIL that fumbles are now called critical failures and no one bothered to tell me.
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv9ju,famoushippopotamus,8,Sun Jul 19 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"Also, we changed your birthday and canceled Christmas.  I could have sworn there was a memo.  I use the phrase fumble less and less, probably because it doesn't make a lot of sense for non combat scenarios, like this one.  ""You fumble your brain.  Con save or instant death from brain hemorrhage.""  Even in combat it implies specific outcomes, usually dropping your sword in embarrassing ways like Harry Hamlin in Clash of the Titans, and I try not to discount more creative things.  Fumbles also make me think of a quirk in the Warhammer rules that meant that master assassins and eight armed alien monstrosities tended to spend combats dropping their guns and falling over as they rolled too many dice to avoid getting at least one fumble."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv9ju,techiesgoboom,2,Mon Jul 20 06:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of critical fails.  They simply don't scale with level and abilities.  Someone very learned should be less likely to critically fail.   With that said I do like scaling knowledge checks a lot.  I've seen similar systems before but I prefer something along the lines of:  If they roll 10 or more below the check they come up with a result that is flat out wrong  5 or more below the check?  They have two possible answers (one is correct and one is wrong)  They are pretty sure that the wrong answer is the truth but also have an idea that something else could possibly be the case.  Just under the check?  They equally believe both a wrong and a correct answer  Exceed the check by only 5 or less?  They are pretty confident in the right solution, but there is a possibility something else is the case.  Exceed the check by more than 5?  They are 100% confident in the correct answer.  Now if you like your scale developed you could pretty easily work those results in, but distribute them among different spectra of how close or far they were from the check."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv9ju,HauntedFrog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"This is what I do. If they fail by 10 or more, I give them incorrect information. Since I'm rolling for them on these checks, they don't know it's incorrect.

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,Kylasaurus_Rex,6,Sun Jul 19 20:02:43 2015 UTC,"This is simply much better than Hellish rebuke, especially at higher levels.  My suggestion?  Change the name of Hellish Rebuke to Feyish Rebuke and describe is as such.  There is no reason to change the mechanics.  If you simply must include the blindness mechanic change the level of the spell to 2 and let them save for half damage as well.  If you want it to be a level one spell that gives blindness then it shouldn't damage at all."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,techiesgoboom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, the scaling is my primary concern. I neglected to mention above that it would be capped at 5th level.  After much consideration regarding ways to ""reflavor"" Hellish Rebuke, we found those unsatisfying. (Considered alternate damage types, considered ""what if it was still fire, but just, like... green?"") I'm posting this here to debate the way to properly balance the above proposal.   I did wonder if it should be a 2nd level spell, and I thought about making the save halve the damage. So, are you suggesting scaling it as written, thus just making it start at 2d10?  ETA: Also, I came across a 4e spell (or maybe it was homebrew? Who can even tell online anymore...) that had similar effects, but instead of blindness, it rendered the caster invisible - only to the affected creature - for the duration. I wondered if that might be a more appropriate effect, power-wise."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,techiesgoboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:52 2015 UTC,Don't cap it at 5th level.  That doesn't match any other spell so it doesn't fit.  I suggest making it a level 2 spell that deals 2d10 damage and blinds for 1 turn on a failed save.  Half-damage and no blinding on a successful save.  The damage and blindness can scale by 1d10 and 1 turn for every level over 2nd.  Here is what you need to consider.  You are combining two spells - Hellish rebuke and blindness/deafness.  Your spell needs to be worse than either one of these on it's own.  Especially keep in mind that this is a reaction spell when comparing it to the full action spell blindness/deafness.  Also consider that while blindness/deafness lasts for a minute chances are that they will save in 2-3 rounds at most.
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,techiesgoboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"All fair points. I think I got lost in the coolness of the flavor and let my player push this further than he should have.   Since we're dealing with a warlock spell here, it effectively DOES cap itself at 5th, since those are the highest slots they can get, and the level of the spell doesn't really matter once you have access to that level (which he does).  Did you have any thoughts on the edit to my last comment, re: making only the warlock invisible to the target vs actual blindness?  I do appreciate your input!"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,techiesgoboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense.  I play a lore bard in a campaign so I always look at spells with a mindset of possibly stealing them as well.  Regarding invisible to target or blinding: this is dependent on if the warlock is a bladelock or not.  If the character is up in the frontline of combat all the time and consistently targeted by enemies as he holds the line, then invisible to target is pretty similar to outright blindness and I wouldn't adjust the spell too much between the two.  Now if instead the warlock is a little more of a blaster from the back or even occasionally mixes it up in the front then you could get away with making it a lvl 1 spell with 1d10 damage and the abilitily, scaling as before.  Just make sure they can save for half damage and the ""blind"" in a single roll (and once/turn at the end of it's turns vs the ""blind"" as usual)."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,techiesgoboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"Rightfully so! While it may be accurate in this instance, it's a cop-out to say, ""well I'm only making it for this character, so it's ok if it's unbalanced because XYZ."" If it exists in the world, it's technically free game for anyone, including NPCs, multiclassers, etc. In the case of a warlock, I guess I can restrict it as being a gift from his patron (which it is) but that's no less of a cop-out.  PC is a rear blaster, with occasional jaunts to the frontline when needed."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dv6ot,Trigger93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"Oh agreed very much on the cop out point!  It's just that blind to caster is so very situational.  I'd rather go with the full blind and the second level spell if it were me.  After all, warlocks always cast at max level."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,fake_person,14,Sun Jul 19 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"One thing that I like to keep in mind is that these characters have been living in this fantasy world for tens (or hundreds) of years.  Think about the kinds of things that the characters are likely to know after living in this world for that kind of time.  If you want your players to be able to really role play their characters, it's important that they have access to this information, at least when it matters.  In practice this isn't too hard though.  The DM in my campagin send us a 12 page word doc for all of the starting information we needed along with a (not too detailed) world map.  The first 1-2 pages was some general history of the world, followed by another 1-2 pages of the current politcal situation (magic is tightly controlled, etc) and finally about 1-2 pages on how most races/classes fit into the game or differed from the norm.  These first 4-5 pages he highly encouraged all of us to read before character creation to get a good feel for the world he created and figure out from the upstart how our characters out fit into this world.  The remaining 7-8 pages were a serious of paragraphs about each of the major city-states and some of their prominent landmarks.  It wasn't important that we read this at all, although if we chose a location for our character to have grown up we could know a little bit about the area.  In practice this was a 30 minute investment on our parts as players that really helped us to learn about the world from our character's points of view and in my opinion really helped to roleplay from the get-go.  I was able to create a backstory for my half-elf bard that was heavily tied into the setting and felt a lot more invested in the character and world because of this."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,techiesgoboom,3,Sun Jul 19 19:13:23 2015 UTC,"This is what I'd give, really. I would probably speak to each player individually, and tell them the general information that their character would know. They may be from different places, and so know their way round different places and know different parts of the lore of the world. Details, however, can be left to in-game stuff. If someone needs to know something, you can ask them if they want to share the question with the group, and if they do you cna decide who would potentially know the information being sought."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,CloneTwo7,3,Sun Jul 19 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"I am highly in favor of giving everyone personalized campaign knowledge sheets/packets/booklets/encyclopedias, but those can take a while to put together and break your heart if/when they don't read them.  For a first game, I would just go with a ""Same Unless Noted"" policy.  The players will be bringing their own assumptions about the setting based on D&D, Lord of the Rings, medieval history, etc.  You only need to tell them what isn't the same as that archetypical framework.  Dwarves mine the mountains, love ale, are gruff but loyal, and have Scottish accents for reasons unknown.  These are all things the players are expecting and don't need to be brought up.  But if the Dwarves all follow a monolithic church complete with an inquisition and witch burnings, that is probably worth mentioning.  Also give them a heads up on anything that's likely to get them killed just for existing.  If elves are hated and feared, you should probably let any elf players know that from character creation, rather than waiting until they walk into a tavern and order a drink.  Finally, anything you want them to know for the campaign at large, such as story hooks woven into the history.  A complete history is more than they need up front, and can come up in play (even things the characters would know, just say ""you know that..."" and fill in the detail).  But for the start, a single paragraph is probably enough.  You've already given yourself a great opening line in ""The world is scarred with countless wars"" and then give a couple lines on the last one and it's outcome."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,Grumpy_Sage,3,Sun Jul 19 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"Write up a short doc (1-2 pages is best) with all the main things players need to know - names of major locations deities, where the game will be starting, and anything different from what's implied in the book if it will affect the game.  It's also a good idea to include table rules (no cell phones, etc) as well as house rules in this. Ideally, this should be given to players when they're invited to the game.  In addition to that: make sure all the information that isn't a carefully guarded secret is available (posting it online should be fine) but don't expect players to read the whole thing unless it's less than a page. Players will cherry-pick the stuff that interests them. I personally would let players flesh out areas that I haven't if they want too (and then I'll make sure to include those elements: the player just put a lot of extra work into telling me what they'd like to see in the game)"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,CloneTwo7,2,Sun Jul 19 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"Just tell them enough so that they know the feel for the world. Is magic outlawed? What are the gods and how important are they? And where are they going to start, and how often does racism occur. Maybe even how old the world is. Most of the time they'll assume the best. No racism, magic is allowed, gods are good. But the main thing is. You don't want to have one of your players make an elven warlock who warships tyr. Without knowing that elves are on the brink is extinction because humans want the world to be ""pure"" and that magic is outlawed because it is not considered moral, and that Tyr is part of a pantheon from another world. Things like that. Also you may want to work with each player and come up with a background so that they know as much as the world as their character does."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,Grumpy_Sage,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks. This is a great idea. I might put together ""An adventurer's guide"" to my world, with the sort of information you just mentioned.  I already have been working with each player individually to work on their character. I'm letting them (within reason) do whatever they like in their backstory, which is great because they're building half the world for me but no one else knows each other's story. I've actually told them to keep it secret, because they're going to meet during the first session so how much should they logically know about a total stranger?"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3du9z5,Andvarinaut,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"Try to show, not tell as much as possible. In my experience some players will not read a document about the setting and their eyes will glaze over if you try to describe everything before the first session begins. If something pertains to a character then you can reveal that information during character creation (the civil war might be important or tie in to a character that used to be a soldier), but anything that is not important to the current state of the world should be taught as it becomes relevant during the sessions. So for instance, if they have an audience with the king, you can give them the information that he recently took the throne after his father (a beloved ruler) died under mysterious circumstances. This information can either be given by you to the players or better yet, by an NPC talking about it. The more information you can reveal in-character, the better."

And then, what if there are other moles? This creates a lot of political intrigue.  Alternatively (and this one is my favourite), have them be the moles! They have to fake getting captured by the enemy (convincingly). Then they need to convince their captors that they're defecting. Cue tests of their will to see how far they'll go to convince the enemies that they're one of them (make them have to execute members of their true allegiance, etc.). Then, they need to work their ways up the ranks. Find ways to get information to their allies while remaining undercover. Find ways of sabotaging their enemies while keeping their trust. This can eventually lead to them getting the opportunity to assassinate an enemy leader, which leaves them with interesting choice: do we call in our true allies to crush the enemy while they're weak and in disarray? Do we usurp control of the army but keep our cover, essentially playing both sides of the conflict? Or do we simply take control, throw away old allegiances and use this army to further our own goals? The possibilites are endless!"

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dro9d,ethanGeltan,5,Sun Jul 19 05:26:42 2015 UTC,"It may be a bit overpowered, but it'd be a very tactical bow in a sense.    Stasis  This bow is made of glowing blue bones, embroidered with golden trim and has a dusty scent to it.  It lays beside a single bone arrow, designed in the same fashion as the bow.  Whenever the bow fires the matching arrow, the target hit enters a temporal lapse; they cease movement and actions for a short duration (Spell Resistance and Fortitude saves apply, numbers are unknown atm).  The glowing arrow then dissolves into dust.  Until the end of the bowman's next turn, they are frozen in time, and denied their dexterity bonuses on their AC and any related feats for the duration of the effect.  The target can only be affected by Stasis once every 24 hours.  This does not break concentration on its own, simply allowing it to resume once stasis is complete.  After the shot is fired, the bow ceases to glow for 2d4 rounds, at the end of which the arrow is returned and both resume their glow.  If the target of the effect dies while still in stasis, the arrow is immediately returned through the necromantic magics bestowed in it.    When firing arrows other than the Stasis Arrow, Stasis acts as a +1 Shortbow.    I designed this bow as a rogue's wet dream.  Ultimate scouting advantage, giving the rogue one free round of hiding/escaping/sneak attacks while allowing it to be beneficial to more than just the wielder.  The numbers would be something you'd have to figure out yourself and scale with how powerful the party is / enemies are.  Lastly, if you still think this is powerful, make it a quest!  They only find Stasis in the fortress, and the arrow is elsewhere.  Drop hints, guide them to it, and the rogue will feel like an utter badass when he unites the two pieces.    As a DM, I like making artifacts for the players to find / assemble since it gives them a drive to understand the item.  Plus, such a powerful item can easily draw the attention of a higher force and add even more to the story.  I hope you enjoy Stasis! (PS, I made that up on the fly, and may end up using it in a campaign myself.)"

Taking to 0 charges is a 1 in 20 change to lose added feature and be stuck at just a +1 weapon.  On any attack (before rolling to hit) you may opt to spend a charge.  A successful hit will cast a Silence spell centered on the target of the attack.  This silence only lasts for 1 round.  Failure to hit will not give silence, but will consume a charge."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dro9d,ariven,3,Sat Jul 18 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"Here's a bow one of my parties found while dungeon delving in a dead hero-deity's crypt. The party's archer was quite happy to have it, specially because of the versatility it gives in surprise/adverse situations (you can still fire it without arrows).    Vekkoru's Gem Bow  Longbow of +1 to hit, excellent craftsmanship, wooden (bow saves as thick metal or thick wood, whichever is best for the roll).  Gems are studded along the limbs of the bow. Gems can be set on the bow's limbs by pushing them in (this consumes the gem, and adds its gp value to the bow's gem-gp-count). If the bow's gem-gp-count ever reaches 0, it becomes an ordinary +1 longbow.  The bow was found with about 400gp of gems within it (and there were more in a satchel nearby).   If a magical arrow is show with the bow, add the +1 to hit. If an ordinary arrow is shot with the bow, 50gp is substracted from the bow's gem-gp-count, and the arrow gains +5 magical cold damage (and the usual +1 to hit). If the bow is drawn without an arrow, 100gp is substracted from the bow's gem-gp-count, and an ice arrow is formed (hits for 10 magical cold damage, and has the +1 to hit).     This campaign was magic-poor but currency-happy, if the item seems weak or the gem costs seem high.  Possible alterations could include:   Change the type of damage to another element/type. Have type of gem determine type of damage. Reduce/Increase gem consumption and/or damage."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dro9d,hamsterer,3,Sat Jul 18 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is what you're looking for since it's for a rogue, but I'm working on one I've tentatively named Siegemaster's Horns.  +1 (or higher, if needed) longbow made of some sort of animal horn. Looks and functions like a normal longbow, but when used to fire at a building/wall/fortification of some sort, the arrow deals an extra 3d10 damage to that building and ignores up to 5 points of hardness.  More in line with what many rogues might want: Cupid's Bow (can be reskinned to fit your setting's deities). +1 and once per day you can use it to ""shoot"" a target with a charm person spell instead of an arrow. Again, + bonus, per day uses, and power or even nature of the spell can be tweaked."

When you use the attuned arrow, on a hit, the arrow latches itself onto the target. When you speak the command word, the arrow drags the target back towards the bow (Str save to resist, and the arrow flies back without the target).   So the bow has a sort of infinite ammunition that has a nice little perk that can be quite interesting to abuse (dragging archers off ramparts, bringing casters to melee range etc.)"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dro9d,Sasaki-,2,Sun Jul 19 07:11:51 2015 UTC,Bow with 10 arrows. All found in a box full of blood.  The arrows never dry of blood and if fired from this +1 shortbow they have a certain effect. Blood Arrow of _____. If a creature with HP equal to twice your level or less dies with an arrow stuck inside it you ay activate this effect. While concentrating you may command an animated version of that creature for rounds equal to twice your level. It regains half its HP but loses half its AC.

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dro9d,darkmuskrat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Something I've had great success with in the past is magical arrows, rather than a magical bow.  Examples include:   Transit Arrows: provided the arrow is shot from a bow at a target or square within the bow's range, the archer and an amount of equipment no more than his carrying capacity is instantly transported to the arrow (a la Dimension Door). Lightning Arrows: as soon as the arrow strikes, a bolt of magical lightning arcs to it from the bow.  Regardless of arrow trajectory this lightning bolt takes the shortest path.  Pinning arrows: these arrows entangle a target upon a successful hit.  Can also be used as a ranged touch attack. Cupid's Arrows: these arrows behave most strangely. They become invisible as soon as they are loosed from the bow and deal no damage.  Upon striking a target, that target becomes charmed towards the archer.    The only magic bow I custom made was based off of the 3.5 spell Arrow Mind, which allows you to threaten your standard reach with a bow and negates AoO from shooting the bow.  Very nice for a closer combat archer!"

A bow that cast spells (look at things like ensnaring strike, hail of throns, hunters mark, cordon of arrows, ect the ranger spell list is good.)   To put in line with what the others are getting, i'd say an ice bow works.  So when they fire the bow the arrows magically get coated with ice adding an extra 2d4+1 dmg. Reason why I'm nerfing it is one bows already do decent damage with less risk...but two with this being a rouge their DPS would go out the door.   (1d6 , + sneak atk + elemental dmg)"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dtf2s,Melisandur,5,Sun Jul 19 07:33:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I prefer to keep the races as they are but add flavor by radically changing the cultures and sociopolitical dynamics they embody.  After a point it stops to make sense, though. Like, why do dwarfs get stonecunning when they're nomadic sailor-folk?  I'd say it's probably okay to just make up your own stuff. People are generally overly concerned with balance, I think. Having strictly-equal races in terms of power and benefits can get a bit boring.  So long as you don't go overboard with the abilities and such, and maybe provide some flavorful drawbacks, you'll probably do fine."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dtf2s,thuhnc,3,Sun Jul 19 07:52:34 2015 UTC,Give them another racial feature instead of stonecunning. Sailors might get Weather Sense or Land Sense?

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dtf2s,Super6Seven,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best way to go.  If you take a look through each of the races you will notice that in general abilities can divided into significant mechanical advantages and ribbon abilities (stuff that adds more flavor than actual serious mechanical benefits)  Now anything that falls into the serious mechanical advantages should very much stay as is.  Stuff that falls into the flavor catagory you can (and should if needed) change to fit your world.  When you are done compare your new race with your old one and ask yourself ""If I gave my players the option to pick between these two, would they significantly favor one over another?""  If the answer is no, or a well yeah but only because they love sailing; then you've done your job perfectly."

It can change all sorts of weird things in your setting that are quite fun to explore. For example in a setting I'm making you can be a 12ft tall giant, but then how do they go about their lives in a human sized city?  5e is pretty easy to balance if you know what your doing, and if your ever in doubt there's places all over reddit that can help deal with unforeseen issues."

Only through our sacrifice can Her favor be secured! Would you withhold your sons and daughters from their divine purpose and let the darkness rule? Selfish heretic!""

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dqmfd,The3rdCraigRobinson,10,Sat Jul 18 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'd look at some of the brutal Aztec pantheon for inspiration, specifically, Huitzilopochtli - one of the Aztec gods of Sun and a god of war.  And kind of a douchechill.   Followers believe the sun requires blood sacrifice/blood pacts for fuel/sustenance.  Perhaps she had to undertake some rather chaotic and or evil undertakings to attain (and retain) her position as Sun Goddess.    Why worship?  In an agrarian, medieval culture, you'd want the favor of a Sun Deity.  Because crops.  And not drought.  Or perhaps her followers live in an arid zone and the favor of a Sun God is the margin between eking out a life and a fairly unpleasant death.   Those Old Testament era tribes lived in harsh, dry climes and their gods were rather dickish.  Why evil in first place?  These things don't occur in a vacuum.  She likely doesn't see herself as evil.  The best foils/villains do not.  Maybe the deities who she displaced (or seek to displace her) demand brutality and brutal followers.  Favor?  Blood oaths, blood sacrifices, vendettas against opposing deities.  Required service/servitude against cults of Night, Cults of Death, and so on.   Non-Evil society POV?  With careful, whispered scorn, if they live nearby and are possibly threatened by them.  Or, arrogantly; likely see her followers as uneducated, savage rubes (Spanish v Aztecs). Followers likely justify their veneration of her because without her boons and blessing, they'd likely die of the elements or be destroyed by opposing forces/manifest destiny.  Positive or Negative Energy?  I'd say in terms of energy without moral consideration, Positive as the Sun's energy is largely as life-giving as it is life-taking."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dqmfd,Mikeavelli,3,Sat Jul 18 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"In these lands, there is one day a year where the light is feared more than the darkness. Yivirasana we call it or ""Yivira's day"" in common tongue.  When the sun rises on that day, its shine is just a bit paler than normal. If you stand and watch the sunrise, you will feel your skin tingling within minutes. Staying outside for any much longer after that is very unwise. Five minutes is enough time to develop a burn, a half hour is enough to develop blisters, and an hour will result in open wounds. Strangely enough, the day is no hotter than any other; the burns come not from warmth. If you leave wood out to be dried by this strange sun, it becomes ashy like charcoal. Not very useful for burning, but it makes for the best fertilizer we know of.  On this day, all the people hide in their homes. Nomads take shelter in churches. Animals are naturally drawn to caves, dens, and areas with thick underbrush in the weeks beforehand, but it isn't strange to see wounded and dead animals the day after. Not a soul can be seen wandering the streets on this day... Except for the disciples of Yivira.  On Yivirasana, the disciples of Yivira coat themselves in ceremonial oils and creams, and go out to wander the streets nude. On this day you can hear them preaching: half cries for salvation, half cries of pain. Even while hiding in my home, I can hear their stories. They talk about how greedy we are for taking the sun in for the rest of the year, but hiding away when it hurts us. They talk about how they must suffer to please Yivira. They challenge us to come out and join them, for when you are a disciple of Yivira you are immune to all pain but Yivira's. People do join them on this day.  Once when I was a child, a disciple collapsed on the outside of my front door. He cut out mid sentence, and with a loud thump he hit my front door. When I placed my ear to the door, I could hear him breathing heavily. There was a sound of footsteps as another disciple came. There was a whispered prayer that I could not make out. The sound that came afterwards I will never forget: a slash and a gurgle. I immediately pulled my ear away from the door and ran. Next morning, there was a red stain on our front step. My mother cleaned it up silently.  I know not what the disciples of Yivira do with their dead. Their burial areas are kept hidden. However, I do know that they always seem to have the largest vegetables, the freshest fruit, and the juiciest meat at their feasts. They are very secretive on how their farmers do so well."

There are going to be harsh weather phenomenons- people can't live on the coasts because of almost monthly, city obliterating storms. And, if they live too far from water, deserts dominate the landscape making for a highly inhospitable world. People live in the mountains, underground and in the rare forest belts that line the coasts and surround mountains that release life giving rivers into the local area.   Her followers are heat maddened, on the verge of dehydration and have leathery, almost black skin regardless of race. They are lunatics that barely get by in life. Her favor is granted at seemingly random- its almost as if she's completely uncaring of her followers, yet the power they have is very real.

I look at it as the Sun being oppressive, and if the proper amount of worship and sacrifices weren't made, he would turn up the heat; scorching the earth and such.

It doesn't matter what you are, where you're from, or what's in your heart.  The only thing that is good and pure is the blood, sweat, and sparks that fly when you strike steel to steel in deadly combat.   In these contests you bring the love and grace of our venerable goddess and the might of the sun she has subdued to bear against the darkness of the weak and cowardly.""  Combat is the only true decider of fate, and Yisvra long ago brought this truth to the gods above and below her.  I would have her be a fierce warrior ascended to godhood.  She only respects combat and the virtues good combatants possess because of it.  Doesn't matter if youre a warrior who would protect a child or the warrior who would slay it where it stands,  both are equal and worthy of her love.  She first fought her way to great power and dominion over an ancient empire.  She then tricked a lesser diety into manifesting on the material plane and slew it outright.   Taking its skin she disguised herself and gained entry to the divine halls of the God of Storms who was having a celestial ball.  She slayed that God and revealed herself to the host of gods as she took a seat on the throne of storms and ascended.  From there she fought those foolish enough to attack her and repelled them all from her new home turned fortress.    Ambition lead her to the foot of the benevolent Sun God where she promised to help rid the multiverse of darkness for a portion of this beings great power.  The sun god acquiesced and imbued her with the power to root out darkness and eradicate it.  Instead she vanquished the sun god in swift combat and took its throne too.    Now she controls one of the most powerful energies on the material plane but is forced to follow her divine promise until she relenquishes the sun gods power and seat or until she ends the darkness forever.  Which one do you think she chose to do?  Right.  So that's how an evil being turned into the God of Sun and Storms.  Her ruthless efficiency keeps the sun spinning and shining with the deaths of those too weak or scared to fight.  Those who cannot or will not enter combat are footholds to the darkness within all mortals.    Though her promise and position have forced her to become lawful she is most definitely evil and anyone who is tainted or could be tainted will be cleansed with her brilliance.   Her clerics are diverse but all share the same belief, weakness and cowardice are the true darkness.  When clerics meet they fight.  It can be a simple sparring til first blood, or a contest that wins the servitude of the defeated, or if they are both most zealous they might fight to the death to both fuel the eternal burning away of Darkness and the bolstering of the Victor in power and favor with the godess."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dqmfd,Janzbane,2,Sat Jul 18 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"A faction of Yivra's worshippers could easily be druids after a fashion - all plant life comes from the sun, only by the grace of her light does natures bounty abound and flourish - she sends drought and firestorms when she is displeased with our worship.   Followers ritually spend hours, days or weeks naked in the sun. Basking in her warmth. Followers consider red and inflamed skin a sign of piety. To heal such wounds by the use of magic is sinful. The wearing of hats or hoods during the daytime is blasphemous, why would you deny yourself the grace of her light!?  As worshippers wither under her stern gaze, and drink of her warmth, she drinks of their life. Captured cities see unfaithful heathens staked out naked beneath her judgemental gaze. Survivors may be converted/conscripted or spared.   High priests in her temple have large magical spheres that absorb her light during the day and project it when it is night time. The inner sanctum of such temples is always open to the sky, such that there are no secrets from her. Her blessing prevents clouds forming between the sanctum and the sun, even on the rainiest day a shaft of sunlight may be seen touching her temples, making them easy to navigate towards.  High priests gain power by spending longer and longer exposed to her gaze. Brown, wrinkled and scarred, with a short life expectancy (melanoma, cancer, cooking their brains. Priests drink water only sparingly to better commune (read dehydrated and delirious) with their lady. To suggest they are unwell or injured is anathema. They are blessed! They live in a state of divine grace!  A babe born at high noon is a blessing from Yivra. Such a babe, born in the sunlight, must be taken by the temple and never know darkness. Infused with the heat of her gaze, these children grow up naked, always bathed in her direct, or stored and re-emitted light. As their bodies burn they are hardened, strengthened and transformed into zealous instruments of her will, manipulating her divine magic and needing to wear no armour, no clothing. Their skin is tougher than the finest animal hide, their gaze blazes with her reflected light. Their touch burns with her heat. When they come of age, these noon-children begin to collect the sun's light during the day, and blaze with the strength of her light whenever there is darkness. They are the naked truth of her glory, and woe be unto those who would live in darkness."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,TheColossalThrust,20,Sat Jul 18 11:44:37 2015 UTC,"Dragons are amazing. They truly are. But the Monster Manual never quite does them justice in terms of ""what they can do"". So what you have to do as DM is create a little mechanic for this particular encounter.   I like to use sliders, as in scales that go from 1 to 10 to measure certain things on the battlefield. Sometimes it's just the willingness to fight, sometimes its the amount of enemies that dwindles down.   You can do this too, but use it for different things that the Dragon is doing. You can put one slider at 10 and label it ""City Structure"" or something of that sort. Then, everytime the dragon breath weapons, or flies over (I'm thinking Battle of the Five Armies style), talk about how he rips the roofs off of the merchant district, or breathes fire down on the main road. Then, slide the slider down to 9.   Now, as this goes down, it can represent several things.    The town's reaction to this. People can start panicking, setting up ""defenses"", running, giving up, etc. Vision obscurity. The smoke would start to build up making it harder for the PCs to see up into the sky to attack this dragon. How much longer the party has to complete their objective. This is the big one, because when fighting a dragon, the party will fail most of the time. At the point when it shows up, the encounter should switch from being about ""protecting the city"" to ""trying to minimize damage and fucking survive"".   Once the slider reaches about 5 or so, that's when the town would start to flee and give up. And once it reaches 2 or 1, the city is lost and the smoke is so thick that PCs are hacking their lungs out while they dizzily make their way to wherever.   Boom."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,DeathMcGunz,16,Sat Jul 18 13:51:41 2015 UTC,"I remember somewhere reading a great example of a multi-stage dragon encounter. Basically it suggested that you divide the dragon's health into thirds, and when the dragon hits those markers, there is a scene change of some kind.  There was an example given that went something like this: The party trek out across an ice field to get to the dragon's den. Half way across they are suddenly beset by the dragon! Slugfest ensues. Dragon smashes the ice, party struggles to stay above the freezing water. Once the party whittles down the first third of the dragon's hp, it decides ""to hell with this"" and flies back to its lair. The party gets to the lair. More fighting ensues inside.  When they knock the dragon down to its last third of hp it goes crazy and begins smashing its lair to smithereens, causing rocks to fall and stuff, while still desperately lashing out at the party."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,Sad-Crow,8,Sat Jul 18 13:08:09 2015 UTC,"Dragons are, for one, very intelligent creatures. They're not going to stick around for a fight outside that they know they can't win. They'll do a tactical retreat back to their lair where they feel like they're safe. (Now some stronger dragons might be exceptionally cocky, but they still feel pain. Maybe make them hang around longer.)  This sets up two different combat encounters for the dragon. One wherever the dragon attack happens, and one in the dragon's lair. One of the big advantages a dragon has over the adventurers is that a dragon can fly, making them far more mobile in town and cityscapes than your players. A dragon will be able to do much more damage to the town as a whole than your adventurers will be able to do to it.  Then, the dragon's lair. How is it set up? Is it just a natural cave that was eroded over time by water seeping through cracks in the rock of the cave ceiling? Is it a temple created by a group of cultists to worship this specific dragon? Is it long-forgotten, or is something maintaining the look and feel of the lair? The dragon's lair will create many different opportunities for you. If the ceiling of the dragon's lair is supported by columns, give each column a health bar, and when that health bar reaches 0, its no longer structurally sound. Every turn, roll d% to see if boulders come smashing down in the vicinity. The dragon, in its low health rage, could swat through some of the columns with ease, adding more danger to the end of the fight.  And this is just for party vs. dragon encounters. There are some occasions where I'd set up a party & metallic dragon vs. chromatic dragon, which adds in a new element. All in all, a dragon encounter is what you make it."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,thedefinitionofidiot,4,Sat Jul 18 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"One of the things I like to do with big epic monsters is to give them a battletech treatment.  I break them up into multiple parts (head, neck, arms, wings, etc...) with their own hp pools.  The players then have more than just 1 target, it's similar to fighting a group of different enemies and the players have to figure out what's more beneficial for them to attack.  The dragon is killed if the body or head is drained of hp."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,darksier,3,Sat Jul 18 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"You have some good ideas there already: populace in danger, buildings, etc. Now is just converting them into an awesome encounter.  What you have to do is pick the features you wanna add to the battlefield (in your case the civillians and buildings) and figure out how the bad guys interact with them and what is the result of said interaction, how the PC's interact with them and the results of said interaction, figure out interactions your players might want to try and working out logistic problems that may apear.  If I were to do it I would spread between 2 and 4 buildings in the map and mark around 4 areas of the map as mobs of panicking civillians (you could say that these people were down, cowering, preety much paralyzed by fear, so you don't have to move the areas around). The advantages of  marking an area as a mob instead of dropping every civillian would be that you wouldn't have to control each citizen and could have one initiative spot for each mob. That would already solve some of the problems of battles that take place in cities.  Then I would figure that the dragon could interact in two ways with the crowds: first would fly over them making them panick, second he could grab people from one crowd and drop them on the PC's heads. Now which effect would those things have? Well you could say that a panicked mob would disperse once it got to their turn (people running everywhere in panic), and everyone close to it (say 10 feet) would have to pass a dex save or be trampled by the panicking crowd. The effect of the dragon dropping civillians on PC's (beside panicking the mob he flew over) would be obviously damage, but you could also make the PC make a Wis save or become shaken with the brutallity of the attack (you now, gore eveywhere from the splattered body). You could even give penalties/disadvantage to good aligned characters.  What about the PC's? They would probably try to calm the crowds (a char/diplomacy check) to avoid them stampeding all over. They could also give the crowd commands once they are calm (""over here"", ""get down"", ""run for your lives"",etc).  But the PC's (specially good aligned ones) would also want to save/protect civillians right? Well, thats where the buildings enter. The PC's could guide the people inside buildings, where they would be safer from the dragon (make it that it would take about three attacks for the dragon to level a building). The PC's could even use the buildings themselves as a place to hide while they heal or self-buff.  There, this is already a more interesting fight, with both PC's and Dragon having many options through interacting with the city features. And you could do this with other features as well, you just have to think how both sides interact with them (maybe theres a fountain where PC's can stand so they can't be set on fire, ou wooden buildings that the dragon can ignite to generate smoke, etc).  Hope that was useful."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,tulsadan,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:48 2015 UTC,one thing to try (though it's a bit cliche) is to have the dragon stay flying and use hit and run tactics till the party manages to deal enough damage or shoots it down with a ballista or a net launcher
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dq8ws,broran,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"For the first part of the battle, the Dragon flies around, watching the town for funny business and pockets of resistance.  It feeds information to it's minions, while staying out of harms way.  It could also use its breath weapon or magic to corral the defenders.   The Orcs stormed forward, smashing through the barricade and cutting through the ragged line of defenders.  They are about to charge right where Sebastian can get them with his fireball spell, when suddenly they cut down a side street, attacking the western defences from the rear.  ""How did they know we were out to get them?""  Sebastian glanced up as a shadow passed over us.  ""It's the Dragon,"" he said.    When a certain number of its minions have been slain, it flies down and confronts the most dangerous enemies itself.   That shadow passed over us again.  Gygax the Destroyer landed in front of us.  ""Enough meddling.  I will deal with you myself."" Focus on the Wizard or the Fighter.  Whoever has the highest DPR.   Finally, when the Dragon hits three quarters health, its minions catch up to it.  Now it focuses its attacks on whatever it perceives to be the greatest threat, while the minions run interference."

It sounds like what you have right now is a one shot, and several other one shots around. This might be the kind of party that isn't accustomed to making choices yet. I assume they are also first timers, but I could be wrong. But my point still stands.  I know, when this new party I'm running started, they didn't know they could ask me to go do things, or that they could really do what THEY wanted. So I had to keep telling them, and asking them ""Hey, what would you guys like to do next time?""  This is important because you need to start shaping them into a real party by asking them the questions and getting them accustomed to playing DnD. It's different than other games and thus takes some time to adjust.  As for having a campaign, instead of just one shots, you need to make a villain and you need to start asking dramatic questions and these questions need to be answered by OTHER dramatic questions.   What do I mean by this? Simple really. Next session you run, ask a dramatic questions (not really out loud, but to yourself) ""Can the party save the defenseless town?"". You ask this because they see a town being attacked in the distance. This is usually enough to get a party to act.  Now, they scurry along and have an awesome encounter in a city being attacked, saving it, feeling like heroes. Yay. But then after, as the smoke clears, they find that each creature that attacked had something wrong with them (either a charm spell was obviously on them, they share an emblem of an organization, or they have mutations). This leads to the new dramatic question, ""Can the party figure out the mystery?""  That again, leads to another quest, where at the end they should find the answer to that, but the answer is also a questions. That's what a campaign is, and it only ends when the BIG question is answered. Which in DnD the big question is usually ""Can the Party defeated the BBEG?""."

Brave, but stupid. Everyone knows the Gargoyles won't give up their treasure so easily.""  rumor and myth and truth can all get mixed up and disseminated this way. never tell the whole truth, mix some bullshit in there, and get people talking about it. and don't be shy about spreading lots of stories around. more hooks means more things to snag the characters' attention on. every tavern should produce at least 2 or 3 rumors, and who knows where else they will hear things, find stories in books, see as graffiti on sewer walls, overhear while in prison, or read in the newspapers?  get the world talking!"

Sure there may be a map with stuff marked on it, but they need some motivation.

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dqx5t,Locke3,4,Sat Jul 18 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"I can dig it. Its not my style but I can dig it.  Here is my only suggestion. Don't make the upgrades level dependent. Make it more based around story elements. You can work Inuyasha or his own character's story into the ways to unlock further abilities and strengths (I can't help you there since I'm not familiar with either.  But here is an example:  Gladeripper  +1 Glaive  Background: A glaive created by a an elven druid for her human lover. Ancient and from a time when elves and humans were at constant war, Gladeripper is a symbol of both the strained human/elven relationship and the start of a sort lived human-elven royal court that first sprung half-elves into this world.  Important detail: Under the full moon glowing elven script appears as well as words in an ancient human language.  Unlocking its potential - Step 1: The human script must be translated and then learned to pronounced. The two phrases must be spoken in unison by a human and elf, onr one and then the other by a half-elf. This must be done under the full moon. When this is done the human, elf, or half-elf involved in the ritual can use the weapon to shoot a beam of radiant light up to 100 feet dealing XdX damage (forgot the numbers). The weapon becomes a +2 Glaive for anyone using it.  Unlocking its potential - Step 2: Shortly after the first step is complete a human, elf, or half elf who is attuned to the weapon will start having dreams of an ancient jade fountain/statue in an enchanted glade. By taking Gladeriper there fey creatures will explain to the one who carries it that they most bath in the fountain's waters with clean Gladeripper. Again, under the full moon. The wielder can use [Misty Step I think is the spell] a certain number of times per day.  Unlocking its potential - Step 3: The final step. Glade ripper begins to speak telepathically to the wielder and those involved with the ritual. It must be taken to a Shrine of [insert fey god] in a specific location...on the full moon. It promises to unlock an ultimate power if placed in the hands of the statue there. If the party does this they will see the glaive begin to glow, and hover, and then shoot a beam of radiant energy at the moon. The party will see it pierce the moon and then the moon crack in two. A great light will erupt form the moon. A fey-ish angle-ish creature will appear before the party and explain that the weapon was designed by the druid to destroy the moon if the humans and elves did not stop their war. the moon trapped a terrible dark god that was now free. The weapon was compelled to fulfill its destiny and the party was its witless allies. The Human's and Elves were ruled by the Elf Druid and her Human lover for many decades and their son then acceded to the throne on their death. Their son saw that his people only respected his family out of fear and set to finding a way to lock away the powers of the weapon. Together the humans and elves placed wards on Gladeripper to weaken its power. But now it is at its peak, though the energy to blow up a moon is spent. It is now a +3 weapon, user can use fey step, shoot a beam doing 50% more damage than before. In darkness their form is blurry and single target attacks against them are at disadvantage.  EDIT: Just want to add that this quest chain went from about level 3 (finding the +1 Glaive) to about level 17 (destroying the moon and then hunting down the demon they released)."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3ds3kd,tulsadan,2,Sat Jul 18 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"Looks like DMG pg 144 is what you want. Just glancing through, it seems that Tables A through I get progressively stronger, or at least they are found in the hordes of progressively higher CR creatures with higher rolls on a d100. Not 100% sure, but maybe check it out and see if that seems to fit with what you think of when you say ""power level"".  You could say, ""You get two items from Table A, one from Table C, and one from Table F"". In your case, a +2 weapon is on Table G and a broach of shielding is on Table F.  EDIT: Also consider the fact that ""power"" is relative to the situation. If you have a +2 weapon and you do a lot of hitting things with weapons, that is quite powerful. If you do a lot of talking, it is not very useful/""powerful"" at all."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3ds3kd,andero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:31:36 2015 UTC,That is definitely a better approach than I've been using.
DnDBehindTheScreen,3ds3kd,techiesgoboom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"So the thing about 5e is that the game is balanced around the players not having many magic items; particularly having very, very few that significantly affect combat (+1 to hit etc).  Magic items are special; they are unique and rare and even a single one can pretty significantly affect combat.  Take your +2 sword for instance.  This means a character will hit about 10% more often and deal about 10% more damage.  This will increase a fighters damage by around 20%.  That is really significant  Magic items inherently aren't balanced; and because numbers are so tight when it comes to combat it's really hard to compare any two.  The only way for you to do so is on an individual case-by-case basis and actual think about how this balances.  (Additionally a player having a +2 magic item at game is very far away from game balance.  Page 38 of the DMG has starting equipment.  the tl;dr is that in a normal magic world a character starting at level 5-10 has 500-750 gold and 0 magic items.  From 11-16 they have 3 uncommon magic items and 5-6k gold.)"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3ds3kd,techiesgoboom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:55:03 2015 UTC,"While I agree with everything you post, none of it addresses what I asked.  Regardless on how much magic a DM wants in his/her campaign there is nothing that indicates the power of magic items relative to each other.  And worse there is this random ""rarity"" that gives a false implication that some groups of magic items are similarly powerful, when they are not.  So it would be great if someone put together a list of the magic items with some sort of power score to help players gauge them.  So a DM could say, ""Your 6th level character gets a category A magic item"" or "" no greater the power level 10"" or whatever.  I don't care what the scoring system is, I would just like to see a valid one somewhere."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dpo91,brail,3,Sat Jul 18 06:09:08 2015 UTC,"3.5 has an idea you might want to look at. Other than that, I found via quick google search, this article on the enworld forums where someone used the following formula:   Square of the spell level multiplied by 10 gp plus DOUBLE of the consumed material cost plus 10% of nonconsumed material cost.   The following is pulled from the playtest info for WoTC, Page 11   Spellcasting Services  Any settlement the size of a town or larger can provide some spellcasting services. Characters need to be able to travel to the settlement to obtain these services. Alternatively, if the party finishes an adventure, they can be assumed to return to the settlement closest to the adventure location.  Spell services generally available include healing and recovery spells, as well as information-gathering spells. Other spell services might be available as specified in the adventure. The number of spells available to be cast as a service is limited to a maximum of three per day total, unless otherwise noted.    Spellcasting Services Spell Cost    Cure wounds (1st level) 10 gp   Identify 20 gp   Lesser restoration 40 gp   Prayer of healing (2nd level) 40 gp   Remove curse 90 gp   Speak with dead 90 gp   Divination 210 gp   Greater restoration 450 gp   Raise dead 1,250 gp     I'm not actually sure how I'd rate them myself. I usually charge for spells by way of asking for something the person casting can't get without the adventurers help (particularly because my people love side quests, and I enjoy them being able to effectively define what they want in terms of magic items (by way of asking for specific services) because it makes them think in character, and gives me item ideas for later when I want to upgrade them. Generally speaking, anything above six level spells is likely to be favor related.  Now that I've said that, I feel like developing a system of 'marks', to show favors owed, and building a merchant section of the mage's guild that manages those favors so they can be traded between spellcasters who are under their employ (and obiviously some plot hooks on corruption, that might score them legal discounts, or illegal goods, depending on the party's choices.)  Thanks for the inspiration, hope all this helps!"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dpo91,TheChaoticDoctor,2,Sat Jul 18 06:36:25 2015 UTC,"The issue with 'favor related' costs is that there are wizards of lvl 11+ in the party. NPCs charging favors can lead to quests, but when a player wants gold/treasure... how does the DM handle a group of NPCs going to a dungeon for the player?   We did that once, players took over a group of lower level npcs to do a side quest,but itd get old quick and interrupt the flow of the game.  The 3.5 thing could be helpful"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dpo91,TheChaoticDoctor,2,Sat Jul 18 06:59:43 2015 UTC,"Typically I'd avoid giving a player direct control of npc's (mostly because it does, as you've said, mess with the flow of the game), and stick it to a percentile chance roll to see if they succeeded, based on the difficulty of the quest. That way my players could, if they so chose, send out multiple parties to ensure success, at the cost of funds and time waiting somewhere for them to return (the time is a big thing in my groups, the events in the world happen even if the players aren't there to see it, and I adjust the game accordingly.)  If the player came to me asking to basically set up what sounds like an adventurers guild, so that they could essentially harvest funds and things from lower level people doing quests, I'd let that happen, provided they were willing to do all the bookkeeping in their downtime between sessions, and it didn't impact the game too much. It does pose the question of why an 11+ player would want to let someone else do the work, when they could theoretically do the work for a fraction of the cost/time involved, with their expanded powers (and nothing says the people working for them are honest, and will be willing to part with any magical items/gold they find.)  So I took the formula I found on that enworld board for a whirl real quick, and came up with this table:    Spell Level Total Cost (Gold)    1 110.5   2 221   3 331.5   4 442   5 552.5   6 663   7 773.5   8 884   9 994.5    In general, this doesn't seem like enough money to me, so I started playing with the values til I found something I liked.    Spell Level x5 GP x10 GP x15 GP    1 552.5 1105 1657.5   2 1105 2210 3315   3 1657.5 3315 4972.5   4 2210 4420 6630   5 2762.5 5525 8287.5   6 3315 6630 9945   7 3867.5 7735 11602.5   8 4420 8840 13260   9 4972.5 9945 14917.5    I'd say that the x10 cost is what I'd normally charge, with the x5 being what I'd charge them if the merchant was friendly, and x15 being if unfriendly. Obviously, exclude 6-9 levels if you want them to be something a party has to earn."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dpo91,techiesgoboom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:35:30 2015 UTC,"The party is the one selling/providing the spell services in question at the moment,though it does need to be consistent. If an NPC wizard charges X for a spell, players should be able to do the same for an NPC in need of that spell.  These numbers definitely help a lot, thanks for all the info you've provided =]"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dpo91,TheChaoticDoctor,2,Sat Jul 18 08:24:06 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind about the pricing of the spells from NPCs is about how often they actually offer their services.  NPCs that offer spell casting services for sale aren't depleting their entire reservoir each day for a profit.  More than likely that NPC is happy if they sell a single lvl 4 spell within any given week, and level 7+ spells are probably sold once every year max.  There simply isn't going to be enough demand for that to happen very often.    So if you plan on letting your players sell spells it's probably best for it to be one-off kinds of situations, in which case think about why that NPC needs that spell.  If they have the kind of money to seriously reward he players (hundreds or thousands of gold) then chances are that NPC is a high level character themselves.  If that is the case chances are they have a spellcasting friend of a similar level who would cast it for them in exchange for a small favor like helping them move or something."

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp7uw,harringtonE4,3,Sat Jul 18 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"Bear with me.  I'm a few beers in.  1a) I generally don't bother with maps beforehand.  I have two sheets of thick plastic I use as whiteboards during the game.  One is laid out on the table for combat, the other is where I draw the map for the players.  Are the PCs skulking around a house looking to rob it?  Then I quickly sketch the house and some surrounding structures.  If I end up drawing the structures closely (I'm a really crappy artist), then there are narrow alleyways.  Then, my players will ask me what certain buildings are and I just guess what would be nearby (e.g., ""that's a stable"").  1b & 2) For dungeons, keep them simple if you're making them up on the fly.  Don't make them too big.  Or, if they're big, make them mostly empty.  There wasn't an encounter in every room of the Mines of Moria.  Only have one or two kinds of opponents in the dungeon.  Don't try to get too fancy.  If the PCs fight a bunch of goblins being bullied by an ogre in a cavern, leave it at that.  Draw the cavern and throw in three details.  Is there a ledge?  Awesome, put goblins there.  Is there a big fire pit?  Is there a harried goblin in the corner trying to get a bunch of goblin kids to stop crying by teasing a testy goat?  Great.  Now  the PCs need to get up on the ledge to get the goblins in cover, the ogre is swinging a flaming club at them, and the goat has gotten loose, sending squirming goblin children everywhere (rough terrain.  Don't make them combatants.  That's just sick).  Also, I make my tiny dungeons dynamic.  I know what's in the dungeon - heck, only two or three types of things - and I make them move around constantly.   If my dungeon has more than four rooms, you can be damn well sure I'm planning on something either chasing or being chased by the PCs through all four rooms.  Complicated, encounter rich dungeons are for GMs who have done more prep than you.  Accept it and every now and then figure out a way to tweak a published adventure to give your PCs their fix of ""why the hell is that monster living here?"" (I just ran a converted White Plume Mountain for my group and spent most of the time wondering that exact thing.  I don't care how much you pay me.  I'm not going to live in a flooded dungeon in a 30' x 20' room, with six other men, plucking the occasional adventurer who has manage to get past a series of deathtraps, from a floating river)  3 & 4) I listen to the players.  If a player is checking everything for traps, give them a couple traps.  Be gentle with the DCs because it can be really easy to accidentally TPK the party with a couple bad rolls.  Sure, the PCs will usually succeed, but every now and then they'll fail.  In that case I generally go for causing an amount of damage roughly equal to 25% of the PCs hit points).  In general, if the players keep looking for something, it's there.  5) I have my players give me a wish list of 3-4 items they want for their character.  If one of those items could conceivably be in the dungeon, is appropriate for the party's power level, and I can balance the PCs against one another by handing one PC a sweet magic item, I give it to them.  If it's a hoard (like they kill a dragon), I let them roll on the tables (well, they roll, I tell them what they get). I also occasionally let them spend inspiration for this, because at the end of a session I'll take any opportunity for cheering players I can get.     Edit: Formatting and spelling"

DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp7uw,techiesgoboom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"I_fling_feces gave some phenomenal advice.  One extra thing i like to do is to have a handful of generic humanoid NPCs ready for anytime.  If you create a fighter NPC at a CR equal to the PCs (it can either be just a character with levels in fighter, something similar to appendix b in the MM or my favorite: a mix of both) you then can use this as the head of a town guard, the son of a noble with fighting training, an ""enforcer"" for a thieves guild, a bandit, or much, much more.  Have a handful of these ready to go of all different types.  If you don't use it in a session just put it in a folder and write on the top ""CR 5 NPC Fighter"".  You can always ""level"" these guys on the fly by adding a few points to hit, damage, and AC, rolling some extra hit dice, giving it extra attacks if needed, and giving it 2 uses of a single fighters manuevers.  Spell casters you just give a few level spells.  This way if the players want to attack a town guard you have no stats for, or need to break a PC out of prison you are prepared on the fly."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp7uw,reicomatricks,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm creating a large elaborate dungeon with some sort of puzzle, obstacle, and traps, with a finely tuned ""wear down the clerics healing spells until they're all but gone"" format so the last room becomes super stressful, making up small dungeons on the fly is easy. Keep the page of the DM's guide that has a list of sample traps handy and blow up a PC if they're rushing ahead, and toss monsters into a room that you know will scare the crap out of the party.  As for ""letting the PC's drive the story"" I've recently adopted this model. Lately all I do is get a general feel for the local environment the party is in, and create the personalities of a few NPC's in my mind and let everything just play out as the PC's make their decisions. My last session felt like my most rewarding session to date for that reason, I did next to no prep and my group had the most fun they'd ever had, and I truly felt like I'd learned how to DM properly without railroading my players."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp7uw,brandonedwards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"I like to plan stuff out to the point that a roll of the dice will come into play. I use checks and player feedback as the guide for the narrative. For traps and plot hooks, I prepare 4 different scenarios and wait for the rolls or the characters to give me sign which I should start pursuing. Having a couple of those DMG rolled quests helps, then the other options in my head include anything that the players have mentioned interest in via backstory or habits. I treat lot as a specific reward. Loot can lead to the other quest I rolled lazily. I only prepare the loot when it will lead into another quest, because I'm lazy. Also, its easier to track loot that way, cause if it's special, you wanted it in there in the first place. I don't freestyle in isolation; if I made stuff up, I have another goal, whether it makes an incredible arc or not. They choose the arcs, but I've got to have some goal or else the improv becomes random.  It doesn't take a long time to make up some vague quests with a handful of badies to store for whenever. When you use one or two, fill those random slots up with a couple new quests (however's comfortable) and wait for your players to tell you any of that information possible. It's fun, cause I get to direct the narrative and am surprised at the same time."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp7uw,st33d,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:32:08 2015 UTC,"Have ammunition.   World building - it's easier to have ideas about somewhere with a history. Factions can be spawned to reinhabit the areas players clean out. Make areas populated by certain monsters. Give them a basic motive for being there so you don't get stumped when everyone tries to RP through what you thought would be a boss battle. Variations on the same monster. I ran a game once with homebrew spiders - no help for players owning the Monster Manual that day. Lists of loot. Thematic to the areas. Set pieces. Any random experience is still played in a linear fashion. Even with a random encounter map you want the odd ""real"" thing to happen so that the whole world is at stake."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp74k,ceeeKay,4,Sat Jul 18 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"Usually they start at the same level as the lowest party member for me. Starting items/gold, and they can run by me ONE magic item as long as it's not OP as fuck. Unless they plan on looting their old characters body. But that's usually looted by the other party members..."
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp74k,Trigger93,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm just doing milestone leveling for this, because tracking XP is a pain with as many players as I have (we have a pool of about 8 that show up when they can to lunch games, so the characters sometimes phase in/out of the ethereal plane, along with monsters to scale encounter difficulty to number of players)"
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp74k,Trigger93,3,Sat Jul 18 03:17:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I hate counting xp. Milestones are the best way to go. That way when you take a break to level up everyone does it at the same time.
DnDBehindTheScreen,3dp74k,Grumpy_Sage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. Although after today when resting under the bridge they are like ""did we get to level 5 yet?"" I said ""haha no you got beaten, knocked unconscious and killed on someone's doorstep"" (also when I added up the equivalent XP later from their kills they were like only 30% of the way from 4 to 5)"
