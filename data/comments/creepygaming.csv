creepygaming,3e5mhl,ricocarnie,2,Wed Jul 22 03:42:34 2015 UTC,I've come across Rooster Teeth before. Wasn't aware he did horror stuff. My buddy loves Him Stearling(sp?) But I find him annoying.
creepygaming,3e5mhl,NeroIV,2,Wed Jul 22 04:28:12 2015 UTC,"Rooster Teeth is a huge entertainment company. Their main focus isn't horror lets plays, but they have plenty.   Joel and Adam played through all of Outlast together, where one player uses only the mouse, and the other uses the keyboard, so it adds for some chaotic humor. Same with Michael and Gavin with Slender. And other horror games throughout the years.  I recommend everything they do, not just their horror lets plays."
creepygaming,3e5mhl,NeroIV,2,Wed Jul 22 04:37:28 2015 UTC,I will most definitely check it out. I really enjoy when the Game Grumps tackle horror games. Danny's absolute squimishness mixed with Arin's dead pan humor is a sight to behold sometimes. I think it played out best in P.T.

creepygaming,3diz9l,LordMcze,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"I was browsing through my old CDs from local game magazine and found this.  Small ""About"" by the devs (Cuz I'm lazy and their description is better than mine would be.)   In Maere : When Lights Die, your character is a volunteer tester for a virtual reality experiment. A team of scientists places a VR headset on your head and the game begins as their voices start explaining what is going to happen as they begin generating a lovely virtual dream for you to peacefully explore. Unfortunately, things start to get a little bit out of control, the audio transmission fails, and the program creates...a nightmare! Full of dark corridors, it's clear that the place you're trapped in is not only scary, there have been previous VR experiment failures. So much for long pony rides, flowers, and unicorns! Source"
creepygaming,3diz9l,NDWolfwood5268,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"This is my experience playing a demo last year for this game.   I've played this game on the Rift. Great experience, but it breaks down with subsequent plays. You find the game is more about getting lucky with monster spawns and level generation than using skill and stealth to avoid being caught. The monster itself is rather ordinary except that it never loses you, it seems.   No matter where you hide, it knows, which really removes any semblance of stealth, which is what I expected. It feels like Amnesia at first, so I thought hiding was the main strategy.   The atmosphere is great, the gameplay was garbage and the replay value was non-existent. It's worth a look, and I hope they improve on the concept.   Right now, 4/10, would strap unsuspecting friends into a Rift and watch them shit their pants again."

If you are a fan, I'd check it out.  Cry of Fear is starting to show its age, but it is legendary for good reason-- it is both better designed and scarier than most horror games created by paid developers in the last decade. Its got a pretty beefy campaign (for an indie game) that IIRC takes ~8 hrs. There is also a plethora of fan-made custom stories.  SCP Containment Breach is not pretty by any standard, but it makes up for lackluster graphics with some genuinely haunting atmosphere, a complex design that leads to interesting and unpredictable emergent gameplay elements, and monsters that are flat-out fucking horrifying, if only because the devs had the opportunity to draw from an immense community of what basically boils down to fan-fiction fan-made content .  The other titles are more-or-less adventure games with pervasive horror elements. I'm eager to give The Train a try and would appreciate some input if someone else in the comments section has tried it."

Eternal Darkness did something similar to this where the TV supposedly started to mute itself, or switched inputs, or the camera behind the player would start to tilt and shake, like it's trying to get at YOU, not the avatar in the game. I'm imagining something like pretending that the game crashes, showing a screenshot of their desktop that you took when the application launched, and having it start to bleed, or something along those lines. That's just my personal hell, I hope it helps."
creepygaming,3cckyb,GVP,15,Mon Jul 6 21:51:46 2015 UTC,"Now that I think of it, another example (if you were to do a third-person game) is when things start to look at YOU instead of the player avatar. I actually see this in The Sims 3 of all games... every so often they'll just stop everything that they're doing and stare at me, following the camera until I make them do something else. It's unnerving. If there is some sort of entity in the game, having it start out talking to the avatar, then looking up as if it's acknowledging that -you- exist is pretty scary."

creepygaming,3cckyb,MisaelK,8,Fri Jul 10 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"The main concept here is the invasion of the safe place. Your desktop is a safe place because it's outside of the game's domain.  Another easy way to accomplish this is by having the game be a Matrix-within-the-Matrix game. Imagine you need to do some actions in the game before you start playing ""the real game,"" like the room itself in Silent Hill 4: The Room or the waking world in Yume Nikki. These are safe places at first, because they only work as portals to the real game, where the scary stuff happens. After building up tension in the real game, tarnishing and then destroying the safe place can be extremely powerful. Invading such places like the main menu or the pause menu can be very effective, too.  Of course, making this the main game mechanic is incredibly difficult, because once the cat's out of the bag, overusing this can become annoying instead of scary."

creepygaming,3cckyb,SchizTurtles,15,Tue Jul 7 06:34:28 2015 UTC,"If you're going for psychological horror, I'd stay away from adjectives like ""brutal and offensive"" entirely. If that's part of your vision, I'd still be interested in seeing it, but visceral and violent horror is very different from psychological. Psychological horror is about what you don't see, thoughts and feelings they stay with you when the game is over. Silent Hill 2 is arguably the best example of this (thematic spoilers ahead). The game has themes of murder, sexual violence and mental illness. Despite this, I wouldn't consider it an offensive game. The game never shows too much, but puts just enough suggestions in the player's mind where they can piece it together. It uses oppressive, dark subject matter without trying to shock the viewer. The viewer then feels unsettled and uncomfortable while playing, not repulsed or offended.  As far as camera angles go, it depends on the environment really. If you want tight corridors, first person is pretty good but incredibly overused, and third person needs tank controls. If you want more open areas, first person is the same, and third person can have a more free range of movement. Combat should be a challenge, but not too punishing or it just won't be fun. Between combat and camera angles, the player should feel limited but not constricted. If there is an enemy that is easy to outmaneuver and kill, it won't be scary no matter how it looks or sounds. If every enemy is enough of a challenge to appear significant, it's perfect."
creepygaming,3cckyb,biranqu,10,Tue Jul 7 03:46:12 2015 UTC,"Wow! Awesome that you guys are asking this! Here are some of my suggestions that on making a game truly scary  The first thing that comes to mind is music. Excellent music is essential in Horror games. Sinister music can be used to make the player feel uneasy, combine that with disturbing scenery to really make the player too scared to continue. Music needs to be present in most horror games, but not have to much of an impact. Rarely do you want an entire orchestra playing while the player walks around. Save these songs for essential parts in the game so that they have an extra large impact. Not playing music can also be very scary. If all music dies out, the player will expect something scary to happen. Play with the emotions of the player by sometimes muting all music. It keeps them on their toes.   Almost never make the player feel truly safe. What i really like about Alien:Isolation is that the Alien adapts on your playstyle. If you hide to much in closets, the Alien may find you. Try giving this feeling that the player can never rest. That they will always have to  be alert. This can be done by making hiding spots inreliable or by placing the player in a spot that they think is safe, only have them running for their lives seconds later. Do make sure to give them rest from time to time, as you dont want to make the player exhaust him/herself to quickly. Adding a few save spots is alright(mainly because the player wont trust them).  If you deside the incorporate jumpscares, dont make them scripted. Jumpscares feel way less cheesy and are way more scary when you encounter them when you lest expect them. this is a cheap jumpscare imo and this is a better one.   Combat is realy hard to balance. I find it most scary when both you and the enemy are very deadly, however, ammo is sparce and shots are loud. This will force you to make decisions. I can take out this one enemy, but if i wil do this, a lot of enemies will come to me and i dont have enough ammo to take them all down. I dont know how prevalent combat will be in this game, it's hard to judge. I personally really liked how Condemned: criminal origins balanced combat.  Building suspense is most easily done via anticipation. Lead players through dark narrow corridors, only to have nothing happen to them. Force players to walk through very open areas, knowing that any enemy will be able to spot them. Things like these really keep you on edge.   I always like it when you make some friends, so that you are not entirely alone, but you dont know whether or not you can trust them/whether or not they are sane. This can help with story stuff, but also gives the creep factor of never feeling safe, even though there are other people near you.  I find Monsters to be the most scary when they have some sort of familiar form. Whether it is a human or a dog. Just make sure to have a rather large enemy variety, so that the player can never really get accustomed to one monsters A.I. By adding new monsters, the player will have to change his/her playstyle, which brings him/her into unfamiliar territory. Also, be sure to make the creatures terrifying loud screeches, especially when they spot you. Something about these send chillings down my spine  Last thing in wanted to mention is being stalked. Alma is everyones favourite little girl(or pregnant woman). She is scary because she's always near you when you least expect it. This point also connects to the ""never let the player feel safe"" point i made earlier. Knowing that something follows you is very unsettling.  These are just a few things I like in horror games. I can thing of more thing if you need me to. I hope this helped.  Edit: i saw your followup questions. Personally i dont really mind first or third person. Both can be very scary, but i prefer first person games i think, mainly because it feels more immersive. Peeking around corners feels more intens than abusing the camera to look around corners.  I think that FEAR has to much combat for a horror game, mainly because its more of a fps/horror hybrid. I prefer games that have some combat, but make not fighting a possibility. Think a bit more like Alien, but with a bit more combat. If you make the player like Isaac from Dead Space, the player will be less scared because he's so strong, yet i do like combat in a horror game because it gives the oppertunity to place more threats in the players path. In amnesia (a game with no combat) there is generally only one monster per area, and generally no enemies when you're solving puzzles. Combat in games gives you the oppertunity to encounter scary monsters even when puzzling, because you can defend yourself. Its less cheap this way. Now you will always be on your guard when walking. Outlast had a bit to much chase sequinces to my liking. I'd rather face my fears. I hope this is clear enough, its way to late where i am from right now and i'm very tired.  Which reminds me. I find ominous foreshadowing creepy as well"
creepygaming,3cckyb,goomylord,5,Mon Jul 6 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"Don't make it uber-hard, the player will feel less scared with each retry. A good example of this was Five Nights at Freddy's."
creepygaming,3cckyb,hawkcannon,2,Tue Jul 7 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The more you show the player about death, the less scary it is. Actually dying changes death from a serious threat or a way to build up atmosphere, into a simple, familiar, mechanical fail state."
creepygaming,3cckyb,SpookyMcPants,4,Tue Jul 7 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"Sound. Sound is so very important in a good game. And the use of subtle silence in spots, banging, creaking. The idea of layering things.   I'm with you all. Less jump scares. If there are many enemies, randomizing the spots they appear would also be fun, and add replayability.   Lastly, with an engine like that, atmosphere. Lighting going out, clicking back on. As someone else said, the idea that the computer itself, or even screen is subject to goofy things is lovely too."
creepygaming,3cckyb,Puripnon,4,Mon Jul 6 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"I think a big mistake many horror game developers use is to draw too much from horror films. We all know the tropes by now, so you're not going to elicit any fear by playing on the same old ideas.   What I enjoy in creepy games is the immersion factor. The better job you can do crafting the details in such a way that I forget that I'm playing a game, the more genuine fear I will feel.   I think first person is a must for that reason. Third person reminds me that I'm playing a game. The horror is happening to my avatar instead of to me.   As for combat, FEAR never struck me as scary. Any enemy I can kill with a couple of shotgun blasts isn't frightening."
creepygaming,3cckyb,Psychron13,5,Tue Jul 7 01:50:20 2015 UTC,One thing that always scares the crap out of me is when something spots you and it forces you to turn around and sprint for your life because I'm constantly wondering if I'm actually getting away and I don't have the luxury of looking behind me.
creepygaming,3cckyb,Psychron13,2,Tue Jul 7 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"Also, when it comes to the monster/creature/whatever is chasing you, it's always a lot worse if they have some sort small warning that they're behind a door or around a corner; whether it be a blood curdling screech, or an ominous red/green glow that they have, it was always a lot more terrifying when I would register that warning and panic about whether to hide or run rather than just being confronted and forced to run."
creepygaming,3cckyb,SennaSaysHi,3,Tue Jul 7 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"Years ago, I played a game called Amber: Journeys Beyond (1996!). That game scared the crap out of me.  One of the scariest things I've ever done was sit in the dark, everyone else in the house asleep, wearing headphones, straining to hear the voices underneath the buzz of bees in a beehive."

creepygaming,3cckyb,SennaSaysHi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"No, in that part of the game (in which you are basically working through dysfunctions of past souls) you are a gardener (I think, it's been a long, long time!) who had abducted and murdered a neighbor. You could go to the beehives and listen within the buzz, hearing what was either his internal monologue or supposed to symbolize what others were saying about him.   ""She doesn't love you like you do her""  ""Everyone laughs at you""  ""You'll never do anything""  ""You should make them""  ""You should make them listen""  ""...You should kill them""  It was really, really chilling. I loved it ♥"
creepygaming,3cckyb,imahna,3,Wed Jul 8 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"Ambient sounds and landscape/scenery.  I've always envisioned a game where as you explore, you can really get into what you hear, just like in the real world.  For instance, walking through a forest, you can hear the wind blow through the trees, making that well known slight howling noise.  Perhaps while moving, you can faintly hear bushes rustling, twigs snapping, etc. off to the side (or behind you) but if your avatar stops, so do those sounds.  Most of this comes from walking in my family's woods.  I know there is nothing ""that's going to get me"", but in the back of my mind, the sounds have always had me on edge.  To me, a game that puts you in that ""hey, this could happen"" kind of situation would be the perfect horror game.  Scavenging, fending for yourself, etc.  Sure, zombies could happen, aliens could invade, but in the end, I could see mankind at war with itself first - leaving every man for themselves.  Sorry, did not mean to get on a soapbox or anything, just typing what came to mind."
creepygaming,3cckyb,Graavy,3,Tue Jul 7 00:35:00 2015 UTC,"Things you cannot kill but can only run and hide from work well.  Also, things that de-materialize and then re-materialize near you or behind you.  It isn't a jump scare.  You know it is happening, but it still freaks you out that the monster or ghost or whatever is right behind you and you can't see it.  I felt that way about the crow man in Bioshock Infinite, for example."
creepygaming,3cckyb,jomari29,3,Tue Jul 7 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"1) Watch everything from the people of Extra Credits, especially about horror games.   2) What  scares people, as far as the mechanics of the game is concerned, is helplessness. Look at Five Nights At Freddy's. Mechanically, simple. But the mechanics of the game put you in a state of complete helplessness. You are only trying to delay the inevitable, and all of your actions can lead to the inevitable happening.   3)  Psychological horror isn't about the gore, or being shocking. It's about pacing. Look at the pacing of the first Paranormal Activity. It's slow, and the  horror slowly ramps up until the end of the movie.   4)  Know why Lovecraft and Hitchcock are so scary? Not only do their stories take place in this world, as accurate as conceivably possible, but the main protagonists could be anybody. Also, the scary thing? Rarely seen. Fear, creeping psychological fear, is getting the person who is  experiencing your work to scare themselves. A shadow in a Slenderman youtube video has more psychological fear in it than  any slasher.   5) BE.  SUBTLE."

creepygaming,3cckyb,BaconWrapedAsparagus,3,Tue Jul 7 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"I like this question, because good horror games a hard to come by. Psychological horror, but you want it brutal and offensive? The first part of your idea sounds like a slow simmering pot of clues that creep into the players mind, and the second sounds a lot like the feeling of the Saw series. It sounds real difficult to mix the two and appeal to everyone. How do you plan on accomplishing this?"
creepygaming,3cckyb,BlunderBluster,3,Tue Jul 7 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"just remember that the most effective and disturbing scenes are those that are placed somewhere contrasting. For instance, if you are walking through blood soaked halls and see a dead guy, you almost don't even notice it. However, if you are walking through a clean and normal mall and suddenly see someone crucified in the fountain and small smears of blood on the floor, the scene can be entirely more horrifying. I don't think finding a woman in a shack would be as shocking visually as it is mentally, kind of like how stephen king's books are way scarier than the movies he directs"
creepygaming,3cckyb,thearrowinurknee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"I'd like to piggy back on that by saying what psychological horror is to me, and give a recent example that really shocked me. It was dark, brutal, but built slowly over time instead of thrown in the game as a small part of it. If I see zombies running at me, there is not much question what I need to do. Avoid the Zombies. Seeing them act violent feels like the average definition of brutality, and shock found in many horror-coaster games. Instead, should I see news reports about strange illnesses breaking out in remote towns, I could feel disturbed if connections could be made to those stories and any nearby 'illnesses' that occur in-game.  Its all about the story writer, and the introductions  player has to the world. A good example of horror game teasing at something tragic until it hits you would be  the Game Deadly Premonition. If you haven't seen it, I won't spoil anything, but it hides all of its horror in plain view. When the connections are made there is a distinct moment you realize that the whole game means something different than before. The pleasant town you were in (minus the shadow world), turned into a horrible lie, and the quiet sickness was growing there all along. As an addendum, this probably has a lot to do with the personalities your character goes through meeting and developing fun rapport with. Also, I hope to never see a game where a rape is just thrown in the game for the sake of shock.  TLDR: To make a game not forgetable,"
creepygaming,3cckyb,VladislavThePoker,2,Tue Jul 7 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like if you do this sort of thing you need to not just have a dead mutilated body just laying around with no context. Like in fallout 3 you can enter a old broken down hospital with very old skeletons laying in hospital beds with the skeletons of their family members sitting in chairs beside the bed, this leads you to think about what happened and gives you enough clues to figure out that at some point there was a gas leak in the building that killed all of the patients and their family members.  I guess what I'm trying to say is tell a story with the gory/brutal scenes, place bodies in a way that would give them an identity."

Or at least it did before the information fried up. Crappy Terror Engine game with a bunch of weird sound files backwards and photos of crazy stuff, nothing NSFW, and yet extremely unnerving. The discussion over at /r/sadsatan has more info.... Definitely the gameplay is garbage, but the team based research aspect of it is fun and learning all this nutty stuff about international satanic sex cult conspiracies is pretty damn creepy. There was even an aspect where the game made the original player think it had hacked his computer. Pretty creative."
creepygaming,3cckyb,theB1ackSwan,2,Fri Jul 10 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"Not to be a party pooper, but I think a well-edited and well-designed game will be scarier than, idk, putting in a bunch of different scary things and hoping they all work together. There's something to be said about really streamlined, really carefully directed game design that takes a game from just having disparate ""scary moments"" to having a truly scary gestalt.   ""Brutal and offensive"" also sounds hilarious, I'm sorry. I don't know why, but most writers take characters cussing and being assholes as a chance to skimp out on writing refreshing and WEIRD dialogue. I don't think realistic dialogue has ever worked in a horror game; it always sounds corny and distracting or cliched and boring. Ditto with XTREME guts and gore - there's nothing surprising about it! There's nothing, idk, twisty and uncomfortable and stick-in-your-craw kind of messed up. (Look at the original Oldboy ending, for example. Damn!)"

HOWEVER, if you are going to do stuff like that or other methods of ""screwing with the player"" such as text documents appearing or images like imscared, WARN THE PLAYER WHEN THEY START THE GAME!!!  I know it may seem weird to warn players about this kind of thing.  However it would be best so as to avoid another fiasco like ""remember.exe"", a game that tried to act similar to imscared, Luna Game etc in which the creator did not mention the kind of thing that was in it and when the freakiness started people began accusing the game of being a virus. I prefer a mixture of outlast and F.E.A.R, have some sections where you can do nothing but avoid enemies and have others where enemies are killable."

It is relevant to mention that I am an uber Silent Hill fan. I have an encyclopedic knowledge of that IP, and it's safe to say I'm obsessed. I have Silent Hill vanity plates on my car and a huge decal of Red Pyramid Thing. Blah blah blah.   The only reason I say any of that is to give context to my response to your question. Which is to not make it -too- scary.   As much of a SH fan as I am, I couldn't handle P.T. It was just too much. The level of intensity was so unforgiving-- it was truly terrifying. It was so scary that it stopped being in any way enjoyable to me.   I love ambience. I love disturbing, creeping dread. I love lore that haunts you for years. I think that is the most effective, while still giving an experience people want to participate in.   I doubt Silent Hills could ever be as scary as P.T. There were many things contributing to why it worked so well-- the extremely limited space, the short duration etc. That sort of terror is not sustainable for an extended period, IMO. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe you guys could be the ones to do it.   But... Maybe you shouldn't. There is such a thing as too much. Push players to the edge and keep them there. Don't shove them over.

creepygaming,3cckyb,Lobsel_Vith,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:06:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like everyone and their uncle has something to say about horror game theory on this board, so hopefully this doesn't get buried. I think some of the most psychologically unsettling moments i've had in games have relied on convincing me that there is something just beyond my line of site that can kill me. For instance, when playing Silent Hill 2 I was walking through the fog and knew that there could be a creature out in it, but it was a fear in the back of my mind. It wasn't until I saw a creature crawl out from under a car and dart into the distance that I knew there was something out there. I knew that, from a programming point of view, that this creature had spawned into the world, and was somewhere out there. That, to me, was one of the most terrifying moments I had in that game.  Sound design is obviously a big one. When that creature took off into the fog, it made an extremely disturbing grinding noise as it crawled across the ground. The sound seems like it doesn't belong with said action and it sort of leaves the reasoning behind it to your imagination. Is it dragging something metal? How can something so heavy as to make that noise move so quickly?   As a horror game dev, you have a unique opportunity to craft a player's realizations and understandings of the world and creatures you've created. By not even showing the creature, save through sound and story, you can do what a million lines of code to display it visually could never do. So even though it's easy to get buried in the code, never forget to step back and put yourself in the players shoes. Anyway, once you've decided how you want your player to perceive something, you can play with those perceptions. Is your creature primarily slow? what if it suddenly moved fast? Is it a creature that has only showed up one at a time? What if the player (by his or her own ""will"") stumbled across a room with hundreds of them and absolutely no way of killing all of them. You can create some amazing ""nope"" moments by creating an artificial standard and then shattering it. Just keep in mind that this sort of thing should be used scarcely, lest the player catch on to a pattern of scare tactics.  Something that has always stood out to me in (good) horror games was a solid basis in reality that can then be twisted into something much more surreal. Silent Hill of course is the obvious answer, but you can also look at such games as PT, lone survivor, penumbra, amnesia, and even condemned (think of the mannequin level) for deviations in reality, sometimes very subtly. It's not difficult to imply reality as more often than not, the player is already expecting the rules of the gameworld to be similar to the rules of the one they inhabit. They probably don't plan on running like sonic or jumping like they might in halo. They will assume that structures in the game make visual-spacial sense (i.e. rooms won't intersect with each other, a player could feasibly map out the game world without coming across any impossible scenarios). Like the constants I mentioned earlier, establishing this lets you put in moments like, say, the 2 minute stair descent in silent hill 2, or the door that leads back to the starting hall in PT. In condemned, it is established that you are in a clothing store with tons of mannequins, but then you see a mannequin walk by. You suddenly realize in a claustrophobic panic that some of your enemies have dressed themselves like mannequins and your immediate surroundings become much, much more threatening. However, such a scenario is plausible in reality, as mannequins can't actually come to life, so you keep playing until you reach one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire game. This scene was so scary that they tried multiple times in the sequel to recreate it without realizing that it was the shattering of belief in the reality of the immediate world that made it so horrifying as there was no tangible reason they could have moved like that. The horror was all in the build up, kind of like how it's much scarier to watch a horror movie up until it's scariest scene as opposed to just watching that scene itself (although that scene I linked from condemned gave me chills in itself).  Anyway, I could talk for hours on what I think makes a good horror experience, but I'll leave it at this as i'm starting to ramble. Good luck with your game, and let me know when you have a playable build.  EDIT: When I mentioned shattering the basis in reality and mentioned penumbra, I forgot to elaborate on one of my favorite moments in a horror game. There is a particular scene in penumbra that forced me to throw my pants away afterwards. The game sets you up to be absolutely terrified of the creatures. You have no way to kill them and they are about as fast as you are. If you get seen by one, there is a strong chance you will die. Anyway, I had nearly completed an area. I had finally unlocked the door to the next area after an hour or so of wondering around these particular halls and becoming familiar with the area. I was on my way to that door when another door that I previously wasn't able to access broke right in front of me and one of the creatures ran out of it at me. I sprinted as fast as I could through the winding halls and turned down the hall that contained the door, except for some fucking reason the door, which I know should have been there, was not. It was just a wall. I can't remember panicking more than that in any video game i've ever played. The combination of being chased by this thing and not having time to really think about it and seeing something that clearly did not fit with the standard of reality that I had come to believe created an experience that very few games have been able to live up to in terms of making me shit myself.

creepygaming,3cckyb,walkman01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"I would say it's pretty terrifying when the player can't trust the actual setting or simple objects either. One example that I saw is when the setting changes in some way to make you feel lost, then for using objects for a scary factor I find that radios turning on, a window rattling, bottle rolling, etc. all add suspense and make the player think that something is nearby or out to get them. Places where light is also spaced far away so there are dark areas are also creepy when your walking down a corridor or area. Also having an internal conflict become an external conflict also adds to it if you have a mechanic where the character's health is based on sanity."
creepygaming,3cckyb,EclecticallySound,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"The ocean is pretty terrifying. Imagine a small boat, sort of like Life of Pi, except without the tigers, and in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight. Daytime could be for fixing up your ship, looking for resources floating in the water, and other non-scary things. At night, though, shit gets real. Something huge passes under your boat really fast, you're not even sure if you saw it. It happens more and more often over the course of the night, and you can never fully make out what it is. Then, just before it breaks the surface, the sun comes up and it darts down into the deep, leaving the player in the dark about what they just saw. And then, they have to jump out of the boat and swim around to look for food or driftwood, anything that could help them survive. The boat can be moved, but not very quickly, so avoiding monsters isn't an option. Have a few more nights of complete unknown, sightings becoming more frequent, the player gathers resources and every night that same huge thing comes closer and closer to revealing itself. One of the greatest fears is fear of the unknown, so keep the player in the dark about the thing in the deep as long as possible. One night, though, it emerges. The player has to hide somewhere on the ship until dawn to try to avoid its grasp. All the hiding places should almost completely obstruct the view, so even when the creature surfaces, you still only know that it's big. If the creature grabs the player, it flings them high in the air. There is a moment of peace as the waves move along with the player high above them, and then they fall into the ocean, where visibility is low and terror is high. They then have to try and swim back up to the surface, and then back to the boat, while still only catching glimpses of the creature darting around. If they're in the water for too long, the creature will get closer and closer to them until it grabs them with one long appendage that fades into the darkness, still obstructing the rest of the creature. The player could just die there, or they could be pulled deeper into the ocean where it would get even more fucked up.   That's just me, I saw a thread on 4chan earlier about fear of deep oceans. Some colossal thing lurking underwater against the pitch-blackness of the ocean stretching as far as you can see is terrifying to me.  EDIT: Look me in my virtual eyes and tell me this would not be a petrifying thing to look down underwater and see."

I'm not saying your game won't stand out if its 1st person, but besides Forgotten Memories and The Evil Within, what other new 3rd person horror titles are available?  Here are a few things that freak me out:   Glitches for example: When familar places/things start to change in an extremely unusual way. Taken Over When it seems like the paranormal/glitch is taking over the pc/console (This was suggested also).  Nothing terrifies me more than a PC doing what it shouldn't (opening the cd tray, opening other programs, or as the video shows acting like an error has occurred (among others) Suttle jumpscares A psycological horror game can have jump scares, but having too many doesn't make it suttle.

creepygaming,3cckyb,SchizTurtles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:36:30 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot to make me afraid these days.  First off, gore doesn't work.  Me and everyone above the age of 15 has been desensitized to violence.  It's not that it doesn't have it's place, but it generally takes a more subtle type of creepy to scare.  A good example of something that was frightening without gore was Silent Hill 2.  The game did an excellent job by making enemies that were subconsciously frightening.  A mannequin isn't that scary, but a glossy wet multiple legs deformed mannequin was.  Same with the nurses from act 2.  They failed though, with the third common enemy, the door people.  They were creepy, but I think they were shooting for the look of someone trying to escape a painting, and it made more cheesy schlock than legitimately scary.  The subconsciously frightening thing goes deeper than though.  I find myself watching a lot of ""scary"" games on youtube and it's the ones where things are less well defined that really unsettle.  A subdued soundtrack of soft but atonal sounds can go miles to making a game unsettling.  Not knowing why or where you are going can make things unsettling.     I'll point out two examples that almost get it right, but shoot themselves in the foot, Au sable and Gyossait.  Both of them do a good job of setting a mood.  They use vaguely menacing imagery and subdued ambient sound to set a mood.  Things form something that makes sense but are still unsettling.  Both games fail in the same way, by being too much a game.  If anything will take you out of a frightened mood it'd be precision timing and platforming.   And that's an important lesson, the game part of your game is going to seriously affect things.  If the character keeps dying, then dying isn't scary anymore and it loses all it's oomph.  If the character is never in danger it never was scary or had that oomph.   Difficulty is a hard line to walk in this type of game.  I've got a ton more I could say but I'm gonna stop here."

creepygaming,3cckyb,TheCaringArsonist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:47:03 2015 UTC,One thing I can think of is you should focus more on atmosphere and less on jump scares. Silent Hill does this extremely well. I'd say a mark of success in a psychological horror game is when the player is unable to play it for too long due to the atmosphere alone ;) either way good on you for reaching out to the community and I wish you good luck!
creepygaming,3cckyb,KarmelCHAOS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Calm, but overwhelming fear.  In a little indie RPGmaker game called OFF, the world select is black with little dots you can move to. The background music is Silencio, and is arguably one of the scariest tracks in the game. Nothing bad or scary happens in the world select, though.  It's nothing but an overwhelming feeling of dread despite the incredibly minimal (visual, at least) information.  A dark room with constant, human-like clatter, or a deathly silent, twitching figure on the other end of a window you can never get around. Something creeping and overwhelming can really make people just exit out. Take Five Nights at Freddys for example, just waiting for something to happen in the first nights on your first play can make you wanna shut down your computer.  Also, this is personally me, but I have Megalohydrothalassophobia. Basically, a fear of impossibly large creatures in even larger, blank bodies of water.  Even the beginning of Half-Life 2 with the teleporter malfunction made me cringe in fear. An entire game based on this would honestly be unplayable to me. Which is why I want to play one.  Anyways, good luck on your game!"
creepygaming,3cckyb,MyFavrouteCrayfish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"This is something I wrote in this sub forever ago, but I think it fits this thread.  My ideal horror game would be one that's psychologically gripping, like Silent Hill 2. Give the monsters grotesque appearances to make them terrifying, but give them an underlying meaning. Have a genuinely scary setting. I personally don't find old castles scary (i.e. Amnesia), so give it a more modern setting, somewhere you could one day find yourself, to bring you into the setting more.  Do SUBTLE things. That's what I think most of today's horror games are missing, there's nothing subtle about them. In Dead Space, which honestly I think is a great game, there's nothing subtle about necromorphs jumping out in every room and attacking you. One of the things Silent Hill 2 did fantastically was the random sounds every once in awhile, making you wonder if you actually heard it or you were imagining it. Have something appear in one frame to where you're not quite sure you saw it, but then when you go to look again, it's gone. Break the fourth wall. This one is a little trickier, because it can either really enhance the scares...or make them so unbelievable and corny that it hinders them. I think Shattered Memories did this really well, with the voices and phone sounds coming from the wiimote. I don't know if that quite counts as fourth wall breaking, but you never know. There are a bunch of ways I think that could work, such as sending you anonymous messages to your Steam account, or Xbox account or PSN account. Sort of like the way Imscared messes with your directory and adds files, or the way Eternal Darkness tricks you into thinking your system was shut down.  Change things based on your choices in the game. It didn't do it that well, but Shattered Memories asked you psychological questions, and tailored certain things in the game towards your answers. So, affix the game at least slightly, around the person that's playing. I think SM only really did small things, like making a characters breasts bigger, if you showed a penchant for sex. (I swear I'm not making that up.)"
creepygaming,3cckyb,DARKSTARPOWNYOUALL,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Something that scares me personally, is ambiguity, an unknown enemy or even a game that makes me wonder why I am scared. Telling the player that they are in a situation and they need to get out is fine, but I'm much more scared if the horror is very surreal and abstract. I couldn't see more than a minute of sadsatan, (although I'm still not quite sure what it's meant to be.) Overall I think I want a game where I don't know what's happening, I can't trust what I think might be happening and I don't even know if the games events are even real."
creepygaming,3cckyb,Gord10Ahmet,0,Wed Jul 15 04:29:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a massive horror game fan. To me, combat is fine to have in games. The feeling of helplessness is what's important to horror, doesn't have to be there all the time. It doesn't have to be void of combat ala Amnesia/Outlast, but that is a lot better than say F.E.A.R.. Dont do 3rd person by the way. You just lose SO much.  I remember playing STALKER at some places like this http://cop.stalker-game.com/img/screens/xr_cop_screen_014_1280w.jpg , thinking how scary it would be if a horde of zombies or anything came rushing around that corner. Not the slow zombies from STALKER btw, fast rushing things. And I thought, why has something like this never been done?  If you want my take on it, the ""wide open places"" need to be scary to and have them force you into scary darker places.   Good job on asking questions. I can talk for days about how I feel about horror games, so feel free to ask me anything, I'm a BIG fan of the genre done well"

There's multiple ways to complete the game, which is awesome.   For the monster?  Not so much.  I have repeatedly died by walking out of a room I had just come out of and was 110% sure was empty, only to have the monster spawn in said room and pounce me.

creepygaming,3bslab,VladislavThePoker,7,Thu Jul 2 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the laws in Europe, but in the US it's pretty easy to find out where someone lives through property records searches. It all seems very terrifying and real on it's face I'm sure, but the reality of finding information like this in most countries is much more banal. It'd could be as simple as having certain real estate software, or a friend who works as a paparazzi or something.   So when you look at cases of accusation of large scale international abuse like McMartin, the adult making accusations was mentally ill. I'm not saying the victims in Dutroux weren't abused, but rather that prolonged abuse can make an individual unstable and unreliable as a witness. There are also a lot of well-meaning but gullible people in law enforcement and low level government. Bear in mind these are the same ""authorities"" warning us that our kids might be drinking hand sanitizer, something that's also never been documented. People love to whip up fear, and a good old fashioned Devil in the flesh is always popular with the torches and pitchfork crowd. As for identification of individuals.... In McMartin, Chuck Norris was identified as having participated, which was not the case because ultimately no actual evidence was found.  In Dutroux though, I was referring specifically to van Rossem, who seems off in a variety of ways. Also odd to me is that Dutroux seems to be suspected of being responsible for generating this monstrous volume of tapes rather than just collecting them, which... there's a difference between making something and owning something from an objective viewpoint. Sex trafficking is totally real and has been pretty well documented, so while the details are horrifying it's also not like this is a totally new and unheard of thing. As for snuff films, the closest documented real world thing I'm aware of would be Peter Scully or Charles Ng.   Edited to add that the Dutroux article you linked was unreadable after a point, not because of content but rather poor writing and a book length of 19 chapters. Also, it's on a pretty tinfoil-y website and all these claims about international stuff were made by Dutroux himself and then law enforcement did their best to come up with evidence to back that up and failed. Lots of serial killers make crazy claims. Manson said he was Jesus. Doesn't make it so. I personally don't think the police failed out of loyalty to some shadowy secret order but rather that there was simply no corroborating evidence. He is a serial killer though, and they had all the evidence they needed to put him away for that. It's not like Dutroux is walking around free. He's serving a life sentence."

To be clear I am not trying to imply that this ZK that posted about this game is the actual Zodiac Killer. The original Zodiac Killer was active in the 60's and 70's which imply that he was at around 20 when he was active. Which would make him over 60 years old today. Not trying to sound ageist here but I don't know anybody that old that has the technical ability to craft something like this.

creepygaming,3bslab,Clbull,18,Wed Jul 1 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"Hi  I've been prompted to join Reddit and add to this as I find the entire Sad Satan hoax/game/message/whatever extraordinarily fascinating.  It's in relation really to the image of Thatcher and Savile and the comments in that she's not involved with the abuse Savile perpetrated for nearly 5 decades. In fact it's becoming clearer that Thatcher may have known not just about Savile, but abusive paedophiles in her own government such as Leon Brittan, a former minister that died fairly recently.  http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leon-brittan-abused-children-westminster-5038101  Or Peter Morrison.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11323146/Thatcher-confidant-raped-boy-and-police-covered-crime-up.html  There's ongoing investigations into several MP's and current Lords and Thatcher's name keeps coming up as someone that knew, not to mention actively covered up abuse and abusers. She's not the only PM to be accused in such a way, but the sheer number of accusations coming from her time in government has become overwhelming.  Sadly there still appears to be a cover up but outlining everything in detail would take me months, so I recommend people use the investigative news site Exaro for more information.  http://www.exaronews.com/  How this relates to the video I'm not sure, but I find it hard that the person putting it together isn't fully aware of the situation regarding Thatcher, or the current controversy over the cover up of institutional child abuse in the UK because there's tens of thousands of images of Savile, but whoever made this game picked this one I think deliberately.  Anyhow, hope some of what I've posted helps in some way."
creepygaming,3bslab,shuttl3cock,11,Thu Jul 2 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"I forgot to add this Youtube video by campaigner & survivor of child abuse Bill Maloney. It's entitled Sun, Sea and Satan and gives a little bit more insight into the sort of institutional cover up in the UK, or in this case, Jersey, that I think this game is referencing. It's also a pretty creepy video in it's own right as you'll see if you watch it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq6lJsBz9UY  There's also a school of thought that Savile was a Satanist, but at the very least he was part of a circle that abused and helped procure children to powerful people which brings me to this second Maloney video. This one is pretty disturbing as it details allegations that are currently, and finally, being investigated by the police in regards the Elm Guest House.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORU5x-ryedU  Again, I hope this helps fills a gap or prompts someone to make a bigger connection here."

Margaret Thatcher was almost certainly directly complicit in the cover up as her friendships with Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith show that there were paedophiles with very high level connections who repeatedly got out of being charged with any crimes because of their status. As an interesting and disturbing aside, the original report on this paedophile ring which supposedly names a lot of prominent members of the British Establishment still exists, but is being kept from public viewing on grounds of national security. This is all true, just google it."

The Obscure Horror Corner channel's other videos have relatively low view counts, while the Sad Satan videos are much much higher. Also the subscriber count has jumped significantly in the last few days, so /u/86Hachiroku is benefiting directly. Whether that's by luck or design remains to be seen. Again, no disrespect meant.

As for Lee Harvey Oswald (the shooter), conspiracy theorists believe that he was a 'patsy', ie. he took the fall for the real shooter, so the only other connection I can think of here is that maybe the game designer is trying to imply that someone who is being mentioned in the current reports/theories on the child abuse scandals is just a patsy? Although I'm pretty damn sure that's not directed at Saville!  Or in a more general sense, I guess a lot of people might argue that the JFK assassination is the most prolific conspiracy theory of all time (or, at least, it was until 9/11) but if the child abuse scandal ever gets fully revealed it might even eclipse JFK?  I dunno, I guess I'm just throwing a line out now and seeing if anything bites...but then the rest of the images/audio in the game seem so deliberate that it's hard to believe that this one wasn't also?"

creepygaming,3bslab,Soul-Diver,7,Thu Jul 2 23:59:05 2015 UTC,"Sure! Sorry I didn't see this sooner. I'm not too good at this kind of thing, my audio editing software is laughable, but I figured I'd try. This is the clip I modified that I believe may be an excerpt from The Lincolnshire Poacher. I couldn't get it much clearer than that. Likely someone who knows more will have more luck than me on that front. The original begins at about the 10 minute time stamp here and was edited from there. The clip was reversed, sped up, and I tried to get some of the distortion gone.  I also noticed that, if my hunch is right, it seems most of these sound clips were used in Banshee Chapter. Not sure if that's relevant at all."
creepygaming,3bslab,Soul-Diver,10,Fri Jul 3 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"Fair warning: Be a bit careful. I looked up some more information on this game and downloaded some things (like the audio) related to it. With all the tracking messages in the game, I was a bit cautious, but I noticed immediately after that my computer was heating up a lot and running slower than usual. I ran a virus scan and I noticed that a ton of tracking cookies and a worm were in my computer, all from an unknown source. I sometimes get cookies from websites and all, but they're usually trackable, unlike this one. If you're working on this and normally don't do scans, you may want to do a few checks."

creepygaming,3b7rac,SquidsStoleMyFace,11,Fri Jun 26 18:04:43 2015 UTC,Uncommon but it also makes its way to lists.
creepygaming,3b7rac,LordTurner,5,Fri Jun 26 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"Oh i didn't read your post clearly, I thought you were looking for AAA eastereggs. I don't know why, but Halo 1 comes to mind (i'm not even a big halo fan, but we used to tear those games apart for glitches and eastereggs). One thing you could do when you were getting out of a pelican was to throw grenades as fast as you could, just spamming the left trigger. This would cancel out the auto-jump-out command that would dispense you into the level. The pelican would then fly away with you still in it. On the level 343 guilty spark, we discovered a pond that, if you shoot the ground, the bullets reflect back at you. It was the weirdest shit. What's more is you could drop down to where the marines are shooting (far ahead of where you should be) to see floating assault rifles. Not really eastereggs, but I've always found glitches like that to be far more rewarding because instead of seeing what the developers left behind for you to find, you get to see what the never intended for you to find. Halo 2's skulls also come to mind, but those are pretty well known now. I also found a way in the first city of that game to get onto the buildings and run way outside the map, which was awesome because at the time I had never seen any videos on it or anything on gamefaqs, so I assumed it wasn't well known. I even found a sword up on one of the buildings, presumably placed there for developers. There was also an elite that wouldn't notice you ever. Just placed there and forgotten about.   Let's see, the borealis easter egg in portal 2 was really cool, Just about every rockstar game, Dear Ester has those creepy shadow people, The dream sequence in metal gear solid 3, followed by the radio call, etc. If I think of any others, i'll leave them here  EDIT: I don't know if I would call it an easteregg, but the true ending in Braid is worth mentioning. It already had a mindfuck ending, but the secret ending was chilling."
creepygaming,3b7rac,NuclearSquiddy,2,Fri Jun 26 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"Carrying on with what you were saying, MGS2 had a bit when you were swimming to get to Emma, when you come up in one of the breathy vent points, and you went into first person, you saw through a vent, I don't remember if it was Emma or Vamp you were seeing, but it was some really fucking chilling music, freaked me out a lot, every time..  On that, not even an easter egg, but very chilling for me, especially as I was so young, was when one of your villagers died in Black and White, it took me a while to make the link between the villagers dying being the cause but everytime one did, this creepy woman would whisper ""Deeeeeaaath"". Now imagine as  a wee child, my computer whispering Deeeeeaaaath at me at seemingly random intervals.  Freaked me the fuck out man."

I didn't even like looking at the box in the rental store.

The first one was watching my older brother play, because he's older he goes first, a new game we picked up called Sword of the Berserk: Gut's Rage. The intro cutscene was awesome, then the action starts. The screaming and blood seemed just a bit too much, causing me to wonder if this is too violent. I reflected on this and after a while it just stopped bothering me.  The second time was when I borrowed Half-Life from a friends dad. Though it was a school night I decided to squeeze in some play time to see what the hype was about. The intro, at the time, was unlike anything I've seen before. It was very graphic. It gave me nightmares of feeling isolated and helpless in a secret compound with everything falling apart and people dying around me. I remember warning people but in the heat of the panic didn't listen and died or were maimed, nowhere was safe."

Another story isn't really something in the game but more how I found I have a phobia of large bodies of water.

creepygaming,39g1zz,MrWinks,2,Fri Jun 12 11:13:58 2015 UTC,"It's fantastic. 2 (Black Plague) is slightly better than 1 (Overture) but play both back to back for the full experience. In the span of a single night if possible.  3 (Requiem) isn't really a proper Penumbra game, but a physics puzzler similar to Portal, set in the Penumbra world. A lot of people were disappointed but I rather liked it. Just for another taste of the Penumbra atmosphere, even with different gameplay."
creepygaming,39g1zz,Aquareon,3,Fri Jun 12 21:46:44 2015 UTC,Oh! It's coming out September. I was thinking next year.

creepygaming,39g1zz,Dauss,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"Soma (Sanskrit: सोम sóma), or Haoma (Avestan), from Proto-Indo-Iranian *sauma-, was a Vedic ritual drink[1] of importance among the early Indo-Iranians, and the subsequent greater Indian and greater Persian cultures. It is frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, whose Soma Mandala contains 114 hymns, many praising its energizing qualities. In the Avesta, Haoma has the entire Yašt 20 and Yasna 9-11 dedicated to it. It is described as being prepared by extracting juice from the stalks of a certain plant. In both Hindu and Zoroastrian tradition, the name of the drink and the plant are the same, and also personified as a divinity, the three forming a religious or mythological unity. There has been much speculation concerning what is most likely to have been the identity of the original plant. There is no consensus on the question, although some Western experts outside the Vedic and Avestan religious traditions now seem to favour a species of Ephedra, perhaps Ephedra sinica.   TIL."

First, let's assume that a man is just their BRAIN, a huge cluster of information containing your feelings, habits... => your personality. The scientists in the video copied the mind one of their co-workers and put it into the machine hardware (like Ctrl+C Ctrl+V). And hence the question: if we omit the physical differences, WHO IS THE REAL ADAM GOLAZKY? Each consiousness is absolutely identical. The ""machine"" strongly believes he is good old Adam, standing there like nothing had happened. The only thing he didn't realise, he is no more a human being, but I think it's definetely a defence reaction of his mind. Now, imagine that you are being told your mind is now stuck in the ugly pile of metal, ""recorded"" on its hardware. Will it be hard not to turn mad?  -Ramiz S"

Yeah, there is a ton of walking but it's necessary to get you really involved. It may be a bit too big, considering just finding where to go at the start of the game took 15 minutes.  definitely worth it IMO!"

creepygaming,39aprs,HairlessSasquatch,7,Wed Jun 10 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"Any game can be a walking simulator if all you're willing to do is walk in it. It isn't a super action focused FPS, I'll give you that."
creepygaming,399509,Hazard_Zone,21,Wed Jun 10 03:47:28 2015 UTC,"Shadow of the Colossus.   I know this game is like the Reddit circlejerk star of two console generations ago, but it really was a masterpiece. The massive, haunting ruins, juxtaposed with vast tracts of virgin land and sunny viewscapes. Light streaming through the trees of a forest, but across a canyon an area of dark shadow.   I dunno. Maybe you're looking for something even more subtle, but Shadow was always a melancholy mix to me, with hints of horror."
creepygaming,399509,ConnectionIssues,6,Wed Jun 10 04:05:45 2015 UTC,The subtle way your character changes throughout the game is fairly creepy.
creepygaming,399509,BJKWhite,7,Wed Jun 10 08:42:33 2015 UTC,"This game was a straight horror game for me, because I have a phobia of wide open spaces and this game's environments are pretty much nothing but wide open spaces."
creepygaming,399509,Roque14,2,Sat Jun 20 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"It's funny, I was just thinking the same thing but decided against posting a comment because I didn't really have a good reason for why, and I didn't think anyone else would agree.  But yeah, there's definitely a growing sense of melancholy and uneasiness as you get farther and farther through the game, and it's really punctuated by the score. Black Blood is still one of my favorite ""creepy"" tracks in gaming."

creepygaming,399509,ikahjalmr,2,Wed Jun 10 07:23:08 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing that made it creepy was how empty it is.   Sure, you see birds every now and then, and obviously the Colossi, but other than that....nothing. But it's clear it wasn't always like that. There are ruins, so someone had to build them. And the temple. But something happened and now it's just the Colossi. And if the Hero never appeared, they would wander aimlessly for eternity."

I'm not even going to try describing it, but the atmosphere gets creepier as you play. Not only do the subtle changes to the ""zones"" get weirder, but this uneasy feeling of being followed- like there's somebody right behind you the whole time. It's not scary in the sense that it was meant to be, but it gets to you after a while."

No game I've ever played in my decades of gaming has even come close to the atmosphere in those games."
creepygaming,399509,Meoang,4,Wed Jun 10 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"When I bought my Xbox in 2003/4, I immediately picked up a copy of Silent Hill 2 because I was a fairly big horror movie fan, even at 13/14. That game became an obsession for me; I've beaten it at least 30 times over the last 13 years, and every single time it tears at my heart in the exact same way. The voice acting may not have been super, but the emotions were real. I'll never forget Angela crying out how she'd ""been bad"" when the Abstract Daddy was attacking her; the holes in the walls, pumping rhythmically, speaking volumes about her history without saying a word...    Damnit, now I gotta play it again."
creepygaming,399509,Telodzrum,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"The voice acting may not have been super, but the emotions were real.

creepygaming,399509,k8207dz,6,Wed Jun 10 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"Velvet Assassin (a WW2 stealth game) is a good example.  It takes place in the mind of the lead character (a British spy who is seriously injured in a French hospital), and has a bleak, psychological tone you don't often see in World War II games. You see sights like this, and ending spoiler.  It never tips over into outright horror, but it often feels like it could."

creepygaming,399509,Kaiden103,5,Wed Jun 10 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"Dark souls series. Even though parts of the game are full of vast lands, colorful and vibrant, some dark and looming, there was this subtle sense of dread and loneliness.   One of my favorite things about it that really gave it that creepy atmosphere is when you talk to NPCs, there is no music or background noise, it's just their voice that seems to resonate and Echo, usually telling of some foreboding or depressing tale"
creepygaming,399509,Fallen_Angle,3,Wed Jun 10 10:44:29 2015 UTC,"The Catacombs were probably the creepiest part, that is, until you descended into the Tomb of Giants.  The game made you feel so small no matter where you were, the amazing feeling of beating a boss would always clash with that horribly creeping sense of discomfort and a sense that you ""didn't belong"" in this dying world... to describe the experience is to do it injustice.  You have to experience it yourself."
creepygaming,399509,Necromunger,4,Sat Jun 13 05:32:00 2015 UTC,I found some parts of the creepiness in Stalker: Call of pripyat very subtle. Like a school room thing i found with the drawing from children.  Although other parts of the game are a lot more obvious with creepiness.

For those of you who don't know what it is, basically a mostly underwater survival game similar to Stranded Deep, but on a distant water-filled planet. Graphics are very cutesy most of the time, but a lot of the game can have a really creepy atmosphere. The awesome sound design makes you pretty damn creeped out at times, but the very realistic sense of everything being so huge and vast also gets me."

The skeletons everywhere (especially the suburbs/ children's playgrounds) were pretty sinister too (inb4 2SPOOPY).  Creeped me out anyways, probably because of the FPS action parts of the games get you so used to noise and light and then when it is taken away it's downright chilling as a juxtaposition."
creepygaming,391yit,DavidSixtyFour,6,Mon Jun 8 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"The game is a first person exploration game (Similar to Dear Esther) that puts the player following the path of the doomed Dyatlov Pass Incident years later.   The game places you in a huge open world environment and gives you a map and compass to navigate from landmark to landmark and gradually discover what really happened to the hikers. The pacing is excellent and shifts between an almost peaceful tranquility in the beautiful natural environment to terror when the mysterious orange fog rolls in or, smoldering ghosts appear, and horror when you slowly learn what has been going on.  There is also some excellent narration from Sean Bean that is not overused, and very enjoyable when it does appear. The environmental effects and soundtrack are great, the latter featuring an appearance by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn who has also done some excellent work on a number of the Silent Hill soundtracks (Perhaps most notable Shattered Memories)."

creepygaming,388xhf,dumppee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"For anyone considering, I'd say this bundle is worth it for The Moon Sliver alone.

Plus the audio for that section is spot-on.  The question is what audio tracks will be used. I think despite the lack of 8-bitness in some of these tracks, the tracks used as background music in the narration of the creepypasta by Goji73 should be used."

creepygaming,37eyqv,BeefBreeze,1 point,Wed May 27 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting find regardless.  I don't buy the ""it's just bowser"" explanation. If all the rest are just fuzzy screens, why would they bother creating and slotting in a picture of bowser just to hide it in a few subliminal frames? It's not the kind of thing they would need to conceal, since they made the asset you think you'd probably work on at least using it somewhere, or at the very least not sliding it in a couple of frames during some random area transition, especially since all the rest are just blank.  Begs the question why they slot anything in there though. Something subliminal? Something to scare 12 year old sisters? Might just be a weird graphical glitch, but it's too defined to be a coincidental pattern imo, maybe it is pulling an artefact from something that got cut from design but not fully erased? Who knows, as I said though, interesting find."

creepygaming,37adn9,Steely_Jackson,5,Tue May 26 06:33:05 2015 UTC,"Right. I use a program that corrupts a ROM file, which when loaded into an emulator yields strange results, like this. Depending on how you corrupt it (How many bytes you corrupt, how you corrupt each byte, which bytes you corrupt, etc.) you will get different results. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it just crashes, and sometimes it's super creepy, but after all the time I've been corrupting ROMs, (It's been a couple years now) I have never ever found a corruption as scary as this one..."
creepygaming,37adn9,Steely_Jackson,2,Tue May 26 13:54:09 2015 UTC,Ok I see. The thing is I didn't find anything creepy about it. Just seemed glitchy. Or is that dead kong at the end non existent in the real game?
creepygaming,37adn9,Steely_Jackson,3,Tue May 26 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"The Dead Diddy Kong is DEFINITELY not supposed to be there... It's just supposed to be a crate that you can break open. So it was just like, my friend and I were messing around with the corruption, (Which already creeped us out, due to the creepy music) and he goes in there, rides the rope across, and suddenly there's a dead Diddy Kong lying there. We were freaking out!  That sprite IS in the game, when you die as Diddy that's what he looks like until he hits the ground, (Once he hits the ground he sits up a scratches his head) except the color palette is different. (The one at the end of this video has a greenish color palette which makes it look like his body is rotting or something...)"

creepygaming,37adn9,Steely_Jackson,1 point,Tue May 26 12:26:13 2015 UTC,"The ROM is basically all the games code, and all the art assets in one file. There are tools that change a single byte, or a number of bytes, and the rom is now corrupted (no longer original). This may also happen in a physical copy by degradation over time or some other kind of failure of the rom chips.  People do this on purpose, to get funny results, weird graphics, etc. I'd recommend this video, and the dude has a few others of other games in the channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITfzLGNc0RY  It generally works better with older games, because they are simpler, and the chance of fatally breaking something is lower."

He just acted creepy for attention, and once the cult around him started, he didnt make posts with his name any more so he could keep the image of this weird player and dissociate himself from the talk about the game. Props to him for still being relevant to the game so many years later and not coming out of character too much. He could easily make a youtube series or something like that documenting his creepy antics, but instead he still lays low and tries to get a scare out of anyone who plays the game looking for creepy things.

creepygaming,36fqzs,forcehatin,2,Tue May 19 03:24:12 2015 UTC,Thank You
creepygaming,36fqzs,Brokenglass126,2,Tue May 19 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"You can also get it on GOG, I have had no issue with their version"
creepygaming,36fqzs,Ekiriam,1 point,Tue May 19 08:07:00 2015 UTC,"I had no trouble out of the steam version, personally. Myself and a coworker played through it last week. His first time playing it. I was 13 when this game came out, and it was one of those games that stuck with me from that era. The oddities I experienced in that game was like no other. It got me into that genre of games, playing phantasmagoria 1 and 2 over and over again, as well."
creepygaming,36cnaz,CrystalFissure,4,Mon May 18 09:07:49 2015 UTC,"This is definitely more creepy than the Spyro 2 video I linked, because unlike that one, the area here is cutoff at a point. Sandover Village is one of the first levels in Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. What happens is that you load the cutscene in which you leave the location, and then take the disk out of the PS2."

creepygaming,36c3pc,Thanics,3,Mon May 18 07:36:24 2015 UTC,I once bought a second hand laptop and it had a game called hunt.exe i don't remember much playing it.it was an 8 bit game and u hav to kill people and keep on killing in the forest. much like texas chainsaw massacre in the atari 2600.i googled hunt but it doesn't show up.. guess its a bootleg then.
creepygaming,36c3pc,crossM92,3,Tue May 19 08:54:39 2015 UTC,"Not so creepy, but I played this bootleg Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets game on Gameboy Color that was a sidescroller (real game is an turn based RPG) and you fought character from the movie, even Hermione and Ron. Voldemort looked nightmarish.   Also, what was that about the Lion King game? Please explain. I keep thinking of the Lion King creepypasta."
creepygaming,36c3pc,crossM92,4,Fri May 22 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"OP here. There exists a bootleg lion king game for NES which has game over screens that are animated. all three of which depict characters from the movie killing themselves. Timon buries himself alive, Pumba jumps into a boiling pot and Simba hangs himself. Look it up, it is not a creepypasta and is actually real."
creepygaming,36c3pc,CrystalFissure,2,Sat May 23 03:46:53 2015 UTC,I actually found it. What the hell? Why? Its like an actual creepypasta

creepygaming,368ppj,mydadhitsme,2,Mon May 18 03:13:25 2015 UTC,I think people are upset it's not traditionally horror. But there's something eerie about being in a cutscene by yourself.

The first Internet puzzle started on January 5, 2012, and ran for approximately one month. A second round began one year later on January 5, 2013, and a third round is ongoing following confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 5, 2014.   The stated intent was to recruit ""intelligent individuals"" by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved, each in order, to find the next. No new puzzles were published on January 5, 2015.  The puzzles focused heavily on data security, cryptography, and steganography.

If you uninstall the store, you lose the game too.  2) Keeping the store on your phone allows Amazon to collect a TON of information on your phone usage, cookies, contact list, etc, and they can use that info wherever they like (like to sell to advertisers, keep records, etc).

creepygaming,35qtdk,Glitchwinslet,3,Wed May 13 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"Shit, it's kinda hard to explain.  It was a game allegedly made by aliens, and the game was put into the guy who received it (Sean M. Puckett), in his hard drive.  So he split it into two parts, Helious, whom was shareware, and Helious II, which, at the time, you could get for money. But nowadays, you can get both Helious and Helious II for free.  The gameplay isn't exactly that great, you kinda have a level select, that you can choose your level with a tentacle, and even that is kinda hard to explain. But, in the levels--the backgrounds are a tiling pattern/texture, and you control a balloon-ish thing, and you can use hot gas to maneuver around. But alas, physics also apply here, so you have to slow down. And if you use hot air/fuel, your balloon will shrink. And if you exhume all of your fuel, you'll be taken back to the level select.  Sometimes in the levels, there are enemies. I think you have to spray fuel to kill them, but they don't exactly pose much of a threat. And to complete the level--you'll have to find a gem to escape.  And if you'll complete all levels in Helious, you'll get a bit strange ""ending"" screen.  But in Helious II, your tentacle kinda resists you, but it'll go to a level.  And Helious II is way much harder. Jesus christ. It's not cheap like Megaman Eternal or I Wanna Be The Guy. It's just hard.  Currently, nobody has beat Helious II to see the ending, because it's fucking hard."

I don't really expect it to blow up like the Bloodstained kickstarter did. It was exciting to watch and be apart of though."
creepygaming,35o4av,pickelsurprise,3,Tue May 12 05:09:14 2015 UTC,"This looks like it could be really cool. Unfortunately I've just become a bit cynical as far as kickstarted games go. I'll take a few days to decide if I want to back it or not, but I'm glad they already hit their goal."
creepygaming,35o4av,Kilvoctu,2,Tue May 12 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"Hoping the holdouts such as yourself will lend your support before the campaign's end. While they've hit their goal already, yes, I feel that with more support comes a more embellished experience.    It's been a while since a concept has piqued my interest as much as Tokyo Dark, and ideally the devs don't pull any punches on disturbing content."
creepygaming,35o4av,pickelsurprise,2,Thu May 14 05:25:29 2015 UTC,"I really want to have faith, but a lot of the time it's just such a huge gamble. I don't know anything about this developer, so I have no idea whether they're trustworthy or not. The fact that they hit their goal so quickly does comfort me a little, but they still have to be able to actually handle that funding and not squander it just because they're getting more than they thought they would."
creepygaming,35caau,peepjynx,29,Fri May 8 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry Bud, but it's not gonna happen.  And as awesome as P.T was, what a lot of people seem to forget is that when you beat it, they make it clear that it isn't a direct representation of how the game would play. For all we know it wouldn't even be in first person which was kind of a huge part of what  made P.T so effective.  This whole thing sucks, sure, but whose to say Kojima and Del Torro won't team up again in the future and make something creepy without having to be tied to the Silent Hill IP?  Kojima Productions is now a free agent, find the right publisher and maybe we can really see what happens when they let their hair down."

creepygaming,35caau,yookalyptus,7,Sat May 9 00:21:59 2015 UTC,The game itself doesn't have to be called Silent Hill. I think the point of this is to potentially show him how many people liked P.T and maybe convince him to work on another horror game/spiritual successor.
creepygaming,35caau,flarnot,16,Sat May 9 00:36:10 2015 UTC,Waste of time
creepygaming,35caau,HairlessSasquatch,16,Fri May 8 23:30:39 2015 UTC,"Jesus christ enough with the fucking pointless petitions, they don't even do anything or have any weight.   I love P.T. as much as anyone else, but accept reality for fucks sake, just hope for the best that Kojima is going to have a spiritual successor eventually."
creepygaming,35caau,Jack_Ryker,7,Sat May 9 00:19:15 2015 UTC,"Whilst this would be cool, Kojima can't legally do this and Konami aren't exactly known for actually listening to consumers or critics."
creepygaming,35caau,ranmaster,3,Sat May 9 06:46:47 2015 UTC,Konami physically took Kojima's Studio away and renamed it their Los Angeles Branch. He is basically just sitting around twiddling his thumbs until his contract is up/he can freely move on. Of course when they do officially release him he will probably have to sign all kinds of stuff that will prevent him working with competing companies for 5 - 6 years.   Also another fun fact is that Konami is exiting the video game industry and going to outsource their games to third party developers and continue focusing on making pachinko machines in Japan/other tech.
creepygaming,35caau,raspberrykraken,2,Sat May 9 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"Of course when they do officially release him he will probably have to sign all kinds of stuff that will prevent him working with competing companies for 5 - 6 years.   You mean, they will try to persuade him to sign those by offering him money if he does? Otherwise I don't see how they can force him.  But that's probably beside the point, since California has a strong law making non-compete clauses automatically void for employees (which is not true of all states), so as long as he stays there, that won't be an issue.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause#California  If he returns to Japan, a non-compete is still unlikely to be enforceable:  http://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/gtdt_webinar_maintainingemploymentnoncompeteagreements.pdf"

creepygaming,35e6rq,Coldcat99,5,Sat May 9 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"So done with this game. Sure, first game was interesting, second one pretty interesting too but after that it just became repetitive. Maybe if he put some more time working on the game instead of rushing them, it could still be interesting. Another factor is the shitty fanbase (not everybody of course, I mean the RP'ers and all).  It's like Scott finally found a cash cow and now milks it out until the very last drop. I don't blame him though, but maybe he should get a little rest."
creepygaming,35e6rq,DoritoCow,9,Sat May 9 16:38:02 2015 UTC,If he was in it as a cash cow then the 4th one would be out already.  He is releasing this one 7 months after the 3rd one which is about the longest he has spent making one of them.  I have faith that it will be good.  I haven't seen any of the first 3 as bad games at all. He's not even charging much to buy them either.  I've seen lower quality games on steam for more money.
creepygaming,35e6rq,xandan,1 point,Sat May 9 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"Still, considering first game was out in August 2014 (early of said month), it's pretty much four similar games within bit over one year's time-span."

creepygaming,35e6rq,xandan,-3,Sat May 9 19:40:53 2015 UTC,It won't be good.  It will be Youtube clickbait material as it always has been.

It gives more credibility to Yahtzee, as most people who read his articles and watch his game reviews assume that he got to the position with his original Darkness review (which is somewhat true) but he is actually a talented game designer and his interest in video games as a story-telling and immersion device really comes out in the works he created."

Life developed in a habitable terminator zone between hemispheres that were constantly scorched or perpetually frozen. The harsh conditions of Suen's surface forced the rachni to forage underground amid sprawling subterranean river systems. Sometime at the height of the Prothean Empire, the Protheans discovered the rachni and bred them as weapons of war, selecting for the most cunning and warlike queens and unleashing rachni swarms on their enemies. Eventually, the rachni became too difficult to control and turned on their Prothean masters. The Protheans attempted to eradicate the rachni and destroyed as many as 200 worlds before they were satisfied the rachni were extinct, but enough survived on Suen to replenish their population.

Upon entering the area the Hero arrives on a beautiful snow-covered path bordered by tall pine trees. A soft snow falls, and although it is night time, and a dim glow is cast over the area by a series of lanterns. The Hero must follow the road over a small bridge before turning the corner to see a pleasant little cottage (not unlike a winter version of the idyllic Serenity Farm). As the Hero walks up to the cottage, they can see a warm glow of a fireplace and a cosy little inn where travelers may take refuge from the cold of winter. As the Hero eagerly steps through the door, the scene drastically, and startlingly, changes. A shrill noise breaks the silence and the welcoming light and warmth vanishes. The cottage is shown in true colour: a derelict, and ransacked, torture den.

creepygaming,344sdk,Opti101,15,Tue Apr 28 08:22:40 2015 UTC,Well it's a Halloween themed song - it's got a picture of Jack (the pumpkin-headed character that only appears around Halloween) on the album cover. So I don't think it's out of place because it's meant to be creepy. It's actually one of my favourite AC songs (that and Hypno K.K. - which is also pretty creepy).
creepygaming,344sdk,ManicWolf,6,Tue Apr 28 09:44:04 2015 UTC,This song is only creepy to me because of Aika Village.

creepygaming,344sdk,CharlesManson420,4,Tue Apr 28 18:08:25 2015 UTC,Not in a game for children. It's filled with sudden loud noises and stuff. It also doesn't just play on halloween. It can earned any time of the year.
creepygaming,344sdk,TwoUnicycles,3,Tue Apr 28 23:21:27 2015 UTC,Username relevant? It doesn't play on Halloween. You can get it anytime and it is one of like two songs that are this creepy. Why be so negative?
creepygaming,344sdk,IsaacIsLazy,9,Wed Apr 29 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"Whenever something seems oddly out of place -- in a game, or a book, or in your medicine cabinet, or an unexpected email from your parents -- you have to admit the possibility that it's not actually out of place, maybe everything else around it is out of place, maybe everything else is just camouflage, maybe this odd discomfiting detail is the very center of meaning and there's something terribly critical, some fundamental understanding of the true nature of things, that you've missed.  Or, you know. Could be nothing."

Also there will be an Outlast 2 (don't know if it will make it to Steam 2015), a new Fatal Frame, another Walking Dead game and, my personal favourite, a new Call of Cthulhu game.  Also there are many indie games being developed. For example Soma, a game called Dollhouse, also Routine, which plays in a station on the moon. With The Hum: Abductions there will also be a game which looks like some kind of alien-survival-game.

creepygaming,342re0,Dauss,8,Tue Apr 28 10:35:51 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, FNAF was never a very 'good' game. It isn't complex or very deep, the mechanics are very simple.  What FNAF does right (for the most part) is be a dread simulator. It works best when you don't fully understand the game mechanics because that's when you're confused, and you never know what will be there when you lower your monitor, or look at that vent.  Unfortunately sooner or later the game is broken down to its base elements and a simple pattern emerges that you can adhere to and that's when the game really bottoms out and you see it for what it is, babysitting a bunch of jumpscares and closing a door/putting on a mask/playing an audio file to hamper the one that's going to get to you next.  I don't think Scott is really 'gaming' anyone, he's just found something that sells, and I don't blame him for milking it until it stops being successful."

If there are 100 posts about FNaF on the front page, those few other posts not about it are going to get drowned out and overlooked, so us posting something else won't even matter. It's also up to you guys to post quality content, not to flood the subreddit with all of the same stuff when there are other subreddits designed specifically for FNaF."

There's also the ""Blackwell"" series which are more paranormal mystery than horror but still great. That series is made by Wadjet Eye Games, most of their catalog is horror/sci-fi/mystery point-and-click with a great old-school feel. Just a shame that not all of their games have been ported to Android yet, nothing like tucking in bed, lights off, headphones in and getting stuck into a good horror/mystery."

creepygaming,32q9ma,Karmatix,26,Wed Apr 15 21:08:48 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously the atmosphere for one.  Aside from that though, I would say a lot of the horror comes from traveling through the same hallway over, and over, and over again, with it slowly becoming more nightmarish each time. Adding on to that, the fact that the hallway itself is very ""uncanny-valley-y"" in that it just has things that are off about it (Stuck clocks, general silence with the occasional weird noise or radio broadcast). I suppose that could be considered part of the atmosphere as well, but I think it's worth considering on its own.  Makes me wonder. Make a small game where you wake up in a large-ish house. Have everything accessible from the start but cannot leave. Player must find key somewhere in house. Maybe have somethings change positions, but subtly whenever you leave a room. Find key, go to front door, open it, basic jumpscare. Probably be pretty effective."
creepygaming,32q9ma,Applepienation,22,Wed Apr 15 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"A rough brain spasm list:   It has an amazing lifelike environment...this isn't so important, but it lends credibility to the experience. Anticipation. Being asked to step through the same space over and over...you know something's going to happen, and you're possibly ""going deeper"" with each cycle Cryptic information. A lot of P.T. doesn't explain much, but offers food for imagination. Lack of control. What are your options? You can only move and look...you have no recourse for any confrontation, other than to look at a wall. It instils a sense of helplessness. It makes it clear that there's no rules. Anything might happen; a ghost appearing in the corridor, the hallway changing, things appearing behind you. You're not safe. It makes you ask questions about who you are, where you are, who the people are in the photos, where sounds are coming from. It doesn't outright answer any of these; generally your own imagination will be more powerful at making you scared than the game itself. Lighting. It begins bright and takes that away from you. The ghost itself; creepy movement, 'inhuman' positioning. IT's clearly not correct, and makes you question your sanity because you're expecting to see something that makes sense. General creepy sounds with no discernable source, put you on edge."

creepygaming,32q9ma,redditorrage,6,Mon Jul 6 00:33:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the eeriness of slowly walking through the house those first few times, and the minimal controls, and the lack of ambient spooky music at the start really helps create a creepy atmosphere, but being fully honest, i think its only really scary at those moments. Once you get past the weird red corridor with the eyeball pictures, i feel a lot of the creepy atmosphere is killed and it ends up being almost frustrating. I love puzzle games, dont get me wrong, but i feel like no game should require its players to look up how to complete it, there should be SOME clues, rather than just leaving you helpless and confused. But then again, its only a demo, and a very well made one at that, so it can bend those rules a bit."
creepygaming,32q9ma,Jack_Ryker,2,Wed Apr 15 21:39:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it was to get people to work together, and, in an equally important light,   spread the word of P.T. By asking ""What the hell do I do?!"" everywhere. Making people search for an answer made the game more prevalent and made people discuss the game in an in depth manner.   But I do agree that the abstract nature of the puzzles caught me off guard. If I knew beforehand how abstract the puzzles would be, then I feel like I could solve them a bit easier than having no clue that I have to force my perception of reality in relation to the game in different ways."
creepygaming,32q9ma,xxHikari,3,Thu Apr 16 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"Wow never thought of that actually. The whole spread the word is pretty interesting. For some reason though Hideo Kojima likes to break the 4th wall with his games. Then whole psycho mantis thing, so its not really surprising."
creepygaming,32q9ma,DanDoubler,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:38:16 2015 UTC,I agree. To be forced to look up some of the puzzles kinda took the charm away. But they were pretty unique and scary though. The sit still and walk a few steps and speaking into the mic was really well down. However the one puzzle that you had to go into the menu and press a button to get the picture piece was a bit... strange.
creepygaming,32q9ma,insanitune,2,Wed Apr 15 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the use of the soundscape to kinda lure you into uneasiness. The jumpscare are warranted and tasteful as well as creepy. And the general atmosphere of the radio, and when you see the ghost outside etc etc. It all adds into something that made me feel physically ill while playing"
creepygaming,32q9ma,Shazza1990,2,Thu Apr 16 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"The Grate Theory on YouTube posted a video recently that talks through how Silent Hill games in general create this overwhelming sense of anxiety as you progress through the game. If you have half hour of your time it's a good analysis on some of the ploys that they use to instill fear in us. For example a good point they raised that I don't think I realised is that if you generally map out the continuous  progressions through the repeating hallway sequence (apart from t' mad eyebally one) it maps out a continuing downward spiral. Something that Silent Hill has employed throughout the series that instills a sense of anxiety. I suppose it's the descent aspect of it; in silent hill 2 there was that part in the museum by the lake where you progressed down a never-ending staircase, SCP-087-B gives us that sense as well although your senses are probably overwhelmed in that game by the atmosphere. Anyway give it a watch, the theory they suggested is pretty labyrinthian but if you look at the analysis of the games vibes then it might be something you're after. Tension followed by jumpscare followed by relief followed by jumpscare is what tends to be the key to it though, no?"
creepygaming,32q9ma,PM_Me_YoSecrets,2,Wed Apr 22 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"take a familiar environment and turn it on its ass.  fear is due almost completely to the unknown, especially when you take something that's supposed to be safe and give it a new, unexpected twist"

Lighting, of which there is plenty in the beginning, and the game gets slowly darker and more eerie. The mysteriousness of the setting. You have no idea what is going on, and can only piece together very small bits of information as you continue to progress through the hallway. How downright disturbing some of the things are, and how abrupt they are. You generally expect something to happen, but when you first see the ghost, it's very much an ""OH FUCK!"" moment. The supernatural elements to it all. The ghost itself is creepy as fuck, and it's kind of implied that if she kills you, she rapes your corpse. In addition to that, the sink fetus is horrifying."

creepygaming,32qh9v,Jack_Ryker,4,Thu Apr 16 03:03:45 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate. Konami should back away from Silent Hills, and Kojima should work on it independently."
creepygaming,32qh9v,Jack_Ryker,4,Thu Apr 16 05:01:53 2015 UTC,"If Konami did that, I'd have huge respect for them. But, after some digging it seems Kojima was fired due to a power struggle with upper management. My guess is they said they wanted more control over Kojima's works. Which he obviously disagreed with.  Of course, they haven't outright said anything yet and Kojima legally can't either."
creepygaming,32qh9v,Jack_Ryker,4,Thu Apr 16 13:04:06 2015 UTC,Wow that sounds petty. Glad he's getting out of there.
creepygaming,32qh9v,Zidlijan,3,Thu Apr 16 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's just sad though, cause this is supposed to be the final MGS. He wants to go out with a bang. But, from a recent announcement it seems Konami wants to reboot MGS after MGS5 is released and without Kojima."
creepygaming,32qh9v,Zidlijan,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine having your series not end on your own terms would make anyone angry enough to leave.

I think it's unnecessary and disrespectful to Kojima, who has been such an integral part of MGS."
creepygaming,32qh9v,mastersergeant98,2,Thu Apr 16 16:46:04 2015 UTC,Exactly. MGS is his baby. He's been caring for it for over 20 years. I have no doubts he'll continue to do great things still. Just this whole thing is scummy.

creepygaming,32m8xq,idonthateyouanymore,2,Tue Apr 14 23:07:47 2015 UTC,The arms that break through the windows in that hallway in resident evil 2 was the best jump scare for me.

Everyone loves Five Nights at Freddy's (I'm sure a lot of people here do too) but it's literally just a game of jump scares.

creepygaming,32m8xq,rage_quitter,5,Wed Apr 15 19:23:02 2015 UTC,I'm assuming he ment P.T. which is a playable teaser of the new Silent Hills game coming out.
creepygaming,32m8xq,deadlyenmity,3,Wed Apr 15 03:15:29 2015 UTC,Ahhhhh... But that has its share of jump scares. Or at least the most traumitizing jump scare of all time... I'd say silent hill one and RE1 are the best examples of good atmosphere. Thanks for clarifying for me.
creepygaming,32m8xq,idonthateyouanymore,2,Wed Apr 15 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the jumpscares aren't over abundant, unlike something like FNaF."
creepygaming,32m8xq,rage_quitter,2,Wed Apr 15 04:00:34 2015 UTC,I dunno PT had more jumpscares in it than almost all of Silent Hill 2. It's a bit strange to pick PT over basically anything from the original Team Silent run when talking about atmosphere.
creepygaming,32m8xq,idonthateyouanymore,6,Wed Apr 15 04:15:58 2015 UTC,"In my original response I was talking about the original SH. But PT did a lot of things well and the jumpscares are earned. You don't fear the jumpscare you fear what created that scare, which is good. Unlike, again, FNaF where you fear the loud screech coming from your headphones rather than the thing making that noise."

Anyway, it was a playable trailer for the new Silent Hill game. It's not very long, but the last puzzle is really difficult and even though it's super short, it's honestly scarier than anything I've ever played.

creepygaming,32m8xq,Itthatbetrays,6,Wed Apr 15 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"For me, the more subtle the change, the more horrific it is when you realize it. When you play games, you constantly make note of where things are, especially when you're first starting out and trying to get your bearings on where everything is.   I'm talking super minor things: change which direction a fan is facing, which side of the room a lamp is on, or where a stack of papers are... things that are so little that they may not even be noticed in the first place... but there will eventually be that moment where the player re-enters a room and thinks... ""wait, is this the same room? I thought that thing was over there... maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention at first...""  Eventually, the horror can be ramped up from there. Full screen jumpscares and loud noises can have their place if used correctly, but they're often used cheaply and far too often. A jumpscare says ""OMG I'M GOING TO DIE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO REACT"" and subtle scares say ""I don't even know if I'm going to die or not... I just know something's not right and I can't do anything about it"""

creepygaming,32m8xq,frzfrz,10,Thu Apr 16 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"Have it to where you can't pause the game in the middle of intense moments. If the user pauses the game for too long change up the room a bit to give the impression something moved things around when the user wasn't looking. Have enemies that run by noisily when in a tight spot, like squeezing through an opening, but keep going without noticing you. Have an enemy that makes a loud constant noise that gets quieter the closer you are to it, good for something otherworldly."
creepygaming,32m8xq,SergeantStapler,5,Wed Apr 15 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"That gave me a good idea.

You don't fight it, you don't run from it, you just see it and have the ""knowledge"" that something is in the location with you."
creepygaming,32m8xq,toxicapathy,2,Tue Apr 14 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"Good direction. You could even make it impossible for the user to reach it, even if they rush to it.  Build up to the eventual confrontation."

creepygaming,32m8xq,ras344,8,Wed Apr 15 03:13:42 2015 UTC,I'm late to the party but here's my two cents:    What scares me are unexpected changes to your environment. You can make the player backtrack through the building but behind a door you've already been through is suddenly a different room. Maybe even make it somewhat random so that the player is never sure what to expect around the corner. There are no safe places if you run back. Because the building is as evil as the rest of the threats around you.
creepygaming,32m8xq,Pariahterror,2,Fri Apr 24 23:47:10 2015 UTC,"I really liked how in Amnesia the corruption visibly follows you, taking over the house as you go. It's basically being consumed by some life form that you have no way to stop, and if you don't keep moving it will consume you too."
creepygaming,32m8xq,Szwejkowski,5,Wed Apr 15 11:34:48 2015 UTC,"Either the inability to defend yourself, or even worse: the illusion that you can defend yourself. Give the player guns/weapons, but they're ineffective at best. Enemies that can clearly see/interact with you, but that you can only detect in certain ways. Perhaps you can hear them, but can't see them. Or maybe you can only see them from a particular angle, or if they're not looking directly at you. Maybe it can only approach you if you're not looking at it. Maybe when you look at it, it stops and just stares at you. Maybe as you get closer to it, it slowly fades until you can't see it.  Generally the unknown and unexplainable are pretty terrifying. Things that can't/shouldn't exist or happen. Something (an enemy maybe) moving in a strange way, skittering across the screen in an impossible pattern, or moving as if time has slowed for it, but increasing to impossible speeds when it spots you. Things that change depending on how you look at them. Unpredictable enemies and environments, maybe rooms that change or rearrange themselves when you enter/leave. Look into HP Lovecraft, he discusses non euclidean geometry/cyclopean architecture a lot in his literature. Reading those passages in Call of Cthulhu and Mountains of Madness was one of the first time a book has scared me.   Darkness/obscured vision are extremely good tools. Amnesia: The Dark Descent understood this."
creepygaming,32m8xq,123123sora,8,Wed Apr 15 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"Besides atmosphere, I would suggest breaking the 4th wall.  Also, have you ever played ""imscared.exe""? I definitely recommend it. The atmosphere and the way it messes with you and your pc is excellent."
creepygaming,32m8xq,mehtulupurazz,5,Tue Apr 14 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but something about that style of graphics and sounds really gets to me. I find it a lot scarier than any more realistic monsters."
creepygaming,32m8xq,mehtulupurazz,6,Wed Apr 15 00:35:14 2015 UTC,"It is all about atmosphere.  When you make music for it, make it first as it was normal, but the longer you play the darker the music becomes, even in the start menu the music should get darker and it synchronizes with the current saves.  You can move stuff in chambers where the player has been and will go through again, but only if it can be explained. If it had been changed by an entity, make sure you know why it didn't went after the player but disappeared.  Let the game be possessed. Give it small mouse movements when the player is busy (not when he isn't doing anything)  Make it so that the longer the game is played, the less light there is (towards a certain point).  Create shadows of creatures (mouse/rats/bugs) and let them walk around, make sounds of those creatures dashing. Let them move in the walls.  Add a big houseclock which you can hear through a big area and muffle the sound bit by bit. You can also let it go slower.  Rain and thunder can help to produce extra mystery to it.  Add some music for when they are being chased (not too loud), in a later fase of the game, play that music at random or at certain points and stop playing it when the player encounters monsters/enemies or at least for some of them.  Add echoes for certain rooms/hallways/caves. From both the players movement as the movement of other things.  Doors that squeak sometimes. By adding this, the player doesn't feel that safe anymore because of the sounds he makes.  Change where the rooms are which are the same in size. Just disorientate them, for example, the player walks from a hallway into a room through door 1 and back again, but let them exit in another hallway or door 2 of the hallway.  Add some lore to the game with scrambled pieces of papers. text that makes no sense or just random symbols.  let some encounters be impossible at the first and maybe second time and then let them through. Or just the opposite when they play again with a new save, make an encounter which was easy in the first run impossible in the second for 1 or 2 attempts and then let them through.  Add mirrors where you sometimes can see some people in it but not always. And when the player stares in the mirror for a long time, let it break (also not every mirror, but on random).  Add a family painting where over time, people are starting to get missing and sometimes people get added.  Flickering lights, especially when the player has been through a checkpoint or has to reach it.  Don't add all of above tips at once, but let them appear one by one or even 2 at once, but not more."
creepygaming,32m8xq,mehtulupurazz,5,Wed Apr 15 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"Lots of people saying atmosphere - I agree and I think a key part of atmosphere in games is sound. The Thief 3 level 'The Cradle' is a good example of sound used to petrify.  Nothing else quite has the primal shortcut to fight or flight that sound seems to have. They tend to overdo it musically a lot these days, but non musical cues tend to work better for fear - static on the radio when bad shit's coming was a good example of this.  You can train your player to feel dread before anything happens if a sound is tied in with the onset of bad stuff. Maybe a quietly ticking clock a couple of rooms away stops ticking before events, or the dog a few houses down starts (or stops) barking. At it's best, it's background stuff quiet enough to only be on the edge of awareness - something the conscious mind might not pick up on, but the subconscious will.  And as /u/Coldhell says unnatural things be scary, so taking something usually benign or unnoticed and changing it can be very effective. Most of us find voices running backwards creepy as fuck for instance, but subtler warping or discord also works. A fair example of this is the picture box theme music, turning what should have been a delightful child's program into a source of nightmares.  Context is important too. The sound of a running bath is a fairly benign noise, unless you wake up in the middle of the night in a place you're supposed to be alone in and hear the bath being run in the darkness.  The great thing about just hearing something is that the imagination leaps into overdrive - something it doesn't do when you see something. A well placed creak can put more fear into a player than all the gore-filled rooms ever could."
creepygaming,32m8xq,ArrtosTarne,3,Wed Apr 15 10:22:00 2015 UTC,Having an enemy that you don't know what it is/can't see it well... but you can feel its presence
creepygaming,32m8xq,OdinTheUnknown,4,Wed Apr 15 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"Atmosphere. Atmosphere is the reason that, for me, Penumbra: Overture is the scariest (and most atmospheric) game. Setting is key. Something original. Outlast was scary for it's jump scares and darkness, but the whole asylum thing has been done time and time again. What made Penumbra so enticing and unsettling was the mystery that surrounded everything.    Further using Penumbra as example - don't always resort to loud noises. Sometimes the most tense moments are in utter silence. This is what made the dogs in Penumbra so terrifying. You'll just be exploring in the dark, with no sounds but your footsteps and the environment, and suddenly you'll hear that slight growl in the distance, and then the slight pounding of drums (which was the 'battle' music).  Lastly, in my opinion combat is vital to truly perfecting horror. One of the big problems with a lot of horror games that have come out lately is that you can only run (Outlast, Amnesia, Slender...). While this does make for extremely intense situations where you have no clue how far behind from you they are, coming face to face with them can be equally as scary, if not more. A big part of why I think the sequels to Penumbra: Overture were weaker is because they got rid of combat. And trust me - the scariest part of that game was coming face to face with those damn dogs. Amnesia, which was in a sense the spiritual successor to the Penumbra trilogy (and made by the same company) also lacked this aspect."
creepygaming,32m8xq,GurdonFremon,5,Tue Apr 14 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"About the location, I'm thinking of making the location a large house. The prolouge to Slender: The Arrival was actually way more scary than the ""scary"" parts of the game. I think the reason is because a house is normal and innocent, and if you bring something that isn't innocent, it makes it much more creepy (and hasn't been done to death in horror)."

creepygaming,32m8xq,Coldhell,3,Wed Apr 15 01:08:02 2015 UTC,Into the gloom is a great example of atmospheric horror and shows it doesn't have to have amazing graphics to be creepy. Throughout there's a creature chasing you too. Said creature isn't scary looking but having to run and hide from it is creepy just knowing that it's there.
creepygaming,32m8xq,sagstercrzzypants,3,Fri Apr 17 08:26:50 2015 UTC,"Unpredictability. I love games that use this to its advantage, e.g. Clock tower (ps1), when you hide in, say, the bedroom, you can hide under the bed, in a closet, etc. but you don't know where the scissor man/that crazy ass little girl are going to look, they might look everywhere, or te closet, maybe behind the curtains and under the bed. Then when they leave the room, you don't know if they're going to walk back in 5 seconds later to bust you as you climb out of your hidey-hole, or if they're actually gone. Moments like that where you don't know how things are going to turn out (unlike open-like-a-book outlast) make for an awesome adrenaline rush.  Also for the sake of interest/fun, have a quick lookup on adrenaline/endorphins and how they relate to horror games, it's fascinating how good horror media can cause such major biological changes in observers!"

creepygaming,32ik4f,nfreakoss,8,Tue Apr 14 13:13:45 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty neat twist, it threw everybody for a loop. Besides the phone guy being still alive, the check at the end of the game is dated earlier than the first game's check.  Here's a simplified version of the lore:  FNAF2 happens during the murders, and it has the main 4 ""awakening"" through the puppet putting their souls in the old suits. The puppet, btw, is the kid who died at the very first location, before they moved to the FNAF2 location.  FNAF1 shows the location after that, where they severely downscaled operations and for some reason repaired the old suits instead of using the toy ones. My personal theory is that the toy ones had some glitches (especially since they would kill you despite not having a kid soul in them), so they dismantled them and recycled parts to repair the old ones that ""worked"" fine.  Inbetween 1 and 3, the purple guy (the murderer) returns to dismantle the suits for an unknown purpose. After the suits are destroyed, the ghosts themselves corner him in a room (that was later sealed off) and scare him into hiding in a ""springtrap"" suit. The suit messes up and forces the animatronic bits into his body, killing him.  The third game is about the ghosts of the kids waking back up (although it's implied they were still slightly active before) after the room is unsealed, this time without the suits themselves. The ""springtrap"" suit is haunted by the ghost of the killer, and the kids' souls are essentially trapped in the place forever with him, making them rage. Through some hidden bits of the game, you can free their souls while leaving the killer behind. The place also burns down, and the ending image of a newspaper article can be brightened to show Springtrap's face still around.  My personal theory is that the next game (if there is one) will deal with a new, non-restaurant location and perhaps a new style of play that doesn't involve cameras."
creepygaming,32ik4f,ColumnMissing,3,Tue Apr 14 15:56:15 2015 UTC,Phone Guy dies in night 4 of FNAF1 and Phone Guy is alive through NIGHT1-6 in FNAF2 so it has to take place before 1. There is also a lot more evidence.

Imagine this scene, Cthulhu or any truly gigantic and bizarre creature sitting in the background, making you feel like an ant, powerless against such a massive being. Imagine that scene and after a while of just staring at each other in the distance, the creature slowly lunges towards you, the enormous hand getting closer and closer, or maybe the head moves in your direction, or maybe it stands, making you feel even smaller against the inconceivable size of the creature. Just the imagination of this scene blows my mind and even more imagining it in the Oculus Rift.

For me, just the scale of the creature gave me shivers. Imagine it extending his arm and fucking destroying the whole level. Even if it doesn't interact with the player, just the presence makes it a great example of Lovecraftian fear and how something of that scale can make you lose your mind. Just imagine it suddenly lunging towards you."

It's not gore-porn, fine, but it has werewolves and old ones, ritual human sacrifices and nightmares made flesh.  Blowing away snake-infested zombies in the forbidden woods with a shotgun, you might as well be playing Resident Evil 4.  I suppose it's a matter of degrees.  There are areas that aren't scary as well, which makes it that much more tense to explore dark caves when you find them.  But it's certainly scarier than other horror games I could name.  A Machine For Pigs, for example, not that that's saying much.  Scarier than the Souls games as well, though.  They all have a foreboding atmosphere but Bloodborne follows it up by having a witch grab you from behind and slit your throat with a hacksaw.  I die more often in Bloodborne than most horror games, devoured by monsters that just ambushed me, panicking and using the wrong items.

I'll give the game some credit, the lore is kind of spooky. But the game itself, people saying that it's the scariest game in years or it being ""scary"" enough to warrent a film, is not true.

The Internet has made it all too simple to use a computer to change reality. An abundance of information is merely a search engine away, to the point where it's hard to imagine life as any different. Yet, a generation ago, when the words 'streaming' and 'torrent' were meaningless save for conversations about water, people met face-to-face to conduct software swap parties, trading games and applications on Sharpie-labeled five-and-a-quarter inch floppies. Of course, most of the time the meets were a way for frugal, community-minded individuals to trade popular games like King's Quest and Maniac Mansion amongst themselves. However, a few early programming talents designed their own computer games to share amongst their circle of acquaintances, who in turn would pass it on, until, if fun and well-designed enough, an independently-developed game had its place in the collection of aficionados across the country.

The file name was jvk1166z.esp. It was never posted on any of the larger Elder Scrolls communities, usually just smaller boards and role-playing groups. I know in a few cases rather than being posted, it was sent via PM or email to a 'chosen few.' It was only up for a few days, to the best of my knowledge. It caused a buzz because it was a virus, or seemed to be. If you tried to load the game with the mod active, it would hang at the initial load screen for a full hour and then crash to the desktop. If you let it get that far, your install of Morrowind, along with any save files you had, would become completely corrupted. Nobody could figure out what the mod was trying to do, since it couldn't be opened in the Construction Set. Eventually, warnings were distributed not to use it if you found it, and things died down. About a year later, in a mod board I used to frequent, someone popped up with the mod again. He said he was PMed by a lurker who deleted his account immediately after sending. He also said that the person advised him to try playing the mod through DOSbox. For some reason, this worked... sort of. The game was a bit laggy, and you couldn't get into Options, Load Game, the console, or really anything else, other than the game itself. The QuickSave and QuickLoad hotbuttons worked, but that was it. And the QuickSave file seemed to be just part of the game file, so you couldn't get at it anymore. Some speculated that the changed game used an older graphics renderer, making DOSbox necessary, but it didn't LOOK any different. Image i Image i   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I think Mogeko would have been better off just making it a visual novel - that's clearly what he wanted to do, since the actual gameplay takes such a backseat.  Personally, the fact that the dark part was such a small part of the game and came so late is what made it creepy to me - I'd been playing the game for ages and had gotten settled into the lightheartedness, so the whole gore-fest scenes came out of nowhere. It wouldn't have had an effect if the game had been dark before it."

Which, for me, made the gore/horror hit harder.   I only got 3 out of 4 endings though. I missed the True Ending. After about 20 hours I really couldn't sit through anymore cutscenes of every character going ""......................"" or ""..............??""   My only complaint is the battle system. I was absurdly overpowered the entire game, with the exception of the Orca fight. Nobody else even touched me through out the game which was a huge let down. I slaughtered everything and when I finally fought a boss that was supposed to be Uber Powerful I was eventually let down."

There's actually only a few seconds between the 3rd and 4th 6th and 7th images. There really wasn't anything dark before it - just cutesy ""Oh!

creepygaming,2zy9rh,KefkeWren,2,Tue Apr 7 08:53:05 2015 UTC,"I thoroughly enjoy both. The forest has a really creepy atmosphere. At this point in time though, 7DtD feels much closer to being  complete. If I had to choose one over the other, it would be that."
creepygaming,2zy9rh,Jaxerjay,9,Tue Apr 7 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"Never been a fan of jump scares myself, and it seems that the majority of horror games these days rely way too much on them to achieve their success."

creepygaming,2zy9rh,LastViking,7,Sun Apr 5 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"I think that for me, it's actually lack of visibility. That might seem weird, but hear me out. See, I understand the reasoning. If it's dark, anything could be hiding out there. If you're in close quarters, you don't see what's around the next corner, nor have room to react. The thing is, though, it makes all the environments the same. It's always dark, always around midnight, almost always some abandoned building full of clutter. It's a predictable atmosphere, and the scares more or less have to be of the ""jump"" variety, since that's what the environment is setting up for...being taken by surprise.  I remember when I played the original Myst for the first time. You wouldn't call it a ""horror"" game, really, but it had an eeriness that a lot of modern horror games don't get. Everything was bright, it was colourful, but everything was empty and lifeless. There were signs that something horrible had happened, there was uncertainty as to what would come next, but there was also a kind of tension that you don't get in modern games. You thought you could count on nothing jumping out, but you weren't sure. Meanwhile, you still found things that could shock and disturb you, especially in the more ""uncivilized"" brother's areas."
creepygaming,2zy9rh,Katzenklavier,6,Mon Mar 23 04:58:46 2015 UTC,"YES! i'm not the only one that thinks the first myst can sort of qualify as a psychological horror(for lack of a better word) game. there were no scares or monsters but the atmosphere was so genuinely unnerving that I couldn't play with the lights off...or at night. It didn't intend to be a scary game, like it wasn't it's purpose, but it did it. I agree that more modern horror games should create these feelings of unnerve. Just don't see much of that anymore"
creepygaming,2zy9rh,WildPie101,2,Mon Mar 23 07:51:24 2015 UTC,"Myst had its eerie moments, too. Like looking in the books with the missing pages, and the garbled messages from the people trapped inside.."

It was advertised as his project after all. Then apparently there were about 2 articles the next day that mentioned that the project would continue, and no one talked about it on reddit either. So fuck me for coming to conclusions based of the information I received, right?"

creepygaming,2zz8g1,Tebeal,3,Mon Mar 23 04:07:26 2015 UTC,"Obviously, you don't need ""permission"" to dislike a game, but some of the stuff in that video's just straight up not true. You can't just check doors because then it's basically impossible to stop Foxy because Foxy gets activated if his screen isn't monitored. Raising the monitors is also what allows Bonnie and Chica to attack you, and you only have so much power to spare to prep doors and check for immediate threats, so it's hardly a ""fatal flaw"" to the game's design that you never have to check the monitors."
creepygaming,2zz8g1,SteveLusion,3,Mon Mar 23 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"I played all of them and enjoyed them, I wouldn't call it extreme horror or anything, but the story was pretty morbid. The only problem I had with it was that it stopped being scary after the first 2 or 3 jumpscares, from then on it was a puzzle game I needed to beat. I think it was a pretty good series and had a good time playing so who cares if it doesn't fit the cookie cutter right?"
creepygaming,2zz8g1,Jaxerjay,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:08:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think context is appropriate here. A single person made it and sold it for ~$5. I think it goes above and beyond what is expected in terms of development. If it was $15 or more, I would be a little miffed that it wasn't more complex or had more variety."
creepygaming,2zz8g1,durrandi,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"exactly, I bought it as a mini game and I really enjoyed it for what it was. you're right though, if it had been 15 bucks I probably wouldn't have liked it as much, just because of it's simple concept"
creepygaming,2zz8g1,Jaxerjay,2,Tue Mar 24 00:45:11 2015 UTC,A decent video as of the time it was released but the later iterations of the game did improve on the formula with the the later 2 installments having more complex gameplay and an actual story as well.
creepygaming,2zz8g1,xandan,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"I know it's highly subjective but did they really improve the formula? The first one was basically a resource management game with a risk reward system based around vision and jump scares. The second one took out most, if not all, of the resource management and replaced it with that stupid music box. And I haven't played enough of the third one to really get a feel for it and    they've done some interesting stuff but it seems more like just simple gimmicks rather than actual, well thought out, gameplay mechanics."
creepygaming,2zz8g1,flarnot,2,Mon Mar 23 08:57:57 2015 UTC,"The third one is based around luring spring trap around using noises and managing the systems' readiness as they can all go out and need to be reset.  The main changes that helped the second one was that you had to be vigilant while keeping track of the music box.  The music box made camera use necessary to an extent that wasn't just checking it briefly like pirate cove but was admittedly not great.  There was also the addition of meaningful audio cues that required the player to listen as well as watch when playing which is a step up from the first one that had a simple pattern you could use to win.  In this one the pattern changes based off of the audio cues and visual cues while trying to wind up the music box being a sort of stressor to cause the player a constant looming threat.  The third one however requires you to look through all the cameras, listen for audio cues and act based off of the information you are given to last the night and unlike the first two there is no pattern to follow.  Spring trap acts dynamically based off of your input and tries to get to you through the halls and vents.  The vents are placed such that if you take him all the way to the start, he has a direct path to the room and certain rooms he is able to shortcut through.  You can also shut one vent at a time to prevent this."

But I remember some farting creature sitting on a swing that was just... odd. It was like if uncle fester had invaded your world and now just sat on a tree farting. Apparently he was the in-game cheat screen, and if you paused and pressed buttons, you'd make farting noises as well and unlock passwords."

Now, if anyone really loves ants, there's a great documentary about a colony of honey pot ants. It's done over the course of five years.

The aesthetic is wonderful, and it deserves to be more than a fresh coat of paint over another basic open-world survival game. The idea of having to pass as one of the drugged-up public is so good, it would be a shame to see the finished product relegate that to ""don't attack people out in the open."" Since looting people's places looks like it may be an important way of getting supplies, I'd be all for a social option. Charming your way into free dinners and whatnot."

Essentially: * Drug that everyone takes to make them ""happy""   Your character is probably the only one lucid/not taking drugs Doing anything like sprinting,jumping,going into someone's house, holding your weapon out in the open, crouching will lead to other people in the community becoming suspicious, and eventually attack you. Hunger and thirst are important You can dose on the drug to lower suspicion rate, stop hunger and dehydration temporarily, but after the drugs wear off, suffer from quicker hunger and dehydration etc Crafting equipment and items Seems like breaking into someone's house to get items will be huge.   Not as creepy as it looks after the gameplay as compared to the trailer, but the atmosphere and environment created is just so unique and cool."

creepygaming,2yu0wh,OnlyAMasterOfEvil,9,Thu Mar 12 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"PS1 has two separate sound sequences as it boots. The first sound sequence is where it tells you that the Playstation hardware booted correctly. Then there's a pause where it reads the disc, and if all is well, you get the second tone sequence before the game fires up.  The initial sequence sounded fine, but the software load sequence came out distorted, after a longer-than standard load break. This suggests that either the disc is corrupt or the hardware to read the disc is.  A slightly eery sound, and spelled panic for people who dropped a lot of money on their Playstation. Kinda like getting a 3-red on your Xbox."

You'll need to open the audio file in a sound editing software, and remove/reverse the audio channel that is reversed or just play this audio file using headphones. You will hear 4 different voices... each one saying a number in a language that corresponds to the country codes from meta data.  Now all you have to do is either learn those 4 different languages, or ask around forums/reddit if there are people who can translate this for you... or if you want an easy way out I can PM you the code."

creepygaming,2yk634,WorldOneWon,56,Tue Mar 10 14:22:03 2015 UTC,I would definitely say the first Bioshock applies. It's not a scary game or horror genre in of itself but it's definitely creepy and unnerving at times.
creepygaming,2yk634,The_Nightfox,16,Tue Mar 10 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"This was going to be my reply as well. Bioshock did a very good job of setting an atmosphere, and that atmosphere could definitely get creepy/ominous at times."

Eversion is the only one that's disturbing in the way They Breathe is. The others just scared me a bit because of the atmosphere, even though they aren't technically horror games.  Edit: Oh yeah, and Hatoful Boyfriend gets disturbing at the end and in a few of the story lines before that (no joke)"
creepygaming,2yk634,comedicallyobsessedd,4,Tue Mar 10 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think if you go in completely cold and you like story, you'll like it. I hate to say it but I loved it.

creepygaming,2yk634,monsterm1dget,12,Wed Mar 11 04:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah? It was designed to be unnerving. You're home alone in the dark with no idea what happened to your family, there are all kinds of secret places, there are mentions of a ghost, there's the whole great-uncle/dad subplot, and of course the one intentional jump scare.  It's not meant to be horror, but yes it is meant to be unnerving, and seems to me to be the same level of vaguely creepy as everything else people have mentioned in this thread."

creepygaming,2yk634,KefkeWren,14,Fri Mar 20 12:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think that, by and large, that's going to be a YMMV subject. For instance, I personally found the early parts of Dark Cloud, where the town is just empty and gone, pretty unnerving. There are also numerous points in the Myst series where I've found myself more than a little creeped out. It's just something about the atmosphere of isolation and uncertainty. However, different people are unsettled by different things.  Although, if you're okay with puzzles, what little I've seen of Year Walk suggests that it might be something like what you're looking for."
creepygaming,2yk634,KefkeWren,3,Wed Mar 11 04:32:45 2015 UTC,"think that, by and large, that's going to be a YMMV subject   True, but it's still something I like to talk about. This isn't really a ""tell me what games to get"" sort of post. Just curious to what other games focus on atmospheres, you know?   I personally found the early parts of Dark Cloud, where the town is just empty and gone, pretty unnerving   I'm glad someone else feels this way with certain games! Although mine was with Shadow of the Colossus. Just something about that big, empty world really got to me."
creepygaming,2yk634,redqueentopawnfour,8,Tue Mar 10 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"Shadow of the Colossus, absolutely! In my opinion, that game is a lot creepier than it gets credit for. Empty but for giant creatures out to kill you, mysterious ruins of unknown purpose that are never to be explained, darkness infesting your body with each kill, your body growing increasingly pallid and ghoulish, those doves that appear after each colossus falls, but disappear forever if killed... That's not even getting into stuff like how the description of the forbidden land at the beginning of the game can be interpreted as breaking the fourth wall."

creepygaming,2yk634,Maschinegewehr,5,Wed Mar 11 05:05:53 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed. While it does have some genuinely scary moments, it's the incredibly thick atmosphere that really shines. There's only a couple of small places where you feel like you can actually relax, and then you just get out of that get-out-of-here-stalker-bar/bunker/whatever and that eerie feeling crawls up your spine again."
creepygaming,2yk634,Horse_Ebooks_47,11,Tue Mar 10 17:18:45 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree. I've heard people describe it as survival horror, but the game focuses more on immersion and atmosphere to create the horror aspect, right?  On another note, aren't the Metro games similar in that vein?"
creepygaming,2yk634,jdvano,8,Tue Mar 10 21:23:34 2015 UTC,Yes and yes.
creepygaming,2yk634,Bixbeat,7,Tue Mar 10 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes and no. Metro does have a lot of frightening moments, but it has a lot more ""oh shit a monster"" or ""oh shit a ghost"" moments. It plays on jump scares, darkness, death, and claustrophobia. I don't want to say it's not scary, because what it does it does well, but STALKER is a different beast altogether.  STALKER creates an environment where you are just never sure of yourself. Where you make friends with people only to see them ripped apart by hungry dogs. Where you see a person far off in the distance and you aren't sure if you should run to greet them or hide in some rubble until they pass. Where you experience random moments of complete terror and paranoia before you realize that you're actually alone in the middle of an open field just because all the noise in the game stopped for a second.  In short, I like Metro, but I love STALKER."

Majora's Mask is fucking disturbing at a lot of points, particularly the side quest where the family gathers and accepts that the world is ending. Also just the surreal feeling you get from the final stage of the game, knowing anytime you look up, that moon is there, watching you. Always watching you."
creepygaming,2yk634,Djammer,7,Wed Mar 11 06:30:23 2015 UTC,I could discuss MM to death. Everything about that game was depressing. You can't save anyone.

That game really made you appreciate the moments when you had backup, or at least other humans around. Even enemies troops were a more welcome sight than most mutants.  Fighting one of the bosses wasn't as scary as the solo insect sections because there were other humans there with the boss... you weren't walking around alone and vulnerable."

There's so little player involvement to Esther that it really felt more like a museum exhibit than a game, for me, and once that impression hit, it undercut a lot of the tension. It stopped feeling like I was a part of Dear Esther's world. Like, there was this clear delineation between the user and the software to where the two would never intersect.

But when being out in strange and quite hostile lands, blasted by the elements and surrounded by enemies... it starts to get super creepy.  Especially the water realm- its this strange interconnected labyrinth, comprised of cyclopean statues rising out of the very depths you must traverse.  Perhaps it's only me? Oh, yes, and the pitch black death realm, home to hellish butchering factories and evil goblins."

creepygaming,2yhutl,douggums,8,Mon Mar 9 23:16:37 2015 UTC,It's not an easy game to play but it's worth playing at least once all the way through.  Same goes for Blood Curse

Like people have mentioned before, it's fairly difficult and doesn't really give the player much direction in regard to objectives, but it's genuinely unnerving since you very seldom have a decent means to defend yourself.  Make sure you play with the original japanese audio and not the dub (if that's even an option in the US version)."

creepygaming,2yc08f,BrokenLink100,6,Mon Mar 9 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite is the ""What are some lesser-known horror games that no one has heard of?"" and you can guarantee that someone has said Yume Nikki, Ao Oni, Witch's House, Penumbra, Mad Father, Crooked Man, Corpse Party, etc...  Those games are like, the most popular and obvious ""hidden"" and ""secret"" games.  Maybe we could include some of these games in the sidebar? Not that I don't want to see anything about them (all good games!), but it would significantly cut down on all the posts acting like ""Yume Nikki"" is this mysterious game that no one's played or heard of."
creepygaming,2yc08f,FlyingNarwhalGames,2,Tue Mar 10 13:54:26 2015 UTC,"We should include them in the sidebar. Like you said, it gets very annoying seeing that same question and answer everyday.

creepygaming,2yc08f,jimothyjim,9,Tue Mar 10 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"That's cool but I'd still rather there was way more distinction between this and /r/horrorgaming. It'd be cool if both subs could come together and be like "" the /r/horrorgaming subreddit is for discussing any intended horror game things"" and this sub starts  adhering to this slightly modified sidebar description:  ""This subreddit is a place for all the creepy, unintentional things that can happen in video games. A home for creepypasta, personal stories, haunted games, myths, glitches, creepy easter eggs, etc."".  This would essentially mean there is never trailers or images of horror games on here, or discussion of mechanics because they are all intentional horror game things. This would definitely cause this sub to be a bit slow, but I'd rather have something that's worth checking once a week than days of content I feel is better suited elsewhere.  Edit: I saw after the fact  that regular horror game discussions is actually in the sidebar description, I'm sure that didn't used to be there.

Wouldn't that go against the general concept of the sub?   I suppose you could argue that it would ""start a discussion about horror games"" (As it says in the paragraph where you also quoted from) but then, if that were the case, then it could also be argued that other things (screenshots) could also contribute to a discussion of horror games as well, right?   Is this sub no longer about discussing legitimate horror games like the sub itself states..and is only for unintentional creepiness??  I just don't see where the line is, seems like a pick-and-choose at will sorta thing. :p"

Context can sometimes ruin a creepy screenshot. Maybe some limited context, like what game it's from, but even then... Like, if a throwaway account posts a picture labelled ""[NOTITLE]"", and it's, say, Luigi looking horrified in Luigi's Mansion, it's automatically going to be more unsettling, or at least more interesting, than a known user posting the same image as, ""Luigi's Mansion: Luigi looks really scared!"""

creepygaming,2y9945,appropriate-username,7,Sat Mar 7 22:44:59 2015 UTC,I would be down for that. But a lot of the posts I don't like get a lot of upvotes. So there's definitely an audience for that sort of thing on this sub.
creepygaming,2y9945,appropriate-username,8,Sat Mar 7 23:03:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting thing about reddit is that it's difficult to decide whether to cater to voters or to commenters. f7u12 is an example of a sub that did the latter--the mods planned to not do anything for a month as an experiment but shortened it to a week after the outcry of the (commenting) userbase. Voters in general tend to have a bad rap, at least on default subreddits, where you get things like ""mother drowned 8 puppies in a lake"" being upvoted when all the comments are about how it was somebody washing their socks and OP is an idiot.  Ultimately, I think the biggest concern here is the death of the subreddit; regardless of the voting, I don't think filling this sub with horror game promotion will spur interest in this subreddit and thereby fuel further submissions, especially when there's a different sub dedicated to this."
creepygaming,2y9945,slushcountry,4,Sat Mar 7 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"The mods are pretty inactive anyway. If we want this sub to be like it used to be, that change is going to have to come from the inside."
creepygaming,2y9945,slushcountry,3,Sun Mar 8 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"I usually remove anything that goes against the rules, which at the moment are quite liberal as to what kind of horror game content is allowed. We discussed only allowing creepypasta/glitches early on, and the consensus was that there isn't enough of that stuff to keep the subreddit alive, without seeing reposts every month.  I think a good first step to recovery is to disallow the low quality posts asking for help how to get horror game x started, or the montly ""what's a good horror game with this element, or on this system"". Also, a good way for those of you in this community who want the good old myths and glitches stuff is to try to post some yourself."
creepygaming,2y9945,thedeadlinger,6,Sun Mar 8 02:10:53 2015 UTC,But what about the posts that are straight up advertisements for horror games? Like the fnaf teasers and the Night Terrors posts. I saw three of them today.
creepygaming,2y9945,1manparty,2,Sun Mar 8 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"You only saw them so frequently because people were upvoting them so much.   aw man look...i hate to be that guy, and your game looks genuinely very cool, but you could've just linked to an imgur gallery and updated that. the reason we're seeing them so frequently is because you're uploading them separately and repeatedly. that's poor etiquette. just a heads-up."

creepygaming,2ya7vg,xandan,-4,Sun Mar 8 01:42:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but, it's a flashback to him being a security guard in the older games. Just to extend to the theory, the man who had his frontal lobe bitten off was not said that he was dead, and the frontal lobe has a primary function of memory, thus this leading to him possibly breaking back into the place in FNAF 1 and taking up his old position as a night guard and not having a clue that he was clearly fired or anything, whilst having flashbacks of himself getting paid for his work to add meaning to him being there. Adding to the ""...in 3 the security equipment is gone..."" thing, it's because, as I said, he isn't security anymore. He thinks he is during FNAF 1, but he isn't anymore. that's why it's a clearer view of him not being a security guard."

creepygaming,2xnd3w,morgennsternn,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:25:30 2015 UTC,"Loved Amnesia, it didn't scare me. I couldn't handle FNAF though because you can't run or hide, and I hate mannequins... so seemingly possessed animatronics that you are constantly checking cameras and hallways for, while your power is continually draining, were a bit too much for me. Stressed me out too much. I got to the second to last night (each level is a night, guess how many nights there are :)  ) in the first game but quit playing after that.  That's the unique thing about horror and frightening things, different themes and monsters affect some more than others, and everyone has a fear of something. If you're scared of big dark houses for example, try Among the Sleep. Actually try that one anyway, it's amazing and the story is very compelling, kind of like Amnesia's but on a much more realistic and relatable scale."

The second game is a prequel to the first game. The First game takes place in 1992/93 and you have a normal small office and you must close doors to avoid the killer animatronics. In the second game Prequel you have to wear a Freddy Mask to avoid them. You have no doors but a flashlight. You must wind am music box... etc."

creepygaming,2xgo9c,ItchCrikkit,12,Sat Feb 28 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"I think that, in horror games, having lower quality graphics can be a good thing in terms of creating a spooky atmosphere. When one sees some monster rendered with a (relatively) low amount of polygons, sometimes it is not immediately clear to the viewer what they are looking at. This causes two things:   The fear of the unknown. The viewer may not be able to fully understand just what this monster is. Not being able to understand something, especially if that something is a menacing creature out to get you, can be very spooky. One's mind filling in the gaps. This is closely related to the first point. Much like when one reads a book and visualizes a scene based on the text, not having much visual aid (in this case, the low poly-count monster) can cause one's mind to fill in the gaps. One can make assumptions based on what they already see, and given the nature of the enemy (spooky looking in some regard) and the atmosphere of the game (assuming the horror game has successfully created a spooky atmosphere) the mind will tend to attribute things to the creature that they find terrifying.   I base this on no scientific knowledge whatsoever and instead use my own experiences with horror games."
creepygaming,2xgo9c,DudesOnly,6,Sat Feb 28 20:13:10 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I still think that the original Silent Hill is super spooky and the muddy graphics definitely have something to do with that.
creepygaming,2xgo9c,TeddyBane,4,Sat Feb 28 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, they royally fucked that HD remake."
creepygaming,2xgo9c,worlddictator85,3,Sat Feb 28 18:32:13 2015 UTC,I think he's talking about Silent Hill 1 though. 2 Wasn't really all that muddy originally.

creepygaming,2xgo9c,worlddictator85,2,Sat Feb 28 19:04:29 2015 UTC,You're not wrong though. Fuck that remake!
creepygaming,2xgo9c,TeddyBane,5,Sun Mar 1 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure to be honest. I played the original back in '96, and it was scary as hell at the time, but after I played REmake, I could never go back. IMO everything about REmake was more terrifying to me. The graphics, the lighting, crimson heads, Lisa Trevor. All of it was executed in a near perfect fashion. I tried to play the PSX version a few times after, but it felt so primitive and inferior to me. It was like playing goldeneye after playing Call of Duty 4. Slow, sluggish, and ugly. No offense to the original, because it was a masterpiece when it was released, but to me personally, time passed it up and never looked back. REmake replaced it in my mind. This is my opinion, and not everybody's though. To each their own!"
creepygaming,2xgo9c,DatNick1988,2,Sat Feb 28 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"I'm someone who still plays and prefers Goldeneye over every shooter in the modern gen,  so to each their own I guess."
creepygaming,2xgo9c,faaackksake,2,Sat Feb 28 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"i really enjoyed REmake, just because it was nice to see everything in high quality, but i agree with you the original is scarier although i think it might be due to nostalgia  from playing it when i was young, the Deadly Silence Remake is genius and i love it dearly."
creepygaming,2xgo9c,slushcountry,2,Sun Mar 1 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"it's probably nostalgia talking, but the whole uncanny valley concept has a lot to do with it. for what it's worth, i agree.  obscure, lo-fi 70s and 80s horror movies evoke a similar sort of ""special creepiness"" to me. sledgehammer, things like that. the special effects may be terrible and the acting wooden, but combine that with those weird synth scores, strange editing/camerawork, and the fact that a lot of them were recorded to tape instead of film (resulting in fuzzy, indistinct footage) and you get a bizarre, confusing, dreamlike, oppressive, and weirdly intimate experience.  old ps1-era horror games are similar. they might not have gotten horror ""right"" but what they got wrong frequently comes across as considerably scarier, or at least weirder, than any of the intentional scares. so, yeah, i definitely get where you're coming from."
creepygaming,2xgo9c,Shoboni,2,Wed Mar 4 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  I've always found old stuff(crappy graphics and all, especially old FMV games with their grainy, VHS quality picture) far more creepy than new stuff with ultra detailed and high res HD graphics."
creepygaming,2xgo9c,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"I think each games have their own creepiness to them for different reasons. Like one thing I believe the original still trumps the REmake on are the Hunters.  They just stand, fixed to one spot, not making a single noise. In some cases you pretty much have to approach one in order to attack it or at least get it moving. Their faces are rendered nearly pitch-black with only two beady white eyes, it's creepy as hell looking. That, plus the fact in REmake you can just stab or zap them make them a fair bit less intimidating in my opinion."
creepygaming,2xh5bp,Ben-FAN,3,Sat Feb 28 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, that can be resolved by pressing ctrl+alt+delete, going to task manager and ending the task (the game can do it by itself sometimes when you enter task manager), despite this, I can assure you that it is NOT a virus, the source code was posted on thegamecreators (I think that was the name) forums and none of the people that looked at the code said it was a virus and they work with the same tools that were used in the game's creation."

As for other free horror games, here's what I know is available for Mac, likely through Indie DB or Gamejolt: Urbex or anything by Psionic Games, Lurking, The Deep Well, Vanish, and the demo for DreadOut.  Now as far as personal insight goes, I personally found that The Deep Well and DreadOut were best, but nothing for free is typically going to be THAT great and deep.

Though I agree, that it's not my favorite part of the infographic, but blind bandwagoning isn't uncommon.   Manhunt not a masterpiece?!?!?!? How dare y...you're right. It was cheap thrills, but it was fun, and exhilarating and for the time, scary. I could objectively break down on how a particular game you like isn't as good as you say it is, but this isn't an objective arena. Experience is largely subjective unless there are huge mechanical flaws that hinder all enjoyment.   Just saying you're coming in hot with your opinion on a game that you didn't continue to love and that's ok, but the experience stuck with me personally more than you so am I right, or are you? both of us.  I agree that empirically stating that games do or do not cause violent actions is impossible. There are some interesting stats in the infographic, but who's to say that a person couldn't blur the lines between real life and GTA and start running people over because it's funny.   I agree, there are always 2 sides to a coin, but with the media it's often not. We're all going to die of a Lupus/Swine Flu/Bird Flu epidemic, and global warming is killing the earth, when a few decades prior we were heading into a new ice age. so on and so forth. but there a few in the media who stand for the truth. yet people are spoon fed and accept it as gospel.

A Stalker's limb extremities (hands and lower legs) have been removed and replaced with bolted-on metallic augmentations, which offer reduced agility and result in a slow, zombie-like gait. Apparently unable to talk, they utter only roars and groans, probably as a result of severe larynx and mental alteration. For ease of maintenance and to ensure a dependence on the Combine, the Stalkers' digestive tracts have been pulled out, resulting in them surviving solely on a nutrient solution administered via the gastric port in their sides. Stalker bodies are extremely atrophied and skeletal, with very little muscle or fat tissue remaining. Their facial features have been replaced by a metal plate, their ""eyes"" are mere pinholes, and all signs of their genitals have been surgically removed. They have small plates on hinges next to their ""eyes"", which can be closed during periods of inactivity. Opening the plates apparently activates them again, as seen in the train crash in Half-Life 2: Episode One.

It's more of an abstract walking simulator but I adore it. Knock-Knock: By Ice Pick Lodge who also did Pathologic it has a great wee art style, is fairly short and though repetitive I enjoyed my time with it. Nothing like being in the mind of a man going mad. Year Walk: While not specifically psychological horror it's a great little puzzle game with good art and atmosphere. My only real complaint is that it's too short, but definitely work checking out if you're into the creepy side of things. Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines: Is a fantastic horror RPG that everyone interested in horror gaming should play. I wouldn't call it Psychological, but damnit. If you haven't, check it out! Condemned: Criminal Origins: While I haven't finished it, Condemned has been recommended often enough that I may as well suggest it.  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth: I played this many years ago when I was alone, at night, in a house bus in the middle of the country and there was a certain part in this game which shook me up so much that I decided I wouldn't continue until I had company. I find the first part of the game to be the stronger but if you want to manage a sanity meter and explore dark Lovecraftian themes, give it a shot.  That's all that come to mind for now!  ALSO!  American McGee's Alice: Some pretty sinister levels. Wicked fun. The sequel was okay but lacked in creep. It has the best imagining of Cheshire, arguably.   The Suffering: As /u/Just_A_Guy_Eh said. Stuck in a dark and gloomy prison. Fun fact! The sequel, The Suffering: Ties That Bind (which I haven't played so can't recommend) has a few Tool lyrics written on the walls.  Fatal Frame: A PS2 game set in an old haunted Japanese mansion, the only tools you have to fight the various ghosties is your CAMERA! DreadOut tried to do this too but fell flat on the atmosphere.  P.T. is the Playable Teaser for the upcoming Silent Hills game which you can download for free if you have a PS4. It's very atmosphere heavy and spooky.  And of course there's Outlast but no doubt you're well familiar."
creepygaming,2uo5ny,HairlessSasquatch,4,Wed Feb 4 02:44:54 2015 UTC,It's a shame that the Condemned series was discontinued. It was one of the very few horror games that were original and had an impact.  And what happens when games are like that? They don't get enough sales...
creepygaming,2uo5ny,Ingrid_Cold,5,Wed Feb 4 04:24:42 2015 UTC,Condemned 2 jumped the shark by the end
creepygaming,2uo5ny,ItchCrikkit,2,Wed Feb 4 11:03:38 2015 UTC,"I never even got to play the first one yet, only seen enough gameplay of it. But the second one was just covering some background and story elements, and slowly escalating for the third one. The crazyness was supposed to be just a taste of what was going to happen in the third one, but we will never be able to witness it. :(  I don't think the ending was bad at all."
creepygaming,2uo5ny,kitten_based_economy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"The first one wasnt so in your face literal.  Its almost like if the first one were a good book,  the second would be its overdone American film adaptation."

creepygaming,2uo5ny,LostJoyIX,4,Wed Feb 4 13:37:28 2015 UTC,"Siren is pretty cool. The game gives you pretty weak/defenseless characters with the ability to see what the enemies are seeing. The gameplay can be a but rough getting a hold of, but regardless it's still one of my favorites"
creepygaming,2uo5ny,RafaelTheVengeful,3,Wed Feb 4 07:39:45 2015 UTC,"Have you played Cry of Fear on steam? It's free and it's really scary.

creepygaming,2uo5ny,ladyjen19,2,Mon Mar 2 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"The game follows an elite group of assassins called the ""killer7"". The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform hits on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in US politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. Killer7 features first-person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to Myst and Snatcher.  - Wiki  The game was made by Suda 51 whose games are always ridiculous. It's a nice mixture of genres. Once you think you have something figured out the game completely takes your understanding away. I don't want to say too much just in case you do try it out. I will say this it's like nothing you've ever played."

I had never properly seen the mask (you don't really see it face on in the game) and I had a dream it was outside my bedroom window. The next day I played it and did the bit where you see him on the rocking chair and it shows you the mask. It looked just like my dream.
creepygaming,2u6dfq,xXCyprusZeroXx,2,Fri Jan 30 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"That's pretty hardcore! The first time Scissorman took me out, it was in Scenario 1 (playing as Jennifer). I ducked into a men's room and hid in the stall. When Scissorman attempted to break in, I didn't have the forethought to grab the broom by the door. He quickly broke in and relieved my neck of my head! :-/  Thanks for sharing your experience, as Clock Tower truly changed how I viewed games! :-)"

I think at first her character design makes her look sort of horrifying, but her features are actually quite soft and when you actually play I suppose she's the least horrifying thing in the game.   I think the game is supposed to represent a sort of struggle with depression (I thought the esc menu further hinted at this), and I felt sorry for her going through this sort of never ending torment."

Alone in the Dark: the New Nightmare is a bit wonky but still has some creepiness. Dino Crisis 1 and 2 are both good choices as well.  Venturing away from the normal crop, Galerians is pretty creepy (mostly just weird, actually). The two Overblood games are more dark than creepy, but they have their moments. Parasite Eve, MediEvil and X-Files might also be to your liking.  I also wouldn't count off Castlevania SotN. It's a metroidvania, but has a pretty creepy atmosphere and disturbing stuff in it.

creepygaming,2t4f18,2LateImDead,3,Thu Jan 22 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"the Conet project   Excellent Link. Still messes with me everytime- I don't understand why a child and ice cream truck are in a numbers station, but thats a whole different level of the theories & questions to be asked/answered.  All I know is I realized why that ice cream truck recording was so eerie to me- It reminds me of an ""impending doom"" sort of feeling, that sample could be used in a horror movie or something. Just absolutely rubs me the wrong way.  I'll probably be bookmarking that to check out some other samples, but I'll take your word on   by far the most popular for creepy sampling.   shivers a bit  edit Just figured I'd add, things that are included in numbers stations that many people may not know, aside from the (obvious numbers), the stations also produce sounds, such as the SSTV frequency that was translated somewhat into a picture, in addition to harmonic scales, rising and lowering pitches, and other aspects that may not be noticed. They're absolutely one hell of a mystery, and it's even more interesting that nobody takes any claims for them. Its not uncommon for a numbers station to interrupt a radio stations frequency on occasion."
creepygaming,2t4f18,2LateImDead,3,Wed Jan 21 12:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure getting a hold of transmissions isn't an issue. The fact is however, whomever this person was, had some sort of motivation to hack to extreme lengths if this was a prank, as even getting two Usernames the same is difficult. There seemed to be no particular reason for it. For the record, this is NOT ME in the video, but circulated quite a bit throughout the community because it occurred so often during the few weeks it happened (Roughly a year ago).  I'd say its a previously recorded transmission, but still the question begs to ask, why? I could understand a night or two messing with people, but this continued for weeks.  edit Also, why both Swedish & German transmissions? Guess that's one of the questions that only the person behind the computer could answer. (Or maybe there's some sick Double Agent working through video game number stations?) Either way, that ice cream truck gives me chills, every freaking time."
creepygaming,2t4f18,2LateImDead,3,Wed Jan 21 02:37:06 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know why.  These number stations are of no significance to the public, we can't decode them and we don't even know why we have them.   There are tons of theories, from failsafes for nuclear retaliation to spy networks to aliens, but we don't know and won't know until many years until after they're disabled when the government tells us, or until someone hacks into the documents of one of the nations with these systems and happens to find any documents on them, if there are any.  There are tons of them, too.  America still has a few running even.  I agree though that it's an extremely weird prank, given how much work it would require if it was going on for weeks, was through the mic, was carried out by hidden ""players"" with the exact same names, was spread across multiple servers, and was right after some big anti-hacking thing, all for ultimately no gain or purpose.  It just doesn't seem realistic.    Have the game files been scoured for anything that could naturally be causing this?"
creepygaming,2t4f18,delta0062,2,Wed Jan 21 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I haven't checked all the game files, but there wasn't anything mentioned about any files that could cause this- Many people now hack in this game so it would probably not go unnoticed, and at least these hackers show UP on the player list. None have yet to duplicate a name as seen in the video since, nor has anyone sat around and relayed number stations after that timeframe.   As I mentioned before, it was only on US 001 and US 002 servers, and as I preferred lower population servers, I never ran into this personally. (US 001 & 002 were popular at the time, with 001 being maxed on its 100 player population servers at the time normally).  You're absolutely correct for theories, I don't disagree a bit. It's just incredibly odd, creepy and well, somewhat surreal. I've heard of them (numbers stations), know of what they're allegedly used for but I didn't expect to see it via a (agreed) ""Player"" in a game, especially in one I actually played like this which had a very small amount of players compared to DayZ.  The maker of the video however DID understand the SSTV signal and translated it, though i'm honestly not sure what the final image is (a face? skeleton? No clue). Anywho, it just leaves a ton of unanswered questions that I have no honest reasoning for myself.  edit I won't lie. Something about the eerieness of it (The game itself at night I'm used to, its the broadcast itself) really irks me in an unusual way. Almost demoralizing/discomforting, and I was just listening to some of the ""Scarier"" sounds threads..."
creepygaming,2t4f18,Grumpchkin,3,Wed Jan 21 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"though i'm honestly not sure what the final image is (a face? skeleton? No clue)   I don't quite understand what that guy did to get that image.  Did he just convert the background noise into a picture somehow?  Doesn't seem very accurate anyway.  I kind of took the image as a face of sorts, because towards the top you can kind of see eyes.  But then when it zoomed in it made me think of grass.  Hare-brained thinking mode activated: So what I'm thinking is that if there were transmissions from three stations, you could triangulate a center location if you knew where the three were located.  It's possible that the one identified as German is German, but that one of the earlier or later ones that sounds like it is some other nation's, since a lot of them use computer-generated voices.  Triangulate that location, go there, perhaps there's a patch of ground resembling that image, and maybe something's buried there."
creepygaming,2t4f18,2LateImDead,3,Wed Jan 21 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"The Game... doesn't let you bury objects... What you saw was it. They got as close to the source as possible, and found nothing. Even explored the house earlier on.   It looked like he used a 3rd party program that is used for SSTV analysis, I'm sure it would be able to be easy to grab off Google. As far as how he converted it, it looked like the system was based on point and clicking the source (exe file), and dragging said audio sample onto the analyzer. I'm sure its inaccurate because it probably requires more to decode it properly, or the sample he took was started at a bad time- could be tons of factors. I mean we haven't even addressed the numbers, but they have no actual meaning to us as far as I know, regardless of whether or not you played the game.  As far as the thinking mode, it was worth a shot, but I doubt people are using number stations to leave loot when those people were about 3 minutes from a Safe Zone with a Vault and everything. It'd be a hell of a lot easier to just leave a Personal Locker around and just tell your friends the combo via group chat instead of broadcasting it.   This was just an extreme effort, and I honestly don't think anyone will know why or if there's any relevance, aside from the guy who set it up in the first place."

Two could technically triangulate the position though if this were the case, one could be a Longitude, the other could be a Latitude, and the picture could've been a scene of the area? That would be my best guess if they were related, but its all hypothetical thinking at this point. I don't believe they were related in terms of finding something, just someone was playing Relay Station Numbers... For whatever reason, regardless of language most likely. I dont know.

Just to point a few things out, aside from the obvious zombie noises which are part of the game-   Multiple times the player points out the player broadcasting Doesn't exist on the server The broadcasting player is within the set proximity- Any movement by players give up positions (even while crouched), so this player is specifically parked to do this. This was also right after the new anti-hack (which is even worse off now, but was somewhat effective back then) came out, so accomplishing this would still take time, and obviously some sort of motivation. It's impossible in this game to create two characters of the same name, similar to any unique username- Two of the same relay stations appear around midway through the video.

Players hunted everywhere to find this person, to no avail. This is... extensive lengths to go for a prank. The Devs took no responsibility for it. This is like someone hacking DayZ to broadcast number stations- Why? How?...  The message ACTUALLY DECODED into a picture- Regardless of whether it was a hoax or not, this was an absolute real recording.   P.S- Super Important Don't buy this game. It's crap and poorly optimized. You could heat a small apartment with your computer playing this game.   Regardless, around 5:20 is where the hair on my neck really began to stand up. Number stations can apparently turn the happiest childhood songs into a nightmares.  At roughly 5:30 it looks like some sort of movement on the top floor, but I believe its just rendering in the game (shadows, daytime approaching, etc), otherwise it would have aggro'd the nearby zombie if it was a player- You can see more of the shadows playing mind games as time progresses.  At 5:55 there IS a player that runs through, but has spawn protection on (note the glowing in the dark), so they had joined the server within the past 30 seconds. The alternative is a zombie that is commonly dressed in light blue, and could have just been wandering in the moonlight as programmed. Just felt this was worth mentioning as it is NOT a possibility of being the source."
creepygaming,2t4f18,The-shindigs,6,Wed Jan 21 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah screw this game, there was a pretty big deal about it when it first came out, typical alpha release BS from the devs.  Creepy as hell though."
creepygaming,2t4f18,CitizenSmif,4,Wed Jan 21 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"Yea.. It only got worse when they REALLY started reaching for money... The prices on the market for items such as Personal Lockers went from 150 GC (like $1.50) to 750 or so overnight (over $5 or so), it's somewhat settled now. Everything was all screwed up, though they did admittedly finally get some issues fixed.. It just seems like it might be dying out a bit, especially after the massive waves of bans.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing it every now and then, but it seems people are finding other alleys/niches, for apocolypse survival games."
creepygaming,2t4f18,CitizenSmif,2,Wed Jan 21 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"That Swedish numbers station is actually a famous recording  I remember it from years ago. It's the first one that comes to mind for me when I think of Numbers Stations.  Chances are, it is just a prank. Much like Day Z, people love to use the atmosphere and uneasiness players experience in these games to make them even more frightening by broadcasting or hacking to pull creepy pranks. See the people who teleport and walk everywhere in Day Z while playing audio through their mic (like songs or other such creepy things) just to frighten people.  Not much of a mystery, just a great prank to up the anxiety and suspense in these games.  Edit: You say it's too elaborate to be a prank, but it could just be someone trying to get their money's worth after having buyer's remorse with this game."

If you mean the fact that it can turn off your machine, that is part of the game that was coded in game maker which is meant to simulate BEN having control of your machine.  Aside from that there is NO malware, I have played it myself.  If this is the way reddit reacts to remember.exe, I shudder to think how the 3rd arc for the original BEN DROWNED would have gone with the community since Jadusable said he wanted to make it seem like BEN was going after the player in one interview or post."

Literally the  definition of a Trojan."
creepygaming,2sr958,Madous,6,Sun Jan 18 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"allow me to rebuke each of those with a few comments, 1 per point you made. 1. That feature is meant to simulate BEN being in control 2. The e-mail thing has stopped afaik, it did when another feature (see below) was removed 3. So can imscared and Iseeyou, imscared adds text documents and images, Iseeyou removes the game exe after completion and replaces it with one that makes a windows error message box appear 4. The webcam feature was removed 5. The commands are NOT in remember.exe, only lostmemory.exe (which has not been functioning lately as the site went down I believe) but besides, all the creator used it for was to play songs, send messages to the game and open/close doors etc, for instance one player in my skype group was allowed access to the basement, something which is normally locked.  The creator was planning to use the two games as part of an ARG (Alternate Reality Game, similar to the original BEN DROWNED one), but his plans got derailed for some reason."

I never spammed the ESC key harder in my life."
creepygaming,2sppwv,Hazard_Zone,15,Sat Jan 17 06:45:14 2015 UTC,I love the sound design of the first Dead Space game particularly. Hearing the ship creak and clatter was incredibly immersive.
creepygaming,2sppwv,SingedWaffle,5,Sat Jan 17 13:59:35 2015 UTC,I agree. I also found the lack of sound in the space sections to be equally well done. A faint distant thump might be all you hear to let you know something horrific is on its way.
creepygaming,2sppwv,roadlesstravelled,3,Sat Jan 17 16:47:05 2015 UTC,Yup. I couldn't play it because of how well the sound design was.
creepygaming,2sppwv,heyyouyeahyou55,3,Sat Jan 17 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thought 2 was really good too, but giving Isaac a face and extensive dialogue made it more clear that he wasn't 'you', just a character you were in control of. But other than that, I thought the atmospheric sound was still excellent."
creepygaming,2sppwv,h8yuns,16,Sat Jan 17 19:26:41 2015 UTC,Amnesia gets it right in my opinion.
creepygaming,2sppwv,Dead_Sparrow,7,Sat Jan 17 07:59:10 2015 UTC,"In your opinion? Nah, that's a fact. That game (and the second one too!) was full of masterful sound mixing that made it pretty easy to visualize the flashback scenes. The ambiance was pretty damn well made too. The footstep sounds in the wine cellar made me so tense and reluctant to explore.  There's one thing I remember vividly while watching my brother play the game for himself. He was near the beginning of the prison area, and there was an inexplicable thumping noise that caused him to freak out. To me, it sounded like someone was getting thrown against the wall, but he probably thought it was a big monster dude stomping around. That game digs its hands into your brain and manipulates your primal fears like a fiddle."
creepygaming,2sppwv,VostokTheROBOT,2,Sat Jan 17 11:51:44 2015 UTC,That is why Amnesia is one of my favorite horror games.

I could go on and on.   I'm sure that a lot of people are going to give me shit for bringing up Resident Evil 4, as it's been shoved in everyone's face for years on end, and lots of you might not consider it ""creepy"" enough to fit in this subreddit (and a lot of people really didn't care for it at all), but the total package was one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had in gaming.   To this day, it stands the test of time and I can still go back and experience the same tension, the same brooding atmosphere from the lilting, haunting background music in safe-rooms, the sound of the pouring rain and thunder in the background, hearing a plaga's tentacle-blade violently swinging behind you just off-camera.....  Yeah. Have to say Resident Evil 4. There are many many other games that deserve to share a special place up there for their sound design and atmosphere, however. It's hard to choose just one.

creepygaming,2snyvk,boybosh104,2,Sat Jan 17 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Fellow gamers and I decided that's it the purple man from the death minigames, he killed the children and holds a object that looks like a phone and wears a badge. He is theorized by many to be the phone guy presumed dead in the end of the first game.  What I believe is that he and golden Freddy will be the only animitronics, hinted at by this picture as you can see, the masks are all thrown in the box, thrown away. Now, since I was fooling around with brightness, not only did I see this new animatronic, but I also saw golden freddy. I also theorize that the marionette will play a large part in this game considering it resembles the crying and dead boy in the minigames.  Thats all I have for now. Tell me what you guys think."

White Day: A Labyrinth Named School: this game is basically an Amnesia style game where you wander a school with loads of spooks and try to return a girls diary. It's without a doubt the scariest game I ever played. It has outdated graphics, but the atmosphere is intense. You can find it on modDB. Phantasmagoria: really old pc game with digitized actors. It's well known for gory scenes and its dark story about a woman trying to save her husband from a haunted house. and it definitely shows its age at times, but it's still a great game. You can get it on GOG.com. Yume Nikki: this game is a cult hit made with RPG Maker. It involves a girls adventure in her dreams. It's got some trippy backgrounds and it gets a bit hard at times. But walk-throughs of the game exist. You can download it pretty much anywhere.   Hope these suggestions help. Happy gaming."
creepygaming,2s6gvl,nate0113,3,Mon Jan 12 19:59:50 2015 UTC,I would second White Day. The only issue is it's a pretty old Korean game and I know there are sometimes weird glitches when people try and play a downloaded version. But it is sooo good. I love the playthrough cryotic does of it.

It seemed to happen more at the start than anything else.  I mean, it wasn't made by a huge developer (I believe), and as far as I know it was one main person who translated it and made it available to English speakers, so to assume perfection from that is perhaps asking a little too much."

The game's story is a set in the world where an evil computer named AM has destroyed all of humanity except for five people, whom he has been keeping alive and torturing for the past 109 years. Each survivor has a fatal flaw in its character, and in an attempt to crush their spirits, AM has constructed a metaphorical adventure for each that preys upon their weaknesses. To succeed in the game, the player must make choices to prove that humans are better than machines, because they have the ability to redeem themselves. Woven into the fabric of the story are ethical dilemmas dealing with issues such as insanity, rape, paranoia and genocide.

creepygaming,2s6gvl,EverChaotic,3,Mon Jan 12 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with nanashi is the navigation, super slow and complicated."
creepygaming,2s6gvl,Sentenced2Burn,3,Tue Jan 13 07:52:41 2015 UTC,"It's not complicated, and it's only slow because that was intentional to heighten the terror.  Seriously, it was one of the two games that got close to making me shit my pants when I first played. If that's not an accomplishment that makes a horror game good, I don't know what is. (Note: for those interested, the second of the two games was P.T.)  I still play it occasionally when I get the itch, even though I've practically 100% the game already and it's not scary as it was before. It's a great game.  Now, Theresia has slow movement like Nanashi, but that probably has two explanations beyond ""it's a horror game, give it a break."" The first is that it's a port of a Korean mobile game (which, ironically, is part of a series that we never got the rest of in any way, shape, or form). Maybe it isn't the best port? The second is that it's a point and click adventure game. Well, beyond the hallway areas where you're walking around in a space that resembles one of those old 3D maze games. It's entirely possible that the game was built for slow movement because of the point and click nature of the game and the fact that there's non-door stuff you can tap on to enter specific screens that you do stuff on."

creepygaming,2r6sgt,RiggsRector,42,Sat Jan 3 10:51:52 2015 UTC,"As much as it is indeed just hype-train riding, you've got to give the guy his dues.  FNaF1 was just a demo, and everyone went mad about it. So he released it, and then worked on the sequel, using ideas for what 1 was going to be as a final product.  YouTubers like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Yamimash, RaedWulfGamer etc are all seeing huge views on these videos, so they're also adding to the pressure of more media/content, and the guy is delivering.  Good on him. He never intended to make any money out of it, really. Just a few sales of an alpha."

creepygaming,2r6sgt,raspberrykraken,9,Sat Jan 3 22:45:53 2015 UTC,"It's a thing, the animation style looks even more removed from what the original game was, so this could give an assumption on what direction Scott Cawthon is trying to get out of this. Clearly it's trying to be ""different"" than what the first two were, but i'm having a bit of difficulty figuring out how considering how the existing gameplay style leaves little room for imagination.   But i'll give Mr.Cawthon the benefit of the doubt and sit tight for what's going to happen."
creepygaming,2r6sgt,Taboggan,0,Sat Jan 3 14:19:17 2015 UTC,How about physically moving between different rooms as well as having the camera feed? That's what I've got after thinking for a few seconds. He has probably thought about it quite a bit more.
creepygaming,2r6sgt,Trunn,5,Sat Jan 3 19:22:08 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that make the game easier though?
creepygaming,2r6sgt,Trunn,2,Sat Jan 3 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Make it so that you can only do some things in one room and some things in the other. You make some additional noise while moving in between them, but the path you use has a slowly moving door that only you can operate. If you close the door, you know that they can't come at you from that direction which will save you from one that always moves around no matter what you do, but keeping it closed will mean that you can't quickly move over to the other room to use the functions specific to that room.  Once more, this is just spur of the moment ideas. My point is that there is still a lot that can be done with the concept, and if he is already working on a sequel it probably means that he is taking advantage of that.  Edit: The noise I mentioned can only be heard in a room adjacent to the corridor you move through. If any of the animatronics are in that room they will hear which way you are moving and quickly go to the control room you are."
creepygaming,2r6sgt,benjamin4526,4,Sat Jan 3 20:17:28 2015 UTC,"What if they add something like there is more batteries in the backroom across the building for your camera and flashlight. It would be really easy too If you can always access the camera monitors so you could only access them in the office. they could also make the kitchen either always locked or golden freddy jumpscare when you go in. it would also be cool to see how much he could add to all the lore from being able to see every inch of all the rooms which would be really cool.   Edit: I keep thinking of all these ways on how he could make the third game. Like how it doesn't tell you the time and there are clocks in certain rooms and you have to go around the rooms and it takes you around 5 seconds to add batteries or you have to find a code for a generator and what buttons to press for it in another room, then go turn on the generator for the control room at some point."

creepygaming,2r6sgt,KayCato,9,Sat Jan 3 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"In terms if gameplay elements, FNAF burned itself out in the first installment.

Was a little confused when a sequel emerged from it, but thought ""why not, I'm sure there are people who had some fun with this title"".  I can't really understand what a 3rd installment hopes to accomplish... Is it not basically the exact same thing still? The ""gameplay"" doesn't exactly leave a whole lot of room for variety.

creepygaming,2r6sgt,Salmontaxi,5,Sat Jan 3 10:32:57 2015 UTC,"Think it's the stress of having to micromanage all of these things with the knowledge that they will be frightened by something jumping at them and loudly going ""Bloggy-woggy-woo!"". People get off on the adrenaline. What I think is most different from other horror games is that the jump scares are so foreshadowed that you know exactly when they will happen.    Randomly jump out at someone, they will be startled and it will be over. Tell someone that in about a minute something frightening will happen, then have someone jump at them after 70 seconds, the anticipation will be scary enough on it's own and they will still get frightened at the end. Having the frightening thing happen when they fail at balancing 10 different tasks, they are now also stressed out in addition to being scared.  Won't work on everyone, but I think that's the reason why most like it.  Edit: And while the sequel used the same core-concept, from what I've seen of it, enough elements were switched up for it not to feel like a rehash. There's still enough room to innovate for another sequel, but if not bigger changes happen than the iterative ones for FNaF2, it is likely to flop out of saturation."

creepygaming,2r6sgt,Clbull,-10,Mon Jan 5 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yay, even more boring gameplay of doing nothing but sitting on your fat ass in a room and checking security cameras to avoid being jump-scared by some animatronics which you probably should have brought a weapon to subdue.  But of course, FNAF's story and game design assumes the night guard is a fucking idiot and that people are fickle for buying an overrated, crap game because one of the most popular and most obnoxiously annoying YouTubers played it."

creepygaming,2r6sgt,g33k5t4,-4,Sat Jan 3 12:27:03 2015 UTC,"Because I appreciate true horror, not jumpscares."

creepygaming,2r6sgt,Clbull,0,Sat Jan 3 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"the story was loosely based on an obscure murder, thats literally all the depth there is. All the guy is doing is adding in random creepy shit and ""confirming"" fan theories that he deems cool/good enough to just slap on there."
creepygaming,2r6sgt,Chewbaccasdad,-1,Sat Jan 3 12:45:03 2015 UTC,"I agree here since the start.  It felt like the first one was really all that was going on and he just took the most interesting Fan theories and slid them in to apease the fans who would now think   ""WOW! I totally KNEW it""   or  ""OH WOW! I cant believe it was totally this deep. Hes a genius"""

creepygaming,2r6sgt,CptLeon,2,Sat Jan 3 12:52:18 2015 UTC,I especially enjoy the console version's couch co op.
creepygaming,2r6sgt,Toomykins,0,Sat Jan 3 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"I'm simultaneously interested but also not really excited. I thought the first game was great in terms of atmosphere and subtly implying its backstory. The second game technically has more in it, but it's the quantity to the first game's quality. The game was essentially solved within a day and there were basically no animations of any kind. If further choices of quantity over quality are what we can expect from the 3rd game, I'll be sitting this one out.  Spoilers for FNAF 2 below  I still think it has at least some potential to be interesting, however. Explain it to me as thoroughly as you like, but the fact that 2 is a prequel to 1 makes no sense from any standpoint other than the supplementary material arbitrarily assigning it an earlier date. It's as if 2's story had no regard for the canon established by the first game. That said, if 3 can somehow make sense of it all, I'll definitely be interested to find out."
creepygaming,2r6sgt,xandan,-9,Sat Jan 3 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"I love how the dev got some attention and is now just blatantly milking the idiots who don't understand that literally everything that has been added in new games could have easily been included as dlc/for free in the first one.  I don't want to say indie gaming is becoming a joke, but i am certainly thinking it loudly."
creepygaming,2r6sgt,Toomykins,-7,Sat Jan 3 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"This is not creepy nor does it fit what this subreddit is about.  A little bit of horror games in this subreddit is alright, but come on, A third installment of jumpscares is just not creepy nor is it unexpected.   Fuck this."
creepygaming,2r2mdy,pale_of_frost,7,Fri Jan 2 04:59:26 2015 UTC,"Hitman does have its fair share of creepiness, but I don't know if I would include this especially since it's explained later on. It did take me by surprise the first time through.  Hitman Contracts is easily the most unsettling of the Hitman games, it's probably the only one where I would use that word to describe it. The level Traditions of the Trade has a certain mystery to it that you can figure out by exploring a bit. The Meat King's Party however is definitely the most creepy and disgusting part of the game"
creepygaming,2r2mdy,Vlayer,2,Fri Jan 2 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"Meat King's Party was pretty revolting, I wouldn't say it was creepy  Traditions of the Trade had me nearly shitting my pants, I was pretty scared of running into the ghost in the closed wing, I have a paranoia of ghosts.  But the rest of the game was definitely dark; it was definitely the most claustrophobic Hitman game.  Most of the game takes place in dark damp buildings or at night.  There's no sunlight in the entire game, it's definitely the darkest Hitman game.  As for Hitman 2, I included that bit cause it was pretty damn creepy, almost as creepy as the mission afterwards where you're strolling, and look through binoculars, and see a clone of yourself pointing a sniper rifle at you.  I included this bit cause when I first played it, I had done a perfect mission, not gotten caught, not fired a single shot, and was on my way to the exit when the clone ambushed me.  Definitely enough to make you scratch your head."

creepygaming,2qzbmg,koleheltman,29,Thu Jan 1 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"What made it creepy was that this trainer, Red (not Ash), was the same character you played in the previous installments Red and Blue. The same character you took to the top of the league, defeating every trainer and bad guy who stood in your way. This was the character that many of us played with over and over for hundreds of hours, trying to be the very best. Once you reach the top, you realize that you have no one else to defeat. You are the best trainer in the entire Kanto region, after years of hard work. You have every Pokemon, every legendary. Nothing can stop you, and no challenge lies ahead. Your journey is over.   And then a new game arrives with a new character, Gold, and a brand new region, Johto. You face all sorts of new challenges and new Pokemon, but still strive for the same goal: to be the best trainer in the world. So now you spend hundreds of hours fighting your way to the top of the Johto league, and defeat the elite four. Before you can celebrate your victory, you learn of another region nearby, full of other Pokemon and a whole new Pokemon league.   Your journey continues even further, spending hours on end trying to beat every trainer in Kanto. The satisfaction you feel as you beat the Elite Four in the Kanto region is euphoric. You are truly the best trainer in the world. There is no one that can stand in your way. No one to outmatch you. There is no other trainer that is as good as you. And you believe your journey has finally come to an end.   And then you wander deep into a cave and stumble upon a familiar figure. It's takes you a moment to realize who this character is, but upon recognition your anus tightens. Your old, forgotten friend from the Kanto region. A trainer who at one time was the best in the world. Hiding away, waiting for you to return. It's almost as though he's been there for years, waiting for a challenger. Waiting for someone to give him meaning again. He silently acknowledges you, and begins to battle you with everything he has left in him. It is a very intense battle, but once you do beat him he simply disappears - never to be seen again.   It is at that point you realize that the torch has been passed on, and you truly are the Champion."

creepygaming,2qzbmg,HRHSirGideonOsborne,17,Thu Jan 1 07:10:24 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: The Twin Victim, also known as Doubleheader, is a character in Silent Hill 4: The Room. They can be found within the Prison World, Forest World and Apartment World.   The Twin Victim also known as Doublehead, are an enemy from Silent Hill 4: The Room. In addition to their game appearance, Twin Victims are also seen in the comic Dead/Alive.  The creature appears to be a large set of sleeping conjoined twin infants wearing a tattered, dirty smock and what looks like a scarf. They also appear to be feathery to a mild degree. Along with pale skin, they have enormous adult-like arms on which they stand. Their arms come out from underneath their smock, as if they are a pair of legs.

creepygaming,2qzbmg,DrummerHead,9,Thu Jan 1 10:38:27 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: The Abstract Daddy, also known as Ideal Father, is a character in Silent Hill 2. They can be found within the Labyrinth, while smaller variants can be found in the Lakeview Hotel.   Abstract Daddy, also known as Ideal Father, is a monster James Sunderland encounters in Silent Hill 2. It is a manifestation of Angela Orosco's traumatic memories of her father raping and sexual abusing her on a bed.  James first faces this monster as a boss near the end of the Labyrinth while smaller, weaker, variants can be found later on in the Lakeview Hotel.  The Abstract Daddy appears as two figures lying on a bed, covered in a ""blanket"" of putrid skin, with the two forms apparently having intercourse. The two figures seem to be trapped in a rectangular board, with the ""male"" or upper figure's arms and legs dangling out the bottom. It moves on all fours, and the lower portion of the beast has the appearance of a bed with four posts.

And the winner... something I've never discussed... the void.  I know of /r/thalassophobia/ and I agree that fucking huge creatures in the unknown are terrifying. But the void of the unprogrammed is something that has been quite terrifying to me. I remember one time playing cryisis, I was holding a log and bashing things (you become this lord of the bashing, nothing can stop you) and then the physics said ""well, you're going down now"" and then I was below the sand. And at water level... everything is water. And I was kinda happy I found a bug, and started swimming down... and then I thought ""this is not expected. I'm not supposed to be swimming down here. This water is infinite. I could be swimming down for ages"" and then I swam up very quickly.  The black void of outside the map is something that can trigger in me some sort of fear, and it's very interesting.  Honestly, I think a game should implement some sort of monster that appears when you go outside of the playable boundaries of the game. THAT would be fucking terrifying. You're all like ""look, I can see behind the buildings and they have no texture, lol. Imma jump here, lol I'm just falling now 'cause these idiots don't know 'bout my leet"" and then suddenly you see a hugely sized this coming at you and you just fearquit."
creepygaming,2qzbmg,Crumpgazing,31,Thu Jan 1 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"Oh fuck, the void. I know exactly what you mean. There's always been something unsettling to me about those moments where you become aware of a games artificiality. It's like an uncanny valley feeling of sorts. Suddenly the immersion is broken and you're very aware you're playing a game and you just feel weird and unsettled.  I used ti get a similar feeling from playing older GTA games. Something about them, like immersion wise the city itself felt good, but then there was all this odd stuff about it, like when you see a bunch of the same NPC walking beside each other, or sometimes there's none at all and you feel all alone. IDK, there was just this emptiness to the world that would make me feel all kinds of weird."
creepygaming,2qzbmg,Endermiss,5,Thu Jan 1 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"Old free-world games had that problem a lot, with the lack of power for processing and the like, there's bound to be very few NPCs if any, which gives the world an eerie ""empty"" feeling, that creeps me out."
creepygaming,2qzbmg,Crumpgazing,5,Thu Jan 1 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, I think it's partially why GTA IV is my favourite GTA game, it doesn't have the same artificial feeling as the previous games.

creepygaming,2qzbmg,Priderage,15,Fri Jan 2 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"Daddy.  This enormous, unkillable monstrosity is blocking the only way out of your apartment building. You enter the basement, see some seriously nasty shit, restore the generator power, lure Daddy into a service elevator and call it down to the basement.  But you've miscalculated. Daddy rips straight through the elevator doors. He comes for you.  What happens next is a headlong scramble out of the basement, only the basement is pitch-black and very difficult to navigate. There's a long stretch near the start of the chase that shows that Daddy is slowed down when he swipes at you if he gets too close - truthfully this isn't the danger. It's getting lost or cornered in the hellish basement of your apartment where the true danger lies.  There's also Mother, the ""final"" boss of Lone Survivor, but the fight isn't too impressive. Mother herself, however, is fucking terrifying. If anyone asked me what the worst noise I've ever heard is, it would be her scream at full volume after the rest of the game - nothing else in the game makes that kind of noise, you see. Usually it's either a sublime soundtrack or disturbing ambience.  However, truthfully there's one last thing that is even worse than Mother and Daddy, but it's buried so deep within the game that even mentioning it is nearly a spoiler enough. Suffice it to say that this entity surpassed the aforementioned creatures in sheer horror factor by several orders of magnitude."

creepygaming,2qzbmg,The_Courier,29,Thu Jan 1 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"Alright, I fear I may have exaggerated it a bit and that the final result will be a letdown but here we go.  <Spoiler> So. The plot of the original Lone Survivor without the Director's Cut is meaningful but difficult to pin down completely. It's very Silent Hill, but with more story elements that add to the mix. There are abstract, strange characters - The Man Who Wears A Box, the Man in Blue, The Director, ""DRACO"" (who we only ever learn about in writing, and whose identity is a continuing focus of theories about the game's plot).   One pivotal character that remains a focus besides all of these...people, however, is Her.  I mentioned earlier that to bring Daddy down into the basement you need to turn the power back on - fairly standard stuff, for a survival-horror game. But when you get to the generator, there's THIS fucking thing-sculpture instead. Watch the link (fun fact - the rumbling is Daddy pacing above you, it gets stronger and louder in different parts of the basement) and you'll see a scene with Her.   Later, when fighting off Mother, Mother flees the field and mortally wounds the only other significant character, The Director, whose role in the story is...very hard to pin down. But his last words are very significant:  I miss her too.  In The Director's hands after his death is a key combination to a hospital. Sensing the end is near, You goes to the hospital, passes a door that leads to a long white corridor and finds a single open room, where You is locked inside. He lies down on the bed, and your ending begins.  Now, what the end actually is, is depending on how you've conducted yourself - your psych profile. Trying to eat well, not eating junk food, staying away from various pills, non-violent evasion of enemies, keeping a daily routine, sleeping well, finding and adopting a cat, taking time off to listen to music or play on your JoyBoy...all of this affects your mental health, for the better, giving you either the Green Ending. Eating rats, murdering Thin Men and Fat Men, blasting Mother with pistol rounds in the final fight, torturing an NPC who's infected by shining a light in his face, trying to eat rotten meat and what-have-you will turn you psychotic, giving you the worst ending, the Red Ending. A mix of both nets you the Blue ending.  Think of it like this - green is exceptional mental health, high self-love and a strong desire to both live and flourish. Blue is indifferent and uncaring. Red is unflinching psychopathy. Note: the game never tells you you're being evaluated this way. It plays out as a 2D Silent Hill game, but you are warned ahead of time that you should ""take care of yourself"" and ""seek non-violent solutions"" - you are given fair warning.  In the Red or Blue ending, after some other things involving another character, you appear next to Her on a hill overlooking a ruined cityscape, and you express that you're happy you can be together, ""even if it's like this"".   In the Green ending, you meet Her by the hospital bed, and she says goodbye, and not to be afraid. We see the same hill from earlier, only it's a meadow, a field of flowers. The narrative seems clear. You is alone after Her was killed, or died of some other cause. He is the ""lone survivor"" because he survives her. The better your mental health, the more ready You is to accept losing her. In the red ending, it's implied he kills himself. In the green ending, he moves on.  But that's not the end.  Look up in this post. I mentioned ""the original Lone survivor without the Director's Cut"". I also mentioned a ""long white corridor"". Watch this and you'll see it's glanced over. A meaningless detail. You move on to the real ending.  When The Director's Cut came, it changed that.  It was now possible to attain a White Ending, with a perfect mental health score. There were three items that were added to help you get to this, but it's still a feat to achieve the White Ending, especially since you need to see all three other endings first; Red, Blue and Green.  If you qualify for the White Ending, you can continue down the hospital rooms and go to the end, as normal, for the Green Ending. Alternatively, you're given the option to head into the White Corridor.  So you do, and that's when you finally encounter Her.  ""Her"" makes a sound like a horrid demon scraping the bones of its throat together. She warps back and forth on the ground, eyes blood-red, warping over and over from the left side of the screen. If she reaches your feet, you die instantly.  Sadly, I'm not able to find what happens if you try and actually shoot her, or plant a flare, or rotten meat. Her neck distends, her spine coils out and she makes the most god awful scream, wiping out what you were doing.  Your only option is to travel down the White Corridor, which slowly becomes the oversized entrails of a living, writhing thing, before reaching the White Room, and seeing the White Ending.  Perhaps Her isn't the same in-your-face enemy as Mother. She doesn't scream unless provoked and she doesn't pose a threat unless you screw up and run towards her.  But she is so wrong.   Her has no place here, no reason to be there. Her role in the story has been a beacon of warmth and safety, a lighthouse of sense in a world of madness. Seeing her like this is so wrong, so horrid and invalid that it matches her approach - disjointed, disturbing, something that puts you ill-at-ease, and combined with the effect of just getting through the white corridor, well. It's only two minutes, but it's a harrowing two minutes, especially if you have no idea what's coming. Especially if you expected to merely see the ending when you walked through the door in the hospital.  Her leaves you helpless and bewildered, set-upon by something insane and bereft of reason. For me, she hits a sweet spot of horror that Silent Hill couldn't hit - an attack on your love for the character whose feet you've dragged through hell and whose beloved you came to see as reason.  </Spoiler>"

creepygaming,2qzbmg,Nocturnal2425,3,Thu Jan 1 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed no one has posted anything from STALKER. Immediately 3 enemies come to mind.   First and foremost, the Controllers. They're insanely strong, telekinetically pull you towards them out of nowhere, and disarm you. The shock of it will often get you killed, because if you haven't been paying attention, it's hard to recover from that. poltergeists. Invisible, hurl random objects at you, and you first meet one in a suspiciously abandoned lab. It's hard to even run from them, as any room contains tons of junk for it too throw at you. Bloodsuckers. You hear a muffled grunting sound, and out of nowhere, a twisted cthulhu headed humanoid leaps at you, and slashes you into bleeding. You unload a clip, but it flees and fades into invisibility again. You can still hear the shuffling, but you've lost track of it, and all you can do is hope there's only one so you'll have time to reload before the next assault...   I think part of why the enemies in STALKER get to me is the atmosphere. Generally, the only enemies are the occasional simple bandits. Most of the time you're in desolate environments, searching for something, and desperately trying to avoid the deadly anomaly traps of The Zone. Finally, when you're comfortable you're alone, and you've lulled yourself with quietly searching your surroundings, these things ambush you and destroy that tense loneliness. Amazing atmosphere in that series."

I don't know what it is, but they honestly stopped me from playing and enjoying nearly every level of the game. To sort of explain, they're nearly the most harmless enemy in the entire game, their name coming from the fact that they seem to just be around to do menial tasks and jobs while every other Chimera is out on the battlefield shooting or whatever. When you first encounter them they sort of just see you and start shambling their way towards you. No big deal right?  Though once they get anywhere close to you they're prone to fucking leap at you without a moments notice and latch onto you, their face covering the entire screen nearly as they bite the shit out of you and you have to shake the controller or whatever to get them off. After a few scares with them I honestly could not ge anxious or have a near panic attack whenever I saw one. The closest sort of thing that had the same sort of affect that they did, apart from my real life fear of Frogs, is probably the ghost from the P.T./Silent Hills demo. It's just that type of gnarly, nerve-wracking jump scare that gets me. And it's weird considering that there was two other enemy types in that game that did the same leap-y grab-y thing and they weren't as scary or affecting to me.

Andrei Mikoyan of article  Lost Cosmonauts:       Andrei Mikoyan was reportedly killed together with a second crew member in an attempt to reach the Moon ahead of the Americans in early 1969. Due to system malfunction, they failed to get into lunar orbit and shot past the Moon.  This story may have influenced the plot of an episode of the television series The Cape. The episode ""Buried in Peace"" first aired on October 28, 1996. In it, a shuttle crew on a mission to repair a communications satellite encounters a derelict Soviet spacecraft with a dead crew—the result of a secret attempt to send a manned mission to the moon 30 years earlier, before the United States. Tom Nowicki played Major Andrei Mikoyan in the story.  This story correlates with another claim about the unsuccessful second manned test flight of the N1 rocket.

creepygaming,2qstgg,Monklyn,3,Tue Dec 30 11:39:41 2014 UTC,"Jvk1166z.esp:       Some people might recall some momentary buzz caused a couple of years ago by a particularly odd Morrowind mod. The file name was jvk1166z.esp. It was never posted on any of the larger Elder Scrolls communities, usually just smaller boards and role-playing groups. I know in a few cases rather than being posted, it was sent via PM or email to a 'chosen few.' It was only up for a few days, to the best of my knowledge. It caused a buzz because it was a virus, or seemed to be. If you tried to load the game with the mod active, it would hang at the initial load screen for a full hour and then crash to the desktop. If you let it get that far, your install of Morrowind, along with any save files you had, would become completely corrupted. Nobody could figure out what the mod was trying to do, since it couldn't be opened in the Construction Set. Eventually, warnings were distributed not to use it if you found it, and things died down.  About a year later, in a mod board I used to frequent, someone popped up with the mod again. He said he was PMed by a lurker who deleted his account immediately after sending. He also said that the person advised him to try playing the mod through DOSbox. For some reason, this worked... sort of. The game was a bit laggy, and you couldn't get into Options, Load Game, the console, or really anything else, other than the game itself. The QuickSave and QuickLoad hotbuttons worked, but that was it. And the QuickSave file seemed to be just part of the game file, so you couldn't get at it anymore. Some speculated that the changed game used an older graphics renderer, making DOSbox necessary, but it didn't LOOK any different.  Image i==== Image i   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Common explanations for the nefarious game is a government conspiracy, or that the game is supernatural.   Another myth I like is ""Killswitch,"" which is a game where you played as a girl (or an invisible demon, though no one ever completed the game on his character due to him being near impossible to control) that explores a coal mine while fighting demons. The gameplay was very strange, and the creators described it as representing the reality of life and death. The game could only be played once, and very few copies of the game were ever made. A couple of years ago, some rich guy bought the game for like $70k, promising to do a let's play of it so other fans could enjoy it. The only video he uploaded though was 2 minutes of him crying at the menu screen."

The story describes players suffering from amnesia, night terrors and a tendency to stop playing all video games. Around a month after its supposed release in 1981, Polybius is said to have disappeared without a trace.  There is no evidence that such a game has ever existed.   Polybius is thought to take its name from the Greek historian of the same name  who was known for his assertion that historians should never report what they cannot verify through interviews with witnesses, as well as for his works in relation to cryptography and for developing the Polybius square.

""The Last Door"" is very atmospheric and creepy, scary at points.  Not exactly a horror game, but ""Gods Will be Watching"" might satisfy those criteria.  If you don't mind retro consoles, Clock Tower (SNES) and Sweet Home (NES) are amazing. They both need translations, as they weren't released in English.  Corpse Party and its sequel are both on PSP/Vita. Those are very scary, but they're more like Visual Novels than traditional games.  Those are all that I can think of right now.

Anyways feedback;   Suddenly, Jack finds himself stranded   Why? Saw something appear on the road in front, swerved to avoid and hit a tree totalling his car (Can't get any more cliché than that)? Was he drunk or suffering from fatigue (due to driving all night) and ran himself off the road after loosing focus? Why can't he use his phone, or a radio, or an emergency phone on the side of the road?   nowhere to go but a city   Why? If it's obviously abandoned/deserted or otherwise unsafe what sane person would voluntarily venture through it knowing they would likely just be putting themselves in danger, and making it more difficult for people to find him?  If he's travelling long distance wouldn't he have told someone, so eventually someone would come looking? Can't he just stay with his car with the hazard lights on, waiting for another passing vehicle? Or walk back to the last petrol stations he drove by?   Character needs a legitimate reason to why it's his only option. Is it because he took the scenic route that is almost never used by anyone and all his means of communication are non-functional? Is it -40°C and he will freeze to death without warmth (assuming his cars heating is not working either)?   narrative focused   What narrative? The characters survival? Uncovering the history of the city? I don't see anything in your post explaining these narrative elements.   interacting with the abandoned city   Doing what exactly? Looting houses? Doing puzzles to unlock secret rooms?   Innocuous decisions made early on...   Sounds unfair to the player and likely to encourage the use of walkthroughs and guides. Also I hope you realise how much work multiple storylines is (unless of coarse they're quite short).   Some storylines feature no enemies at all   So what are the hazards (besides metabolism stats)? What will make it challenging and enjoyable? The environment?   can never heal   That seems a bit harsh. Making healing items extremely scarce or making it only possible to heal in certain locations seems more fair.   no heads up display   I hope you properly compensate for this. For example; brass check, visible injuries on players arms as health becomes lower, goosebumps as you get colder, sluggish movement when hungry. Those are just some ideas but its your game, in anycase the player should know what's going on rather then suddenly dying from thirst. Also personally I do not feel something like DayZ's status text ('I'm hungry', 'My throat is dry') is a good solution.   inventory screen which will not pause the action   Sounds good, but make sure it's easy to use and doesn't not completely obscure the players vision.   poor selection of weapons   Why are there weapons? I hope there's a good reason for them being present or that they're mostly makeshift. Are they part of the cities dark past? Were their hunters living there?   'Good' and a 'Bad' ending, depending on player performance   Why make it binary? Why not a neutral ending as well? What performance, what is being measured? How much health they have left? How many items they collected?   receive a grade    Why make it arcadey? Honestly I've always thought Resident Evil's stat screen was unnecessary.        Well anyway that's just some quick thoughts I had, hope they help."
creepygaming,2q0o90,Dead_Sparrow,6,Mon Dec 22 02:13:00 2014 UTC,"My first thought was, ""What you've given up already?""   Haha! Whoops. Didn't even think of that!   Why? Saw something appear on the road in front...   Ah! Nope. I was just being purposefully vague. There are 3 different ""openings"" depending on which of the storylines you engage with. I just didn't want to tip the gameplay too heavily.  You'll be in control of the car, so if you decide to swerve off the road for whatever reason, that's your prerogative. Otherwise, events will unfold that will leave you with no choice but to enter the city.   Why? If it's obviously abandoned/deserted...   Ever driven out west in the USA? The setting of the game is going to be early 1970s. The last civilization was 100 miles behind him, and there's what seems to be a city a mile or two ahead. It's hard to tell a city's abandoned from a distance away. Depending on the opening, the impetus to stay in the city is quite varied.   If he's travelling long distance wouldn't he have told...   He will, in fact, be late for a meeting. The idea is he's in the middle of the nevada/utah/colorado desert with the last petrol station being some 100 miles behind him. With the blistering sun about to rise, walking 100 miles through the desert without water or food isn't really the best of options. Though, of course, you're free to try. The game doesn't /force/ you into the city. It's a survival game. Walking out into the desert isn't a very good idea if survival is your goal.   Character needs a legitimate reason to why it's his only option.   Yep! That's the intent. I figured our modern generation would identify with the feeling of isolation and abandonment much greater if the time period simply did not even have the concept of a cell phone.  The intent was Jack is stuck between a rock and a hard place. The desert is almost certain death, and from where he's standing, and the city ahead, even if it is deserted, brings with it the (perhaps false) promise of some supplies and at least shelter.   So what are the hazards...   Ah! That's the intent of the different storylines. Each one features a different ""antagonist"" hazard, a different reason the city was abandoned. I don't want to reveal too much yet, but think of it this way. The hazards of finding yourself in this situation with a failed city like detroit are much different than finding yourself near chernobyl.    That seems a bit harsh.   Don't fight a wolf if you lack the necessary medical expertise to repair the damage done. The intent of this is to be a realistic simulation.  If you start bleeding, you can bandage the wound, but you lack the necessary medical expertise to repair a broken arm, or a gunshot wound. If you don't want to die by the sword, you best sneak by your problems or not miss when you confront them.   no heads up display   I should probably change this to minimal heads up display. You know when your cold, and the game will tell you that's the case.   I'll do something like display a snowflake in the lower right hand. I was more getting at ""there's not an ammo meter or a thirst bar"".   Those are just some ideas   I like them a lot! I was planning on doing some of those exact things, along with the player breathing heavily if terrified, etc. I was planning on /not/ having background music other than ambience.   The intent is that you won't suddenly start dying of thirst and that's shocking to you. It'll just be done in a way where you don't ""Check your thirst meter to see if you should bring water with you or drink it here.""   but make sure it's easy to use and doesn't not completely obscure the players vision.   Yep! I was planning on some sort of a pop-out-from-the-bottom action bar sorta thing. Just a couple slots for small items.   ""Say Jack, is that a tire-iron in your pocket or you just happy to see me"" is what I wanna shy away from. Bulky items you carry and drop, small things like a pistol or some keys/candybars you can toss in your pockets for later use.   Why are there weapons? I hope there's a good reason   Yep! It's more stuff like, if your opening sequence involves you fixing a flat tire, a tire iron is ""a weapon"" for this game. If you find a pistol in the city (which is very dependent on which storyline you're following), ammo will be in short supply.  The only reasons there's guns even a little is the fact it would seem /less/ realistic to me for an american city, even an abandoned one, to not have at least two or three pistols. ;P  But yes, the sort of reasons you listed here is the direction.   Why make it binary? Why not a neutral ending as well?   Maybe there will be? I was simply planning on ""Well if you die, that's bad. If you live at all, that's good.""   I suppose you could say getting a ""D-"" and the good ending /is/ the neutral ending? The focus here was really just to say ""The ending is the thing you're playing for and you can do it so poorly that you 'fail'.""   What performance, what is being measured?   My tentative plans was to use an A-F grading scheme. If you die during the encounter, that's bad and an ""F"" ending. Otherwise, your grade depends on: (a) How many newspaper headlines did you collect exposing the history of the city. (b) How many side-quests did you fulfill in your explorations. That sorta jazz.  I was then planning on using the ""-/+/neutral"" modifier of the grade to be gameplay oriented. If you finish the game bloody, beaten, and bruised having spent half the time starving, you get a ""B-"". If you finish it walking out without a scratch on you and a full stomach, you get a ""B+"" instead.   How much health they have left? How many items they collected?   Among other things, yep! Sorry, I read these two leading questions after I typed the response to the direct one. :3   Why make it arcadey?   I'm open to other grading schemes. I'm less going for ""stats"" and more going for ""overall completeness"". The intent of having this kind of summary screen was to give the player /some/ feedback on how much of the game they've seen.  I'm expecting players to scrimp through the first time, get a ""C-"" and go ""What the fuck? I thought I did well! Jesus how much did I miss..."" sort of reactions to the letter grading. Some gamers will just play through to play through and don't mind if parts of the story are left untold. I'm one of those guys that, upon getting a summary screen with a silver metal and a ""0/3 secret areas found"" screen will immediately replay the mission to find the secrets.   Honestly I've always thought Resident Evil's stat screen was unnecessary.   I play for the stat's screen. :P  The story is the key here, the stats screen is to cover the desire some gamers have to know ""how much of the story did I uncover"" sorta jazz. That's all! :)  If you want to just play through an see the story unfold, you're free to just hit spacebar and go back to the title screen. I just wanted to provide /some/ completion-based feedback.  The letter grading I was planning so I could throw it on the side of the title screen once you've completed something, so you'll see like  ""Economically Failed City: B-""  Off to the right, maybe a ""1/7 Stories completed"" sort of thing too after the first playthru.    Well anyway that's just some quick thoughts I had, hope they help.   Yep! Certainly! Always good to have answers to questions. :D  Thanks for your time!"
creepygaming,2q0o90,Dutch_Wilkerson,3,Mon Dec 22 07:36:43 2014 UTC,Also 7 unique and individual story lines and endings? To say this is ambitious is a grotesque  understatement.
creepygaming,2q0o90,shiny_dunsparce,2,Mon Dec 22 07:23:16 2014 UTC,"Meh, I don't really think so. It's worth it to me to not have a single ""Here's all the ways you can expect to be spooked"" youtube video released of the game.  The way I'm planning on implementing this is very ""the city is the stage and a story will be told on it"" sort of way. Given like... half the storylines feature no enemies at all, the configuration of the rooms and the items available are all procedurally generated, I don't think it'll really be that difficult to execute.  The dual points of the game are to test the player against a set of challenges. I could just as easily wrapped all the mechanics I was thinking into one story, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as good.  Think of it less like ""I'm gonna tell Hamlet, and Othello, and the Merchant of Venice, and..."" and more like a game of clue. Regardless of if colonel mustard does it or ms scarlet, the factors may be different but the ""outcome"" is the same."
creepygaming,2q0o90,shiny_dunsparce,2,Mon Dec 22 07:42:01 2014 UTC,Will it be possible to uncover Story events from the objects in the city. You can learn as much from an abandoned living room as you can from a headline. Also where does the paranormal part factor into this? I'd be cool if you fight coyotes and snakes and natural things with the spooky/weird part being the backstory. I see this being somewhat like Vanishing of Ethan Carter meets The Forest meets Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
creepygaming,2pztw9,NCWithasuit,15,Sun Dec 21 19:30:06 2014 UTC,"I think Silent Hill 2 tops the list for me. (Though I loved the first one as well, along with the PSOne Clock Tower.) The original Resident Evil really got me too. The hordes of zombies and abundance of ammo and ridiculous guns in ""survival horror"" games these days really takes away from the elements of creepiness and fear these games used to be built upon. That one lone zombie eating and not even attacking you right away in RE1 always got me so bad. Lots of honorable mentions, but for me Silent Hill 2 really taps into how most fears are based on your own psychological weakness'. I don't think any other game has tapped into that theme as much as SH2. I have not played Eternal Darkness, but my b/f has and he adores it. I hope it's aged well should I decide to play it one day."

creepygaming,2pztw9,LearmingDisodor,8,Sun Dec 21 23:00:22 2014 UTC,"I was enamored with how dynamic the AI for Scissor Man was. I liked how sometimes he'd find you if you'd hide, and sometimes he wouldn't, even if you hid in the same spot upon a reload. I got every ending you could in that game, for both Jennifer and Helen. I abandoned a lot of ""survival horror"" games this generation and whenever my friends ask me why I don't love L4D or some other game do, I tell them because it's just not scary to me. I'm armed to the teeth, the enemies are so abundant and rushing at me so quick I can't even process fear. Fear is hiding under a bed in a dorm room, seeing Scissor Man open the door and hoping he won't jump on top of the bed and impale my ass. THAT's survival horror."
creepygaming,2pztw9,PretttyHateMachine,3,Sun Dec 21 23:03:13 2014 UTC,"All of what your saying is yes...I loved that scissor man had a timer in that if you were not doing anything for 3-5 mins he would automatically come out and hunt you down made the game so much more terrifying. I liked the idea that you can only hide in a certain amount of places for a limited time, but once you find that one sweet spot, it kind of got a little less terrifying...very little."
creepygaming,2pztw9,LearmingDisodor,11,Mon Dec 22 00:32:27 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed Scratches.  It's a point and click mystery style game but it just slowly got in my head and terrified me in moments. Good story and creepy setting. If you are into that type of game, I highly recommend it.  edit: fixed formatting of link"
creepygaming,2pztw9,mendorr,3,Sun Dec 21 21:18:15 2014 UTC,Haha no way! I thought I was the only person to ever buy this game (I even bought the Special Edition Box that came with a ticket for a local Horror Theme Park).  It was nothing like I imagined (I only saw screenshots before) and was really disappointed when it turned out to be more of a point&click game - I might give it a shot again after reading your comment.
creepygaming,2pztw9,Hubinator,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:03:20 2014 UTC,"You definitely should. If you take the time to get thoroughly enveloped in it, it could turn out to be one of your more memorable gaming experiences. Play it in the dark alone for full effect. There were a few times where I was actually scared to click the mouse."
creepygaming,2pztw9,mendorr,1 point,Mon Dec 22 04:00:59 2014 UTC,Is there any way to turn down the sensitivity further? I turned it down all the way in the options and its still too fast for me to move the camera around. It's the reason I stopped playing it.
creepygaming,2pztw9,Steambot05,1 point,Sun Dec 28 16:49:13 2014 UTC,"I completely agree, it's one of my favorite horror games too. I love games where the mystery is subtle at first and slowly creeps up on you while you're figuring out what is going on. Great soundtrack too, really added to the atmosphere of exploring an old house. And those dream sequences were indeed some 3spooky5me-shit."
creepygaming,2pztw9,Vidyabro,20,Mon Dec 22 21:43:42 2014 UTC,"While not the scariest, Alan Wake is my favorite horror game. The story is incredibly well-written and the characters feel vulnerable and human. It has an amazingly immersive world and very atmospheric (although a bit repetitive) gameplay.    I'm playing through Afterfall Insanity at the moment (it's currently free in IndieGala) and I'm very pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is similar to Alan Wake, the horror to Dead Space (although not exactly as much) - all in all a very solid combination.   I'm not a huge fan of cheap jump scares, even though both Alan Wake and Afterfall do have some in their horror-repertoire. It's mainly about the creepyness for me and these games definitely hit the nail on the head there.  I'm interested in what others think and would like to hear some recommendations too!"

creepygaming,2pztw9,ColeTheo,7,Mon Dec 22 08:24:16 2014 UTC,"I'm a bit surprised nobody else has mentioned Alien:Isolation. Yeah, the classics are damn good, but personally being trapped with a Xenomorph hunting me actively is amazingly unnerving, especially when I can check a scanner and know that it's always there.  There's spooky get-in-your-head ghost town, and zombeez and such, but you're not being hunted in those.   A damn close runner up is Shalebridge Cradle from Thief: Deadly Shadows. Hoooooly fuck, that's the creepiest damn level of any game ever. Especially one that didn't involve scary shit anywhere else in the franchise."
creepygaming,2pztw9,speelmydrink,9,Mon Dec 22 14:42:35 2014 UTC,"The Fatal Frame series sticks out to me because of how helpless I felt the first time I played it only having a camera.   Silent Hill 3 is pretty creepy, but the randomness of 4 was even worse.   Speaking of randomness, Eternal Darkness stands out too; I remember that game making me feel insane.   Dead Space 1 & 2 for sure.  Last but not least, the most recent one has been Outlast. That game is like no other."
creepygaming,2pztw9,tifacockhart,6,Sun Dec 21 20:57:34 2014 UTC,"Lone Survivor. You have a pistol and that's it. But the fighting isn't the point. It's the story, the surviving, living a daily routine in a world of rotting madness.  Inspired by Silent Hill, but far and away a different creature altogether."
creepygaming,2pztw9,Priderage,8,Mon Dec 22 02:29:05 2014 UTC,"Fatal Frame 1-3 are probably my favorites, just because ghosts are downright scary to me. Very good atmosphere, good scares, pretty decent stories as well.  Silent Hill 1-4 are another group of favorites. Obviously these are really well known, and you might have already played them, but I still love the hell out of the series.  I would say Resident Evil, but zombies don't scare me too much anymore. Though Resident Evil 2 did scare the shit out of me when I was a kid."

Creates one of the best atmospheres of any game I've played, and I was pretty freaked out the whole time.  Don't wanna say any more for fear of ruining the story, but definitely worth a playthrough."

creepygaming,2pztw9,Playle,2,Mon Dec 22 15:04:23 2014 UTC,"Like most on here I'm gonna roll with the first few Silent Hill games.  Number 1 being my personal favorite in the series.  I'm surprised there's no mention of the Siren games made by the original Silent Hill creator.  I only played the first in the series on the PS2.  This game shit me up and creeped me out like no other game.  The filtered slightly wooden graphics for the time helped create a perfect atmosphere for the setting. The Shibito enemy where incredibly unnerving to stealth your way around.  The part that sticks out the most for me is the twist with the teenage girl you play as in the red track suite, I won't say much more than that.  I hear the sequels are not as good.  Still, I'd love to get around to digging out my PS2 again and giving this a replay."

There's also a nice let's play by Nucleargothic."
creepygaming,2pztw9,JohnTravoltaire,4,Mon Dec 22 10:33:14 2014 UTC,"Amnesia: The Dark Descent is among my favorite games, regardless of genre, and what that game does with atmosphere is something that hasn't been surpassed in the 4 years since it's release. Amnesia's predecessors in the Penumbra series are also good, though I'd recommend Overture over the others.  Outlast is arguably the scariest game I've ever played, but in a less atmospheric, but still incredibly tense way. It's the kind of game that wants to make you shit your pants and then laugh at you about it. I had fun with it.  Home is a great way to kill 45 minutes to an hour, and Gone Home is a longer, less supernatural, indie game that does a great job of recreating that ominous feeling you get when you're alone.  Other than that, I recommend Bioshock and Resident Evil 4 as triple A titles with scares. Bioshock is scarier, but RE4 is a fantastic game all around, even if it doesn't give you chills."

Don't know very much about Android, but I can provide some suggestions for general gaming for those that are interested.  ""The Last Door"" is very atmospheric and creepy, scary at points.  Not exactly a horror game, but ""Gods Will be Watching"" might satisfy those criteria.  If you don't mind retro consoles, Clock Tower (SNES) and Sweet Home (NES) are amazing. They both need translations, as they weren't released in English.  Corpse Party and its sequel are both on PSP/Vita. Those are very scary, but they're more like Visual Novels than traditional games.  Lone Survivor: Director's Cut! That's an incredible game and is available on pretty much every console, as well as PC.  Those are all that I can think of right now. If I recall any more I'll edit my post."

There has to be a real life story about a child molester working at a Chuck-E-Cheese that we can make a comparison to.

creepygaming,2pjoaj,blueeyedconcrete,14,Wed Dec 17 05:14:26 2014 UTC,"No the mask is to make them think that you are just another animatronic like them, since they are not very fond of humans walking around at night. They force you into a suit to kill you if they catch you.  It's not mentioned in the game but I'd say the face detection software would probably work more like an alarm if they detect someone rather than murder a guy in front of dozens of children."

I'd rather some arcane puzzles that have to be googled than square block in the square hole puzzles.  My only real complaint is that there is no save system so you have to complete chapters before quitting.  I find that exhausting for a game with a series of puzzles to work out.  Alt tabbing is my best friend, but still is unpleasant.  As it's my only complaint, it's still a strong recommendation :)"

creepygaming,2oh9r7,12MoreSeconds,16,Sat Dec 6 19:45:02 2014 UTC,"Death Minigames:       In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, when the player is killed by any of the animatronics, they may be taken to a minigame that is very reminiscent of an Atari 2600 game involving various tasks, in which the player controls an animatronic. Failing, or even succeeding, can result in another jumpscare. The games seem to give some more insight into what happened with the missing children and possibly explain the motive behind why the animatronics attack the player.  SAVETHEM Edit     Freddy with glowing white eyes walks with a microphone in hand. The player controls Freddy Fazbear by using the W, A, S, D (movement), up, down, left, and right keys (facing different directions), and seems to have to follow a figure resembling The Puppet.  Once arriving at a certain room with the Puppet, the game abruptly cuts to static and ends. The player can choose not to follow the Puppet and instead receive an identical ending by encountering Golden Freddy at random. However, this sometimes results in an abrupt end to the minigame following the red static then taking the player back to the title screen. While the player is walking, letters can be clearly heard called out at regular intervals, spelling out ""S-A-V-E-T-H-E-M."" There are several variations of this minigame in which the player starts out in different rooms, those including The Office and Parts/Service. The Mangle also appears in a room near the bottom of the layout; touching it will cause the game to end in red static. Very rarely during this minigame, a purple figure will appear at the end of the room the player has entered. The figure will follow Freddy, until coming into contact with him. Blue static instead of red will then cover the screen, flashing the words ""You can't"" at the bottom left hand corner of the screen. The game will then crash. Give Gifts, Give LifeEdit The player will play as The Puppet. Instructions at the top read ""Give Gifts"" which is completed by approaching four small figures that look like dead children. Once the gifts are all given out and the player returns to the middle of the room, the text on the top of the screen will change to ""Give Life,"" and the player must approach each of them again, resulting in the four original animatronics' masks appearing on the heads of the children, possibly implying they are being stuffed in an animatronic suit.  All throughout this sequence, multiple letters are called out, spelling ""H-E-L-P-T-H-E-M."" Upon completion, Golden Freddy will jumpscare. Upon close inspection, a fifth body may be seen in the middle of the room right before the jumpscare. Unlike in the other minigames this one has a score - 100 points are awarded for each gift given. In the end, there will be a total of 800 points. However, during the Golden Freddy jumpscare it will change to a random number. Some recorded numbers include: ""5229,"" ""9225,"" ""6762,"" and ""7226."" Take Cake to the ChildrenEdit     Freddy carrying cake.   Playing as Freddy, the player has to take cake to six kids (two in the Mobile versions). Walking to each child makes them turn green, and leaving them alone for too long makes them turn red. Meanwhile, a child stands outside crying. As the player tries to serve cake to all six kids, a purple car will pull up outside and a purple person gets out, who then proceeds to kill the sad child (who actually appears to stop crying and then cry even harder while this is happening).  The sad child will then turn gray when dead. All the while, letters are called out, spelling ""S-A-V-E-H-I-M,"" and the player begins to move slower and slower. If the player is able to make all the children green at the same time, the player will be unable to move and will be forced to watch the children turn red. When the minigame ends, the Puppet will jumpscare the player.  Foxy Minigame Edit Playing as Foxy, the player walks out of what appears to be the curtained Pirate Cove and into a room with children, who celebrate his arrival. All five children appear to be happy, with the bottom one offset so it looks sad due to the black bars. The player is then returned to the curtained area and has to repeat this twice.   On the third playthrough, the purple man who killed the crying child in the Take Cake to the Children minigame (see above) is seen standing in the corner of the starting room, smiling. When Foxy approaches the children, they seem lifeless. The minigame then ends with Foxy's jumpscare.  Image i==== Image i   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Also Passing Pineview Forest was a Oculus test as far as I know, if you want more from the devs then Pineview Drive is made by the same people. It was...okay. The 3D models were amazing for a small team, but the gameplay and the optimization needed work. They use fear as a health bar in the same way Amnesia: The Dark Descent intended to, but Amnesia opted out of it when it was reveal to be a janky mechanic in testing.

creepygaming,2mxgra,TheGamingOnion,3,Thu Nov 20 23:52:35 2014 UTC,"I have two pairs of JVC XX bass headphones, one being newer than the last. I use a SONY PHA-2 headphone amplifier that I have plugged into my computer via a midi/audio mixer. The headphones are pretty low-end, but with the amplifier the bass is unreal. The amplifier has a nice clean sound that doesn't get distorted when the volume is up high. I'm sure it would be great with a pair of seinheissers. I find the bass in the headphones is great for action games. 20mm cannons sound awesome in War Thunder.  I think the bass would be pretty effective in horror games that utilize sound and music in order to scare you. I would probably go with headphones that have much clearer high notes that aren't drowned out by bass. Seinheissers are good for this, although they are more expensive. You get what you pay for."
creepygaming,2mxgra,RTCinder,2,Fri Nov 21 01:29:06 2014 UTC,"I feel like the bass is less important in horror games, as it's the mids and the highs where the majority of the scary noise/ambient sounds/music sit."

creepygaming,2m2w1a,RyokuSonic,98,Wed Nov 12 15:41:56 2014 UTC,"To me, they seem like a cheap opportunity to get a scare in. Like the game jumps out at you, grabs you by the shoulders, and screams ""I'M SO FUCKIN SCARY RIGHT?!"" while shaking you. Rather than building atmosphere/tension and actually being scary.   Yes the jump scare ""scared"" me, but am I actually frightened by the game? No."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,toxicapathy,33,Wed Nov 12 15:45:19 2014 UTC,"I think games can use them too much, but they are OK in moderation - they are scary, after all. But games should certainly not rely on them but build atmosphere instead."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,JetpackAwaaay01,34,Wed Nov 12 15:51:29 2014 UTC,"I actually love it when a game has built atmosphere for a while and then throws a jump scare at you. This adds some release to the tension, but also amps it up quite a bit and makes a stressful situation that the player has to contend with while scared out of their mind. You've known that this scare has been coming for a long time but you didn't think it was gonna happen right now and oh my god I'm gonna die.  When deployed properly, they can make a situation much scarier. When deployed in the conventional way, they make me quit the game in sadness."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,toxicapathy,6,Wed Nov 12 15:58:44 2014 UTC,"You're definitely right about that. I think moderation is the key when it comes to combining atmosphere with the cheap thrills of jump scares. To me games with just jump scares are kind of like teen slasher flicks, in that you might sit through it and have some fun, but at the end of the day you come out neither better or worse for it."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,jester1357,4,Wed Nov 12 16:28:21 2014 UTC,"I don't think the term ""JUMP SCARE"" refers to well-builted and executed quick scares.  more so on the point of ""it's the jump that scares you"""
creepygaming,2m2w1a,Pyrelord,11,Wed Nov 12 18:39:09 2014 UTC,"Yes the jump scare ""scared"" me, but am I actually frightened by the game? No.   Jump scares don't scare you, they startle you. They're cheap and easy to throw into games and movies, that doesn't make them inherently better or worse than ""real"" scares, just cheaper and easier, thus more likely to get overused, which they are.  They don't require so many moving pieces either, nor are they as prone to failure. I good and truly scary atmosphere requires finely crafted visuals, audio, voice acting, writing, and overall ambiance and it can still fail.   Say you use claustrophobia and confinement to set up an increasing sense of helplessness and fear, but the player is just not afraid of those things, it will be lost on them, yet the jump scare will still likely startle them. Same with almost any tool you can use to build fear, especially when you are transitioning a product between languages and cultures (as video games often are), where nuances are so easily lost and cultural sensitivities are often completely different.  The great games do what /u/toxicapathy talks about here, they build a great atmosphere AND incorporate jump scares to keep you off balance and engaged. They're not bad, just overused, and not a replacement for a truly scary atmosphere."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,Torisen,42,Wed Nov 12 21:29:47 2014 UTC,"Remember during Jaws when the shark pops up when Scheider is tossing chum into the water, and it scared the crap out of everyone?  Now do you remember the moment near the beginning when a diver was moving among shipwrecks and the corpse surprised everyone with a startle?  When Steven Spielberg was making the film, he had a few test screenings.  At first, the film was cut such that the corpse didn't frighten anyone, and when the shark finally burst out of the water, the audience had a HUGE reaction.  When he put the corpse jumpscare back in, he said the reaction with the shark was ""cut in half.""  In other words, the audience had already been startled once, so they were less likely to be affected by another jump.  The more jumpscares there are, the less likely any of them will be particularly impactful.  You can also go so far into jumpscare territory that the game ceases to be ""scary"" and is instead just extremely nerve-wracking (like Five Nights at Freddy's).  That is its own category, but not a particularly frightening one.  Also, jumpscares are a crest of excitement.  You HIT IT, then the tension immediately subsides because your mind realizes you're just in a theater/at home and everything is fine, which reduces the immersion in the film/game temporarily, and creates a kind of emotional hiccup that the story in question has to recover from.  Ultimately then, jumpscares are cheap thrills, but are often overused and thus become ineffective and eventually either simply annoying or tense instead of scary.  The real art in horror is crafting a lingering, ongoing dread throughout that just suffocates you.  That kind of work is very difficult to pull off well, such that there are only a handful in all of film and gaming to point to that achieve it."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,tomrhod,5,Wed Nov 12 16:54:18 2014 UTC,"I loved how the shark scared the shit out of everyone when it came out of the water, but it wasn't quite like the jumpscares we think of when we think of jumpscares.    It wasn't like, ""dark, forboding music walking through a spooky house, let me just check behind here...nothing. Well I guess it's saf-BOOOOOO!!!!!! WASN'T THAT SCARY""    It was just a casual moment and the character was in the middle of dialogue, and then the shark just breaks the water and you just see it. That's it. It didn't jump at the screen or move super fast, it was just the reveal. We'd been told of a shark throughout the whole movie, and this is the first time we see it so we don't just say ""Oh, that scared me"", we say ""Holy shit! There it is!""    Also, wasn't the diver finding the body a deleted scene?"
creepygaming,2m2w1a,17jododd,3,Wed Nov 12 19:15:33 2014 UTC,"Nope it's not deleted, it's why Richard Dreyfuss's character drops the tooth he found embedded in the wood."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,noktiis,3,Wed Nov 12 20:11:56 2014 UTC,"That was totally a jumpscare, just a very well done jumpscare. And the diver is not a deleted scene, it's in the opening of the film. And that was certainly more of a traditional jump - complete with music stab - than the shark. Still, the two affected one another because the startle was still the same."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,tomrhod,11,Wed Nov 12 20:26:55 2014 UTC,"I always, always say that a jumpscare should have a threat with it. It's okay to have those occasional jumpscares ""Boo!"" things, but if your game is only about them, you have failed to make a lasting experience.  FNAF, for example, uses the jumpscare as : Jumpscare = Death. Which is absolutely fine because it builds the tension of not getting caught. Jumpscare is now part of the gameplay. All is good.  Resident Evil 1/2 has you running around, then a huge monster blows the wall next to you. You had almost no atmosphere, but you are heavily panicked and now have to think fast if you don't want to die. This creates a memorable moment of your gaming career, something you will love talking about with your friends.  My problem is the jumpscare like the very first one of Outlast. Outlast is a fantastic game, very fun to play. But it's also guilty of having jumpscares that do nothing but startle you. It does a lot like horror movies rather than a horror game. There, I was startled, I shouted, and now have exteriorised any feeling of tension I had. I no longer need to think twice to continue, I just walk ahead and try to go to the next zone I need to go to.  Jumpscares like the latter would probably be scarier, however, if you needed to not shout at all. Like, having a microphone plugged while playing. Don't speak, don't breath too heavily, don't scream, or else people will be able to hear you and come after you."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,PocketFacks,10,Wed Nov 12 20:02:19 2014 UTC,"They're more ""startling"" than ""scary"". Jumpscares are like when someone jumps out at you from around the corner and yells ""BOO"". Yeah, sure, you startled me. but I'm not actually scared of you"
creepygaming,2m2w1a,AntarcticFox,7,Wed Nov 12 16:50:09 2014 UTC,"I think the jumpscare is a valuable tool, but only when it's effectively paired with a good atmosphere and psychological horror aspects. Amnesia had some jump scares that scared the shit of me, but they were few and far between, and took place in a setting that was already creepy.   To contrast, Doom 3 was lacking in the setting department but had jump scares everywhere, and to me, it just wasn't effective."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,Jimmyfinder,2,Wed Nov 12 18:05:59 2014 UTC,"I think doom 3 had a good atmosphere but it was just an action fps not really a thriller. Once you have a bfg or a minigun nothing can fuck with you why should you be afraid. In contrast, the moments right after shit goes down at the station were tense, especially the first encounter with the 2headed maggots and the teleporting fuckers. But you are also not equipped at that point and they just become ubiquitous later on. The game was more of a tech showcase than a legitimate game in the end though."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,porkboi,1 point,Wed Nov 12 20:31:53 2014 UTC,"And not even a particularly good tech showcase. In addition to being a much better game in every possible way, Half-Life 2 came out around the same time and blew Doom 3 out of the water visually. For me, there's definitely parts of the atmosphere that work, but there's just as many that don't, and the level design is just too bland. And the enemy design. And the weapons. I actually found the flashlight switching to be a good element, at least from the perspective of a horror game rather than an action one. It added a lot of tension even if it made no sense. But overall... Doom 3 was a big mess. I'd probably have liked it more if it wasn't being called Doom, but it didn't live up to the franchise's legacy."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,epeternally,2,Thu Nov 13 15:19:26 2014 UTC,I have nothing against jumpscares if done right. I feel some games suffer from not having any. Silent Hill 2 for example has an awesome atmosphere but i wouldn't call it scary because there was never a moment the game truly scared me. Sure i felt uncomfortable but nothing pushed me over the edge of being truly scared. Throw in 1 or 2 jumpscares and it would be one of if not the single scariest games i've ever played

You may not even jump from the picture just the sudden shock of a extremely loud noise."

creepygaming,2m2w1a,OriginsOfSymmetry,1 point,Wed Dec 3 12:38:39 2014 UTC,"The problem is a jump scare doesn't stick with you (usually).  When a scare is well set-up and executed, it should shake you to your core.  That fear sits inside you long after the scare is over.  Jump scares can totally do that.  I think the first Five Nights at Freddy's pulls them off spectacularly, but the problem is that most of them think its plenty scary to just have shit pop out and surprise you.  Which is scary in a knee-jerk way, but you leave relatively unharmed.  A good scare should scar you deep down."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,Sheogorggalag,1 point,Thu Nov 13 04:39:09 2014 UTC,"I see a scare almost like a joke. You have a build up, set the atmosphere and tone, let the tension pile on and then you have a payoff. The ""Punchline"" if you will. The problem isnt that jump scares themselves are bad. It's that they are rarely used well.   Many developers seem to think that just having a random cunt jump out at you is automatically scary when we all know thats not the case."

creepygaming,2m2w1a,Grimgiven,1 point,Sat Nov 15 04:09:45 2014 UTC,"I think there are enough examples of jump scares being handled wrongly. I think you do actually need them, they get the adrenaline release and some have been pretty good; like when the corpse you need to take a photo of actually turns out to be alive and starts reaching out for help in Condemned. That was handled well.  Dead Space 2, did a weird thing were there were a lot of action jump scares, but then the games own building soundtrack would telegraph them too much, and often in advance. For me, that just didn't work for the horror section of the game.  I do think they are needed especially if the game has a slow building atmosphere and you find yourself becoming used to the atmosphere. With most horror games, the end third is more game than horror and the occasional jump scare at the right time can help keep the tension up."
creepygaming,2m2w1a,Nighthawkkk,1 point,Sun Nov 23 11:55:20 2014 UTC,"Jump scares can be scary if used right, cry of fear had a great jumpscare towards the beginning of the game that really ""built up"" to it, this part of the game had great atmosphere while constantly building up tension before the scare happened. This is how jump scares are meant to be done, most games now adays just toss a jumpscare or two in every 5 minutes and slap a ""horror"" genre on them. If you want to keep a horror game scary and interesting, you HAVE to use these things in moderation. That goes the same for other things in horror games like the cat -and-mouse formula outlast and amnesia used, yeah they can be scary, but i definately lost interest like 30 minutes in. A good horror game comes down to atmosphere, variety, storytelling, and the unexpected."

creepygaming,2m1bt2,Speyedur,18,Wed Nov 12 03:19:28 2014 UTC,"The most important thing is atmosphere, and the most important aspect of atmosphere is sound design. If you get the sound design right then that alone can keep players on edge (The first Amnesia is the best example I can think of that gets it perfectly right). Dim/creepy lighting, fog etc will further enhance the atmosphere.  Some other things;   Limited selection of weapons, ideally none what-so-ever or makeshift weapons (Tools, objects etc) Severely limited resources (health and ammo) (Resident Evil series) Loosing things; for example a weapon being taken from the player Narrative and lore; Good environmental story telling, as well as, audio logs, notes or journals (The original Bioshock is does this well) Weak main character, don't give them ability to kill everything with ease. Ideally the player should at best only be able to slow down enemies, they should generally be trying to avoid enemies not engage them in combat. (Dead Space makes this mistake which detracted heavily from the scare-factor, which was a shame because it does alot of other things right) Show how the player character (PC) is being affected (Attitude/Behaviour/State of Mind) by the situation they're in.  For example talking to themselves, shaking a little etc. Also make sure the character has a clear reason (Story-wise) to remain there, so it's clear the character is fighting their fear to complete their goal. Changes to the world which the player did not cause; revisit an area to find it different somehow. Doors locked, tables overturned, anything that makes it clear someone or something has been here while you were absent or that perhaps your mind is playing tricks on you. Look away from an NPC, then look back and they're gone, inversely something that wasn't there is now and you'll wish it wasn't. Force the player to leave their comfort zone, and/or safe areas. (Alan Wake is a good example of this, we know unlit areas are not safe but we're forced to travel through them) Make the only way for the player to progress to go descend further into 'hell'. Isolation; people not being where they should be, or people ignoring your PC refusing to help them. Make the PC unable to communicate with others eg phone and radios dead. Non-euclidean architecture Monsters; don't let the player get a good look at them, let the player see shadows, silhouettes, hear them roar. Let their imagination go wild. (Personal experience I had with penumbra; Beginning of the game, enter the mines, wander around a bit hear growls and see blood stains, start moving more cautiously, growls approach so I hide, see a shadow of something illuminated on the wall, find corpses and so on eventually forced to face the creature. Turns out it was just a wolf, but in my mind I'd imagined it to be something far more terrifying) Don't have a huge number of enemies it reduces the fear.   Well thats a random mess of things, I've left out a lot especially in regards to enemies, hopefully someone else can cover that.  In regards to jump-scares, they're most certainly not necessary. But used scarcely they're fine. I think it's best when the players action causes them (thus making it possible to avoid), for example trying to open a clearly suspicious door or getting too close to something creepy."
creepygaming,2m1bt2,Dead_Sparrow,2,Wed Nov 12 05:15:38 2014 UTC,"See the early Silent hill games for great examples of most of these points, SH2 is pretty much a masterclass in how to build tension over extended periods of time."

creepygaming,2m1bt2,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Wed Nov 12 11:16:24 2014 UTC,"I believe that a jumpscare can be used for good. Unfortunately, it usually isn't. But a jumpscare gives the player a very negative physical reaction. That can be used as a powerful tool.   Most of the games people complain about put the jumpscares in really bad locations, usually right after the player makes progress. So in a Pavlovian way, it's telling the player that making it further into the game is a bad thing. But a jumpscare would work very effectively if it happened right after the player made a mistake. In the same Pavlovian fashion, it teaches the player what not to do.   Or it could work if the jumpscare was caused directly from the big bad, (no jumpscare fakeout bullshit) and used sparingly. It would once again teach the player that the cause of that jumpscare is something to be afraid of.  Really, the game can't rely on jumpscares, but if the focus of the horror is on atmosphere and suspense, which can be built in some of the ways Dead_Sparrow mentioned, an occasional well-placed jumpscare can improve the experience."
creepygaming,2m1bt2,madmonkeymud,1 point,Wed Nov 12 11:43:59 2014 UTC,"Take aside the running from monsters sections (which are terrible), and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories does a wonderful job of this. It's full of mindfucks, eeriness, and atmosphere. Without doing too much that is overtly scary happening, it all just feels so subtly off that it's more unsettling and unnerving than almost any other experience I've had in games. It's not scary because monsters are jumping out at you, it's scary because the world that you are in feels wrong and you're struggling to grasp why, while the game insistently holds that information just outside of your reach. Which is the hook, wanting to make sense of these surreal places and confusing events. It's a wonderful exercise in atmosphere and subtlety... and then there's the bits where you're forced to run from monsters which ruin all of that tension and are frustratingly difficult. But still, there's a lot of good ideas in it. There's power in what is left unsaid.  The Path also does a lot of the same things well, it's creepiness doesn't come from the woods or even from the wolves, it comes primarily from the sheer amount that is being left to your imagination. It doesn't show us demons, it elicits the demons that we have inside of ourselves."

creepygaming,2leecn,RequiemAdInfernum,3,Thu Nov 6 20:20:34 2014 UTC,"Darkwood is a pretty good game, although it's somewhat sandbox-y. Despite having a top-down perspective, the sound design is top notch and makes for a very immersive experience."
creepygaming,2leecn,thethreadkiller,2,Fri Nov 7 00:20:32 2014 UTC,"OFF is a really good horror/rpg made in RPG maker 2003. While its not scary at first, make sure to pay close attention to things."

creepygaming,2leecn,bilbo_james,3,Thu Nov 6 18:39:42 2014 UTC,"http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Fan/Games/OFF-by-Mortis-Ghost  It was a very long time since I've last played it, but I believe it should be ready to play as is. If not, there are tutorials to get it running."
creepygaming,2leecn,changetip,1 point,Fri Nov 7 00:16:22 2014 UTC,"It's definitely the ""slow-burn"" kind of horror. Nothing is really outright ""horrifying."" Everything just... literally feels a bit off. And once you've come to accept that ""Well, things are just a little weird in this game,"" something else comes in that tweaks the unsettling atmosphere just a little more. If you compare the very beginning of the game with the very end, you might feel like you aren't even playing the same game anymore... but you don't really know when that changed."
creepygaming,2leecn,One_And_Only_Vanilla,2,Mon Nov 10 18:32:17 2014 UTC,"F.E.A.R is a great example of horror done well. Silent Hill 2, as well."

creepygaming,2leecn,Cagg,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:02:43 2014 UTC,"In addition to Afraid of Monsters, Mistake -1 isn't bad if you can put up with the graphics.

Story is lackluster, however."

creepygaming,2l9od7,daveyeah,3,Tue Nov 4 17:56:34 2014 UTC,I'm currently uploading the second part of the video and the weird face thing gets very persistent. Some close encounters as the game goes on. I'll link it in hear when its uploaded.
creepygaming,2l9od7,consign_to_oblivion,10,Tue Nov 4 17:32:44 2014 UTC,"I've been watching Let's Plays on Youtube for a while now, and I never really noticed how random ranting and fake screams actually helped my watching experience. At the beginning, with no noise but the night and the crickets, waiting for something to pop out at me... that was intense.  ...And then the face just slowly hovers toward you. At that point, I said ""Oh, fuck you..."" and rolled my eyes."
creepygaming,2l9od7,consign_to_oblivion,3,Wed Nov 5 03:08:19 2014 UTC,"When i was curious about five nights at freddy's it was infuriating how let's players would ruin the experience by talking over it, i thought it was telling that one of the suggested searches on youtube included 'no commentary'.

creepygaming,2l9od7,gazwel,5,Wed Nov 5 05:36:42 2014 UTC,The atmosphere is definitely creepy and Japan can sometimes create a feeling of isolation and unfamiliarity with their games. But the face... Come on.
creepygaming,2l9od7,daveyeah,3,Wed Nov 5 13:31:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah I felt tense with the well-done atmosphere initially. As soon as that floating face appeared, I was sorely disappointed."
creepygaming,2l9od7,JohnnyCrusade,3,Sun Nov 9 20:18:58 2014 UTC,"I've always been curious what it would be like to develop a horror game.   These kind of games terrify me and the thought of having to play-test the game, spending hours and hours forcing yourself to go towards and get killed by ghosts or monsters or whatever.  And what about the people who make the art? Imagine picking up from last night's work, you open Photoshop, and this spooky face pops up on screen that you then spend hours working on making it look even scarier.  Maybe when you're the one who made the game it is no longer scary because you know everything to expect?  Just random thoughts on my mind."
creepygaming,2l9od7,Godwine,3,Wed Nov 5 08:21:01 2014 UTC,"To be honest, that face just made me laugh."
creepygaming,2l9od7,Chezkel,5,Wed Nov 5 10:30:24 2014 UTC,The face is hilarious and goofy.  The alien thing that screams and chases the player through the crate area is genuinely fucked up though.

creepygaming,2l9od7,Godwine,2,Tue Nov 4 15:51:27 2014 UTC,I like how the FoV and the flashlight are separate. The closest comparison I've found is the gun sway mechanics in Red Orchestra games.
creepygaming,2lag13,dblade19,4,Tue Nov 4 19:28:39 2014 UTC,A group of friends and myself made a horror game in 48 hours last weekend. I hope you all enjoy it.
creepygaming,2lag13,OriginsOfSymmetry,2,Tue Nov 4 19:28:58 2014 UTC,"Going to give it a shot, I used to love playing these types of games when I was very active with my Youtube channel and honestly I kinda miss playing them. It's just different ya know? when you play a game like this you can tell it was made by a small group of people who really love designing games. I will let you know what I think!"
creepygaming,2lag13,OriginsOfSymmetry,1 point,Wed Nov 5 16:48:51 2014 UTC,I know how you feel! I miss those games. It feels like games now aren't like passion projects that they used to be. Thanks for giving it a play :D
creepygaming,2lag13,pickelsurprise,2,Wed Nov 5 17:17:04 2014 UTC,"Just finished it, I actually liked it :)  Using the Unreal Engine was a great idea since it is such a fantastic tool for making games that look incredible. There were a few sound glitches but hey it WAS made in 48 hours and some of the other submissions I have played can't even touch this one. Keep up the great work and whoever decided it was a good idea to give the robot spider like legs is an asshole lol."
creepygaming,2lag13,pickelsurprise,1 point,Wed Nov 5 17:29:03 2014 UTC,I'm really glad to hear you liked it! That engine is crazy powerful. It was my roomate who made the robot so I will let him know! haha

You actually didn't miss anything, funny enough you are the only one I've seen get through it in one shot.

By the time you enter his mind and reach this point in the hack, his mental voice gives a long monologue about this and then his mental image of the machine suddenly mutates into a monster that will try to kill and eat you. Pretty disturbing."

creepygaming,2kzk33,Aspel,35,Sat Nov 1 22:11:01 2014 UTC,The theory was unnerving but the facts down right shocking. I'd never heard of the '93 incident. So horrific. This is why I watch MatPat's videos.

creepygaming,2klyg5,Rev_Up_Those_Reposts,2,Wed Oct 29 13:16:39 2014 UTC,"Check out Clock Tower 3 or Haunting Ground which is its spiritual successor. More leaning to Haunting Ground as its considered to improve on the formula and arguable what Clock Tower 3 should have been.   Any of the Fatal Frame series. In particular Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly. This is on the basis that its story is probably the most interesting out of the entire franchise and its still holds up as of the best games in the franchise. For instance, it recently got a remake on the Wii titled ""Project Zero 2: Wii Edition"" which pays tribute to the Japanese title for the series.   Check out the Siren or ""Forbidden Siren"" series on PS2. In fact the game received a remake or more accurately a ""re-imagination"" of Siren (the first game on PS2) on PS3 called ""Siren: Blood Curse"" or ""Siren: New Translation"" in Japanese. I played the PS3 version, so I'm not sure which version (1 or 2) to recommend on PS2.   Kuon is another example, although its lower budget than the likes of Fatal Frame but its still meant to be creepy. I believe they didn't even animate the characters talking which is sort of funny, in the final cut-scene they do oddly animate the mouths. Same with Rule of Rose being low-budget, the story is interesting but the game-play fight mechanics is badly designed as they didn't have the resources, so it can be frustrating.  Check out the ObsCure/Obscure series on PS2. I believe ""Obscure II"" also known as ""Obscure: The Aftermath"" is considered the best, in fact it recently was released on Steam (2014).   Also check online for videos of these games on Youtube (beware of spoilers of course) as there's been quite a revival of gamers doing walkthroughs on old PS2 horror games, the quality of videos has improved from the older walkthroughs done at the time in terms of visuals and audio/capture quality."

I feel better about that decision now after hearing that it's frustrating.

creepygaming,2kld18,martinp13,1 point,Tue Oct 28 18:38:30 2014 UTC,"Hello martinp13! :)  I'd say a lot of things are different in Silence of the Sleep. It's not only a horror game but there is a strong adventure element involved. The balance in the game is different from usual horror games. Story is very important, and everything else builds upon it. The game holds lots of symbolism and small hints about the story. It is challenging game in many aspects! :)  Also the art-style and audio is pretty unique!"

creepygaming,2kld18,AddeHawk,2,Tue Oct 28 19:34:00 2014 UTC,"Hi! I like hearing about the art side of game development. What was your process for deciding on the artstyle? Was it more about making the best of what you had, or does the end product really reflect the atmosphere you wanted to create?  I agree that it's a unique look, so I'd like to see how the scares play out with it! I'm all for subtlety with psychological horror."
creepygaming,2kld18,AddeHawk,3,Wed Oct 29 17:52:01 2014 UTC,"Good question! Hmm... I'm not quite sure how it started. I think I painted something to demonstrate the atmosphere and it kind of started from there. All the characters in the game are silhouettes, this because it saves a huge amount of time when animating them. Unfortunately I could not use too much time with any of the specific stuff so I had to find the ""golden path"" with everything. :)  But yeah, the learning curve was insane. If I ever can work with another project I'd love to focus a LOT more with artstyle and audio!"
creepygaming,2kld18,alichip,2,Wed Oct 29 18:16:19 2014 UTC,Makes sense! And it's really cool that you accomplished everything by yourself. The art is way better than what most one-man developing teams even attempt. I hope your original painting is still hanging around somewhere!

Obviously didn't work so well with people, as they called it a virus and people stopped playing it. All it was was the creator getting ahead of himself without harming people.

As a comical side note, I just looked up the release dates for both games to make sure I had things the right way around (it was a long time ago, sue me) and if you google GTA3, the blurb for the Wikipedia entry reads:   GTA 3 is a Thug Simulator...GTA 3 is absolutely reprehensible. This is a game that rewards you for causing mayhem."

creepygaming,2keb85,lolmastergeneral,9,Mon Oct 27 02:44:54 2014 UTC,"Please don't take this the wrong way. It seems like it's not the games that are the problem- it's you. What I mean is, you've become desensitized to horror. Here's my suggestion: after Halloween take a break from horror altogether. That includes movies, tv shows, everything. Spend your time on other genres, and wait for a new horror game to come out. Avoid any trailers/gameplay footage of the game, or you won't be scared when you finally play it. This is the hardest part of the whole plan but it is critical. Also, it never hurts to smoke a lil' weed. Weed makes you more sensitive to everything."

creepygaming,2keb85,opiate46,2,Sun Oct 26 21:40:39 2014 UTC,Resident Evil series Terrified me a child but I suppose its effect wears thin after while. Especially if your no longer child.  Silent Hill Games still get to me. Which is why I've probably never finished one. Then again I prefer the mystery aspect that horror games can provide more than the horror part of them.
creepygaming,2keb85,Simspidey,2,Mon Oct 27 00:21:59 2014 UTC,"I make games too.  Once you have a peek behind the veil, it's hard to not pick apart design choices instead of losing yourself in the game.  That said, Alien Isolation really got me.  I'm a huge Alien nerd, though, so that might be the reason.  Also, make sure you give the games their preferred habitat: dark room, good headphones, and play alone.  If I'm playing a game and have someone with me, I instantly lose immersion."
creepygaming,2keb85,Gromlick,3,Mon Oct 27 01:28:28 2014 UTC,Have you tried the demo for the new silent hill game? At least watch a walkthrough of it on youtube. I dont remember seeing something as scary as that since Amnesia first came out.

Plays through them without batting an eye. But then he posted a video of a game called ""Alone In The Rift"". Couldn't play more than 5 minutes of it.  Granted, you need an Oculous Rift to experience it, but I think this would freak anyone out.  Watch the whole video, it really shows the potential of virtual reality."

The God of Crawling Eyes is another RPG Maker game, with zero jumpscares.  Snowdrift has a few jumpscare dreams, but they're more atmospheric than eardrum battering rams.  There are a bunch of IF games on this list, they're all clean. Anchorhead is a masterpiece.   I doubt that the robot's story from Live A Live has any jumpscares. It's a translated Super Famicom ROM with a great storyline.  Fiend is an oldie by Frictional's founders. It has a couple incredibly tense areas, but no jumpscares to my recollection.  Hide is another tense one, a bit like Slender.  The White Chamber is listed as jumpscare-free on UltimateCarl's list. It's a well done game."
