1911,3e14h5,Hovsky,3,Tue Jul 21 04:36:43 2015 UTC,And it all just slides together? Filing aside.
1911,3e14h5,Jelway723,4,Tue Jul 21 06:59:18 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Some of the parts did not fit at all at first.  The barrel bushing took a while to fit to the slide, the barrel itself needed a little fitting as well, the grip safety didn't fit at all, and the trigger well needed to be opened up slightly. Otherwise, everything else just slid into place."
1911,3e14h5,tosss,6,Tue Jul 21 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"A few months ago I decided to build a 1911.  I plan to build several so I started with the cheapest parts I could find just to get a feel for it.  I wanted to learn about the internals and function of the 1911.  This is a .45 with a RIA Slide, Springfield armory frame, Roto4m barrel, and a plethora of cheap parts.  I got it functioning and have put about 150 rds through it.  I plan to build a nicer one sometime next year.  If it means anything, before this I have built 2 AR15s, 1 suppressor, and finished 2 80% lowers."
1911,3e14h5,Jelway723,3,Tue Jul 21 03:48:47 2015 UTC,How much did it cost?  Can you give us some tips? Price list?
1911,3e14h5,tosss,8,Tue Jul 21 04:10:40 2015 UTC,"I think I built mine for around $350. Check out Sarco Inc, they have everything you need. I got the commercial slide kit with a barrel, plus a rock island frame."
1911,3e14h5,insidethebox,3,Tue Jul 21 04:45:58 2015 UTC,Is anything serialized? Do you need an ffl for the frame?

1911,3e14h5,heekma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:38 2015 UTC,I was waiting for one to come back in stock but after a while months I said screw it and just bought all the parts.  That would have been the cheaper way for me to go though considering the purpose of this build.
1911,3e14h5,olds442guy,4,Tue Jul 21 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"It cost right around $600.  I will put together an itemized list.  As for tips, I would say go slow and make sure every part fits right before moving on.  As you are filing parts, make sure you constantly check fit.  If you want it to be tight, this means one stroke, test, one stroke, test, one stroke, test. For me, this was really relaxing and exciting to build.  Some people might try to blaze through it as fast as they can.  That just won't work.   Since I knew very little about 1911s, this was a learning process all the way through.  I had never stripped one so I didn't know how parts were supposed to fit.  So I was constantly looking online to see how parts were supposed to fit and where to file.    I also reccomend going cheap on parts if you don't know what you are doing.  I think the barrel was around $50 so while I don't expect it to be accurate or last a long time, it taught me how to fit a barrel so I know what I am doing when I build another with a $250 barrel.    Ask for help.  There are lots of forums and many experts who can guide you through any errors or difficulties."
1911,3e14h5,DieSigmund,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:14 2015 UTC,How much would you estimate that tools to fit the 1911 cost?
1911,3dvyzs,heekma,6,Mon Jul 20 00:03:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, and it's a great way to make a factory 1911 better with only a little money.   It's important to note that a lot of the value in the semi customs is also cosmetic stuff. It would take a lot of time and effort to make a factory Colt have as much cosmetic refinement as a Les Baer, and Wilson and Brown are even nicer cosmetically.   I also think Baer is superior to everyone, including Brown and Wilson, in how they fit their barrels. They are hard fit, which not only means tight lock up for accuracy, but also work hardening of the parts as they wear in, ensuring a long lasting tight lock up. To achieve this lock up on a factory gun, you'd have to fit a new barrel or weld up the barrel feet. That said, the way Colt fits their barrel is EXTREMELY good, and doing this wouldn't be necessary for almost anyone.   But you're totally right, you can make a gun that has all the important stuff under the hood without spending big money. It may not have the cosmetic refinement of a semi custom, but it will have it where it counts."
1911,3dvyzs,olds442guy,4,Mon Jul 20 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"You're right.  Baer is set apart by the fitting of their barrels-and how long they will stay tight and consistent.  There is no substitute for a hard-fit barrel, and Baer's accuracy guaranty proves it.  Colt's drop-in barrels are not hard fit like Baer, but they are fit in a similar fashion to Wilson or Brown--drop in, with tightly controlled tolerances, giving a good mix of accuracy, reliability and ease of assembly.  None will ever match Baer's hard-fit barrel, but with some carefully adjusted and replaced parts production guns will not be embarassed and shoot extremely well compared to more expensive 1911s."
1911,3dvyzs,Brewsley,3,Mon Jul 20 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"heekma - (and also /u/olds442guy) I've been looking at the O4012XSE but can't find even seem to find it or any of the XSE series any longer on the Colt.com website - it's a commander sized/style, wondering if that affects your advice with respect to parts retrofit? Wondering if Colt cancelled that line? Also, what's your opinion on aftermarket bobtail job? [Edit, for context - I'm in CA so I have a limited choice of models - it is what it is...for now. At any rate, I'd been looking at a commander style 1911 and had been looking at the DW Cbob, but am wary of the galling problems observed (first hand by you heekma) on stainless DW.       What I'm looking for is a well made, reliable commander style/4.25 bbl 1911 - the bobtail feature is kind of icing on the proverbial cake as I feel it would CCW better. When you mentioned the XSE series, you got my attention. Also, I don't get/understand the difference between series 80/70s, except that there's some extra parts that intersect with the trigger on the 80's. Not sure, but I think the XSE is series 80]     [Edit2- and again, thanks for the recent informative posts, they're great!]"
1911,3dvyzs,olds442guy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:20:57 2015 UTC,"Colt has discontinued the XSE line.  They were slow sellers in a crowded market full of ""Modern"" 1911s.  They are just as high quality as any other Colt, Magnet Particle tested barrels, forged frame, slide, barrel and slide stop.  Same tool steel parts same three MIM parts.  I fact I think /u/olds442guy has an XSE Commander.  No issues with parts on an XSE commander other than barrel and slide.  I think bobtailed 1911s are kind of gimmicky, but maybe prevents clothing from hanging up on the grip.  Personally I have no use for them, but my opinion is simply that, an opinion.  If you have a chance to get an XSE Commander, do it.  It's a high-quality Colt and Colt will 100% stand behind their lifetime warranty of the gun."

The important stuff is that the gun has good parts, is well fit, and functions reliably.   If you like it, I'd grab one before they disappear. Colt isn't making any more, at least for now.   Also, I did a write-up on Series 70 vs Series 80. That is pretty detailed, and is more specific to the actual Series 70 and Series 80 models, as opposed to the presence of a firing pin safety, which is the more commonly used (but technically incorrect) meanings. I made a comment about firing pin safeties that talks about the pros and cons, but doesn't really touch on technically how they work.

1911,3du904,Brewsley,2,Sun Jul 19 15:06:55 2015 UTC,That's an interesting point: are DW personnel performing the assembly for these or did CZ stand up a different assembly line?
1911,3du904,olds442guy,3,Sun Jul 19 15:38:48 2015 UTC,It looks nice but for a little more I'd get a Colt Series 70
1911,3du904,heekma,3,Sun Jul 19 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, but then again I'm a Colt fan.  If it's full of tool-steel parts it could be a good buy based on quality, but I'm guessing at that price it won't be.  I don't know how much appeal a 1911-A1 has these days.  I like them, but most prefer modern refinements.  The DW Valor is a nice gun from all accounts-but it's a modern 1911.  A CZ 1911-A1, nice though it will be, is like a Czech made '57 Chevy.  It may well be better than the original, but when it comes to classics originality is key.  I think this CZ 1911 will make a brief splash then disappear, much like the new DW revolvers.  I hope I'm wrong because the more high-quality 1911s in the marketplace the better.  Nothing breeds excellence like competition."
1911,3du904,olds442guy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't imagine it has bar stock parts, which is honestly fine at that price point.   It also has a black oxide finish, which is also totally fine, but I prefer bluing over that just for cosmetic reasons.   I also like more traditional set up guns, but this one seems like it's really close to being authentic, with some differences. Enough differences to turn off the buyers that want an authentic repro, but not enough differences to satisfy a buyer that wants modern improvements."

If you don't feel you need a beaver tail safety or other ""enhanced"" features, I'm sure it will compete very nicely with other 1911s in its price range. (RO and SR1911.) I do get hammer bite though, so I will probably not buy one. I already have a Colt 100th Anniversary for historical reasons, and for practical purposes I would have to radius the edge of the hammer, which would require refinishing."

It was a collaboration between Colt and CZ that was supposed to be sold as a Colt, but the deal tanked.  Sexy beast, IMO  Only in .40 S&W though, so would be nice in 9MM and .45ACP."

1911,3dohmi,heekma,9,Fri Jul 17 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"Answers I find myself giving repeatedly:  GI guide rod, or if you must have a full length, go with the Wilson style that doesn't change how you disassemble the gun.   If you can afford it, go with Colt. Yes, it's worth the money. No, you aren't just paying for the rollmark. Yes, it is objectively better than everything else in the price range.   MIM isn't bad, but if you can avoid it without spending a ton more (Colt), then you should.   Series 80 done right (Colt, Sig does a nice job too) doesn't affect the trigger pull any appreciable amount. If you still don't like it, fair enough, you can remove the FPS and replace it with a $5 shim. Don't let the presence of a FPS be a deal breaker, there are so many more important features.   If you want a tight gun, don't get a stainless gun. If you want a stainless gun, don't get a tight gun. Les Baer is a great example of how to do both right. Tight carbon guns, ""just right"" stainless guns. Too tight fit with stainless can lead to the gun seizing up and needing to be taken apart with a large hammer (looking at you, DW).  Most parts aren't drop in, some are easier to fit than others.   It's cheaper to get the features you want from the start than to buy a gun and modify it.   Tight isn't everything, and in a production gun should honestly probably be avoided. JMB was a pretty smart guy, most companies that try to ""improve"" on his design aren't as smart as he was. If the original specs are being monkeyed with, the builder better know what they're doing (ex: Les Baer, Ed Brown, Wilson), especially when it comes to shrinking clearances.   Accuracy is 99% dependant on the barrel fit with the bushing to slide, bushing to barrel, barrel to slide, and barrel to slide stop. Slide to frame fit is almost meaningless. Even Les Baers do not have that tight of a slide to frame. Their barrels are tight.   The expensive semi customs aren't worth it if you're a casual shooter, or aren't a die-hard 1911 guy. A $1000 Colt at 1/2 to 1/4 the price will make you just as happy and work just as well. If you are a die-hard 1911 guy who shoots a ton (5000+ rounds per year), then there's almost no other way to go than a semi custom of your preference.   A good trigger pull is 99% dependant on the hammer to sear fit. If your trigger sucks, it almost certainly isn't the firing pin safety, the sear spring, etc. It's probably poor sear geometry or miscut hammer hooks.   Magazines are important for reliability, but be careful not to use them as a scapegoat. If your gun has issues, find the root cause. It may very well be a bad mag, but way too often mags take the blame for a gun that has dimensional problems that cause bad reliability.   Edited to add:  A properly dimensioned 1911 will feed most modern hollowpoints just fine. Most modern hollowpoints (230gr Gold Dots, for example) are profiled very similar to hardball, and that's by design. If your 1911 doesn't feed any types of hollowpoints, your gun may have some improper dimensions.   An unreliable 1911 is a fault of manufacturing and not of design. If you think otherwise, you don't understand how the gun works.   I'll probably edit to add more as I think of them..."

It was a good 1911 for the money.  Of course that's a sample set of one, not exactly representative of R1s as a whole.  I haven't shot a Ruger but I'm very familiar with their single action and double action revolver aand know first hand they make quality guns.  I would lean towards Ruger.  Ruger makes nearly every single part of their 1911s.  I'm not sure who makes all the parts for Remington."

1911,3dohmi,ernunnos,3,Sat Jul 18 16:54:24 2015 UTC,"20 years ago I wouldn't buy a Colt I couldn't inspect before purchase.  Back then all you had to go on was a picture in a catalog.  You ordered it and hoped for the best.  I refused to take possesion of four Colts in a row back then and got a Kimber instead.  That was back in 1996.  Today I would have zero issues buying a new Colt online.  I get to see thousands of guns each year at shows in Dallas, Ft. Worth and Oaklahoma.  The Colts I see are cosmetically beautiful in every way, and the nearly dozen Colts I've purchased over the last five years have been well fitted and finished, accurate and reliable.  Frankly virtully all 1911s look well fitted and machined-from the outside.  What sets Colt apart is on the inside--what you can't see.  Correct and consistent internal dimensions, quality control and testing and care during manufacturing and assembly.  Don't wait.  This is one instance you want to be in a rush to get the Clapp.  Edit: as /u/olds442guy mentioned, buy used and all bets are off--especially if parts have been replaced.   Replaced parts don't automatically mean the gun won't run, and there are tests-for the safeties at least-which allow you to know if they work, but just because they work when inspecting the gun doesn't mean they'll still work after a hundred rounds.  TL;DR: buying a used 1911-buyer beware."
1911,3dohmi,EternalNoob,2,Sat Jul 18 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"It depends if new or used, and what manufacturer.   Used, all bets are off, I prefer to have it in my hands before I buy. Lots of bubbas thinking they are gunsmiths.   New, depending on the manufacturer, you'll probably be happy. You're looking at a new Colt. I would buy online with confidence and not worry. Colt is very consistent so it's extremely unlikely you'll have an issue, and on the off chance you do they stand behind their products.   And that's a fantastic choice of gun, by the way"

Here's why:   The G.I. set makes field stripping far easier. Extended guide rods add so little extra weight only a scale tells the difference--and as an added bonus they make field stripping more difficult. There's only an inch or so of recoil spring that is unsupported using a G.I. set up.  Supporting that inch with a full-length guide rod and expecting an incrase in accuracy is silly at best.  Proper barrel fit to the slide, barrel hood and slide stop is what determines accuracy.  To think otherwise is like expecting new windshield wipers to make your car go faster."

1911,3dohmi,olds442guy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"It depends on the feed lips. I'm not an expert on magazines, but to my understanding the design of the feed lips determines when the magazine lets go of the cartridge. For example, GI feed lips are at a slant (which you can see when looking directly down at the top of the mag). You can visualize how this design would gradually let go of the cartridge as it is stripped from the magazine. Compare that to more modern designed feed lips (like Wilson uses) that kind of just hang on to the cartridge for half the way and then completely let go of it.   /u/heekma will likely be able to explain that better than me"
1911,3dohmi,whey_to_go,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:18 2015 UTC,Does that mean Wilson magazines are likely or able to put increased wear on the extractor because it has to hop over the rim?

1911,3dohmi,olds442guy,2,Sat Jul 18 10:26:24 2015 UTC,"I have a Para Elite govt that has been upgraded with Wilson Combat Bullet Proof parts (disconnector, hammer, sear, sear spring, hammer spur) but the trigger pull is not quite to my liking. The pull itself is crisp, although not as crisp as one would describe ""breaks like a glass rod"". The main complaint is that it feels rather heavy.  Is there a fairly simple way to adjust the weight of the pull?"
1911,3dohmi,JabbaTheWhat01,2,Sat Jul 18 09:09:16 2015 UTC,Not really.  The pull weight and break are determined by the hammer hooks and sear nose primary and secondary angles and the sear spring.  Adhusting the sear spring is easy but making adjustments to the hammer and sear requires a special jig and stones for filing.  Edit: look at my other post for a detailed description of how the sear works with the hammer--the primary reason for a good or bad trigger.
1911,3dohmi,olds442guy,2,Sat Jul 18 12:49:57 2015 UTC,What is the general consensus on flat triggers? I was eyeballing a Caspian flat trigger.  Also is there anything to remedy a really stiff magazine release button? A friend of mine suggested cutting the spring down. I'm a lefty so I have to use my index finger to press it and it's difficult and awkward.   Trigger jobs. How much more can it be improved? People always rave about the 1911 having the best trigger.
1911,3dohmi,improbablyhungry,2,Sat Jul 18 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"A suggestion for your mag release issue - I would suggest the fairly cheap route of ordering a spare magazine catch spring, and then clipping a few coils, as your friend suggested. I did exactly that on a Colt XSE which I use in USPSA/IDPA; the effort required to drop the mag was reduced significantly and I've never had a mag drop out. If you cut the spring too far, you only cost yourself a $3 spring.   Also, looks like MidwayUSA sells an Ed Brown reduced strength mag catch spring you could try, also for $3."
1911,3dohmi,JabbaTheWhat01,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:42 2015 UTC,Listen to /u/Smoke_Wagon.  I'm pretty sure he knows what he's talking about.
1911,3dohmi,improbablyhungry,2,Mon Jul 20 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"If you like the look and feel of a flat trigger, go for it.   You would really need to determine why the mag release is stiff. Is the mag catch binding in the frame, or is the spring too stiff? You would need to take off the burr that's binding if that's the issue. There's a sweet spot with cutting the spring. I would recommend against it unless you absolutely have to. The reason the spring is strong is so that your mags don't fall out unintentionally, like when your gun is holstered and your body pushes against the button. So if you have to cut it, just don't go too much or it won't securely hold the mags in.   A factory trigger, even a good one, can be improved. In my experience a factory sear on a production gun often times has the primary angle cut, but not the secondary. The secondary angle isn't strictly necessary, but it makes a huge difference in making a shorter, crisper pull. To get an idea of this, if you have store that carries both, go try the trigger on a production gun and then try the trigger on a Baer/Brown/Wilson. That difference comes from someone who really knows how to shape a sear nose."
1911,3dohmi,Smoke_Wagon,2,Sat Jul 18 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"Right on all points as usual.  With regards to the sear angles, like /u/olds442guy advised, try the trigger of a Wilson, Brown or Baer, then try a Colt.  The Wilsons etc. will have a very crisp break due to the secondary angle. Colts on the other hand (production guns in general) will have what's called a ""rolling"" break instead.  Adding a secondary angle to the sear makes the sear nose into a lopsided triangle.  The sharp edge between the angles is what makes the break so crisp.  Production guns only have the primary angle cut and the rest of the sear nose is simply rounded.  Think of it this way: sears with a secondary angle are like a fulcrum. Sears with only a primary angle are flat on one side and bullnosed on the other. Sears with secondary angles reach the ede of the hammer hooks and slide off cleanly.  Sears with a primary angle only reach the edge of the hammer hooks and ""rotate"" off the edge of the hammer hooks.  This rotation takes a little more force and the sear has to travel just a bit further before clearing the hammer hooks, allowing the hammer to fall.  That's what makes it a little heavier and less crisp.  Keep in mind 1911s have a great trigger by design, so guns using sears without a secondary angle are already better than literally any other handgun design.  Adding a secondary angle to the sear makes an already great trigger just a little better.  Most shooters won't tell much of a difference during practical shooting, but shoot for precision at 25 yards or more and it's the difference between 2"" groups and 4"" groups.  Adding a secondary angle is nice, but it's really the primary angle that's most important.  A sear with a proper primary angle and no secondary angle will feel far better than a sear with a large primary angle--even if it has a secondary angle cut.  The smaller the primary angle the less the sear has to rotate before reaching the edge of the hammer hooks, allowing the hammer to drop.  Make the angle too small and the gun becomes unsafe because the sear barely has to rotate at all before reaching the edge of the hammer hooks-resulting in a ""hair trigger.""  Flat triggers are generally used for competition guns because when shooting really fast double or triple taps it doesn't matter where your finger slaps the trigger-top, middle or bottom of the trigger doesn't matter since it's flat.  With a curved trigger your finger needs to be roughly in the center of the trigger or needs to slide toward the middle if your finger slaps it at the bottom or top of the trigger.  For mortal shooters it makes no difference.  For pro shooters it can mean the difference of a 1/10 of a second and the difference between first and second place.  I'm no pro and never will be so the standard trigger works fine for me."

1911,3dohmi,Inthebackgroundalway,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"Of those the Norinco is the best quality gun--assuming it's all original. Norincos can be a little rough in terms of fit and finish but they used excellent raw materials.  The entire gun, frame, slide, barrel, small parts are all made using 5150 steel vs. 4150 used by virtually every other manufacturer. Basically the entire gun is made of tool steel.  Most gunsmiths will charge extra to do any milling work-such as dovetailing sights-because the extra hard tool steel quickly wears out standard milling bits.  I have no experience with Taurus but have read mostly positive things about their 1911s.  Para's quality has been crap once they started making guns in the U.S.  American Classic is an import like RIA or Armscorp, same quality as RIA.  Get /u/olds442guy to weigh in."
1911,3dohmi,WWJLPD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:41:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, between all those, I'd probably go with the Norinco if it's in decent shape or keep saving up. The Taurus 1911 has a pretty good reputation, much better than their other guns. But I still don't think I'd want a gun that says Taurus on it, even if it's decent, just because of the stigma around their brand.   If you can save up to have a budget around $650 or so, you can get a Ruger 1911. If it were me I'd probably do that."

I think, with the STI, you get a little more hand-fitting than you would with the Springfield (hence the increased price); I know most of the STI pistols I've seen (including my own STI Lawman 9x19) have run smoothly right out of the box. STI guns are used VERY heavily in USPSA competition and have a great track record.   As an added bonus, if you are intending to use the pistol in competition, both the RO and the Trojan can be ordered from Dawson Precision with Dawson's ""Competition Ready Package"" pre-installed for you (fiber optic front, magwell, etc)."

1911,3dohmi,ponystamp,3,Sat Jul 18 09:50:03 2015 UTC,"Series 80 has a firing pin safety which locks the firing pin until the trigger is pulled, making the gun ""drop safe.""  Series 70 is an earlier version without the firing pin safety."

1911,3dohmi,TXUX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that the series 80 has a firing pin block and the 70 doesn't.  This is to make the gun drop safe and prevent it from firing if the hammer drops but you didn't press the trigger.  However I along with plenty of others see this as a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.  A lot of people also say it affects the trigger pull (I think its much less of a problem with newer series 80 1911s). Personally I don't bother with series 80 1911s, the 1911 was originally designed as a very safe firearm."

If they don't make them, I would look at Novak or Dawson sights."
1911,3dohmi,Smoke_Wagon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"I love guns I can build. While there are some rifles in my collection that I like, I feel way more comfortable with my ARs because I built them from the ground up. In the future, I plan on furthering that to building AR10/ .308s, an FAL, and of course my favorite pistol, the 1911.   I have a couple of colts and wouldn't trade them for anything. However I still have an undying urge to build one or two for myself. Do you happen to know of a list of tools that I could obtain reasonably that would help me, as I know its much more difficult that building an AR.   On another note, would anyone know if its possible to use an STI double stack frame with a .460 Rowland barrel and comp? Would an extended dustcover effect the compensator? I got a crazy idea and cant seem to find anything, and Clarks custom either hasn't gotten an email, or they ignored it."
1911,3dohmi,Albino_Echidna,3,Sun Jul 19 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in the process of building my first, still waiting for my frame and slide from Caspian.  They're 12+ weeks out on custom orders.  You'll need a 1911 bench block-makes taking pins out so much easier.  You'll need a set of stones, thin draw files, calipers, small hammer and punches and feeler gauges.  A sear jig is a must if you plan on having a good trigger.  Some work is better to send out.  Give EGW the O.D. of your barrel and I.D. of the slide and they'll make a perfect barrel bushing for you.  Ic you plan on fitting a barrel you'll need special tools to keep the barrel centered when fitting the barrel hood and a tool to ream the lower barrel lugs.  You'll spend $600+ just on tools-many of which are of limited utility beyond 1911s.  You'll also spend $1,200+ on parts for the gun.  Sure, you can go cheap and get a parts gun from Sarco and the absolute bare minimum of tools, but you'll spend as much or more than the cost of a new Colt--and have a gun nowhere near as high quality.  If you do it then do it right.  You'll spend as much money as you would on a Baer.  Depending on how careful you are and how good you are with handtools you could end up with a gun just as nice.  You could also end up with an expensive paperweight.  I'm not saying this to discourage you--just know building an accurate, reliable 1911 from scratch--without extensive experience--is not as easy as some would think."
1911,3dohmi,Albino_Echidna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:57:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it would just be just as expensive to have a smith do it for me, especially if I only planned on using it once or twice"
1911,3dohmi,Smoke_Wagon,3,Sun Jul 19 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Try this instead: get a stainless Colt XSE.  Get a jig and do a trigger job with original parts (they're well worth using.)  you can use the jig to do a trigger job on any 1911 you buy (I do.)  Fit a beavertail grip safety and blend it to the frame.  Leave the thumb safeties alone unluss you want to change them just for the experience.  Have EGW make a barrel bushing made to fit your gun perfectly.  Leave everything else alone.  You'll have a 1911 you put $1,500 into that will shoot as well as any semi custom-maybe even better.  To get a better gun you'd have to skip Wilson, Brown, etc. , spend $5K+ and wait years to get your gun.  I know this because I've done it.  That's why I'm no longer drooling over Baers, Browns or Wilsons.  They make great 1911s no doubt, but not worth two, three or more times a Colt with a little extra attention."
1911,3dohmi,ernunnos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"That.... Sounds like a great fucking plan. I was looking at the dual tone xse too lol. I guess I could go this route, my original plan was either to go with building two dual tones with opposite color schemes (one blue slide, stainless frame and the other stainless slide with blues frame).   Edit: And it would give me an excuse to buy more colts, which is always nice.  However I still want to know if a double stack frame with .460 is possible. That would make one beast of a gun."

1911,3dmsf3,derpmcderp82,8,Fri Jul 17 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"I would save up a little more and get a Ruger.  Here's why:  Ruger makes some of the best castings in the world for all kinds of companies, not just firearms.  The also cast frames for Caspian.  Caspian is known for making the very best frames and slides money can make and many are used for single stack comp guns that see tens of thousands of rounds per year.  Gary Smith (Manager of Caspian) has never had a single cast frame fail.  That's saying something.  With Ruger you also get a fantastic warranty and better quality overall, especially with regards to fit and finish.  The Rugers are nicely machined and their surface finish--almost like teflon--is beautiful.  RIAs on the other hand has some really weird machining going on around the trigger guard.  Everything just seems...off.  RIA  Ruger  It's like RIA simplified the machining around the trigger guard.  It's rounded instead of crisp and what should be straight seems to be curved.  The grip frame on the RIA seems to be wider than normal as well. That's the kind of thing that makes me wonder about how the rest of the gun is machined because they're obviously deviating from the original spec.  From what I've read the RIA guns seem to work fine though.  I think the extra $100 buys a lot more gun in this instance."

I used Wilson Combat 47D mags and recoil springs in all four.

I prefer Colts more than others, but to say the Colt's frame was rusting smacks of complete and total BS to me.  That was the fault of the previous owner, not an indication of Colt's quality.  Even as a Colt fan I'm more than willing to admit that the early 1991s or even very early XSEs had plastic triggers (bullshit, no excuse for that) anx were poorly fitted.    I like a little rattle between the frame and slide--that's part of the design.  But barrel rattle is not, and many Colts made in the 1990s had barrels that rattled. Unexcusable.  I know.  I was there back in the mid 1990s trying to buy Colts.  I sent several back and got a Kimber back in 1996 instead.  Those Colts sucked honestly.  The raw materials were good as always but the fitment and attention to detail sucked.  Fast forward almost 20 years and the Colt of today has nothing to do with Colt from 20 years ago.  Colt is currently making the best 1911s they ever have and the best money can buy for less than $2,000.  I'm a Colt fan but not a fanboy.  There was a period of time-nearly 15 years-that I wouldn't buy a new Colt.  Today I will proudly say I would buy a new Colt sight unseen--something I would not have done years ago."

The frame was prone to rust spotting.  Hard to see from more than a foot or two away and there was no pitting.  It was easily cleaned off.  Was that Colts fault or a previous owners fault? Hell if I know and hell if I care, because I traded it off years ago.  If I were to give my honest opinion then I'd blame the frame/finish because there was no signs of any adulteration by a previous owner and from the threads I posted about it on my various gun forums back then I wasn't the only one that had experienced the issue."

1911,3dmsf3,heekma,2,Sat Jul 18 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"Well let's consider the fact I owned the gun and you did not.  That is an important factor in comparing my knowledge of how it was taken care of and your knowledge of how it was taken care of.  My saying that it was very well taken care has more weight to it than you saying it was neglected because, as it has now been established for the third or fourth time, I owned it and you did not.  Let's also consider the fact that, amongst the hundreds of firearms I've owned, that M1991A1-GOVT was the only one still prone to surface rust spotting with proper care and maintenance.  Or maybe I'm lying and out of all those firearms I owned I chose to only neglect that specific one because I knew one day I could try to trick someone on the internet in to thinking otherwise.  My elaborate ruse has finally paid off!  You clearly did not search those phrases in google, otherwise you probably wouldn't be sitting here still trying to argue about it.  Apparently hundreds, if not thousands of people neglected just that one specific model of firearm.  Or maybe that one specific model of firearm requires a light coating of the tears of a virgin to keep from rusting? Damn us M1991-A1 owners for being so irresponsible and ignorant, we should have done our research!  TL,DR; If you have to leave your gun in a tub of 10w40 to keep it from rusting any time you're not using it, then the gun is the problem.  Yeah, 25 years, we get it.

You're right, I have no idea how you cleaned, handled or stored your gun.  All I do know is that if it rusted it was due to improper cleaning, handling or storage.  I have a lot of tools-many of which have no protective coating-and the only tools that have rusted were the ones I was careless with.  And I'm sorry if my 25 years of experience rubs you the wrong way, but on a public forum such as this I think it's important to make the distinction that my opinions come from many years of practical experience, not what I've read or been told--or ""Googled.""  If you dislike my opinions there's a simple solution-ignore them and carry on.  I'm really not trying to be a dick.  We disagree and won't change each other's minds and that's fine.  We can simply agree to disagree and move on.  I'm sure we agree on far more things than we disagree.

When I went to try out the pistol after replacing the parts, I made it through a few shots and then the hammer broke off (poorly cast MIM was my guess).  This time, I sent it back to Armscor for a warranty repair.  They were incredibly helpful and made it known from the beginning that they were shutting down for a few days for an ATF audit, and that it would delay my work.    When I got my 1911 back, the safety was replaced, they also cleaned everything and some polishing and tuned up the trigger and included some RIA gear.    I'm happy with my 1911 now, and I'm happy with the service I got from Armscor/RIA.  My girlfriend got a Springfield 9mm Range Officer, and that is a great pistol.  IIRC, it cost about what I paid for my RIA.  Check that out."

1911,3dju0v,brianshell,5,Thu Jul 16 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"Also, just in case you haven't already read about it, The Colt Rail Gun--on which the M45 A1 is based, was submitted for military trials and some guns cracked at the slide near the front serrations and a couple cracked at the frame rail.  The military wanted to test the guns to their limits and they did.  Part of the testing included freezing the guns then shooting them until hot several times.  This type of cycling from hot to cold is hard on steel.  The guns were also shot using mostly .45 ACP +P, which is hard on any gun when used extensively.  Colt responded by moving the front serrations forward and spacing them more widely.  The rail on the frame was beefed up--a lot.  Dual recoil springs were used to help dampen the recoil from the +P .45 ACP ammo used during testing.  After passing the military tests a second time without issue, these changes resulted in a new gun with a new model designation--M45-A1.  The M45-A1 also has all internal small parts--barrel link, barrel link pin, sear, disconnector and hammer strut nickel plated for corrosion resistance and durability.  The dual recoil springs are rated for 8,000-10,000 rounds between changes.    The only difference between your M45-A1 and guns allocated for the Marines is yours has a Colt National Match barrel instead of the standard Colt barrel used in the Marine's pistols.  There are a lot of 1911s out there and a lot of claims by lots of folks--some knowledgeable, some not.  One thing is for sure, the Colt M45-A1 is the only 1911 available which has gone through a difficult military trial and passed.  That's something no other 1911 manufacturer--no matter how expensive--can claim."

Those were two individual guns, not a good representation of the guns in general.  Also bear in mind something like a less than optimal cut for the feed ramp isn't damning in and of itself.  CNC machines take several hours to cut one single frame.  The folks running those machines are not gunsmiths, just workers doing a job.  It could take days or even weeks before those frames are assembled and the issue found.  In that time hundreds of frames could be mis cut.  If they the frames are less than optimal--but within spec and functional--any company would use them instead of writing off the raw materials, machining time and labor.  The issue will be addressed, machining will be adjusted to fix the issue.  A couple hundred guns may go out with a minor issue, but after fixing the manufacturing issue tens of thousands of frames will go out perfectly in spec.  Having said that, those less than optimal frames should have gone to the production line and be declined for use in a Professional Model."

1911,3dcoaf,brianshell,39,Wed Jul 15 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"OK, here is the thing. I plan on using my 1911( Sig scorpion full size) as a ccw. I live in a city so for the most part, it will always be clean, always have nice ammunition, and due to those factors, will be near 100% reliable. In fact, any of the 1911 makers you mentioned in your post will be absurdly reliable in those conditions.     However, based on the high level of reliability you are looking for in a custom 1911( mud,sand dump trucks etc), you won't find it.    It has nothing to do with quality.    You might come close to the reliability you are looking for with a GI spec gun with a bit of slide/ parts wobble, but your results may vary.    Anyone can say what they want, but for similar reasons as seen in the ak, vs ar debate, the weapon with the built in wobble and clearances will be inherently more reliable when dirty( akwins). So god help me if someone says "" but piston ARs are super reliable "" yea, they borrowed the reliability of a piston.. Like the one in the ak. Moving on...    I won't get too into it, but there is a difference between tolerances and clearances. You can have high clearance and tight tolerance and get something reliable. Low clearance and tight tolerance ( ie what many consider a high quality gun) will have very good fit and finish, but may have issues with dirt sand grime like you mentioned. I'm talking dirty slide rails ,gunk in the trigger etc.   FYI tolerances are deviations from design spec, not how wobbly it is. I can design a shit gun, with poor designs, make it match paper spec exactly and deliver a tight tolerance gun that shoots poorly.    Before you get disappointed, let's go through an example. I have two guns;one that has a super tight slide/part fit like you find in a custom gun, The other has some slide/part wobble. I pack both with sand sand mud and whatever( dump trucks?) and shoot. The gassses and slide movement in the looser gun will push all that obstruction out of the action and keep the gun functional. There are places for obstructions to go before the part gets to the point where there is no room between two parts and they bind and lock up. The high clearance between parts allows this.    The other gun( the custom gun) goes off( they usually always go bang at least once) and there is a chance that all that grime will have no place to go since those clearances you get with the custom guns are so small to provide that "" my $4000 gun shouldn't rattle "" effect. There is a reason that GI spec guns have slide wobble and maybe some extra play in the trigger. Yes, the barrel bushing to barrel fit may be tight, but the rest of it is designed to have extra clearance to clear the dirt and grime.    The GI spec 1911 is battle tested. The design has extra wobble in it. GI spec guns that are well made wobble a good bit, but each gun wobbles about the same due to the tight manufacturing tolerance that provides uniformly high clearances for every gun made. In your post, you are looking for custom, high fit and finish target gun when you start name dropping Wilson combat.   If you want a dump truck proof 1911, I say go GI spec and accept the wobbly construction. Ironically, that colt marine you are eying should fit the bill since its a brand new USMC commissioned 1911 with reliability as a requirement! Sure its super sexy, but its functional sexy."

1911,3dcoaf,olds442guy,5,Fri Jul 17 13:08:42 2015 UTC,"Here's a recent post about my Colt Special Combat Government.  At almost $2,300 after taxes, it's not as expensive as a Wilson, but it isn't cheap either.  The frame and slide have some deliberate play.  It will rattle faintly when shaken, but the barrel is hard fit and has zero play when in battery.  The gun ships with a test target of less than an inch at 15 yards shot by hand from a rest, not a ransom rest.  It is stunningly accurate and extremely reliable.  I have over 3,000 rounds of various cheap stuff, SD stuff and my reloads through it with no issues of any kind.  I would trust this gun over a Wilson or Brown when it comes to utmost reliability in the worst possible conditions.  Colts have very precise clearances and tolerances designed to allow the gun to be both accurate and reliable. The slight play between the slide and frame is deliberate, not the result of poor machining or fitting.   It took me many years to get past tight slides and frames, but after nearly 25 years--and after shooting the SCG--I've come to the conclusion Colt knows how to make a really great 1911.   Edited to add:  Glocks, M&Ps, HKs, Sigs, etc. have play between the slide and frame and will rattle a bit when shaken.  These guns are considered accurate and reliable and no one complains about the slide to frame fit at all, yet the first thing anyone does when determining the quality of a 1911 is check to see if the gun is tight, with no play between the slide and frame."

Think of it this way, in an ultra-precise machine, a single grain of sand can mess it up; if there's a little wiggle room, the same grain sand will just fall out."
1911,3dcoaf,olds442guy,2,Wed Jul 15 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"Obviously I can't speak for all of them, nor can I say I torture tested it, but the M45A1 of a customer's that I handled a couple months ago should not be associated with wiggle room at all.   I'm not trying to call its reliability into question either, but damn was that thing snug. If I'd been blindfolded, there's absolutely no way I'd believe that was a Colt in my hand."
1911,3dcoaf,heekma,3,Wed Jul 15 14:05:30 2015 UTC,"It most likely has not been shot a lot yet.  Some brand new Colts seem to have very snug slides and others have typical play.  The guns with snug slides simply have some high points on the slide, frame, barrel, etc.  After a thousand rounds or so the snug guns smooth out and have the same amount of play in the slide and frame as any other Colt."
1911,3dcoaf,olds442guy,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"It's also cerakoted, which is a thin finish, but it does add a little material in the slide and frame rails that will wear in nicely after a little shooting.   Also the dimension tolerances allow a pretty good variation of ""snugness"" with the slide/frame. Two guns that are both in spec can feel very different just depending on which side of the tolerance window the parts fall on.   I know you already know this, but just for the benefit of anyone reading this thread..."
1911,3dcoaf,TXKeydet,3,Wed Jul 15 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"You're right about tolerance stacking for sure, but when it comes to the latest Colts I think they are too consistent for tolerances to additively create a tight gun.  I've purchased 8 new Colts over the last couple years.  Some have been ""snug"" some had typical Colt ""play"" out of the box.  After a couple thousand rounds the snug guns had just as much play as the others.  The ones that had play out of the box never got any looser.  I think the snug guns had a few high points that needed to be smoothed out through shooting.  There's no such thing as a tight Colt, only a Colt which hasn't been shot enough to wear in a bit and develop a little play."
1911,3dcoaf,heekma,2,Wed Jul 15 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"I'd bet you're right, and you'd know of all people. I have a feeling the cerakote also contributes to a brand new marine gun feeling more snug than normal. It's a thin finish, but it doesn't take much to to take up the wiggle room. Colts don't come tight, but it's certainly not like they're complete rattle traps like some people make them out to be.  Also, for what it's worth, I have seen some variation in new Colts even after a few hundred rounds to wear in. They are family members' guns who don't shoot near as much as me, so they don't have thousands through them, yet at least. My point being, there was certainly a little variation in ""snugness"", however I wouldn't consider any of them to be tight or loose, all fell in the middle of the spectrum (typical for Colt). My other point is that all of these guns functioned very reliably, regardless of how snug they were (again, typical for Colt)."
1911,3dcoaf,heekma,2,Thu Jul 16 00:09:38 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right.  All Colts will show some variation, some less loose some more so.  When they are broken in some will be a little loose, some a little more so.  There's variation as to how loose they will be, but at the end of the day the variation is small.  They almost all get to the same looseness--some take 500 rounds' some take a thousand rounds or more, but eventually they all end up.with fairly similar frame and slide fit-not loose or sloppy--a bit of rattle when shaken--yet still accurate, reliable and esy to field strip."

My customer bought it at another shop and brought it by mine the next day on his way to shoot it for the first time.  Admittedly, I'm fairly new to the 1911 game, so my sample size of Colt's fondled is relatively small, but it was really a work of art in my eyes."
1911,3dcoaf,LeadFarmer6,2,Wed Jul 15 23:58:03 2015 UTC,"That's why.  My M45 was really snug too.  Made me wonder if Colt was trying to make tight guns.  After a couple thousand rounds it has a little rattle.  It just needed to wear in.  Also, the guns from the Colt Custom Shop are loose out of the box.  The reason is the frame and slide rails have been squared and stoned to remove the high spots that the production guns have."
1911,3dcoaf,GoodGuyGlocker,2,Thu Jul 16 00:02:22 2015 UTC,"I have a Colt M45-A1, production version, not the CCS model.  It's a beast of a 1911 and is noticeably heavier than any other railed 1911 I've held.  The fitting of the barrel is very good, slide and frame have a little play.  In other words, it's the perfect combination of accuracy and reliability.  Mine has been very accurate and I've had no issues with over 1,500 rounds so far."
1911,3dcoaf,LeadFarmer6,3,Wed Jul 15 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"This may not be what everyone else thinks, but for a EDC, I run a full frame 1911 from RIA...seriously, it's the AK of the 1911 world, everything I've put in it, goes bang. It just doesn't care."
1911,3dcoaf,BenLeRoy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that you can have one of the 1911 shops build you a gun with more give in them.  Cheap/shitty guns have greater ""tolerances"" as a result of being sloppy and mass produced, but there's nothing to say you can't have a finely tuned gun with that tolerance planned in."

1911,3d9fqa,selflessass,2,Tue Jul 14 21:43:06 2015 UTC,Sure can.  Get one and send it to Colt's Custom Shop and tell them what you want done.  I've seen some custom Series 70s come out of the CCS and they are every bit as nice as my Special Combat Government.
1911,3d9fqa,BluesFan43,2,Tue Jul 14 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"That is a damn fine firearm!  I imagine it shoots every bit as nice as it looks or better. I would love to see a range report write up, if you get the time."

I wouldn't get caught up with how tight it is unless it's just crazy sloppy, but if it is then I'd bail on it or see if you can get Sig to replace it.   Otherwise, if it works and seems to be fit well, keep shooting and fahgettaboutit!"
1911,3dahfn,olds442guy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"No. The slide and frame are still very snug. no up and down or forward and backward play at all.  Sorry, this is my first 1911 and I hope that's what you were asking about."
1911,3dahfn,olds442guy,2,Tue Jul 14 23:45:34 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was asking. Assuming you take it apart and there's nothing glaringly obvious (gouges in the slide or frame rails, etc), I'd hang on to it and keep shooting and enjoying it.   It sounds like they stood behind the product and fixed it properly. Not surprising knowing Sig.  I'd give it a once over and not worry after that! :)"
1911,3dahfn,olds442guy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I took it apart and looked at it. The top of the frame rails are bare metal now, instead of nitron coated. The slide looks better. cleaned up as well.  I re-assembled it using Slip2000 EWG (grease) on the frame rail top and sides, and Slip2000 EWL (Oil) in the channels of the slide and on the barrel.  Haven't had a chance to test fire yet.  Hopefully tomorrow.  Though Sig said they put 32 rounds through with no failures.  I guess I should look at it like I have a hand fitted Sig 1911 now :)"
1911,3dahfn,flyloco,3,Wed Jul 15 00:42:25 2015 UTC,The finish would wear off on those areas eventually anyways just from shooting. Sounds like it's good to go!

No matter what sights you switch to, you will most likely need your slide milled to match the sight dovetail. So there are probably no sights that ""will fit"" because the common procedure is to cut the slide for the sight."

It's not uncommon for iron sights to shoot low. However, it shouldn't be acceptable either. Call the manufacturer, if they stand behind their product they will fix it."

1911,3d48o9,x2601,2,Mon Jul 13 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"For most people, dot sights are preferred. But keep in mind that the Gold Cup was designed as a kind of production, out-of-the-box bullseye gun. Those sights, with sharp, crisp edges and a front sight that fills the entire gap in the rear sight, are purpose built for precision shooting. They don't have dots because, in that specific application, dots might distract your eyes from focusing on lining up the edges of the sights perfectly.   For general purpose shooting, target sights aren't great. But for the Gold Cup's intended use, they are very hard to beat."

1911,3d1sxl,futuregunsmith,8,Mon Jul 13 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough the last Colt I handled felt like a piece of crap   Anodized black Colt rail gun. Felt loose, and the magazine jammed on the mag release every time you tried to insert one. Slide release was stiff as fuck as well."
1911,3d1sxl,futuregunsmith,5,Mon Jul 13 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"Anodizing is for aluminum.  Stainless Colts are Ceracoated. Loose means very little as I said.  Mag release and slide release issues are common with ceracoated guns until they are shot.  Don't judge it at the counter, judge it at the range.  Odds are good that after a couple hundred rounds you'll be happy with your choice.  I have a Colt M45 A1.  It is ceracoated.  The mag release and slide stop were difficult to use.  Once the ceracoat wore off after 50 rounds those issues were gone.  Not to say Colt doesn't put out a lemon, they can and do, never judge a 1911 until you put a couple hundred rounds through it."
1911,3d1sxl,futuregunsmith,4,Mon Jul 13 00:30:23 2015 UTC,"Good point. I guess it was cerakoted, then. Didn't pay much attention to that.  But, I mean, you could not insert a mag. You had to depress the mag release, hard, and slam the mag in to get it to go.  Is it weird that the Para Expert next to it felt so much better?"
1911,3d1sxl,futuregunsmith,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Most of my 1911s require I slap the magazine home with authority.  I can ease a magazine in with my Glocks, all my 1911s require a firm smack on the magazine base to seat--even more so when loaded.  I literally have almost a dozen Colts made in the last five years, no issues inserting the magazine.  Not at all discounting your experience-as I said Colt makes lemons like anyone else.  And yes, it is weird to think a Para feels better than a Colt.  Practically blasphemous really. ;)"
1911,3d1sxl,olds442guy,2,Mon Jul 13 00:40:22 2015 UTC,"Well, the Para felt better than a Colt lemon...  Para's half as expensive to boot."
1911,3d1sxl,x2601,2,Mon Jul 13 00:44:20 2015 UTC,Can't say it's a lemon without shooting it.  Can't test drive a car unless you actually drive it.  Trust me.  The para is not in the same ballpark as a Colt. There's a reason it costs less.

Combat Elite fits the bill, so does a Gold Cup Trophy.

You can probably do better with different bullet designs than hardball, but it's not like hardball is tumbling through the air on the way to the target.   A lot of bullseye shooters use semi wadcutters. If I were going to maximum accuracy from a 1911, I'd probably start there."

There were all sorts of small, incremental changes over time until the 1911-A1 became the standard.  The hammer length and shape changed as did the type of checkering and border.  There were changes to the slide stop checkering, changes to the trigger and even changes to the ball cuts on the slide.  The only serialized part is the frame.  There are no matching numbers on other parts, so parts are either original, correct or incorrect.  There's a huge difference in value between these three descriptions and it's easy to pay a lot of money for an incorrect gun.  There's a ton of history and minutiae a buyer needs to be knowledgable about to make an informed purchase.  Determining original finish is imperative.  A gun with little finish left will be more valuable than a refinished gun.  Post some pics and I'll help as much as I can."

1911,3cyq3x,timesplitter88,9,Sun Jul 12 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"A GI guide rod will work in an aluminum frame, and the difference in felt recoil will be slight, and probably not noticeable at all.   The Wilson guide rod is pretty much just as easy to take down as the GI guide rod, so if you have the Wilson I'd just stick with that unless you just prefer the look.   There's a chance that once the barrel tilts back, the guide rod could come in contact with the back of the suppressor. This is dependent on the length of the guide rod, the dimensions of the back of the suppressor, and the placement of the threads on the barrel. It could work, it could not. The safe bet is to just go with a GI guide rod. Not really any downside."
1911,3cyq3x,olds442guy,8,Sun Jul 12 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"This guy knows what he's talking about so listen.  There is no downside to using a G.I. guide rod and plug.  There's less than an inch of the recoil spring that's unsupported during recoil.  Supporting that inch with a full-length-guide rod-and expecting it to make a differenc-is silly at best.  The G.I. recoil spring and plug works well, doesn't cause reliability issues and makes field stripping the gun a snap.  There's a reason for the G.I. set up:  it works exceptionally well.  Anything else is a solution looking for a problem."

1911,3cyq3x,olds442guy,2,Sun Jul 12 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, you cannot use a flat wire recoil spring with a GI guide rod. You have to use the guide rod that Wilson makes specifically for the flat spring. It's the same length as a GI guide rod, but it's thinner to accommodate the smaller inner diameter of the flat spring.   I think they state that on their site, but just in case they don't or you missed it..."

If you go to the museum, you'll see why - the entire room is badly lighted (shaded, really), the glass reflects everything, and there are bars that cover the entire backs of some of the details of the guns. Additionally, there was a group of kindergarten-aged kids that were running about while I was taking pictures, so I did the best I could.    Storytime!  Last week, my father and I took a road trip out to Ogden, Utah, in what we've dubbed ""Gun Mecca 2015"". He just retired after 30 years in the Air Force, and I wanted him and I to have some fun going to places we've always talked about. Besides the JMB museum, we went to the Hill AFB Air Museum (SR-71!), the Golden Spike RR connection, the Evergreen Air and Space Museum (SR-71, Spruce Goose, & more!), and Powell's Bookstore in Portland, OR.  The JMB Firearms Museum is located in the upper floor of the Ogden, Utah Union Station, which houses several other museums there, but nobody cares about trains or cowboys, so let's get to the guns. I took a picture of everything in the museum, excluding a small display of miniaturized firearms, which had no relation to JMB, so I largely ignored them.  In this album, you'll find pictures of all the pistols on display currently in the Museum. My hope is that sometime in the coming year (2016), I will personally make another trip down there, so I can make a few contributions of my own to the museum. While there, I took a total of 250 pictures - once I sort and upload them, I'll post them here (next is rifles, then shotguns, then machine guns, and others).

List of parts:   Frame, $169 - Tactical Maching 100% (I transferred mine through an FFL friend): http://www.tacticalmachining.com/1911/1911-frames/tm-recon-frame-1911.html  Slide, $90 - Generic surplus from somewhere, but it was cheap - http://blackthorneproducts.com/cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=25&products_id=560  Parts Kit, $140 - Sarco Industries .45 1911 Auto Build Kit, Less Frame & Slide: http://www.e-sarcoinc.com/451911autobuildkitlessframeandslide.aspx  Black Wood Grips, $30 - From a Gun Show  I didn't have a lot of unexpected problems. I went in expecting to have to hand fit/file every single part, and I was right! I will say that it has sucked to find sights for the Blackthorne slide, as it does not appear to be a standard cut--3D printer to the rescue!  My next step is to decide what to coat the frame with. It is still bare steel, that I just wipe down with oil every now and again. All in all, it was a blast learning how the 1911 works, and it is lots of fun to shoot."

1911,3cmlxb,JabbaTheWhat01,2,Thu Jul 9 18:53:34 2015 UTC,Have you tried building one with a 3D printed frame?
1911,3cmlxb,Wikkitikki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:47:11 2015 UTC,"Nope, and not ever! I might for an AR-15, but with how the 1911 uses the frame as a stressed piece for pins, barrel stop, etc, I would be standing very far away if someone made a 3D printed plastic one..."

1911,3chyl9,bueschwd,5,Wed Jul 8 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"DESCRIPTION: Colt combat commander converted to double action by louis w seecamp in the seventies before seecamp began manufacturing his renowned handmade pocket pistols. Around 2000 of these were converted.  L.W. Seecamp Co. was founded in 1973 as a family business specializing in Ludwig's patented (#3722358) double action conversion of the venerable 1911 semi-auto pistol (Colt .45). This conversion, done during a period when the single-action versus double-action controversy was at its peak, resulted in the first commercially available DA .45 autoloaders anywhere in the world. Nearly 2000 such DA conversions were done from the early 70s to the early 80s. Ludwig had become a firm believer in the value of DA after a Walther P-38 saved his life in WWII. That incident, which left him with a cheek-long scar and some missing teeth from a bullet wound, also convinced him point shooting rather than sight use is the reality in close range combat. Having been a fan of the 1911 but being also an advocate of DA carry, commercial conversions were a natural outgrowth of the Colt 45 that Ludwig had converted to DA for his own personal protection."

I have been changing jobs and we had a death in the family. I don't want to introduce too much gloom into a great community, but rest assured, it has not been forgotten. If nothing else, it will take on a deeper meaning to get it finished. It's nice to know it has some fans!"

1911,3ch4aq,devianteng,5,Tue Jul 7 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"The trigger is typically a drop in swap. At worst it will be light stoning on the top and bottom of the shoe and polishing on the bow.   Usually skeleton hammers are used with beavertail grip safeties. Many of them will not be able to be fully cocked with a standard GI safety like your gun comes with (and vice versa, a spur hammer will typically not work with a beavertail unless it is bobbed). The hammer also requires skilled fitting to make proper contact with the sear nose and maintain the right geometry on the hooks.   The ambi safety is probably the easiest to fit yourself. It requires some filing on the lug on the backside to mate up with the sear. It needs to be perfect, though, one too many file strokes and the gun won't be safe. Also, ambi safeties typically require right side grip panels to have a cut on the backside for the tab that holds the right safety on. Not all ambi safeties are like this, but most are.   The front sight is replaceable, but the stock sight is staked and almost all aftermarket sights (including fiber) are dovetailed. The slide will need to be milled for the correct dovetail cut to match the sight you want. This is a job for a professional.   For almost all aftermarket rear sights, the dovetail will have to be enlarged. Again, job for a professional.   Changing the mag release will be almost drop in but may require light filing to get a proper fit with smooth operation. Swapping this part will honestly add little to the gun and is pretty unnecessary.   Honestly, if I were you, I'd keep the gun as is (old school style 1911s are cool as hell), and shoot the shit out of it. The money you spent on mods (and trust me, doing all of those mods the right, safe way will cost more than the gun itself) would be better spent on ammo or for saving up for your next 1911."
1911,3ch4aq,olds442guy,4,Tue Jul 7 23:21:44 2015 UTC,Listen to this man.  He speaks the truth.
1911,3ch4aq,heekma,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"Very good info, and I appreciate it.  I hear what you're saying with buy the gun the way you want, but it's rare that I can find the exact gun I want, the way I want out of the box.  But after thinking about it, and the fact that this SA Mil-Spec is a solid GI Model, I will likely just keep it like it is then (with the exception of new grips).    If I do anything, it would be new sights which I would let a professional do.  Any other work beyond that, I would prefer to do myself.  I've always been a big fan of CZ style pistols, and by doing my own work on them, I've really learned how they work and how to take care of them.  My goal is the same interaction with 1911's."
1911,3ch4aq,olds442guy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:17:50 2015 UTC,"but it's rare that I can find the exact gun I want, the way I want out of the box   That's exactly why semi customs exist. Take the money you saved from not doing the mods and start saving for your next 1911 that you can order exactly how you want. I'd recommend Les Baer.   It definitely a good idea to learn about how the gun works and how to service it. But even if you do all the work yourself, you'll still spend a significant chunk of money on parts. 1911 parts are expensive, especially quality bar stock parts like Wilson, Brown, EGW, etc."
1911,3ch4aq,heekma,3,Wed Jul 8 13:26:08 2015 UTC,"/u/olds442guy gets it right.  No suprises there.  The G.I. 1911-A1 is the design at its' most pure.  Other than adressing hammer bite for those with big hands (pro tip--put medical tape or a band aid on the web of your thumb when shooting) the design needs only a good trigger and good sights--both of which the Springfield has.  What you're already describing--without ever holding the gun--is the equivilent of the perfectly fine Toyota you see parked at every mall--with a shitty spoiler and ridiculous ground-effects kit installed, none of which serve any purpose or match the look of the car.  It looks like a frankencar made by someone with just enough money to screw up a perfectly good car--and not enough common sense not to.  Your Springfield is a great 1911 just as it is.  Enjoy it!  Don't throw a bunch of stuff on it to make it look like a Dan Wesson,  you'll ruin the gun and waste money--money that should be spent on ammo instead of trying to make it into something it never will--and never should be.  I've been shooting 1911s since 1992.  Trust me, I did then what you're wanting to do now and for the same reasons.  Do yourself a favor and listen to a (relatively) old man:  Enjoy your new 1911 just as it is."
1911,3ch4aq,razor_edge,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:16:53 2015 UTC,I don't regret any of the time or money I spent turning my G.I. into my dream 1911.   ALMBUM

1911,3ch4aq,razor_edge,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"Solid advice.  As long as the sights work for me, I'll will try to keep this as close to stock as possible (other than grips and possibly an ambi-safety)."
1911,3ch4aq,razor_edge,2,Wed Jul 8 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"Well I started my 1911 project with a SA 4"" lightweight G.I. totally bone stock.

Tools are investments not costs.  So the big question is could you get a better factory gun for $1200 and save yourself the hassle? No. This gun is exactly how I wanted it and is 100% unique. It shoots just as well as a full custom Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, or Les Baer.   ALBUM"
