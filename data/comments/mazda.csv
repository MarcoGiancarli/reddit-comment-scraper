One kept trying to sell me something else and would not accept that I wanted the manual. 1 said they could get the blue by the end of the week, put down the deposit and then excuses and trying to sell me a different color. So took the check back and the other dealer couldn't give me a date on the car or an estimate and said it could be a month. Finally found it on a dealers site in Kentucky and they did everything over the phone and by fax and delivered my car to me 200 miles from the lot....  Yeah I am not a fan of dealers."

I'd always loved that car and the ownership experience was fantastic. It was fully bolted-on and it was QUICK. Really, genuinely quick. I wish I'd had it dyno'd. BUT ANYWAYS.  I waited patiently to find a very clean one and purchased this 2008 Speed3 on GOOFY wheels with 50,000 gentle miles on the clock. I am very pleased, it's extremely clean, extremely stock (except for a free sound system bassssss, and a rear motor mount which would have been my first mod anyway) and exactly what I wanted. I love how light it is, I've always loved the design of the first generation Speed and I love being behind the wheel. I've done my research (seeing as I've already owned this engine and tranny) but if you have any ownership recommendations hit me! Glad to be back in the family.  Modification plans:   Find some stock wheels ASAP. Short Ram Intake with integrated TIP Upgraded fuel pump internals Cobb AP Turbo-back Exhaust. Love it forever."

mazda,3dvgyt,strausy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:41 2015 UTC,Great find! Thanks very much. I'm anxiously awaiting since the other choices in reasonably priced 3-row SUVs are quite mundane.
mazda,3dvgyt,polorix,0,Tue Jul 21 13:22:13 2015 UTC,You're going to see a retail product for one in January ;)
mazda,3dvgyt,Virus64,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:09 2015 UTC,That's a bold statement for something that hasn't even been officially announced.
mazda,3dvgyt,lukijano4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:58 2015 UTC,I did not hear anything.
mazda,3dv4cl,SenorDieg0,4,Sun Jul 19 19:43:09 2015 UTC,You'll want some with tread on them.
mazda,3dv4cl,Skeeetz,4,Sun Jul 19 22:43:25 2015 UTC,Preferably round ones.
mazda,3dv4cl,jasonisnuts,3,Sun Jul 19 23:10:11 2015 UTC,Continental DW.   Amazing tire
mazda,3dv4cl,kreshh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:14 2015 UTC,This one is in my shortlist.
mazda,3dv4cl,kreshh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:00:15 2015 UTC,How much is the noise with these?
mazda,3dv4cl,matty_peppers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:06 2015 UTC,Not so much that I notice it.

mazda,3dv4cl,ThOrZwAr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"Literally, almost anything half decent."
mazda,3dv4cl,pseudomorphic,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:45 2015 UTC,Pilot sports are the best tires on anything.
mazda,3dv4cl,MetropolisPt31,2,Sun Jul 19 23:29:34 2015 UTC,I was going to recommend Continental DWS and I see you already did your homework.   I have it on my 2005 Mazda 6 i. I love it. I immediately see a difference going up the steep hill in Seattle.
mazda,3dv4cl,rome2000,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"I had hankook evo ventus v12's on my '08 3 hatchback and they were awesome, big step up from the Goodyear eagles it came with and way cheaper too"
