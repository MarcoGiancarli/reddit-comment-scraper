airsoftmarket,3dz8l6,whiteash6,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:23 2015 UTC,I'd suggest doing is going to a local tech and ask If they have an extra. I've gotten several springs for free by doing this. Also you can get a spring kit for only a couple of dollars at a local shop.
airsoftmarket,3dz8l6,nomadic318,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:02 2015 UTC,yeah I'm probably going to just get a new cut off lever that comes with a spring.
airsoftmarket,3dz8l6,nomadic318,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:55 2015 UTC,That's a good idea if you haven't already upgraded the stock one. Depending on brand some tend to wear out. However a spring kit is typically a cheaper option if you just want to get it up and running.

There should also be some sort of plastic tab inside that you can remove. My p229 fits in perfectly to the cqc blackhawk serpa holster after adjusting the screw and removing the plastic tab. I'd recommend adjusting it if you don't like slide wear (or anyone who is interested in it).

airsoftmarket,3dhg1j,gatotsu312,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:27:25 2015 UTC,I'm confused as to what you're asking in the second paragraph. Are you asking how much a pistol cqb loadout is?
airsoftmarket,3dhg1j,mclarenf1boi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:51:51 2015 UTC,"I think he's asking how many mags would be needed, which varies based on quite a few factors."
airsoftmarket,3dhg1j,Chieffy765,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"if thats the question, it will vary based on the field and playstyle. In a 30 minute game of CQB, I can fire up to 400 bbs."
airsoftmarket,3dhg1j,mclarenf1boi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"We have very different play styles then, the last game I played, I fired ~500rds between my primary and my sidearm the entire day, I guess using GBBRs has fought me to conserve what little I have on me."

airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,TheBetterTurbowolf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:04:47 2015 UTC,The external body has been used for about almost a year but the p* engine hasn't been used in a single game yet
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,TheBetterTurbowolf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:09:30 2015 UTC,How long is the barrel? I'm going for CQB and it seems a bit too long.
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,Avonyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:42:38 2015 UTC,Umm I don't know the measurements exactly but I don't think it would be a problem for cqb. It looks long in the pic but it's not really that long
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,Avonyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:08:48 2015 UTC,"So the ""adapter"" doesn't actually let the p90 accept m4 mags?"
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,Avonyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:05 2015 UTC,It does! But unless you can burn through 1500 rounds I doubt you'll be changing mags lol
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,aznriptide859,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"So, let's say I had some midcaps I would be interested in using with the adapter. I'd be in the clear?"
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,jonnyshock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:33:04 2015 UTC,It will only work with highcaps for some reason. I've heard of people easily modding these to use mid caps (which I've heard is pretty simple) I've just never had the desire to actually do it
airsoftmarket,3dgtn5,Zlateh_The_Goat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:35:04 2015 UTC,Hm. Alright. I have a friend who may be interested. I'll let you know soon.

airsoftmarket,3dgrp9,volktrot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:08 2015 UTC,That doesn't seem like a deal breaker considering all the upgrades and the extra mags that you get with the gun.
