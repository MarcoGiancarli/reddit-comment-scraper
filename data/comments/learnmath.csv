This isn't to discourage you, but math is a skill that needs to be practiced constantly to get better at, and as soon as you stop using it, you start forgetting it. If you play a sport or a musical instrument it's much the same as if you haven't played for the last five years.   That said you have an advantage that many students fresh out of high school don't have. Being in the military likely instilled in you a sense of discipline that most students lack. Some of the best engineering students I've worked with have been vets, because they know how to cut the bullshit excuses and work hard to achieve their goals.  For getting yourself prepped for placement exams and the like, some people have made some great suggestions already. Khan academy is great for practice problem sets, also pick up an old version of the textbooks that they use at your college and try and read through them and try their problem sets. Knowing how to solve for x is a very different skill set than the ability to read through and understand a math textbook."

So, we want two numbers that give the same output when plugged into f(x)=x1/x. Here is a plot of the function  With some calculus, we can analyze this function more thoroughly. Although f is undefined at x=0, we can take the limit to see that f(x) is near 0 when x is very small. Taking the derivative, we see that f(x) increases as x does, passing 1 at x=1, and reaches its maximum at x=e (the number e=2.718..., not the variable in your problem). Then f(x) decreases and approaches 1 as x goes to infinity (using L'Hôpital's rule).  For every value of x on the increasing portion of the function with f(x)>1, there should be a second point on the decreasing portion where f passes that value again. So, in theory, this means that for every 1<x<2.718..., there is a second number y>2.718..., so that x and y satisfy your equation. Further, by taking values of x close to 1, we can make y (and therefore the sum) arbitrarily large.  Actually finding this partner number y appears to be related to  the Lambert W function, and the property exp(W(ln(x)))=ln(x)/W(ln(x)). I'm still trying to piece together how exactly it works and I need to get to sleep unfortunately; I'll edit this tomorrow if I figure it out."

If this is the case, then to find the mean, you would need to add up all 1000 of your numbers. You can shorten this by using multiplication. mean = (592 * 0 + 104 * 2 + 214 * 12 + 90 * 10) / 1000 = 3.676  Now, go back to your original numbers. Instead of saying we have 1000 numbers, we can use the decimal P(X) values from your problem.

You're probably going to want to look up formulas for variance and standard deviation in your book, as I'm not going to be able to type them out clearly here.

learnmath,3e3n4s,andreasd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"Just letting you know, OP, I started over when I got into college at algebra 1 and progressed back into calculus. Now given that I hadn't actually even had a grasp of dealing with logs very well let alone trig functions when I got into calculus, even after refreshing myself, I sort of got to the point where it all eventually evened out and before I knew it, my algebra had progressed to the point of being very sharp, from doing it so much in calculus. It may have been part of the pedagogical process for anyone knows. Doing proofs in calculus is also a good form of exercise when it comes to strengthening your algebra, such as proving that d/dx(sinx)=cosx, or proving the derivative of an exponential is an exponential (which I would just get out a handy list of log rules and reference them until I got the proof down and then try to prove it myself). I also find that going back to prove some basic log properties also helps. Try finding a proof on the web for the properties of logs, such as exponentiation, addition of logs and subtraction of logs. Also make sure you know exactly what a log is, and slowly absorb the essence of log (that it is actually the inverse of an exponential or something to some power).   One thing that has always helped my algebra is knowing the basic axioms of algebra, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative identity properties, etc. I remember being able to do algebra in the past without actually knowing these properties, but nowadays, I ALWAYS think back to those properties as a base for anything I do in algebra.   As far as good books, I actually have no clue, since there are so many textbooks written on the subject, I'd say that just about any would do. Try looking up to see what textbook any nearby community colleges or universities use for their algebra classes. It would be worth taking a look."

The analyst stores the data for a given week in two vector in R5 : VH giving the daily high value and VL giving the daily low values. Find a vector expression that provides the daily average for all five days in a week.          So this would simply by VH + VL and then V the resultant would multiplied by 1/2 to find the average.          I have a semester of linear algebra, but my lecturer was not great and we never touched on a single bit of how to use these things."
learnmath,3e42y4,jimmy_rigger,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"That makes sense to me.  Since the vector is in R5 that just means it has five entries in it. Each of those entries probably represents a day of the week. Using H for high and L for low, the vectors are:  VH = <Monday H, Tuesday H, Wednesday H, Thursday H, Friday H>  VL = <Monday L, Tuesday L, Wednesday L, Thursday L, Friday L>  Notice that when you add these two vectors, what you get is the vector:  <Monday H + Monday L, Tuesday H + Tuesday L, ... >  That's because when you add vectors you add each corresponding term.  If you then multiply that vector by 1/2, each term in the vector gets multiplied by 1/2. So the vector you get is:  <1/2(Monday H + Monday L), 1/2(Tuesday H + Tuesday L), ...>  But isn't 1/2(Monday's high + Monday's L) how you would calculate the average price of stock on Monday? Sure it is."

The chance of getting no items in Z kills is qZ where q is the probability of not getting that item (= 1 - Y). So P[X=0] = (1 - 0.005)2100 = 0.9952100 = 2.68 x 10-5.

But instead of the theory behind it, I'm more interested in strictly building a model that assumes the pattern preceding it was its only pattern. Such as red is called every 4 days for 4 weeks. Thus, if red is called a given day, this model will predict the chance of red being called the next day almost none, the next day red being called is about 50%, and then by the fourth day, it is pretty much 100%.

learnmath,3e1ppp,JackDracona,4,Tue Jul 21 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"Well, you truly need to understand your data to know what type of problem you have. There are several possibilities here:  1) It is actually random.  In this case, no, there is no way to predict it. That is the very definition of random.   2) It is a weighted probability (e.g. 75% blue, 20% green, 5% red).  In this case, you just need to get a large enough sample and plot the frequencies in a bar chart. You can use more sophisticated statistics to estimate the error of your guess.   3) It is not random but determined by a highly complex set of variables. In this case, you would need to identify what those variables are, and then you could use a prediction algorithm like tree induction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) to uncover the underlying relationship.  If you can only identify some of the variables, you could use a logistic regression model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) for each of the colors to get better-than-chance conditions for predicting each color given the variables you know.   4) It is a pre-determined series of colors that only seems random or a series of colors probabilistically determined by the chain of colors before it (i.e. Markov chain).  In this case, you would want to look at the series as a whole (with as large a sample as possible) and try to identify repeating patterns of colors to help find the underlying pattern. This type of pattern recognition is a major problem in computer science, and it can range from extremely easy to unbelievably difficult.    So what type of data do you have?  If you don't know, then it can be hard to find out. This is a major problem in statistical analysis of real-life data, machine learning, and the analysis of complex/chaotic systems. If it is something that interests you, read up on probability, statistics, cryptography, machine learning, chaos theory, and non-linear dynamics."

How would i come up with a percentage that the a certain color will not be chosen?   Suppose, on average, red is chosen every 3-4 days, but rarely ever more than twice a week. Based on a record of previous colors, how would I come up with a probability that red will be chosen on day 3 if say, red is chosen both day 1 and 2 in a row in the beginning of the week?

So as you go from left to right in polynomial terms the x exponent goes from 3 to 0 in each successive term. The second ""1"" in (x+1) exponent starts at 0 and goes to 3. So you know instantly that no matter what if you have (x+y)20, the coefficients on each term will follow the pascal triangle and the rest will follow patterns in the exponent going up or down one. So when you understand this you can easily expand things. You also can do problems like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRkQ9nRk8rU where you are asked to find the coefficient of the x17 in (x+2y)20th. Instead of foiling this all out you can use the binomial theorem to find this answer for you. So, the pascal triangle can help you in quickly expanding something because of the pattern inherent in the rising and falling value of the exponent and the value of the coefficient. It also can help you in finding the value of a specific term. It is of course easier to just plug a number in initially but sometimes we need the other form to do more interesting things.

learnmath,3dvftn,ITwitchToo,2,Sun Jul 19 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"That's because the square root function can only return one answer for a given input (otherwise it's not a function).

So if you think sqrt(25) should be 5, then sqrt((-5)2) is also 5. The sqrt function doesn't know you started off by squaring -5, it only knows you fed 25 into it.  Anyhow, sqrt is generally chosen to return positive answers, but there's noone stopping you from defining your own sqrt function that returns negative numbers.

learnmath,3dvftn,ryrysweetiepie,3,Sun Jul 19 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Probably because, when we write sqrt(25), we mean the positive square root of 25 as opposed to the other, negative square root.  To put it another (longer) way:  The equation x2 = 25 has two solutions; namely, x = +sqrt(25) = 5 and x = -sqrt(25) = -5. By convention, we normally omit the plus sign for the positive square root though, so I could just say the first solution is x = sqrt(25) = 5.  On the other hand, the equation x = sqrt(25) has just one solution; namely, x=5. In writing sqrt(25) we've implicitly taken only the positive square root of 25.  So when you see something like x=sqrt(25), be aware that it's the same as x=+sqrt(25) and we've already restricted ourselves to looking at only the positive square root. If we wanted to consider both, we'd write x=+/-sqrt(25) instead.  (EDIT: Cleaned up my terrible formatting a little.)."

What you're betting me is that, no matter which x I choose, as long as my x is in (a-d, a+d), then f(x) will be in (f(a)-e, f(a)+e).  Since you don't know which x I'll choose until after you've told me your d, d can't depend on my choice of x.  The only information I give you is my choice of e, so the d you choose must either be a constant or some function of e.

Part of the bet is that I give you a number for e, you do some calculations, and then you give me a number for d.  An expression isn't a number so much as a sequence of operations to be performed on an input.  The result of those operations for a specific input might be a number, but until I specify what the input is, it's a list of steps, not a number.  Since you don't find out what x is until after you tell me d, d can't be a number at the time you tell it to me.   What happens though if the function changes direction within (f(a)-e, f(a)+e)?

For f(x)=x+16/x it does get unboundedly larger (the limit as x goes to infinity is infinity). Similarly, 1/x doesn't have an absolutely max since it gets unboundedly large around 0.  This isn't the only thing that you need to consider. You could lack absolute extrema and be bounded. For example, arctan(x) is bounded between -pi/2 and pi/2 but, since those values are never attained (arctan(x) increases monotonically to pi/2 as x goes to infinity, and similar to -pi/2 as x to -infinity), it doesn't have an absolute max or min.

Also note that it is not the case that gn must be the identity; it is possible to have hN=h'N without having h=h' (a simple example is when G is nontrivial, N=G, and h, h' are distinct elements of G). The key (as aleph_not mentioned) is that for any h (including powers of g) in G, hN=N if and only if h is in N. If hN=N then h=h*e is in hN=N. Conversely, if h is in N, then so is h-1 since N is a subgroup of G, so that any m in N gives n=h(h-1m), which is in hN. So N is a subset of hN, and the reverse inclusion immediate from closure of N under multiplication.  Now apply this result to the positive integer powers (gN)k = gkN, recalling that N is the identity in G/N."

Alternatively, you can think of the minus sign on the negative number as swapping the plus or minus sign in front of it.

learnmath,3dse3l,picado,2,Sun Jul 19 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"You're strictly right. To show a set is denumerable, we need a bijection with N.   The proof is still ""correct"", but like most mathematics, it's given as a list of landmarks, not a list of GPS coordinates. It shows you the major steps you need to find your own way through.  The first key is that you are appealing to the lemma you mentioned in your post:  Lemma: The cartesean product of two denumerable sets is denumerable.  This lemma is constructive. If you look at the details of the proof, what it does is take any bijection φ : N → X and gives you a bijection φ' : N → X x X.  The second key, as u/picado mentioned, is that you can turn around bijections: Having a bijection φ : N → X x X gives you a bijective function φ-1 : X x X → N.   Putting it all together explicitly, we get Z[i] → Z x Z, as given in the proof. Then since you know Z x Z is denumerable, there is a mapping N → Z x Z... we turn it around to get one of the type Z x Z → N. Composing the two, we get Z[i] → N. This is again a bijection, because the composition of two bijections is a bijection. So we can turn it around to get a bijection N → Z[i]."

In order to cancel out you still have to be able to divide by the denominator despite whatever the numerator works out to be and since it's zero when you plug in x=2 you can't making it undefined   Another thing is if you do set f(x)=x+1 then plug your answer back into the original.

Why is it true that the jth column of the sum will be the sum of the jth columns of the summands? This is what you are asked to explain.  The definition of matrix addition doesn't say anything directly about columns of the sum. That is why there is something to be proved in this statement.  How can you show that the jth column of the sum will be the sum of the jth columns of the summands? The only thing you know from the definition of matrix addition is what each element of the sum will be, in terms of elements of the summands. So, look at the first element of the jth column of the sum, and show that it equals the sum of the first elements of the jth columns of the summands. Then look at the second element of the jth column of the sum, and show that it equals the sum of the second elements of the jth columns of the summands. And so forth. In general, to show that the jth column of the sum is the sum of the jth columns of the summands, you need to show that for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m (where m is the number of rows), the ith element of the jth column of the sum equals the sum of the ith elements of the jth columns of the summands.  By showing that each element of the jth column of the sum is equal to the sum of the corresponding elements of the jth columns of the summands, then you will have shown that the jth column of the sum is the sum of the jth columns of the summands, because (by definition) two column vectors are equal if and only if each element of one equals the corresponding element of the other.

What other people have said (slow down, be careful, etc.) is correct, so I won't repeat it. Instead, I'll add this:  The type of mistakes you're talking about often come from your brain not being in its best thinking state. Math tests are about so much more than the math - they are a mental game. The key is to relax, and focus before (and during) the exam on having a calm, clear mind. Often, the students who make these types of mistakes are the ones that stay up too late studying instead of sleeping, spend 2 hours right before the test studying constantly (please don't do this!), have their notes out on the desk up until the moment the instructor hands out the exam, etc. Have a pre-exam ritual. For me, I always liked to listen to music. But do something that takes your mind completely off of the math before the exam begins (think about what athletes do before games... sit in locker room, headphones on, etc.). Then, when you are handed the test, tell yourself, ""I'm really well prepared for this test. It's no different than my homework. Just stay calm, and take my time."""

learnmath,3dooff,whyasdf45667,4,Sat Jul 18 00:11:53 2015 UTC,"I've read all of the comments and your replies and you seem to think that the derivative is the equation of the tangent line.  I'm here to tell you that you are wrong, at least partly.  The derivative only tells you the slope, but to find the equation of a tangent line you need to have a slope and a point that the line passes through.    Let's look at the function you're given: f(x) = x2 - 3. The graph of this function has a shape that we call a parabola. How do you find points on the parabola? You pick a value for x, plug it into the function, and take the value that comes out of the function, f(x), to create the point (x, f(x)). A few examples:  x = 2 -> f(2) = 22 - 3 = 1 -> the point (2, 1) is on the parabola  x = 0 -> f(0) = 02 - 3 = -3 -> the point (0, -3) is on the parabola  x = -10 -> f(-10) = (-10)2 - 3 = 97 -> the point (-10, 97) is on the parabola    Okay, so what about the derivative? What does it tell us? It tells what the slope of the parabola is at any given value of x. The derivative of our function is:  f'(x) = 2x  So if we pick a value for x, we will know the slope of the parabola at that exact point. For example, let's see what the slope of the parabola is at the three points we found earlier:  at the point (2, 1) -> x = 2 -> f'(2) = 2(2) = 4 -> the slope of the parabola is 4  at the point (0, -3) -> x = 0 -> f'(0) = 2(0) = 0 -> the slope of the parabola is 0  at the point (-10, 97) -> x = -10 -> f'(-10) = 2(-10) = -20 -> the slope of the parabola is -20    A tangent line is a straight line that touches the parabola at exactly one point. The slope of the tangent line will have the same slope as the parabola as it passes through a point on the parabola. Using our examples:  the tangent line at the point (2, 1) -> has a slope of 4, and passes through the point (2, 1)   ... so the equation of the tangent line at this point is (y - 1) = 4(x - 2) -> y = 4x - 7   the tangent line at the point (0, -3) -> has a slope of 0, and passes through the point (0, -3)   ... so the equation of the tangent line at this point is (y - (-3)) = 0(x - 0) -> y = -3   the tangent line at the point (-10, 97) -> has a slope of -20, and passes through the point (-10, 97)   ... so the equation of the tangent line at this point is (y - 97) = -20(x - (10)) -> y = -20x + 197     To find the equation of a tangent line, you need the slope of the line and a point that it passes through. Both of those things are properties of the parabola's function and its derivative."

As u/AGnarlyNarwhal said, this is best seen by just graphing the silly thing.  Or have a computer do it:  The graph of y = x2 - 3.  The graph of y = x2 - 3 with the tangent line at x = 1.  Note the equation of the tangent line at x = 1. I wrote it in WA as y = 2(x-1) - 2. But really, we should think of it as: y = f'(1)(x - 1) - f(1).   It might be hard to see where I got that equation from. But it at least gives you something concrete to chew on. You can replace the ""1"" in that equation with other values to get other tangent lines:  Tangent at 2  Tangent at 3  Ultimately, though, it comes down to the fact that the derivative is the slope of the tangent line. It is not the equation of the tangent line.   You know how lines have equations of the form y = mx + b? Well, the m here is the value of the derivative, evaluated at some point.

The code below should speak for itself. You can adjust the starting values (nastart, nbstart, ncstart, ndstart) to adjust the starting mixture. In the code below, I've renamed 'A--AB--' to 'c' and I've renamed '--BA--AB--' to 'd' for clarity.   # Initial values for amount of molecules nastart = 50 nbstart = 50 ncstart = 0 ndstart = 0  # Simulation size simsize = 1000 # Empty object for storing final amount of molecules store = matrix(0, simsize, 4) colnames(store) = c('A', 'B', 'A--AB--', '--BA--AB--') # Start simulation for (i in 1:simsize) {   # Set initial values   na = nastart   nb = nbstart   nc = ncstart   nd = ndstart   # While there are molecules of A and B, or B and A--AB--   while((na != 0 && nb != 0) || ((nb != 0 && nc != 0))) {     # If there are molecules of nc (A--AB--)     if (nc > 1) {       # With probability .5 do       if (round(runif(1, 0, 1)) == 1) {         # Equation 1         nc = nc + 1         na = na -1         nb = nb -1       } else {         # Equation 2         nd = nd + 1         nc = nc - 1          nb = nb -1       }       # If there are no molecules of nc     } else {       # Equation 1       nc = nc + 1       na = na -1       nb = nb -1     }   }   # Store results   store[i, ] = c(na, nb, nc, nd) } # Calculate means apply(store, 2, mean)   If you have any more questions on this, let me know!"
learnmath,3dj75a,KeepitSuccinct,2,Thu Jul 16 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, everyone learns differently at a different pace. It is entirely possible you need to study a bit longer to understand/remember things. It could also be that you need to have things explained to you differently. What types of things are you having trouble with?"
learnmath,3dj75a,IdonotevenLB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Mostly graphs with the different types of assymptotes, fractions, and radicals.  Some rules too.  I was fine with college algebra and precalc 1 but then I transferred colleges and hadn't taken math for about 4 years"
learnmath,3dj75a,IdonotevenLB,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"What are some specifics about them that you're having trouble with? Do you have trouble finding asymptotes? Simplifying fractions or their rules? And since there isn't so much for radicals, I'm assume the rules are what are troubling you?"
learnmath,3dj75a,MrPants1401,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:14:52 2015 UTC,OpenStax has algebra 2 and precalc books for free that you can download as a pdf.
learnmath,3dj6i4,RainbowOfFish,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"You have the right idea but your wording is clunky. To be rigorous, suppose you have any M>0 and choose a positive x close to 0 such that ln(x)/x<-M."
learnmath,3dhocc,throwawaytrucker12,7,Thu Jul 16 10:30:31 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're using y = a(x-h)2 + k, let's look at that (x-h)2 part for a moment.  Say it is y = 3(x-4)2 + 7.  If x = 4, then 3(x-4)2 will be 0 and so y will equal 7. If x is anything other than 4, 3(x-4)2 must be some positive number and so y will be greater than 7.  So 7 is the min y-value of the quadratic.  Likewise, for y = -3(x-4)2 + 7, if x = 4 then y = 7 and if x is anything other than 4, -3(x-4)2 must be some negative number and so y must be less than 7.  So 7 is the max."

learnmath,3dhocc,picado,2,Thu Jul 16 11:30:27 2015 UTC,"The minimum of y=x2 is 0 when x=0. So for a>0, the mimum of y=ax2 is also  0 when x=0. Then the minimum of y=a(x-b)2 is 0 when x=b, and the minimum of y=a(x-b)2+c is c when x=b. If a<0, then the maximum of y=ax2 is 0 when x=0, and so on for the rest."
learnmath,3dhocc,wintermute93,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:32:36 2015 UTC,"If you take the graph of f(x) and replace it with f(x)+c, the graph shifts c units upwards. If you replace it with f(x-c), the graph shifts c units to the right.  So if you start with f(x)=x2, it's pretty obvious that the min value is y=0, which occurs at x=0, since we know what the shape of that parabola looks like. When you move from x2 to (x-h)2, everything moves h units to the right. So vertically, the min value is still y=0, but now it occurs at x=h. Similarly, when you from from (x-h)2 to (x-h)2+k, now everything moves k units up. So the min value still occurs at x=h, but now it's up at y=k instead of y=0."
learnmath,3dikc6,rstanton3,6,Thu Jul 16 15:42:15 2015 UTC,But this is incorrect according to my book   No. It has a different form than the answer in your book.
learnmath,3dikc6,zifyoip,2,Thu Jul 16 15:48:44 2015 UTC,i plugged in some numbers and got different answers though
learnmath,3dikc6,zifyoip,2,Thu Jul 16 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"Like what, for example?"
learnmath,3dikc6,zifyoip,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"For example when I plug in 2 to my function I get 4.47, and when i plug that into the books one i get 3.01"
learnmath,3dikc6,jimmy_rigger,4,Thu Jul 16 16:10:29 2015 UTC,You should do that arithmetic again more carefully. Neither of those numbers is correct.

learnmath,3dgz7n,throwaway_47552,2,Thu Jul 16 04:54:19 2015 UTC,"I think Probability/Statistics will definitely help with almost any kind of data analysis. Outside of that, there are a few scattered areas that could be useful depending on the data.  Linear Algebra is generally useful for computer applications of math.  This depends on the nature of the data analysis, but if you are trying to construct mathematical models for situations, then you will want to know Discrete Mathematics (for discrete phenomena) and Differential Equations (for continuous phenomena).  Graph theory has tons of cool applications to data analysis, though you might need to go past the undergraduate level to find them."
