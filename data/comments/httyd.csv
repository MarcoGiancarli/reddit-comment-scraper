httyd,3dy238,TheCommonChild,11,Mon Jul 20 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"You need more examples!  Alexandre Desplat. Recently won an oscar for The Grand Budapest Hotel, but has composed other great scores like The Imitation Game or Rise of the Guardians and of course, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  Ennio Morricone, legend of western film music  James Horner, may he rest in peace. Won an oscar for Titanic, but I prefer his work on A Beautiful Mind or The Mask of Zorro  Thomas Newman, composed American Beauty and The Green Mile  Michael Giacchino, composed many Pixar films like UP, Ratatouille and recently Inside Out and Jurassic World.  Those are my favorite anyway, in addition to yours :D I love film music (obviously) and wouldn't narrow it down to three composers.   Concerning your poll, I would pick John Williams as favorite overall because film music wouldn't be the same without him. But John Powell is also magnificent."
httyd,3dy238,FantasticMrPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"ill be honest, the choices of those 3 were a tad biased towards me so i apologies. But, those are the three that i love the most. I too am a huge fan of movie scores, personally the dramatic kinds like Hans Zimmer's work. That's why he is my top favorite. Exspecially, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95obkJqXj2c (i am not sure on how to link it the way you do xP) But, though i love John Williams work, like Harry Potters infamous theme song. i don't feel as inspired by it as i would by ""Test drive"" or ""Davy Jones' Organ theme"" again, in my books they have a ""Dramatic Flare"" (if you are picking up what i am putting down ;] ) I do, enjoy Jurassic World, main theme though. Just it sounds really cool. You are right, i should have added more people, i just stayed with my top three. and so i put other, hoping for a who in the comments. But, i do regret not adding Paul Dinletir and Kevin Rix (the composers behind Audiomachine and songs such as, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XCZEQXguP4, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0SJpFDko8, or the popular one among HTTYD lovers, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeTFvH4w_KY  if you haven't guessed, i am a big trailer music and epic music fan too :D"

I never played the halo series for i never found a lot of fun in them. The only thing i thought was neat was the vocals in the Halo 3 menu. However, that's why i made this post. To see what people like and be led in different direction and view different tastes. Forgive me for not putting your favorite composer, as i have left out a few of mine as well and many others. There are just so many good composers to name that i stuck with two best known composers than and John Powell for the pleasure of this subreddit since he of course made HTTYD1/2's outstanding work.

httyd,3d4yib,orangeisthebestcolor,4,Mon Jul 13 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"I'll put in my 2¢ as the resident fanfic expert.  I Hear Him Scream is my personal favorite and I would highly recommend it. The poor prose can be difficult at times, but the story structure and weight make up for it. The main idea is that Hiccup becomes a night fury which allows him to communicate with Toothless. The tone is very dark and depression is a major theme.  Hitchups has an entire expanded universe including Without a Hitch and quite a few others. Be warned that the shorts can be quite sad at times with installments such as ""The Circle of Life"".  For the Dreaming is an excellent expansion to HTTYD1 with a POV that switches between Toothless and Hiccup. Toothless can communicate with Hiccup by entering his dreams.  The Dragonwing Effect is an absolutely fantastic work that is in my top 5. It combines an original story set in the future with HTTYD elements from the past. A form of telepathy similar to Hitchups is used but not a major story element."
httyd,3d4yib,Plailect,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:20:27 2015 UTC,Thank you for this post. its a shame there aren't many fanfics where they are able to communicate. maybe in future :(

Lightning and Death Itself is a beautifully written AU that perfectly fits your request but has not been mentioned yet. The story's quality is astonishing - it is on a level that I'd expect to read in a book. There are 110 chapters that kept me busy for quite some time, and I dare say this was one of the best HTTYD stories I have read so far.  To Soar into the Sunset: A Night Fury's Odd Memoir tells the first movie from Toothless' perspective with lots of OC elements added. Very emotional, though I have to admit this is a honorable mention: Although there is lots of dialog between both Toothless and Hiccup, they only grow to understand and interpret eachother as the story progresses, but there is no direct communication using words the other could hear."
httyd,3d4yib,uno28,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"A bit out of the box this one, but try The Dragonwing Effect. It does not focus on Hiccup and Toothless though, it focuses on an OC character. I do find the story very interesting though."

In Nightfall, Hiccup and Toothless grew up together. Cloudjumper took Hiccup with Valka. Toothless and Hiccup can speak to each other from beginning to end; however, they speak in ""dragonese."" I personally really enjoyed their style of dialogue, but I have heard of several people who dislike it."
httyd,3d4yib,blackskies4646,2,Tue Jul 14 13:16:56 2015 UTC,i just dislike the idea that hiccup thinks that he is dragon otherwise i would probably love that fanfic and read it. but meybe i give it a chance.
httyd,3d25dm,PhoenyxVII,17,Sun Jul 12 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. At times, that whole 'family-friendly' thing seems like an obstruction. But if something like that were to exist, it would have to be done with caution.  HTTYD manages to capture something special, and if it were lost with that hypothetic 'adult version'... It just wouldn't be the same. While I would love to see it done, keeping the nature of Hiccup and Toothless' relationship preserved and enjoyable to watch would be infinitely harder."
httyd,3d25dm,Asdamk,5,Mon Jul 13 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"I actually don't know how I feel about an updated animation version. Honestly it's almost fine as it is - I only really have issues when stuff like Stoick freakin blasting Dragon in the face with Gobber's mace attachment leaves no visible damage. I just don't think an ""adult"" version of the animation really fits in with the feel.  However, I'd love to see a YA/Adult adaptation of the novels, or even a novelization of the movies. That would be fantastic."
httyd,3d25dm,ocshoes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:12:44 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel. Books would be perfectly fine to express more realism and gore, but the if the movie was remade to be aimed towards older audiences, it would disappoint me a little. There's nothing like the warm fuzzy feeling of friendship you get of of these movies."
httyd,3d25dm,thestupidestgiraffe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"There's nothing like the warm fuzzy feeling of friendship you get of of these movies.   I totally agree. Also another reason I feel books would be good is I don't know if you've ever heard of the Redwall novels by Brian Jacques, but they're marketed as children's books and definitely have some pretty detailed descriptions of battles and blood running all over the place so it's possible to write gore without being over the top mature."
httyd,3d25dm,ocshoes,9,Tue Jul 14 06:42:33 2015 UTC,"Sure. But as always, you gotta be careful not to over do it. What I mean in, don't just add a viking cutting a dragon's head off if it doesn't add anything to the rest of the movie. I feel that is one of the most crucial mistakes when people try to make something ""darker"", they just over do it to the point of putting the viewers off."
httyd,3d25dm,Angelin01,10,Sun Jul 12 23:26:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. I fell in love with this film BECAUSE it's family friendly and yet still plays with my emotions better than any film I've seen so far - recreating it to cater for ""adult audiences"" completely negates the whole reason why I'm sure a lot of people love it in the first place.

httyd,3d25dm,bcunningham9801,3,Mon Jul 13 11:47:25 2015 UTC,"tl;dr; HTTYD/Dragons basically has little do do with the visuals or the story, but how amazing the characters are. I couldn't care less for a grittier visual, and would worry about that detracting from the characters.   The war would be a war and a scary one at that. Would you all like to see something like this? Or do you feel like the normal (somewhat aimed-for-kids) version should have no contest?   yeah it might be a little more visually impressive, but as a piece of art, would a more realistic animation style significantly improve the art? what does blood/more realistic death have to do with the core story of hiccup befriending toothless/succeeding his father?  as a profit setup, would the kids story going dark make it more profitable? the second movie was already profitable, would cutting out a lot of kids and bringing in a unknown amount of adults be a wise move?  I should finally note a preemptive counter argument, I don't think the blood and more significant violence would heighten the emotional impact of a few events, as many of those events have largely been driven by the characters and how rich they are.  I learnt of HTTYD and dismissed it for years, because it was a story I already knew, the trailer gave everything away, I didn't need to see it, yada yada. Last year I watched a part of a few dragons episodes, found myself pleasantly surprised at the quality of the character. Not the plot or production quality, but the characters. I figured, since tv show spinoffs usually suck compared to the original movie(stargate not counted), I'd give the movie a go.  I went and watched HTTYD 2 in cinema the next day. The story isn't really anything impressive, a few generalized notes can kinda sum up the first movie. I loved the characters however, it and a few other series were responsible for my more favored series shifting from flashy event-based stories, to stories that really just let me enjoy the characters involved."
httyd,3d25dm,twigenator,3,Mon Jul 13 12:13:44 2015 UTC,"The for-kids one no contest. BUT that's not to say the kids version is perfect.  My friends commented how in HTTYD 2 the comedy takes away from the really dramatic stuff at some points, and I find myself agreeing with them. I mean riding the baby dragon's was clever and all, but I really didn't feel it went well with the fact Stoick literally died 10 seconds ago. I also felt that Hiccup's closing monologue lacked the heavy weight he should feel from his father just dying, it should have been about his father a bit more.  I think the writers should move away somewhat from the kids audience and focus on the family as a whole. Basically I wasn't a fan of the (imo) poorly placed comedy.   e.g. they could have kept the baby dragon idea, but instead, show Hiccup taming the baby's who have become distraught/almost feral after their parents were taken away and they were afraid after the attack. It would have shown Hiccup using his pain to reach out to the dragons and if they really wanted, Gobber could still have said something funny to top-off the scene."
httyd,3d25dm,Daimon5hade,5,Tue Jul 14 10:44:16 2015 UTC,I'm not sure.   It could be an addition in some places but it would mostly seem rather uneccesary.   Think to yourself what gore would add rather than just being there for the sake of it being there.   I wouldn't mind stronger language though.
httyd,3d25dm,nukeclears,2,Mon Jul 13 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"If HTTYD weren't aimed at kids, it would have be a different movie. This kind of movie only works with kids as the ""target audience"" because as seen by the Oscars voting, animation is not taken seriously. ""Adults"" don't watch movies with dragons in them unless basically the entire movie is a battle scene (see the Hobbit movies). You can present the same basic themes and tell the same basic story regardless of whether you have graphic material in it or not. And you'll have to work a little harder to show a character is upset because you can't make them say ""fuck"" a hundred times.  Sometimes I do wish that the writers would omit the throwaway joke that's just in there for the kids, but I think overall HTTYD would just not work if it were targeted towards adults."

On a more serious note, I actually much prefer it as a cartoon-style kid friendly theme. The fact it's light-hearted (though with fairly heavy themes) makes it much more fun to watch. Honestly, it's refreshing. There are far too many movies trying to be dark, gritty, and adult. Sometimes, the kid inside of me needs something that's just... fun."

httyd,3d3fwd,Angelin01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"To start off, I want to say that I fully agree with everything you said regarding the development of the universe and plot, as well as the rushed ended (that was disappointing).  Overall, it was a good story and is incredibly unique, breaking out of the standard httyd fanfic storylines.  However, there were a few points that made be really struggle with the story.  First off, I have to disagree about excellent writing.  In no way I am saying it is bad, but I found it to be far overly descriptive about useless things.  As an example, I found the character descriptions in the first few paragraphs to be excessive, detailing the most minor things.  I find general descriptions to be more effective, as it leaves the details to the imagination.  Also, the million different acronyms that often went unexplained.  Secondly, was the relationships.  The Sam/Skye was very well done, the author developed it perfectly.  However, after Sam's return to his time, the relationships fell apart.  The author continuously dropped hints at a Sam/Skye reunion (ie. ""He found himself suddenly transfixed by storm-gray eyes, flecked like opals.  Just as the image began to break up, a familiar voice rang in his head: You will find me again it said."")  After developed an excellent bond between the two characters and leading the reader on in hopes of a reunion, the relationship is then scrapped as the Sam/Silence bond replaces it.  It felt cheap, with no real substance, as there was no development of this relationship as there was with Skye - it just kind of appeared out of nowhere.  I understand Silence was Skye's great99 grandaughter, but how does that count as finding Skye again...?  Lastly, was the villian of the story, Gupta.  Evil for practically the sake of being evil, with an unrealistic motivation of not listening to both his son and wife's attempts to explain the truth to him. Felt one dimensional, which surprised me considering the creativeness of the universe the author created.  Ok, reading this back to myself, it sounds like I hated the story, which is not true at all.  It's creativity more than made up for some of its shortcomings, and was a breath of fresh air in an genre that has become filled with 1000 variants of the same ten different stories.  If someone is new to the httyd genre, then there is far better things to read. However, if anyone has started to find the stories repeat, then they will likely enjoy this one :D"

httyd,3d0mvg,tomakotheblue,4,Sun Jul 12 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"Eh...I'm actually glad HTTYD doesn't do this. Imho having bloopers at the end of a film can cheapen the rest of the movie, especially with HTTYD since it seems to take itself a bit more seriously than most animated films - even Pixar films. It's one of the things that I really appreciate about this franchise, and I think after-credit bloopers or jokes would not fit in with the tone."

In addition the books are aimed at children which would mean for a lot of people it's not for them, and that's perfectly fine.  I myself adore the books, the first couple of books are everything you could want from kid's fantasy, with interesting and funny characters and stories (with a surprising amount of world-building and consistency). The last 3-4 books (final book comes out this year) are even better and become pretty dark (for a kid's book) and honestly turn the story into a fantasy epic (for kids, I'm not exaggerating here).  I definitely recommend you give them a go (or listen to the audiobooks) if you can keep an open mind. But it's perfectly alright if they don't float your boat."

httyd,3cg8jy,uno28,12,Tue Jul 7 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely, I doubt anyone on this sub wouldn't. They're wonderful movies with important messages about responsibilities and growing up. But especially the second movie can be quite heavy, so I'd just make sure they can handle it. I probably wouldn't show it to them at a very young age.  Same goes for HTTYD 3. Based on Dean's statements, that could also score quite high on the traumatize-o-meter™."
httyd,3cg8jy,FantasticMrPanda,3,Tue Jul 7 18:25:15 2015 UTC,Didn't Lion King do that same thing to all of us when we were young though?
httyd,3cg8jy,imaginaryvenus5,8,Tue Jul 7 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"*SPOILERS for HTTYD2, for the few who haven't seen it**  What I think separates HTTYD2 from Lion King and other movies w. deaths is that it axes a character established in a previous film who had a significant arc, and was also in a TV series and the majority of the sequel. I have a hard time thinking of any movie aimed at kids/family audiences, animated or not, that did something like that.   Also, Stoick is one of the best-written fathers in any animated film, if not the best. He was far from perfect and even though he filled the stereotypical role of the ""dissappointed father"", his characterization was so good it not only felt fresh, but he was still likeable despite his faults.   For Dean to decide to kill off a character like that is shocking, and really serves to separate this franchise from other Disney films where the good character that is killed is usually a family member who is portrayed as perfect and extremely two-dimensional. I think that's why people tend to be more pissed with his death in HTTYD2 than most Disney deaths - he felt like an actual human being rather than a fictional fill-in.   To use Lion King as an example, I personally love it as a film, but Mufasa - though an awesome character in his own right - was too perfect as a leader, and we only knew him for about half of a film. It makes the death easier to take for the audience but, in my opinion, limits its effect.   Personally I appreciated the risk, though from what I've heard the second film was going to be even darker, but DreamWorks told Dean to tone it down because the third film is going to be even moreso."
httyd,3cg8jy,gomamon15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"other movies w. deaths is that it axes a character established in a previous film who had a significant arc   Well, in a weird, roundabout retroactive way Star Wars now does this with Obi Wan (and other chars) :P But yeah you have a good point.

My son started to freak out during the scene cause it reminded him that his grandpa had passed away but he got over it and still liked the movie.   He'd said he would watch it again and he isn't traumatized by it. It's a part of life he sadly has had to deal with twice.

Toothless is the fastest dragon in the known HTTYD universe, so why are there scenes where hiccup is struggling to keep up with people or falling behind? I understand its for plot reasons but it just doesn't match the world lore."
httyd,3cg74b,ProcrastinatorSkyler,14,Tue Jul 7 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"Having Hiccup on his back must slow him down a lot. Even discounting the extra wind resistance, he has to go slower to avoid injuring Hiccup. Humans can't survive that much speed unprotected, we can't even breathe in air moving that fast."
httyd,3cg74b,Madock345,4,Wed Jul 8 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"Which reminds me how I once tried to go out in a snow storm and keep my head upright. It resulted in hyperventilation and me almost losing my consciousness.   Good times.   Edit: changed the word, 'cause I be derping."
httyd,3cg74b,rultes,8,Wed Jul 8 10:48:29 2015 UTC,Someone will probably some up with some reason to do with Toothless' tail fin.
httyd,3cg74b,blackskies4646,3,Tue Jul 7 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"If anything, the new tail fin should make him even faster, as he is Mecha-Toothless now."
httyd,3cg74b,tux_mark_5,2,Tue Jul 7 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"same, in the series toothless is as fast as any other dragon..."
httyd,3cg74b,DominikTVDE,11,Tue Jul 7 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"I vaguely recall from the HTTYD 1 movie commentary that riding Toothless at speed requires a lot of effort on Hiccup's behalf, so it's probably not something he wants to be doing on a regular basis without reason.  In the TV series I would assume that since the crew go on missions together, and everyone needs to wait on Fishlegs, it makes more sense for them to travel at Meatlug's speed.  EDIT: also, nobody had ever seen Toothless before because he only flew at night - making him invisible."
httyd,3cg74b,Kataroku,4,Tue Jul 7 21:23:45 2015 UTC,My guess would be that his team work with hiccup improved in the time between movies. That would be a cause for the increased speed.
httyd,3cg74b,Not-quite-a-Stoner,3,Tue Jul 7 19:20:00 2015 UTC,what ?
httyd,3cg74b,-ShadowFury-,7,Tue Jul 7 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"Toothless's speed is dependent upon hiccup's ability to operate toothless's tail fin. So if they have better team work, toothless could fly faster."
httyd,3cg74b,Not-quite-a-Stoner,4,Tue Jul 7 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"Imperfections of the artificial tail fin and steering gear - you can see Hiccup constantly tweaking and reworking the design to increase Toothless' performance. Even with this, they'll probably never hit the top Night Fury speed possible because of different structure of the artificial parts to the lightweight contents of natural fins. Rider - if Hiccup&Toothless hit Night Fury top speed, Hiccup would probably die in one way or another unless he glued himself to dragon's back and made sure he's perfectly smooth while being so. Human sitting on Toothless' back is slowing him down the same way an ogre sitting on a plane would slow it down - aerodynamic shape is broken. Even then, I guess he could hyperventilate or suffocate because his body is not suited for moving with such speed If Toothless hit his top speed, I'm afraid Hiccup would lack reflexes to keep up with steering and manouvres. They'd be like a bullet, but lose on ability to change direction. Plot - if you have fastest and one of the most powerful dragons on your side, you're OP and noone stands a chance and thus you have a very boring plot of the protagonist wiping the floor with everything that stands in his way."
httyd,3cg74b,Dhuz,2,Wed Jul 8 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"It bugs me so much that this is exactly how it is. I want Toothless to be so much faster, but you are exactly right."
httyd,3cg74b,Dhuz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about it for some time as well and accepted the limitations of what we can get from Toothless. Also, in the series I guessed that Toothless had to be limited with power because the characters were supposed to be roughly on the same level - I actually rooted for Fishlegs&Meatlug more than I did for Hiccup&Toothless. We can see a shift of power in Movie#2 where Hiccup and Toothless take on their roles of leaders of their 'people'."

Had to go back and listen to the original just to settle myself down lol.

httyd,3c9a6x,ocshoes,8,Mon Jul 6 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"I really agree on the whole less bad guy thing. I think the conclusion should focus on Hiccup and his development the most.   I also think that instead of a lot of Hiccup goofing off on his dragon (which is really enjoyable to watch) it should be him finding a balance between what he likes to do, and his responsibilities as chief (I.e. Growing up).  But there are a lot of ways they could do that, and I really hope there is a John Powell scored flying scene like in the last two movies.   I really don't think Astrid will become chief. The chiefship, Hiccup's inheritance of it, and his possible reluctance to inherit it is about Hiccup growing up and into what his village expects of him, but on his own terms.  That would be an interesting twist however, and I would be willing to see how it plays out."

I need more Hiccstrid (but it shouldn't be the focus of the movie). Although, I wouldn't mind at all if the movie ends with them marrying and Hiccup's telling the story of the dragons to their children :3   I think the bonding between Hiccup and Toothless should be the main focus, just like the first movie.  And, it must pass the Bechdel test easily."
httyd,3c9a6x,darth-vayda,3,Mon Jul 6 11:26:44 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt Toothless would be a female, it would kind of go against the whole ""Hiccup and Toothless made for each other"" thing, though it would be an interesting twist.   I do think the ending will be bitter sweet, hopefully more sweet than bitter in my opinion, but I really want some closure.   Given that I can only name 4 female characters in the movies, and it is a rather male-centric coming of age story that deals a lot with masculinity, it would be refreshing if it passed the test.    Edit: I totally misread your first paragraph, I thought you meant you wished toothless to be female, and I was like, what? But now I get it. Maybe toothless finds a lady, and they go live on a nice farm up-state?"

I don't think we will see Dagur, I'm pretty sure Dean/Dreamworks confirmed that Drago is returning. I think they should keep the TV and movies separate, but that's just my opinion, I don't have a lot of reasoning behind that besides personal preference.   I also wish we could have a less black and white villain. I would like to see some moral Greg areas instead of ""pure evil"" to see how Hiccup reacts.   But yeah, more Astrid/Hiccup and your third point."
httyd,3c9a6x,geesemaster,2,Mon Jul 6 11:06:24 2015 UTC,"I would definitely like some moral grey areas, especially with Toothless and Hiccup. Also when Toothless kills Stoick and we know it's not his fault, but it still really hurts Hiccup. I want to see more of their relationship, friendship being tested as well. Maybe finding it difficult to navigate Hiccup's new responsibilities.    But I mean I'm sure anything they produce will be worth it. HTTYD is such a good series, tv and movie that they can't do too much to really mess it up I hope"

httyd,3c9a6x,gautampk,2,Mon Jul 6 13:28:06 2015 UTC,"The writing is not great, and some get a little weird, but hey, it's fan fiction.   I can't link, because I'm on mobile at the moment, but there are two that I recommend:  When a boy becomes a man: picks up where HTTYD2 left off, Hiccup has to overcome the death of his father, and his own inhibitions so that he can run Berk. Focuses on grief and moving on, but not really sad. Does get a teensy bit R-rated with romance, but it's relatively tasteful, and doesn't take over the plot. This story is good for closure, and the characters are pretty accurate, I think. The writing is above average for fanfic level, and is readable, but the plot is what keeps you going. No huge conflicts, just moving on. Has two sequel series that I have not read.   Hitchups: the one I am currently on. It's an alternate history where hiccup and toothless flee Berk in HTTYD before ""Romantic Flight."" They travel here and there, and learn a long the way. I don't know how much I can recommend it, because it doesn't really feel like hiccup, but maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Major bromance, lots of Viking culture, a good read if you really want to dive in. It's super long."

httyd,3c9a6x,V2Blast,4,Tue Jul 7 10:33:16 2015 UTC,"a satisfying conclusion where we are left with no desire for sequels, and DreamWorks leaves it be John Powell to top the first two films' scores, which I think is very likely if the third film has an emotional ending and more quiet/dialogue-free moments like 'Forbidden Friendship' As I said above, more quiet moments without dialogue and just music. I loved HTTYD2, but do with there were a few more moments like the first one where Powell's score was the only thing heard. It's one of the things that separates these films from other animated films. If they focus more on the dragons and Toothless, especially if he has a love interest, I think there will be many of these.  Taking risks with the story that pay off  Perhaps an epic battle/war  Finally, as I've said before, winning the Oscar would be a nice cherry on top"

httyd,3c9a6x,thestupidestgiraffe,5,Mon Jul 6 22:13:05 2015 UTC,"Actual romance between Hiccup and Astrid. Though the rest of the Netflix series will hopefully make some progress on that front.  Besides that, I want an interesting story, and I want Valka to actually contribute to the plot (not just be there to set up the major conflict of the movie).  Other than that, I'm just hoping it's a great movie - though some acknowledgment of the events of the TV series would be nice."
httyd,3c9a6x,Skyblacker,5,Mon Jul 6 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"Actual romance between Hiccup and Astrid.   I swear over then entirety of released media they've hugged a few dozen times, had a half dozen kisses and that's about it. There really hasn't been anything showing the relationship at all, only the beginnings of it, and a fairly small chunk of it in HTTYD2. In the Short films it's like they barely know each-other."
httyd,3c9a6x,thestupidestgiraffe,4,Tue Jul 7 11:02:17 2015 UTC,"Half-dozen seems to be overestimating it, but yeah, pretty much. I'm pretty sure they kissed once (not including a kiss on the cheek) in the first movie, and maybe once in the second movie. They don't really interact as more than friends in the first 2 seasons of the TV show. Race to the Edge seems to be the first time in the show that they actually acknowledge that there might be some sort of romance between them (not really a major spoiler, just erring on the side of caution)."

That said, the third movie will also have many flashbacks from before the first movie, so maybe the children we see will be the younger dragon riders themselves."

The only reason she recognizes him is the scar. The scar is there specifically to be used as a plot point. It's not a ""little"" detail at all.  Another cool continuity nod. In the first movie, Hiccup builds something to attach to Toothless's tail so he can fly, but did you know that there's a reason earlier in the film that makes him need to do that? I'll give you a hint: when Hiccup shoots Toothless out of the sky earlier, it tears part of his tail off."
httyd,3c5dnz,DragonBassist,2,Sun Jul 5 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"What I wish they had done, was depict the scar in the first movie.

httyd,3bz5lg,darth-vayda,10,Fri Jul 3 09:34:24 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a lot of questions like that lately... oh well. After the first movie, we have a few short movies.  Gift of the Night Fury, Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon, and Book of Dragons.  Then there's the first 2 seasons of the TV show: Riders of Berk and Defenders of Berk. After that, there's another short movie, Dawn of the Dragon Racers and the Netflix show, Race to the Edge. And then there's the second movie."
httyd,3bz5lg,Asdamk,8,Fri Jul 3 09:51:27 2015 UTC,Probably because with Race to the Edge being so accessible via netflix people are seriously looking into it.

httyd,3bz5lg,LawOfTheSeas,2,Mon Jul 6 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"I will add that some of the spin-offs are of questionable canonicity. For example, in Legend of the Boneknapper, the chronology of Gobber losing his limbs seems off from the 'month' mentioned in the first movie, and (though this is understandable for budget reasons) the fact that there were very few dragons actually on Berk on a regular basis in the series seems to go against the chronology of the first and second movies. But I'd echo what Asdamk has said - that seems to be the optimal order."

This story is a candy to read, it does not focus on hiccup adventure outside of berk, but instead, it focus on the best friendship I have ever seen in a book and their return to berk. Seriously, the bond between these two is amazingly developed and just after one chapter, you are going to fall in love with them.  this is your story where hiccup flew away from berk to explore the world, but it has a big twist, he meet wrenlou, his best friend Brother, and together, they go back to berk.  This story have a lot of action, unexpected and/or tense moments and it is going to make you cry more than once.   I have to give a special mention to the caracters in this one. QueenAurora is one of the best out there in making caracters advance and change throughout the story, she will make you love.. or hate  people in less than a sentence.  All in all, Return of the dragon rider is a gem and I cannot recommend you enough to read it.  *Plus, she is making a collection of stories wich describe hiccup and wrenlou adventures before ROTDR and it is mesmerizingly good *  to everyone, Dont hesitate to send me messages if you want more advice on good fanfic, I would love to help you find one that you are going to fall in love with :P  Again, sorry for the mistakes, I know i am not a good writer myself :/ sob"
httyd,3bq3w9,-ShadowFury-,4,Wed Jul 1 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"One that really tested my emotions was I Hear Him Scream by Rift-Raft.  Okay, it's a transformation fanfic. I know they're generally frowned upon. But seriously, it's one of, if not the, best fanfictions of any fandom I have ever read.  The story surrounds a similar timeline to the beginning of the first movie, but with Toothless landing in the village instead of Raven Point. When Hiccup tries to kill Toothless at the behest of his father, he calls forth magic and transforms him into a Night Fury.  It shows a different, yet possible, side to their relationship - one where they could speak to each other and interact on a very different level.  The writing style is a tad confusing, but the fanfic itself really works. It's not just about, ""Hey, we're both Night Furies, let's do some weird stuff and fly away without even practising!"" It's a heartbreaking story expanding into the world of HTTYD as it could have been. The last couple of chapters are bittersweet to completely heartbreaking. Would recommend completely. I know, quite a few people know of it, and I probably haven't done it justice, but my two cents are on the table. Hope you enjoy/Have a few days free, plus a few more to cry it off!"

I am on mobile right now, but I will link to the stories when I can.   Edit: Added links, and I also would like to second the recommendation of ""Return of the Dragon rider"" (I went ahead and made link to it too).  Nightfall:   Main summary: hiccup is taken by Cloudjumper with Valka and grows up with the dragons. He is basically the feral brother of Toothless and they get stranded in Berk for a while.   Pros: some amazing interactions between Hiccup and toothless. Pretty good storyline and writing. Has a few bittersweet moments.   Cons: some people have complained about the way Hiccup and Toothless talk to each other (I personally enjoyed it, but it is definitely not for everyone). Some of the characters are incredibly flat.   To Be God Touched:  Main summary: Hiccup and Toothless lean to talk to one another, but there are unintended consequences.  Pros: interesting take on the ""Hiccup and Toothless can talk"" story arc.   Cons: it is a short, easy read. While I enjoyed this fan fiction, there really is not much to write about it, good or bad. As far as fanfics go, this one is in the middle.   Becoming Lífþrasir :  Main Summary: Hiccup returns to Berk after having fled. Astrid blames herself for driving Hiccup away.   Pros: really good read. A few Shakespearian quality ironies, good romantic pacing between Hiccup and Astrid.   Cons: I honestly cannot think of any right now. I'll edit some in if I do.  For The Dreaming  Main Summary: Toothless invades Hiccup's dreams/memories in an attempt to discover why Hiccup is sad.   Pros: unique combination of the book characters with the setting of the movies. Interesting take on Snotlout and good interactions between Hiccup and Toothless. Short (might also be a con).   Cons: there are better friendship fanfics about Toothless/Hiccup. Does not give Snotlout as much attention as needed. Cheesy chapter titles. And the author seems compelled to mention it in every thread about fanfics."

It's basically based off of Hiccup actually leaving in the first movie and coming back to Berk. One of my favorites, by far.  The Adventurous Adventures of Hiccup and Wrenlou:  This one's a prequel, per se, to RotDR. It's also really good.  Talking in my Sleep: This is written in Astrid's PoV. It does have a chapter that's got an inappropriate scene in it, but that didn't deter me from the story.  I Hear Him Scream: This one's amazing. Hiccup shoots down Toothless, as in the first movie, but then he gets turned into a dragon himself. I really liked this one- Toothless actually has a personality!

Craig Ferguson and Gerard Butler (R.I.P, Stoick) are both Scottish, just living in America. They even got Scottish Extras (Hence David Tennant - I was surprised that he got such a small part). But yeah, the Scottish accent probably comes after some rite of passage. I don't know - maybe it comes after killing a Dragon - hence why Hiccup could never master the accent while speaking normally even though he's definitely at an 'Adult' age. But maybe it's a secret society that adult Vikings get into once coming of age, and they have to speak in Scottish accents... Their helmets do vaguely resemble a triangle...

httyd,3bkvwk,hgighf,6,Tue Jun 30 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"Before I get started, I just wanted to point out that you linked ""Stoick Saves Hiccup"" twice, with the wrong link for ""Stoick's Ship.""  I couldn't agree more with you on the music. It's extremely well done throughout the entirety of both movies. However, I'm not a huge fan of ""Where no one Goes,"" as a solo track. I just don't think it can rival the genius of other tracks, such as ""Test Drive,"" and ""Stoick's Ship"" (My two personal favourite, utter masterpieces.) Coupled with such a fitting and beautifully animated scene, however, makes ""Where no one Goes"" one of my favourite scenes from the franchise, if not a favourite song.  I also entirely agree with you on the artwork. Completely superb, especially in the second movie. While I prefer the first movie from the second, due to what I think is simply a better story (HTTYD is definitely hard to follow up on,) there's no question that the second is visually stunning, much more so than it's predecessor.  The characters of the HTTYD franchise are some of my all-time favourites. I don't why, exactly, nut I'm just charmed by their personalities.   All in all, an excellent franchise that I hope has a long and well-made future ahead of it.  Note: If any of you haven't yet listened to ""Test Drive"" yet, you really do need to. As OP said, it's simply masterful. You should really also check out ""Stoick's Ship,"" which is also a work of art.  These movies had some of the best scores in recent cinematic memory. I dare say ""Test Drive"" rivals ""Main Theme from Star Wars."" Watch out John Williams."
httyd,3bkvwk,N-Machiavelli,4,Tue Jun 30 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip on the links, I wrote this in a hurry.   I do agree that Jonsi's song is a little bit out of place, and it probably works better for just the credits. I am a huge Jonsi fan though.   Something I missed from the first movie was the humor and wit, that kind of disappeared, but the director said that he wanted to love from humor to wonder, so I guess that works too."
httyd,3bkvwk,uno28,3,Tue Jun 30 03:18:13 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more with your favorite music. Stoick's Ship is one of the best pieces of music I've ever heard. It's beautiful.

I hear im scream https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435562/1/I-Hear-Him-Scream  ok this one is by far... the fanfic I remember the most and will most likely read again.  in this, hiccup become a nightfury... at first I didn't want to read it because it is not my kind of thing (at all), but I forced myself to at least, give it a try... and ohh god am I glad I did!  if I could only choose one fanfic, it would be this one, from cry, to anger, to sadness and joyfulness (is it a word?), this book will make you pass trought all sort of emotions. Just please, give it a try!   in simple, hiccup now have to learn to be a nightfury and survive with the help of toothless while he is stuck on berk. (I cannot say more to convince you sadly, because spoiler)  I can say witout hesitation, that this fanfiction and hitchups, beat most of the books I've read in my life. (And I have read A LOT of book in my early teen)  Becoming-Lífþrasir https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10049374/1/Becoming-L%C3%ADf%C3%BErasir  This one is kind of like hitchups, but it foccus on hiccup return to berk, after years and years, of becoming a man, but don't worry, it has a lot of action in it and you won't get bored even 1 paragraph reading it (and it have some aspect that no other fanfic have, like trying to represent a bit more of viking culture, and a lot of situation where hiccup have to think more than he ever has on how to get trough (I loved this aspect of it) ).  This one is great if you want to see hiccup been underestimated by berk at the start, and proving everybody wrong again and again that he was useles and fragile while talking to his dad, astrid, gobber, after leaving for a long time. lots of stressful and tense moments that make this book hard to stop reading until you finished it.  (okay, I am writing to much here, 2000 caracters...)  If you realy want more, I have read around 10 fanfic as of right now and still reading most of my free time, so don't hesitate to ask me questions or more good fanfic (Really, I just said a little part of the best ones I have came to read) ^   as you can see, I realy love reading httyd fanfic, I simply cannot say how much I love the universe and how hiccup interact with the world around him,I am not much of a hiccstrid fan or just pure action, I want caracter development and see links create between caracters. ohh, and I love talking about it with whoever I can :D!  Im really am sorry for my awful english, it is not my primary language and I barely even talk or write with it :/ , sorry for making your eyes bleed with  mistakes, I swear the fanfic wont :). thanks for reading me ramble about what I love, I hope I can make you read more! and if you can, please leave some feedback, I would love to hear back from you about the fanfic you have read or are reading!!  ok, this is getting to long, sorry D: . see you soon !!"

httyd,3bkjtw,gomamon15,13,Tue Jun 30 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. If anything DreamWorks will cut back on other film projects and focus on HTTYD3 - it's one of their tent-poles after all.   I think that DreamWorks would be smart to turn its attention towards making more films like Dragons and Panda - i.e. grand epics that are done on a scale that decimates anything done by any other studio. Films that feel like complete films (great music, animation, cinematography, production design) and not just a story filled with slapstick and jokes.   For instance, I recently have suggested they take the approach of making more ""David Lean"" animated films, where they can use animation - not to make a cartoony environment - but make a realistic one that includes a lot of color and lighting manipulation that would not work as well, be as feasible, in live action films. Hell, watching the CGI-laden live-action films today I find myself asking more and more ""why not just make the whole thing animated, at least then you'll have consistency in appearance."" Of course I don't think they should stop making cartoony films either, what I like about DWA as opposed to other companies is how much control directors seem to have over their projects.   Anyway, that's just my two cents.   I just want to see is this trilogy conclude with an epic, satisfying, emotional final chapter and fly off into the metaphorical sunset hoisting the Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2019."
httyd,3bkjtw,PhantomMCH,8,Tue Jun 30 01:50:15 2015 UTC,I'm with you on all points.   I thought the lighting and atmosphere in HTTYD 2 was superb.

httyd,3bkjtw,gomamon15,3,Tue Jun 30 07:08:42 2015 UTC,"yep, that is what i have heard, 2018. seams to far away, but at least we have race to the edge to keep us happy."
httyd,3bkjtw,greyspatter,3,Tue Jun 30 07:24:55 2015 UTC,"It wasn't said, but I have had a feeling that DreamWork's decision to push back was due to Pixar's announcement to release Toy Story 4 roughly the same week as HTTYD3 in 2017. It really came across as a move of arrogance from Pixar; like a ""ha-ha watch as you come in second to another Toy Story film!"" Either way it was a smart move for DreamWorks. Plus now that gives Dean more time to iron out the script, storyboarding, and whatnot.   So on the plus side HTTYD3 will not be competing with TS4 (which I have a feeling will suck, but it'll make a ton of money anyway), but 2018 MIGHT see the release of Frozen 2 and, maybe, Incredibles 2. Either way Disney's really flooding out the competition, which depresses me to no end."
httyd,3bkjtw,bejouled,7,Tue Jun 30 12:18:43 2015 UTC,I'm terrified that they're going to cop out of killing Drago. He deserves to die.

httyd,3bkjtw,greyspatter,2,Tue Jun 30 05:11:14 2015 UTC,"If I remember rightly Drago is going to make a return in the third, and the dragons will probably leave for whatever reason, which makes me sad."

httyd,3bkjtw,greyspatter,3,Tue Jun 30 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, I misspoke, what I meant was the characters are never really shown (the Vikings at least) killing enemies, etc. they are very peace oriented."
httyd,3bkjtw,Fifth5Horseman,4,Tue Jun 30 01:07:23 2015 UTC,Yes Vikings are known for their peaceful and forgiving nature
httyd,3bkjtw,greyspatter,3,Tue Jun 30 04:58:18 2015 UTC,"No they didn't, they showed Hiccup's dad doing everything to protect Hiccup... and getting himself hurt in the attempt. That's something that happens in the real world and something that's worth writing a movie about.   Dad's die - it's part of life. The story that's being told by the HTTYD movies is about growing up and adulthood, so it makes a lot of sense to depict this.   On the other hand, you can't just show people dying all over the place every time they do something 'bad' or 'wrong.' Apart from the trouble you're gonna have getting your film rated so that young audiences can actually watch it - what's the point? What are we teaching kids if we show them that someone like Drago will just 'die', and thus the problem is solved and we never have to concern ourselves with that again. That's not how life works. You're not allowed to just 'kill' your problems, you need to work through them and find the compromise that makes the most sense for the situation.   TL;DR: Kids movies; everything is meaningful; Stoik's death isn't violence, it's growing up."

httyd,3bkjtw,MigMigg,3,Tue Jun 30 05:02:12 2015 UTC,"Dads are not supposed to die when you're 20 years old.   But sometimes, they do.    Your father getting BRUTALLY MURDERED should never be considered an essential part of maturing.   I agree with this statement, but I want to watch films about struggle, not ease. That's why it happens in this narrative. It shouldn't happen, you're right. But it does.    How would you propose fixing this? Talking him out of it? Getting him to apologize?    That's what you're supposed to think about. You can't really think about that if Drago's dead, the decision is made for you. Does Drago deserve to die?"

httyd,3bkjtw,gomamon15,0,Tue Jun 30 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"I think Hiccup killing Drago (or Hiccup having him killed) would mean the end of Hiccup's childhood innocence, and I believe that it's such a large part of his character that they wouldn't make him lose it.  Part of what makes Hiccup Hiccup is his unbelievable moral standing and good faith, so it wouldn't really make sense to have him throw away his innocence he's worked so hard to maintain.  On the other hand, it would be an effective climax of his growing up-saga, but I for one don't want such a cliché to happen. If DeBlois want to kill Drago by the hand of someone near Hiccup, it'd probably be either Astrid or Valka, as to create conflict in the wife-husband or mother-son relationships of the film.  Edit: Words and grammar"
httyd,3bkjtw,rbloyalty,3,Tue Jun 30 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"But the last movie was Hiccup trying to be a ""good person"" and it got his father killed.  We've established that talking to Drago isn't going to work.   If we're talking clichés, I do not want anything like the classic bad guy dangles off a cliff, good guy offers him one last chance to redeem himself and pull himself up, bad guy says no fuck you I'd rather die thus cementing the good guy as good and the bad guy as crazy."

There were more callbacks and wit in the script, and more opportunities to have little or no dialogue. The story in the sequel is more expansive and dramatic, which was probably the right direction, but I do miss those elements from the first."

httyd,3beh5x,gaffergames,4,Sun Jun 28 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"Movie was a massive success, as was the new Avengers though we all knew Avengers was going to be more Avengers and that's what people wanted."
httyd,3beh5x,Delsana,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"No disputing the success here - but I think the script was weaker. You can't always judge success by lack of failure. Case in point, I didn't learn of HTTYD till much after it was out of theaters. I saw HTTYD 2 twice, and regret it. Wasn't thrilled either time, but I made commitments to see it with other people.   The other way movies have changed since then is the gigantic focus on international box office revenues. As you can see from Avengers, I think there is a shift to focusing away from the U.S. market, because HTTYD 2, with the larger marketing budget pulled in an additional 200M in international revenues than HTTYD 1.   But now I've failen off the rails, and should probably post this in /r/movies."

So.. yeah I would say it was an epic movie.  As for the style of movies, movies have been taking this path for the past 15 years. it's the special movies like HTTD, Big Hero 6, and everything that are different.  As for /r/Movies, like Videos, PC Gaming and nearly every specialty sub, they are not reliable places to discuss anything."

httyd,3beh5x,Skyblacker,4,Sun Jun 28 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"The first movie had an amazing plot, but it's the kind that's rather hard to do a sequel on: Hiccup goes from being the nerd to being the hero, reconciling with his father and revolutionizing his world in the process. How do you top that?   Anything that could have significantly changed did so in the first movie; the only further changes you could make would be to reverse the effects of previous events - which, indeed, is what happened with Valka. Which is a nice fantasy for anyone who's lost a parent, but it doesn't fundamentally change Hiccup's life; it just adds another trainer to his gang. And Hiccup would have taken his father's place eventually. Even Hiccup's relationship with Astrid is simply the logical continuation of the first movie (though I still can't figure out why those 20 year-old's aren't married yet. It's not like Vikings have to finish college; they've been doing the rest of their adult roles since they were 15).  And since Hiccup's relationships were resolved in the first movie, the only conflict left is among the dragons. Which is why the second and probably third movie will focus on that. Hiccup and Astrid are already having their Happily Ever After; it's their dragons we have to worry about."
httyd,3beh5x,Skyblacker,2,Mon Jun 29 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Right. I can see the best resolution being that while Hiccup earned respect in the first movie, the second movie could have been about fighting battles of his father's past, with him. Not to defeat him, because he has already proved himself, but to recognize that chiefing is about a tremendous amount of responsibility, with a lot of ways to go about it. It isn't just one thing, and then doing more of that - that is a recipe for failure.  I think where it fell off for me, apart from the dialogue, was Valka's return, which was somehow dismissed and forgiven so easily, when it was abandonment. You got the sense that she could have come back, and chose not to.*  Even the old literature of Man v Himself, Man v Man (Drago), Man v World would have been nice, as long as he learned new lessons each time.    As a P.S. it opened on Father's Day weekend, and you kill the Dad off. SERIOUSLY. My now five year old still hates it for this."
httyd,3beh5x,Skyblacker,2,Mon Jun 29 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Valka. She should have stayed dead. Hiccup could have discovered that Alpha, possibly accompanied by another dragon ally, on his own. Then the death of one parent wouldn't have been replaced by the reappearance of another - though Hiccup might have adapted by turning to Gobber more, which might be a more realistic outcome."
httyd,3beh5x,Toofluffles,2,Mon Jun 29 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"That would have been an interesting challenge arc - Drago and the bad Alpha, discovering the new Alpha and struggling with ""can he train it?"" then discovering that size was only one component, because when the second Alpha died, you found out that Toothless could become the Alpha. That would have been nice too.   I see why people write fan fiction now."
httyd,3beh5x,RonPaul2069,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"You might like this. It takes place when Hiccup is 20, but by then, Stoick has died of old age (at least by medieval standards) and the enemy is far more clever than Drago. Reddit recently discussed it here."
httyd,3beh5x,RonPaul2069,2,Mon Jun 29 23:57:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its probably that Hiccup has something worth living for. Previously we saw Hiccup go from nothing to having Toothless and later Astrid, he probably just wasn't as excited in the end of the first HTTYD simply because he doesn't know what to do with his newfound friends.  I guess its just Hiccup being happy..?"

For HTTYD, this is Varèse Sarabande.  Since only Sarabande sells the music, they can set whatever prices they want as there is no competition- a monopoly.  Think: If there are two gas stations next to each other and one has a lower price, you go to that one.  If there is one station and no gas for 50 miles around that, you have to go to that one, even if the price is outrageous."
httyd,3b4o92,MigMigg,6,Fri Jun 26 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"Not a good example because, unlike gas, you don't really need to buy this soundtrack urgently if you're in the middle of nowhere. And while the record company has a monopoly on the specific record,  they don't have a monopoly on the music industry. Price too high, and people will just buy other music (or, as mentioned elsewhere, people could just go listen to it on YouTube). Lastly, most people wouldn't consider music to be as important as gas is. Price it too high, and people will stop buying it. But I think the soundtrack is reasonably priced, or at least priced such that they will get a lot of people to buy it."

httyd,3b1cw9,Buhnanuers,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:28:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the review! I do have a few questions though,  first of which is Gobber. Namely, his accent. How did you guys like it? I myself am torn between it is comically bad, in a somehow good way, to ""I just need to get through his text so that I can keep reading,"" in a bad way. But I don't know, what do you think?  My second question is in regard to Chapter 6: Hurt. SPOILERS, but I figure if you are reading this, you probably know what happens, anyways; that is the chapter where Hiccup goes on his 'I'm useless' down spiral, and Toothless discovers Hiccup was the one who shot him down. My question is, was Hiccup's monologue too drawn out? What I mean is, would it have been a more powerful (For lack of a better term) passage if Hiccup had only one paragraph to express himself?  My last question is about how Toothless talks/describes things. Were you guys fans of how Toothless was possessive of Hiccup and the cove (my little-two-legs, my cove, etc.) and just in general his names for stuff (two-legs, sky-scales, next sun, etc.)? Also, did you like the transition of Toothless calling Hiccup ""my little-two-legs/my hatchling"" to ""my little-brother/my brood-love"" or was it abrupt and/or unnecessary?  Those are all my questions about writing style and whatnot. If you don't mind, I would also like to ask what your favorite part of the story was. This is just for personal amusement, I think it will be fun to see what people liked. My personal favorite is the scene before the test flight (Chapter 7: Affection) where Toothless convinces Hiccup to jump off the cliff with him. I thought it was fun to write, and I just really enjoyed their whole conversation despite the fact neither of them understand what the other is saying. Really, I just like that whole chapter. Anyways, what was your favorite part?  Thank you so much for reading my little story, it means a lot to me. And thank you Plailect for reviewing this! I've enjoyed reading your reviews and seeing my story in the same list of the greatest fanfictions ever makes me feel ridiculously happy."
httyd,3b1cw9,Shireling,2,Thu Jun 25 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"Gobber's accent was fine and I barely noticed it because it fit the character It was necessary to have multiple paragraphs in my opinion, and I think the whole scene would have been worse if it were shorter. I liked the possessive aspect as it felt like what someone used to owning everything would act like. As for the names for stuff, I liked it because it reminded me of Warriors), a series I am partial to.  My favorite scene was the one with Snotlout and his father. It really gave his character a more complex feel as opposed to him being childishly evil for no reason. No problem! I would bet I enjoyed your writing more than you enjoy my reviews. This has definitely made my top 5 list, although I'm not sure exactly where yet."

httyd,3at53b,ThePostItNote,12,Sun Jun 28 05:10:17 2015 UTC,"Because everyone of all ages will profile what they see and hear, once we see all the adult vikings with their accents we recognise them as one group, whereas the younger accent-less generation all share said trait, so we recognise them more as one group unconsciously, its pretty much a device for story-telling. If you look at the normal vikings and the younger generation differently, the accent is a contributor. Also we can identify more with the younger generation (lets face it, the audience mostly is the 'younger generation') that share no strong accent too, 'cus the average young person doesn't speak in a full strong accent.  Something that pisses me off (although know one cares yeah yeah I know) is the critics, they would look at this like a huge -1 star flaw whereas in reality they have actually not even realised it.  Yeah. Story-telling OP, Dreamworks please nerf."

I can't remember if I read it in the HtTYD art book, or heard it on a commentary video, but the actual intention was relatability.   They also made Hiccup speak/act in ways that would let him fit right in with us, right here in present day! That way we related to him and why he struggled to fit in on a viking island.  Similarly to the accent choice, there is evidence that real life vikings never had horns on their helmets. Crew knew this, and designed horned helmets anyway! So that they could be recognizably vikings.  It really bothers me, too, when people think of this as an oversight and become critical of the movie for something that they aren't grasping. :/ One time I was showing the movie to a classmate, and he pointed out the accent difference laughing... I sure felt like a jerk when I couldn't bring myself to laugh too. Just wanted to spell it all out..."

Mulan - Mulan has an American accent, her parents and grandmother have Asian accents.  Shang - same film, same situation. Simba and Nala - They go through an accent change. American Black accent as children, Non-Black accent as adults. Scar and Mufasa - brothers, but different accents. Lilo - She has an American accent, her sister and her sister's boyfriend have ethnic Hawaiian accents. Pocahontas - modern day American accent, while her father has a more stereotypical Native American accent. Except when she talks to John Smith, then suddenly she sounds more Native. WTF? Tarzan - adopted, his gorilla mother and all his fellow gorilla troops have American Black accents, but he's given an American White accent. Dinosaur - forgot the dino's name, but same adoption situation (except this time with lemurs), same accent situation as Tarzan, with the exception of that crazy lemur but he's more like that elephant in Tarzan than anything.   And hey, even non-Disney films have done it!    Fivel and his Sister - In American Tale, Fivel and his sister are Russian-born mice, as are their parents. But while the parents have stereotypical Russian accents, their children have American accents, even before they got to America. Anastasia - she grew up in a Russian orphanage. But even before that, she still had a non-Russian, American accent despite the fact her elders did. As did Dimitri.   So back to the question. Why do you care that these accent discrepencies exist in HTTYD but not in other films? If you did care that they existed in other films, then you would not have asked the question here, you would have asked in /r/movies.  EDIT: The better question is why are Scottish/Galaeic accents being used for Vikings (and Greeks, and Spartans, Romans, ect), and what the hell is Disney's obession with using Black accent for animals and non-protagonists? Hmmm Disney? Mind answering that? Even Tatiana (Princess and the Frog) was given a New Orleans accent, while the swamp creatures and voodoo lady were again given Black accents. Mushu- Black Accent. All the Bears in Brother Bear - Black accent. Like, can we get some Hispanic or even Eastern European in there a little more? If they insist on using ethnic accents for non-protagonists, at least have variety! I haven't heard some variety since Atlantis!"

Sometimes I wonder though if Disney is afraid of child/parent relationships, in the sense that they don't know what to do besides kill the parent. If a parent isn't dead, they're barely a character in the film. There are very rare exceptions (and the Pixar films don't count).   Dreamworks however, likes parents. They're certainly around a lot more - even those that die are not gone in the same movie they are introduced. Unconventional relationships and family groups are also more of a norm in Dreamworks films. Don Bluth films also had some of the same characteristics, and I grew up on those so I tend to like Dreamworks more because of those similarities."

I'll assume that both types of dragons look and feel the same, so it's the inside that matters.  Mechanical   Predictable / programmable behavior, greater control, no risk of running loose No training, can help and accompany you from the very beginning No expensive food required to keep it energized Lives until battery leaks or damaged parts cannot be fixed or replaced at Best Buy   Biological   Emotional bond on both ends Greater self-awareness, more defined personalities Grows, reproduces, baby dragons Unexpected behavior could lead to hilarious outcomes - more YouTube videos with dragons   As a programmer myself, I always hate seeing movies with robots that build emotions. I just can't feel anything for them (even had trouble with Baymax). So I'd say, either a biological dragon or a mechanical dragon as long as I don't know about it."

Sure, Hiro got the desired result when he did that, but it means that Baymax doesn't really have complete free-will.    After mentioning the baby dragons and unexpected behavior, that does make the biological route much more appealing to me.

There's definitely not too much on this, but from what I found on /r/askscience....it may be feasible for some of our dragons.    Obviously we have to rule out something like the Gronckle. Too much weight, not enough wing span. Not too many people should be upset about that anyways. But, the night fury might be a possibility given my extremely limited research.    From the blu-ray extras: Night Fury: Length: 26 feet. Wingspan: 45 feet. Weight: 1776 lbs.     From wikipedia: ""The ability to fly is not a simple question of weight ratios, except in extreme cases. Size and structure of the wing must also be taken into account. As a rule of thumb, a wing loading of 25 kg/m² is considered the limit for avian flight.""  So we convert 1776 lbs to 805.58kg. Then 805.58kg/25kg/m²= 32.2232 m². Do a little bit more calculation by borrowing a technique from another reddit post (""I found one paper detailing a bat wing's dimensions: 20cm span to 57 cm2 area. So if we scale up (and we probably shouldn't), we need a wingspan of...)"", and I calculated a wing-span of 46.62 ft. Not far off from the blu-ray number.      I'm not a physicist, but it looks like there may still be a chance. Don't give up hope!"
httyd,3a9kb8,ZtriS,3,Thu Jun 18 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm hopeful :P. It's certainly possible. Birds have semi-hollow bones (pneumatic), and respiratory air sacs form air pockets inside. By having air inside of your bones, you're keeping yourself lightweight.   What I'm saying, is that there's a better chance, if dragons had hollow bones. :P  And yeah, scaling up doesn't really work.

We could possibly see mechanical pets or dragons in the next 50 years, but I would imagine it would be much further into the future before we could have bio-engineered dragons suitable for riding or companionship.  As for the second question: I have actually fantasized about this before.  With the freedom a riding dragon (Toothless) would present, I wouldn't need to hold down a job or a stable place to live.  I think I would be perfectly content with camping and having Toothless help me hunt for food and supplies while out in the wild.  I could probably also make a pretty penny performing flying shows and tricks with Toothless, so I could make money that way.  I would probably take off for Norway or Sweden and just live in the wild there, though."
httyd,3a9kb8,Usmarine33,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. M.E. would probably be much simpler to create than G.E. I'm not sure about fire-breathing with a ""real"" animal though. If the M.E. one had fire, but the G.E. one didn't, I'd still take the ""real"" one.      Life would be really simple if you had a dragon. You could just live off the land with your bro-dragon and do your own thing. Not a bad lifestyle. :)"
httyd,3a9kb8,OrangeW,3,Fri Jun 19 07:09:45 2015 UTC,"Well I guess I'm gonna get called a hypocrite again for answering this question (yes, I'm looking at you Trolly McTroll person). Genetically-engineered all the way. Robots can only go so far. They would be just a copy. Even if we could implement the most mind blowing AI that could ever be made, I'm sure it still wouldn't match an actual living being. If dragons were real, I wouldn't want them to be real just to have them as pets, I'd want them to be real to just be out there."
httyd,3a9kb8,Mithent,2,Fri Jun 19 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I don't think of them as simply ""pets"". They're more like friends with whom you share a bond.  Quite interesting actually, that we think this deeply. Are we that obsessed? (I know i am :)  )"
httyd,3a9kb8,Mithent,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:42:23 2015 UTC,"That's so true. I think that is a great way of looking at it. Rather than one party being the ""dominant"" party, both parties just choose to remain as equals through friendship. Here's something though: let's say we genetically engineer the Night Fury. Do we give him his full tail, or just half? Something that Hiccup has over his dragon is that Toothless cannot fly without Hiccup. Initially, when Toothless thought he could, he shook Hiccup off into the water before realizing he could no longer fly and crashing into the water himself. How would you convince a dragon that he needs someone sitting on his back?"
httyd,3a9kb8,Mithent,2,Thu Jun 18 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"You don't. Personally i wouldn't want a dragon-friend so he can walk/fly me around like a horse, but mostly because dude, dragon friend. Also, they should have their free will, if they don't want you to fly with them, tough luck. But i think, if you treat each other as equals, and you are great friends, you can share each others best things."
httyd,3a9kb8,HotDealsInTexas,2,Thu Jun 18 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely genetically-engineered. A robotic one could just be some sort of drone with an integrated AI which responds and reacts to you (not saying that wouldn't be cool either). It would inevitably have limits.      And while an organic dragon would mean the possibility of it just suddenly flying away on its own volition, not liking you or even harming you, a bond with a living, breathing creature is still can't be beaten by machinery.       It would be interesting how the world would adapt to such a thing, knowing how tightly monitored the airspace is. If dragons are few in numbers and not widely acknowledged, dragons would possibly end up chained to the ground or close to it due to fear of being mistaken for an unidentified fighter jet. The only real possibility of a free life for them would be somewhere near the arctic circle, away from civilization. If I had to make the choice, I would pack a warm coat and be ready to re-adapt to the wilderness."
httyd,3a9kb8,Xureality,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"So true, and that's so important that a dragon maintain its free-will. Otherwise, bad people like Drago could have unwavering support from a dragon. I want my friend-dragon to have a conscience and morality, just as I have.     You think the Arctic would be your first choice? I thought about that, and it just seems like it'd be SO cold. It makes sense why the Vikings were so hairy; they have to stay as warm as possible! Have you ever rolled down the window in a car during winter to feel that ice-cold breeze against your face? Don't know how long I could stay riding in a place with a harsh breeze like that. However, if the dragon preferred arctic fish, then I would get used to the arctic :-D"

Early in the second film Hiccup mentions he never knew his mother, and wouldn't ya know it, we meet her in the second half.   Pretty sure they're setting up to introduce some Night Furies."

The only downside is... that you need to make it yourself (sewing).  But don't be afraid, as I learned, it is quite easy to do so, im a boy, I had never ever touched a needle in my life, and after 3 week of watching tutorial on youtube in my free time, I now have 2 pinguins, and I am working on making toothless !!

A few weeks ago I asked a guy about one he made, and he wanted $400 minimum. Not so reasonable for me :)  It was yesterday, actually, that I was in the mall and passed by a Build-a-Bear. Saw Toothless sitting on a shelf at the end of the store and almost peed myself. Everyone has been saying they are all out of stock, but this particular store had two or three left. $25 was pretty reasonable to me! You may go to your local one and ask if they have any left, or if you could buy one of the extras that they already stuffed for display purposes."

Jay probably wouldn't want to be distracted from MSW and Goon 2 business.   Bear in mind though, my conjecture is based on the limited information, so in the end I might be wrong on all accounts.

You are given someone's reddit username, you check out their post history, see what they like, and mail them a gift.  Taken from the redditgifts website:   Participating is easy. It only takes a few minutes to sign up and create a profile. Once you do, you wait until matching day, when we run a big program that matches each person to someone else in a giant daisy chain. You’ll be given a person’s username, and you can stalk that person (in a friendly way) to find the perfect gift for them and mail it off. Someone else will be doing the same for you, and when you get it, you can post photos of your awesome gift online so we can all celebrate together."

Another would be Becoming Lífþrasir (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10049374/1/Becoming-L%C3%ADf%C3%BErasir)  Probably one of the best 'Hiccup leaves Berk' stories (Midoriko-sama is, IMO, the best author in the fandom).

I finished and it is well written but it goes to fanatical extremes like ""Standing Against, Standing Between.""  On another note, I would encourage you to try again on ""Becoming Lífþrasir."" I of course don't know you and your likings, but I found it to be very enjoyable with a well incorporated sense of humor and very interesting plot changes. It also has two more entire sequels to it (the last in progress and is the final). I find the first two to be great but I don't know what to think of the third.

httyd,36bnjs,assassinii,2,Mon May 18 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to without giving it away but basically, it starts with Hiccup getting Toothless per the movie and everything but before he has to kill the Nightmare, he leaves in a rather unique manner. He eventually finds a new life elsewhere and goes through a lot of self and outward development with Toothless and others. He eventually makes his way back to Berk for a new reason that no Fanfic has used yet. It is absolutely awesome and you have to read it to really get how awesome it is. It is also still in progress to where he has literally just gotten back to Berk and then end of chapter. It also has some HiccStrid with a major and interesting twist. I would say the character development is great too. Hopefully I have explained enough without saying too much.  A good fic that this thread reminds me of is ""Prodigial Son"" (sorry no link, on mobile). I don't have time to give a description of it but it is great too."
httyd,36bnjs,Buhnanuers,1 point,Mon May 18 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"Problem is that there is really not much of an interaction between Hiccup and Toothless, thus it wouldn't really fit with the category OP was asking for here. (though great story, yeah ;)  )"

It's based around a cliche, but I think it's the best fic I've read so far. After Hiccup shoots down Toothless in the first film, he gets turned into a dragon. I don't want to spoil it too much.  I've read Hitchups, Good Thing You're Already Dead and To Be God Touched, but I don't think any of them come quite close to this one.  I'm currently trying to get into Becoming Lífþrasir, but I'm not a huge fan of how the story skips forward five years just as it gets interesting."

httyd,35wmic,Lament488,10,Thu May 14 03:03:56 2015 UTC,I think Valka said in the movie that she hasn't seen another Night Fury up close before Toothless. Maybe other dragons classes have the same thing and Valka just recognized a pattern on Toothless?

httyd,35wmic,FantasticMrPanda,6,Mon May 18 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"It definitely would be interesting to have more backstory on the Night Fury species in the next film. The way they set this up in the second film (""Maybe we'll even find other night furies?""), I'm pretty certain that it will at least be an important plot point whether Toothless really is the last one. But as far as we know, even Valka isn't sure about that.  I do think it's an interesting theory. It's definitely plausible that Valka knows more than she has told Hiccup so far, because they didn't exactly have much time to talk in the second film. And like you said, the hidden spines thing does suggest she knows more, so I'm wondering if it has further significance."
httyd,35wmic,brasmussen89,1 point,Thu May 14 14:59:25 2015 UTC,I've heard that Drago may also be in the 3rd movie. If the plot is similar to this maybe Valka and Hiccup have to race to find the night fury's before Drago does since he's now seen how powerful toothless is.
httyd,35v7tl,geigenmusikant,3,Wed May 13 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"I can understand it in longer story arcs where there is a great difference in knowledge power and life situation and also quite a few character deaths as these people generally don't know anything that happens later.  It's the ""ultimate"" form of timetravel as you experience the reactions of the timetraveler without them changing  anything (usually) and can be quite a characterstudy.    I myself read quite a bit of the same fics in the harry potter fandom which is very well suited for it. And the most exiting ones were where it really focused on the characters."

httyd,35gnyw,moonexe,3,Sun May 10 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"It sort of imitates Hiccup ""breathing"" fire, which causes the dragons to see him as one of their own. Intimidating human opponents is probably more of a side effect."

Set a good while after the events of HTTYD 2, when you, the main character/chosen one/whatever, have just come of age and finally get to chose/find your dragon companion (aka pick your class). Through out the game you could you level up your dragon increasing your speed, health, stamina, strength, shoot count, ect. Also you could get other dragon riders to join your party and you could level them up as you see fit. All in a world filled with different islands with various loot, quest, enemies and of course dragons to discover."

httyd,350bhl,Auhsoj100,2,Wed May 6 01:50:16 2015 UTC,I would love a combination of player/dragon leveling system and evolutions.

httyd,350bhl,RoidedWheat,1 point,Wed May 6 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say more along the pokemon lines as far as the training and evolutions. But also having customizable player stats such as War Thunders pilot levels like G-force resistance, sight, etc."
httyd,350bhl,phoenix4037,2,Wed May 6 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"My ideas would probably be similar to others, i.e. massive open-world, action-adventure, lore-friendly quests, etc, though I'd rather play as Hiccup/Toothless. And it sure as hell wouldn't be like School of Dragons (pay money to get Toothless?! Sacrilege!).  What about Hiccup himself, though? We clearly like the idea of flying Toothless/Hiccup, or at least 'you and your dragon' and utilising combat around that, but Hiccup is now apparently somewhat skilled in CQC and is quite fit (or at least, more so in HTTYD2 than the original) anyway. Does anyone think he/'your character' could play a role in 'grounded' sequences, or would that split up the gameplay too much?  Edit: player characters"

httyd,350bhl,UserCaleb,2,Wed May 6 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"This is something I thought about a lot, and I would like to have a game from the perspective of hte bad guy from httyd 2.  Like you have a tutorial level where you're a young boy and your town or city is attacked by dragons, you lose your arm.  Then it becomes an open world kinda thing, with you basically trying to become strong and skilled enough to take down a weak dragon. When you take down a dragon you could have it as a companion and basically try to build up an army. I'd have maybe 1-2 dragons max as companions at any one time, the rest would be in a barn/stable/base that you have to complete a mission for. The main quest would be you getting stronger and stronger dragons and getting stronger skills and abilities until you finally attack and defeat the alpha as possibly the final mission. One large battle playing as the alpha would be pretty cool though.   Putting resources into armour and barracks and ships for your armies and dragons would be some cool management aspects but i think the main game would have to focus on you as a warrior, and then playing as dragons when you defeat them.   I was always intrigued by how exactly he managed to defeat and enslave the alpha so this would be super cool to see happen through a game!"
httyd,350bhl,geigenmusikant,2,Wed May 6 11:54:54 2015 UTC,"I would like an mmo, where you are born on Berk and you choose a dragon and try to discover the world"
httyd,350bhl,LaggyToast,2,Wed May 6 13:35:28 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool so long as there was some sort of story or missions for you to do. As well as a huge map you can explore possibly similar to AC Black Flag :)
httyd,350bhl,Berk_Obama,2,Wed May 6 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Here is my idea for what the game should be.  It would a be a MMO, and some may ask why? Well this world is now set where, the people of berk are all getting Dragons of their own. So why not tell the story of how new vikings want to become Dragon Riders too. It would be about the journey of either taming or raising a dragon. Yet as you achieved great things with your first dragon, you will be able to unlock more rare and unique dragons. With their own unique skills and abilities. The goal would be to raise your dragon to maturity map, out new lands/islands, and find new dragons. The protagonist of the whole game would be about Draeger's revenge on berk, so his followers, and him would be constantly trying to invade Berk, and it's surrounding islands. This game would be a more action combat based, you the rider fighting with all sorts of viking weaponry. Then utilizing your dragon with it's break attacks, and physical attacks based on the Dragon. Plus if this game had the customization of say like Black Desert, or one of the new MMOs with the insane ability of customization, we could finally have characters that don't all look the same.  Features it would have.    In Depth Viking Customization (Make your viking the size of Stoick, or small as the Twins) Amazing Graphics Engine that would put any Korean MMO to shame. Vibrant landscapes to explore (On foot, or in the air) Wild Dragons (You have to fight off, and or tame) Unique Player Housing (Stables, Farm, House, and Maybe own an entire Island for yourself) Customizable Dragons (Want a different horn variant for your Monstrous Nightmare? Of Course the Coloration) Action Combat (No skills, just combination attacks, blocking, parrying, and of course Dragon Fire) No Levels (Player Progression Based, Discovery is a key part) Enormous Open World Map (Flying around the world till your hearts content) The Ocean (Plays a key part, vast and spans the whole world, what creatures or dragons await under the waves) MMO Survival (I think this would be a great aspect, having to feed yourself, and your dragon(s) surviving the wilds together)   These are just some ideas, I personally would love to see in a game for HTTYD."

httyd,34zl4n,Rogue_Teapot,4,Tue May 5 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"I have the game that goes with the second movie for PS3.  It can be entertaining for about a hour and there is a two player option.  Honestly though, I haven't picked it up since I first got it.  It is super repetitive.  You go from perch to perch to complete challenges, but there are only about 5 challenges and they just keep going in order.  It is cool to openly explore the island, but again, the entertainment factor only lasts so long.  Cute otherwise. If you can find it for under $10 it'll kill an evening."
httyd,34zl4n,SissySicilian,2,Tue May 5 22:28:14 2015 UTC,"Movie tie-in games are almost always terrible. The HTTYD games are no exception. They get repetitive QUICK, ugly graphics, bad gameplay.   Of course, it's all subjective. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Personally, even being a huge fan of the movies, I found no redeeming qualities in the game.

httyd,34zl4n,ObviousTryHard,1 point,Tue May 5 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"Well, most of the developer studios that create the games are low budget ones, not as AAA-rated as Activision, Sony Entertainment, and even Naughty Dog.

I will say this though. I have a feeling that HTTYD3 is going to end up as an emotionally draining experience (in a good storytelling way) and the ending is going to be one of the most, if not THE most, heart-wrenching moments in animated film history.  This may drive audiences away because it is ""too dark"" (HTTYD2 suffered from that as well unfortunately) but I, for one, am very much looking forward to seeing how it plays out."

httyd,33j9qe,rolf124,5,Wed Apr 22 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"Now that all Berk-ians understand the ""secret of dragon-taming"", can any dragon potentially be tamed? Are all dragons, by-proxy, not considered dangerous wild animals in the new ""dragon-friendly"" era?  Yes, I know that it's a kids franchise. but I've gotten through the second episode of the first season of the show and already they've seriously considered (and even followed through with) throwing away their actual pointy and slashy weapons that they have used for generations.   In theory, yes. Even animals that we think of as ""untrainable"" and ""dangerous,"" like snakes, can often be trained in real life. Example: http://www.anapsid.org/tamingvh.html  Dragons also seem to be social and very intelligent, which makes them easier to train. Most dragon species are probably comparable to the most-intelligent dog breeds or a bit smarter (and Toothless blows even animals like crows and chimpanzees out of the water). They ought to be much, much easier to train when raised around humans.  However, ANY animal species, including domesticated ones, can be dangerous, especially when frightened or injured. And because of the size of most dragon species, what could be an annoyed ""go away"" kick to another dragon could be fatal to a human.  As for the weapons, they'll still be needed, but now that Berk is, for the first time in 300 years, not effectively at war, they need far fewer. Plus they'll probably shift from effective anti-dragon weapons to ones that are more effective against other humans, which are now the primary threat.  Apparently, this also meant that Gobber ended up being rather bored, although even in a peaceful society there's plenty of work for a blacksmith. One thing I'd have liked to see addressed in the second movie or the show, incidentally, was the issue of Hiccup's being divided between his work as a smith, his work running the Dragon Academy, and eventually his duties as chief. Eventually, Gobber will probably take on a new apprentice.   Do we know around what time in history (assuming that this is a world that is intended to represent earth) that this series takes place?  In the book, it seems like HTTYD is supposed to take place around the time of the Roman Empire's dominance over Europe.  But the movie franchise's aesthetics (clothes and technology) seem to suggest a later medieval setting.   The books are most likely Early Medieval, around the time when actual Vikings were around. This is a few centuries after the fall of Rome in our world, so it seems that the Roman Empire never broke up.  I agree that the movies are probably later medieval, perhaps even Early Rennaissance. However, this means that either the Christianization of Scandinavia never happened, or it never got as far as Berk and the surrounding islands.   What are the Riders of Berk to Berk's overall society, exactly?  Okay, hear me out. I'm just confused. Are they seen more like Boy Scouts/do-gooders or do they have some sort of formal standing in the clan itself?  Do the adults (who were previously the warriors/breadwinners and are now supplanted by a vastly superior set of living-weapons and their riders) take a backseat on a political level?   Honestly, I don't think Berk's overall society knows what the Dragon Academy's place is. Eventually yeah, warriors will probably end up having lower standing, but it takes time for culture to shift that dramatically. During the time of the show, I'd say they're the closest thing to a scientific research group in a tribal society. They're learning more about dragons, taking care of dragons, and figuring out new, dragon-based military tactics. I'm not sure they have formal standing, but they're certainly very respected due to their actions."

httyd,33j9qe,Deitatem,2,Thu Apr 23 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"Now that all Berk-ians understand the ""secret of dragon-taming"", can any dragon potentially be tamed? Are all dragons, by-proxy, not considered dangerous wild animals in the new ""dragon-friendly"" era?   I would argue that it is possible to train any species of dragon, however, some dragons are also not tamable. For every tame dragon there are probably an equal or greater amount who are not tame. This also depends on what your definition of tame is. Many dragons live on Berk, especially after the second movie, but a minority of them have riders or 'owners'. Do you consider a tame dragon one that has a rider or one who merely lives with humans peacefully.   Do we know around what time in history (assuming that this is a world that is intended to represent earth) that this series takes place?   Anywhere between 800 and 1100 CE. Any advanced technological inventions are attributed solely to Hiccup, as the rest of Berk appears largely uneducated in math, science, and writing. Technically the middle ages were from 500 to 1500 CE, which the time period of HTTYD falls into.   What are the Riders of Berk to Berk's overall society, exactly?   We can see that there is a large interest in the sport of dragon racing, however very few people are actually participants. This, combined with the fact that dragon riders are the most knowledgeable about their island's new inhabitants, suggests that they would have had a position of respect within the community, comparable to say, a village elder, due to their knowledge. It's likely that the warrior caste meant little in Berk society, as every man and woman was technically a warrior prior to the end of the dragon war, since everyone took up arms to defend their home. Families who were traditionally warrior-only, were probably very wealthy and involved in either business or tribal politics and had no need to rely on their status as warriors to survive.  After the dragon wars, the warrior caste likely shrinked until it was considered a secondary profession. Other professions, such as fishermen, farmers, and carpenters, would be in high demand, while traditional war time professions such as warriors and smiths would become less popular.  Just my thoughts on the matter. I think a slightly more adult-oriented HTTYD would be awesome."
httyd,337apm,rolf124,8,Mon Apr 20 05:01:15 2015 UTC,"True diehards of the franchise will generally reference the movies and the tv show/specials.  As far as canon goes, you should consider the TV show and Movies canon (at least in the movie's universe), as nothing else has been said to contradict it.  The books and movie exist independently of each other. If you watch the movies and then go to read the books, you'll find a radically different universe in both. This is where it gets kinda tricky, as far as canon. The books and movies are both canon, as in, they convey a similar message, but through a radically different process. Imagine a traintrack: A single line splits into two, both running parallel to each other, then, farther down the line, they (may) join back together again. Think of one track on the parallel as the books universe, and the other the movie's universe.   At least, that's how I like (want) to envision it.  As far as the books being related canonically to the movies: No, the books are separate stories.  Hopefully that wasn't too confusing."
httyd,337apm,Buhnanuers,2,Mon Apr 20 05:17:30 2015 UTC,Not confusing at all.   I guess there aren't any shortcuts to knowing the series.  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
httyd,337apm,HotDealsInTexas,2,Mon Apr 20 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"Awwright. Basically:  The books and movies take place in two separate universes, and often usually directly contradict each other.  E.G. In the books, Toothless is about half the size of a Terrible Terror, actually has no teeth, and behaves like spoiled two-year-old. Fishlegs is Hiccup's only friend on Berk, and is, like Hiccup, a scrawny kid (who happens to be a Berserker). Berk is pretty flat and boggy compared to its mountainous appearance in the films. Snotlout and Hiccup are sworn enemies, and Snotlout is actually competent at almost everything. Some people have headcanons for the movie 'verse based on the books (e.g. the Roman Empire is still around, or humans can learn to speak the dragon language).  The TV show and specials might be canon for the movie 'verse, but my rule of thumb is to treat spinoffs of any fictional work as a second, possibly overlapping canon. The writers seem to have taken this route as well: the show and movies are mostly consistent with one another, but HTTYD2 doesn't directly reference the show in any way (although it might explain a few things slightly better)."
httyd,337apm,werewulfking,2,Mon Apr 20 06:48:43 2015 UTC,What is also important is that of course the movies take precendence over the series and that apparently the writers of the series don't necessarly check for any evidence for their rules they try to establish in the show.   Its like that case where they wrote in thornado for stoick only to be told that they have to write it out again. Or like the shot limit for toothless which is 10 in the show but doesn't seem to exist for the movies.

httyd,331jep,eg-er-ekki-islensku,5,Sat Apr 18 22:04:43 2015 UTC,My two year old brother and I (16m) wanted to watch a movie but we've already watched all the Pixar/Disney movies so we rented Httyd about a month ago while I was babysitting him...then we both loved it. Now he I own a plush toothless and stormfly and blurays of both movies.
httyd,331jep,skyflyer747,4,Sat Apr 18 17:19:20 2015 UTC,Made the incredible mistake of going to see the first movie when it came out in 2010. Only really got into the fandom around the time HTTYD 2 came out though. Now I have all you bastards to thank for making me a Fanfiction addict.
httyd,331jep,Buhnanuers,3,Sat Apr 18 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"friend of mine waxed lyrical about it for a while, telling me i'd love it. couple of years later it was on iplayer at christmas so i watched it, was nearly in tears, so watched it again immediately after.  then went to bed, and watched it first thing the next morning... screw you O, you ruined me"
httyd,331jep,uisge-beatha,3,Sat Apr 18 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"I don't remember when it was, but I saw the first one on a plane on a little screen on the back of the seat in front of me.  I enjoyed it, so when the first season of the tv show started some years later, I started watching that and I became a fan because it was interesting stuff."
httyd,331jep,neonrideraryeh,2,Sat Apr 18 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"I also saw it on the airplane seat back screen. That's how I see most movies, actually. If I try watching one at home, I stop twenty minutes in because of all the other things I could be doing. Why passively watch a movie when I could actively screw around on reddit?"
httyd,331jep,Skyblacker,2,Sat Apr 18 23:32:20 2015 UTC,I was previously subscribed to TMN on demand and httyd was playing. Every time it came on I'd watching again and again.
httyd,331jep,danyeluh,2,Sat Apr 18 17:40:53 2015 UTC,I wanted to watch a few animated movies last year and just went through the whole Dreamworks Inventory I hadn't seen. I discovered Megamind and HTTYD which I both loved very much.
httyd,331jep,werewulfking,2,Sat Apr 18 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"I was skipping throw the TV and HTTYD1 started, so I watched it. And there it all started :D"
httyd,331jep,DominikTVDE,2,Sat Apr 18 19:07:36 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing an advert for HTTYD1 in the paper, went to see if it the cinema with a friend, now I re-watch it every 2 months, followed directly by HTTYD 2. I have a Toothless plushie for my bed too. I have it as my PC desktop background (http://i.imgur.com/k2rrDcM.jpg) As soon as the posters for HTTYD3 are out, i'm sure i'll get one of those. I have seen Season 1 and 2 of Dragons. I think it's safe to say, I am addicted."
httyd,331jep,L0rdLogan,2,Sat Apr 18 21:54:51 2015 UTC,":o These are all more interesting revelations of finding our beloved lord and saviour Toothy than I thought.  Alrighty, I guess I owe more detail. One kind of nice day as a student, I saw an imgur post 'bout HTTYD movie-facts, and I thought I'd finally check it out 'cus of some of my new-found naughty powers. I did the thing and had HTTYD ready to watch, one day there was a training day at school (last year before college), but there was still one lesson on, I figured that it'd be as good of a time as any to watch it, previously I opened it up and watched a random half a minute or two, just jumping from one point to another for like, 10 seconds of total random-movie bits and it all looked decent, didn't spoil anything at all though. After that day was done, I obtained food then returned to an excited shower and got into bed. It was around 2/3pm but I didn't exactly have to get up again so smeh. I watched it, ate noms, cried and couldn't believe how lucky I was to have been able to watch it. After that I watched season 1 & 2 of the series and watched a pre-screening for HTTYD2 in IMAX, first time in IMAX too - again, absolutely amazing, soooo much better than I was expecting, I was hyped for months for the trailers but I didn't think it'd be THAT good. Soon after HTTYD2 I started reading the books, they're pretty damn funny, not read them all yet, and I ain't rushing because there's only so much book and there's still quite a lot of time left.  No regrets. I've watched HTTYD1 4-5 times and HTTYD2 3 times, of which 1 of them was at the cinema. I watch them whenever I have a really really good day, or something big happens (or is about to happen_ that is pretty cool too.  Time to find some fanfic, I guess. Apparently they are actually pretty decent! :o"

httyd,331jep,Mithent,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"I had meant to go to see Avatar with my family when both it and 3D were a craze, because they hadn't seen it and it had still been in cinemas up until the previous week. Unfortunately, we were a few days too late, as it had finally ended its run that week at our cinema.  I saw HTTYD was on; the word ""dragon"" attracted my attention, as it always does (what can I say), but the rest of the title looked rather juvenile, and I wasn't sure about it. The reviews seemed good, though, so I decided we would go and see that in 3D anyway (although only my mother actually accompanied me).  It was a lot better than I expected. I saw it again with my partner, then we went to the IMAX to watch it too, I dragged a friend to another showing, and I went a couple more times by myself. And I've been hovering around the fandom ever since."

Basically, how he is in the TV show. Good relationship with Toothless, very, VERY Hiccstrid. Unusually, the story doesn't focus all that much on Stoick, but from what I remember (it's been a while), there is some development between him and Hiccup.  In short, Hiccup, Toothless, and Astrid get themselves knee deep in a foreign fight involving talking dragons, a completely apathetic necromancer, and really advanced ancient technology.   Sounds strange, but believe me, it's hands down one of THE BEST fics in the fandom. You'd be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring this masterpiece.

Rather than being an average joe who became a hero like in the movie, Hiccup's the ""chosen one,"" hand-selected by the Gods themselves. Not to mention the fact that Toothless and the dragons are treated as animals in the movie, not magical beings, so Toothless talking really threw me off.   Normally I wouldn't care; it's fanfiction, so it's okay to go off the grid if you want, but the author (AvannaK) is such a snob when it comes to canon and characterization, I can't help but feel it's a bit hypocritical."

httyd,32o8c9,Angelin01,2,Thu Apr 16 17:46:50 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll be finishing all 100 hopefully sometime :)
httyd,32o8c9,Angelin01,2,Thu Apr 16 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"If you can, after you finish the 100, try writing something a bit longer, a small story, subplot maybe?. It's fine if it's Hiccup Astrid related, helps balance out the Hiccstrid hate that has been going around recently."
httyd,32nzba,DominikTVDE,2,Wed Apr 15 08:58:16 2015 UTC,"Since it's also coming out on June 26 in the U.S. and Australia, I presume the date is global. Because I doubt Netflix would region-block its own original content."
httyd,32nzba,Skyblacker,2,Wed Apr 15 12:53:46 2015 UTC,I have a friend in Germany who you'd think would be happy to hear this. But only if they have the option to switch the audio to English. He understands English perfectly fine and wants to hear the original voices. I hope they allow you switch between audio tracks.
httyd,32nzba,DragonBassist,2,Wed Apr 15 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"For the previous seasons they didn't hire most of the original cast from the movies (money?), so watching the ""low-quality"" actors perform was way more unpleasant than watching it in English all together. (don't want to make any hard-working voice actors feel down though, it's a tough job)  EDIT: Watching it in English was fun, not unpleasant! Just so you know ;)"
httyd,32j9dx,Buhnanuers,5,Tue Apr 14 06:04:51 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of both, i'd give it a try. It would be interesting to see a sci-fi universe and a fantasy world brought up together. Master Chief riding dragons, machine guns mounted on dragons... Not bad."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,5,Tue Apr 14 07:45:28 2015 UTC,You should check out some of the Halo/Inheritance Cycle fics.  Spartans on dragons is absolutely confirmed.  There is a couple stories of genuine quality there if you are interested!  https://www.fanfiction.net/Halo-and-Inheritance-Cycle-Crossovers/1342/1992/?&srt=4&r=10
httyd,32j9dx,geesemaster,5,Tue Apr 14 08:02:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the nuclear fusion of the dragon knight and the inclined plane sword were a true masterpiece. I liked how Paolini introduced physical concepts to explain magic."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,3,Tue Apr 14 09:11:35 2015 UTC,who's the author?
httyd,32j9dx,CDXXblazeit,3,Wed Apr 15 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"Christopher Paolini, the inheritance cycle."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,2,Wed Apr 15 06:43:16 2015 UTC,wait what?
httyd,32j9dx,mr_abomination,2,Wed Apr 15 01:41:38 2015 UTC,"The island of the dragon knights, it's said in one of the books that one knight magically created an explosion destroying the island and leaving the lifeforms on it mutated, it probably isn't REALLY an atomic fusion of his body, but the magnitude of the event and the effects are those of an h bomb. The inclined plane sword it's that of the magical cat woman, which is said can cut almost everything. Ideally the perfect inclined plane could cut at molecular levels."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,3,Wed Apr 15 06:42:33 2015 UTC,Is that from the original books? I don't really remember that...
httyd,32j9dx,mr_abomination,3,Wed Apr 15 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's clearly stated that the knight achieved that by using magic, but as i said it's pretty clear that that's the idea. The sword it's trickier, as it's said that can cut through anything and that the blade it's almost invisible. I believe that the blade it's made of diamond, but diamond can't cut anything if it isn't in the form of a blade. A blade it's technically an inclined plane and the more the plane it's inclined, the more it can cut. Ideally the ""perfect"" inclined plane/blade could cut at molecular levels, a perfect blade like that made of diamond(the hardest material known) could cut through the steel like butter. However a blade like that it's impossible to obtain, as you should have the cutting part thinner than the cut molecule but there's nothing small as that that wouldn't brake by just weaving it a bit."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,3,Wed Apr 15 14:07:31 2015 UTC,"wow, I really need to re-read the books. I haven't a clue what your referring to."
httyd,32j9dx,mr_abomination,3,Wed Apr 15 14:52:14 2015 UTC,The Knight and the explosion Angela and her blade      Keep in mind that the inclined plane part it's merely my assumption.
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,4,Wed Apr 15 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"Welp, time for a re-read."
httyd,32j9dx,mr_abomination,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, so, I'd like to call to everyone's attention ""When Destiny burns"", one of the stories included on the list that the above link references. I'm only about half-way through it, but, while it isn't necessarily related to HTTYD, it does highlight a good wiriting stile and mechanics.  The author does a tremendously good job of keeping things... believable. The two stories combine in such a way that leaves me thinking ""Yeah, okay, that actualy seems pretty reasonable"", rather than ""Where did the dragon come from and why is the Spartan suddenly killing everyone."" No deus ex machina, which, unfortunately, is pretty prevalent in pretty much every fandoms' fanfictions.  Let this serve as an example of how I desire to write my story. Nothing fantastical. Nothing too 'feel-good'. It will be realistic, believable, and 'woah when did I suddenly start reading Game of Thrones'."
httyd,32j9dx,geesemaster,2,Thu Apr 16 08:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is hands down the best fic on the list there - it isn't finished yet but receives updates every 2 or 3 weeks.  It does get a bit more... chaotic in the later chapters, but the storyline is still on point throughout it.  Always makes my day when a new chapter is added"
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,2,Thu Apr 16 11:05:22 2015 UTC,"Haha, no kidding about the later chapters. Feels like I'm reading First Strike all over again."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,5,Sat Apr 18 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"As entertaining as it'd be to see all of that, I think I'm going to go a different route. I plan on writing with mostly OC characters (on the Halo side), since the vastness of the universe sorta allows it. I don't want to have to worry about writing in the frame-of-mind (no pun intended) of characters from both franchises. Having OC's, in my opinion, makes things much easier; also avoids cliches."
httyd,32j9dx,BasileusBasil,2,Tue Apr 14 08:02:42 2015 UTC,"So something like Miranda Keyes, Doc Halsey and Captain Keyes being a viking clan at berk and the spartans an elitè unit of vikings? Probably they should be named berserker then :/"
httyd,32j9dx,rultes,2,Tue Apr 14 09:13:59 2015 UTC,"Do-ho-ho, I'm not gonna lie, the thought did cross my mind. Maybe for a future gag-story... ;)"
httyd,32j9dx,Stoick_the_Vast,2,Tue Apr 14 09:25:34 2015 UTC,"That'd be really interesting, Halsey being all proud of John and neglecting Miranda. What kind of dragon do you think 117 would ride?"

httyd,32j9dx,geesemaster,2,Tue Apr 14 17:24:20 2015 UTC,My bet it's on a Thunderclaw.
httyd,32j9dx,geesemaster,4,Tue Apr 14 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"There certainly will be no shame if you will try. If anything, I think the fandom ought to be more active."
httyd,32j9dx,V2Blast,2,Tue Apr 14 10:41:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I've gotten more than enough feedback to seriously be willing to give it a shot. However, I am going to college full time, so actually writing the damned thing might take a while..."
httyd,32j9dx,Toofluffles,5,Tue Apr 14 17:59:44 2015 UTC,I could see Hiccup geeking the hell out over all the science tech and inventions of the Halo universe. And Master Chief riding a dragon would be pretty badass.

httyd,32gikm,geesemaster,8,Tue Apr 14 07:18:02 2015 UTC,"I just noticed the Star Trek reference in the description of the YouTube video...   Hiccup and Toothless are back in an all-new action packed series DreamWorks Dragons: Race to the Edge. Their quest: to explore strange new worlds, seek out never-before-seen dragons and end the war between Vikings and dragons once and for all. All episodes arrive only on Netflix, June 26.   Let's hope this one's better than the previous ones. Season 1 (Dragons: Riders of Berk) was super-mediocre. Season 2 (Dragons: Defenders of Berk) was slightly better in that it had more of a serialized story.  I suppose the fact that this is on Netflix instead of Cartoon Network might mean it's targeted at a slightly older audience - I don't mean like it'll become gory or anything, just hopefully a more complex and serialized story. And most importantly, it'd be nice if they actually acknowledged Hiccup and Astrid's relationship..."

httyd,32gikm,tealcandtrip,8,Tue Apr 14 10:42:06 2015 UTC,It's interesting to seehow they are evolving the character models each season.  Hiccup looks very similar to HTTYD2 but Astrid is a nice mix of her two phases.

httyd,32gikm,MigMigg,6,Tue Apr 14 04:54:38 2015 UTC,I think the island is shaped like a dragon- roughly.

httyd,32f6a5,Buhnanuers,7,Mon Apr 13 08:12:54 2015 UTC,"No point discussing imo, given lots of anachronisms and inaccuracies in the stories to place them within a RL timeframe: horned helmets on Vikings? Bagpipe music?  Got me thinking though: with their dragons simultaneously providing clean sustainable fuel (hotburple forges, monstrous nightmare saliva, zippelback gas, etc... all from fish), long-range transport, and unmatched military utility, Berk would get a huge head-start on industrialization and colonization. GJ Hiccup"
httyd,32f6a5,Cordapio,10,Mon Apr 13 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"Even before they domesticated dragons, Berk was highly affluent for a medieval society. The fact that most of those Vikings can make it to middle age if they can survive battle is telling; no one seems to die of illness or starvation, and there's so much food that some of the Vikings can even become fat.   Also, the predominance of sophisticated prosthesis shows 1) Berk can devote precious materials to the disabled (not something you often see in olden times, or even poorer countries today), and 2) An unusually high percentage of patients are surviving major surgery. A real Viking with Gobber's injuries would have more likely died from blood loss or infection.   In addition, the fact that Hiccup can spend all day tinkering in the smithy, and even Snoutlout can try his hand at invention, shows a modern excess of leisure time. In real life, any time not spent in battle would be spent coaxing food from the land or doing enough house chores to keep everyone clothed and warm.   I'm not saying Berk is modern, but they're at least as affluent as, say, colonial America in the 1700's (which had low technology but far more food and resources per capita than Europe).   EDIT: Or maybe the franchise was simply dreamed up by people more likely to attend a maker's fair than crack open a history book?"
httyd,32f6a5,Skyblacker,2,Mon Apr 13 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"Vikings were around from ~800 - 1100 AD. However, as the story is very much AU to begin with, you are free to imagine it in whichever time period you would like. Why not 2015?  Perhaps the books have more details."
httyd,32f6a5,SonicSNES,2,Mon Apr 13 08:53:30 2015 UTC,"Berk it's not our world, there's no way to say in what real life era it takes place. It's like asking in which era asoiaf, the cycle of earthsea or other fantasys take place. A huge different thing would be asking it for lovecraftian myths, the histories of conan the barbarian or the lord of the rings."
httyd,32f6a5,BasileusBasil,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:58:04 2015 UTC,"The olympics shorts (seen here for example) say 1010, so canon or not, that's what I go with."
httyd,32f6a5,rozniak,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Historically speaking, HTTYD could take place in roughly two time periods.   The first guess would be around 50 CE. This guess is due to the depiction of their clothes and gear as well as the mentioning of the Romans.   Horned helmets, while generally believed as Hollywood's mistake, were actually a thing; however, they were mainly ceremonial and were of fashion around the first century AD. One of the earliest horned helmets that people have found is the Waterloo Helmet, which was found in the Thames. This helmet dates to about 50 BCE.   And the Roman Empire invaded Britain in 55 CE, so that would be about the same time that the Scandinavian people would have heard of them.   However, the characters in HTTYD refer to themselves as Vikings. A term that only came into use after the sack of Lindisfarne, a monastery in Britain, in 793 CE. Which would set HTTYD in at least the eighth century.   but this mistake can be accounted for when we view how the books are written.   The books are written as a story of past events, so this would account for the inconsistencies of using eighth century vernacular in association with first century setting and description.   Because HTTYD is the translated book the Cressida Cowell found, we cannot be absolutely sure who wrote it. The author of HTTYD may not be Hiccup Haddock Horrendous III, as often attributed by Cressida Cowell, but much more likely is Sæmundur Sigfússon. An Icelandic scholar who wrote down the myths and history of the Scandinavian people who preceded him in 1100 CE.   So HTTYD is set in the first century, but the story was written in the twelfth century, and finally translated in the twenty first.   But then again, that is just my theory for when it is set, if I had to choose a date. Much more likely, the story is based entirely on the wonderful imagination of a young girl.   Tl;dr: HTTYD is written by Sæmundur Sigfússon (1100 CE), who is telling the story of the mythological fall of dragons."
httyd,32f6a5,Shireling,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"At a minimum it's 800 AD or so as other users have said.  One thing to note is that, as far as I know, there is no mention of Christianity in either the books or the movies, and very obviously the various viking tribes shown still practice the Norse religion.  Also, in the books, the Roman empire still exists in some form - but in our world there was a gap of several centuries between the fall of Rome and the beginning of Viking raids on the British Isles. Also, IIRC various references suggest that the ancient Roman religion is still around in some form.  One possible conclusion is that in the Dragons!Verse, the Roman Empire never broke up, and the Christianization of Scandinavia never happened. In fact, Christianity may not exist at all (so in-universe various cultures all have the zero points of their calendars at different dates - perhaps Berk's is the year the first settlers landed on the island).  In theory we could get a later boundary from technology, but in practice technology is inconsistent with our world. For example, we see primitive telescopes in the series (invented by Hiccup - IRL these were invented around 1600) but no gunpowder, which was around by the 1300s. Gunpowder, incidentally, would make far more effective anti-dragon weapons - imagine using grapeshot against a dragon's wings - so if Berk had the technology you'd expect they'd use it."
httyd,32f6a5,HotDealsInTexas,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"The Viking age started at the sack of Lindisfarne in the 8th century. Since Berk was founded 300 years ago (according to Hiccup) that would put them in the early 11th century. On Hiccup's map it mentions the Roman Empire. This could infer to the Holy Roman Empire which was founded around the same time as the Viking Age. The innovation of the HTTYD vikings could be brought about by trade and a lot of times by necessity. Vikings were technologically advanced with ships and exploration, and add in dragons, it's only logical that they would have an advantage with technological advancement in other areas."

That said, I have no ideas for such a story. If you do, please PM me. Throw enough at me and I might be able to generate something. Maybe Hiccup and Fishlegs were chummy as outcasts until Hiccup got a girlfriend and defeated the Red Death?

It is a somewhat unique take on the HTTYD universe that includes mythology and magic, mixing in a bit of elements from LOTR, Star Wars, and Inheritance.

May result in tears and/or warm and fuzzy feeling. Summary (spoilered): Toothless blames himself for losing Hiccup's helmet, and when Hiccup gives him the automatic tailfin he misinterprets it as Hiccup not wanting to fly with him anymore. So, he tries to redeem himself by finding the helmet."
httyd,31rojs,Shireling,2,Wed Apr 8 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"Have you read anything/everything by Queen Aurora? Return of the Dragon Rider (done) and Tales of Hiccup and Wrenlou (still being updated) are extremely good. She is also doing a sequel to Return. She also has a bunch of smaller stories that are great.  I'm pretty sure you have already found this but read Becoming Lífþrasir if you have not. Then there is also it's sequel, Winter in Líf's Holt. These two are absolutely superb as well. (Both by Midoriko-sama)  There is also For the Dreaming by Apatt. A shorter deal but a nice meaningful thing including Toothless' perspective.  Another one that I literally just found right now and therefore have not read at all yet is Nightfall by Le'letha. According to the notes at the beginning, it diverges from the original story a decent bit but going by the likes and what I can tell, it is done extremely well. It is also a longer one. It certainly has a VERY intriguing story idea."

I've read everything she's (at least I think it's a she) written and eagerly await updates to Meeting at Iðavöllr.  I've read Nightfall as well, but didn't really like it as much. I know it presents a pretty decent theme, but I WANT EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING STORIES, DAMNIT, NOT MORALLY SATISFYING STORIES."
httyd,31rojs,madkidk,2,Tue Apr 7 21:06:16 2015 UTC,"May I be the narcissistic author for a moment and second the suggestion of ""For the dreaming""  I think it's pretty emotionally satisfying. The basic plot is Toothless tries to find out why Hiccup is depressed starting at about the middle of the first film. Toothless investigates Hiccup's childhood and just generally is possessive of Hiccup.   It's worth a read in my 'completely unbiased opinion.'  Edit: also, ""Becoming The Enemy"" is pretty good."

httyd,31rojs,Angelin01,2,Mon Apr 13 07:47:49 2015 UTC,"Dragon's Hero - A 7-year-old Hiccup finds an even younger Toothless. Has been out there for about half a year already, haven't seen anybody suggesting it though.  Big Brother - Set during the first movie, Hiccup has to struggle through life while bonding with a certain Night Fury AND taking care of his younger brother. Usually stories that just add more family members don't really grab my attention, but this one feels so lively and fresh. I highly suggest reading at least the first half chapter, that'll give you an idea what tone the story is going for.  Prodigal Son - Has this one been suggested yet? I'm terribly sorry if that's the case, but if not, here's a story about a smart smart Hiccup living in Alexandria while certain people in Berk start figuring out what happened to their heir. The beginning was a little underwhelming to me, but as the story goes on you realize that the whole thing was actually very well thought through. Every little action could be the cause of several reactions 6 chapters later, and that really makes for a great reading experience (since you will always fear about consequences due to events in the past).  How To Train Your Dragon The Hard Way - Hiccup's way of becoming an unlikely hero in Berk. Heavily influenced by the original book series - if you've read them, this story will pretty much do nothing for you, except adding a tint of darkness.  Wayward Strangers - Valka seeks for help in a very hostile Berk, because her son back at the dragon sanctuary wants to reason with an unreasonable man. Though there are way more POV changes than I like, characterizations and overall atmosphere appeal to me very much.  None of the stories have been finished yet, I hope you're ok with that. And hopefully there's enough reading material out there for you ;)"

httyd,31pkgj,Xureality,2,Tue Apr 7 04:01:18 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what made you buy a 2015 instead of sticking with your 13/14? Do you like the new style that much more that you had to upgrade or what? You've got a great car and I think it looks awesome (especially with what you're doing to it) but I couldn't own any Mustang newer than a 2014. The new style just isn't my thing."
httyd,31pkgj,Hanelise11,3,Tue Apr 7 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"The style had to grow on me (aka I had to see it in person) but the drive quality and feature set even on the base model are SO far advanced.  The fastback style I do like, there's a few things I don't but that's all easy enough to fix up aftermarket later on. Having independent rear suspension, the significantly nicer transmission/shifter, the better seats, much better ride quality, much better interior, and the huge electronics upgrade (locks that only need to be touched to open rather than having to dig out a fob, screen interfaces even on the base model, track apps with line lock, etcetera) really made it a worthwhile move, especially for the value.  The new style isn't everyone's thing, the older one isn't either.. but performance wise it just feels like they lept ahead ten years when driving. It sticks to turns, it glides smoothly any time you're just cruising around town but still rips open when you floor it. It's just SO satisfying to control.  There's things I miss about the 14 but overall I'm happy. I'll do a few design adjustments down the road sure but beyond that? quite content."
httyd,31pkgj,Hanelise11,2,Tue Apr 7 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"That's interesting to hear... I've seen some go by in the area but I still prefer the 2014. I can take care of any performance differences too. I hope to pick up a GT500 with full track packages and everything. If I ever do though, it won't stay stock for long. I already intend to up the horsepower to at least 800-900hp or more by building up my own engine. Who knows how far I'd go from there. Glad to hear that you are enjoying yours! Keep us updated!"

The book series is of course canon, and the same for the movie franchise, which is separate and has its own canon. Movie canon is HTTYD 1-3 and the series are not canon at all.The sorts MIGHT be canon, although I'm not sure.

httyd,31l6va,Toothmax,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"Good thoughts, but I disagree.  Parametric equations are a good way to get non-function equations into function form.  (e.g. trig functions can be used to make a circle as parametric equations.)  A function is a machine that gives exactly one output for each input.  Toothless's curve is not a function of x- as you said, the vertical line test proves this.  Rather, it is a function of t."
httyd,31l6va,MigMigg,2,Mon Apr 6 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"If you read through the function details, you will find that it is actually not a single function at all.

So I'm not asking about the whole franchise.   However, when Netflix buys a television series, they usually buy all seasons of it. If the series originally airs on TV, there may be a year or so delay in streaming new episodes, but eventually, it will all be on Netflix.   So my question is, does Netflix consider these new episodes to be a distinct series called ""Race to the Edge"", or another season of ""Dragons""?  Making it a distinct series doesn't prevent Netflix from also buying the old seasons as a separate item, but it does mean we'll only get new episodes in June instead of old and new."

I think it's a weak complaint as well, especially in a film the central principle of which is the value of community and support for one another (as opposed ti domineering security), and especially of so complicated a character (a heroic figure who is not a very good mother, sympathetic, full of regret, and leads the cavalry charge herself wearing her BAMF costume which is, near uniquely, not sexualised)."

I would imagine it goes something like this: You enjoy the movie, so when you read these negative reviews, you feel somewhat sad/upset (on a very low level, almost just as some sort of dissonance in your mind). Because of this, the next time you watch the movie you watch wanting to see if the criticism is indeed valid, and consciously or subconsciously, begin looking for the problem described in the review. Since you are looking for the problem (again, whether or not you realize you are), when you find it (even if in the most insignificant or least convincing way), it stands out to you and reinforces the criticism you read. On top of that, since you initially enjoyed it, you were more or less ""proven wrong,"" because you yourself indeed observed that particular criticism, in turn generating another negative feeling.   The major thing with confirmation bias is that it is often unintentional and just a part of the psychology of how we think, so unless you're actively trying to be objective about something (which, really, what fun would thinking that much be when you're trying to enjoy a movie?), it will likely affect you.  Similarly, confirmation bias might act in the opposite way, where you have a positive preconception (or are introduced to one through a review) about something that you originally did not like or paid no attention to, and that makes you like something more than you originally did. For example, if you did not before notice the parallel between Hiccup and Toothless both losing their left limb/fin but then are told about it, you would likely notice it the next time you watch through, and develop a previously absent appreciation for the extra layer of similarity they have and can bond over. This is just an example for illustrative purposes, but the takeaway is that confirmation bias can act both ways.   What does this mean for you and reading movie reviews? Well, knowing it is a thing will help you put you change in opinion on the movie into perspective. While you can't really control your opinion or how you feel about the movie, if you take the reviews with a grain of salt, so to speak, you may be less influenced. If you feel that reading the reviews will make you not enjoy the movie as much, I think it's fine not to. What matters in the end is that you had fun and enjoyed yourself, not that you share opinions with others about how the movie made you feel."

httyd,318tgz,0hana_Means_Family,10,Thu Apr 2 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"If anything I think HTTYD does a great job of breaking gender roles. Hiccup is certainly not your typical male protagonist. He is physically weak and ineffective in battle. He is emotional and idealistic. He solves all his problems with reason, logic, and understanding. These are not traits that are typically associated with masculinity.  Both Astrid and Ruffnut don't follow traditional roles either. Astrid exhibits many masculine traits, she is strong and can easily defeat Snotlout when sparring. In the first film she is the strongest of the group in dragon training and defeats everyone except hiccup who is able to outsmart her. While she doesn't get as much air time as I'd like to see in the movies I get the impression that she is nothing but capable.   Ruffnut on the other hand isn't exactly the standard female stereotype either. She gets even less screentime than Astrid but it's pretty clear that she's all about pain and mischief things that are both historically masculine traits.  This is what I hate about modern feminism, it turns everything into gender roles and further entrenches them. Personally I think gender roles mostly shouldn't exist, people should be free to express themselves without having to worry about if they are masculine or feminine. Men should be able to be empathetic towards children, cry in public, and be in to poetry and books. Woman should be able to be aggressive, assertive, dominant, and strong if they so chose. It should be up to the individual to express themselves as they see fit and how they want to live their life without interference based on what society tells them they should be.  Feminism it seems wants to turn everything to a ""men vs. woman"" argument of the vague and poorly defined concept of patriarchy which it seems is argued with the same tenacity and fervency of conspiracy theorists. It fits a professional victim narrative that works against, not towards gender equality."

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for equality between genders and self-expression but sometimes I think feminists are a bit too extreme. Yes there should be movies that have female main characters, yes woman should be strong, but that doesn't mean HTTYD is degrading or oppressive towards women."
httyd,318tgz,nn123654,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Based on her poor judgment/planning and ultimate capture by Drago, we can conclude she's not very bright. By process of elimination, that leaves only her combat skills (which she never used) that makes her a strong character. But since she never used her combat skills in the movie, what evidence is there to show that she is a strong character? She lost all her personality from HTTYD1. It's as if puberty turned Astrid into a Barbie doll."
httyd,318tgz,Dennis_The_Menist,9,Fri Apr 3 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Not very bright are you kidding? She was the sole person responsible for convincing Hiccup not to give up at the end of the first movie after the fleet had left for the queen and before they arrived. In more than one place in HTTYD 2 she is seen organizing plans and is by far the most logical of the group of teens outside of Hiccup. As for not using her combat skills unless you want a 6 hour movie you can't give every character tons of screentime. The movies are primarily about Hiccup and Toothless, and rightfully so they get the vast majority of the screentime.  She's certainly not a barbie doll, not once has she ever been overly concerned with her appearance. She even wears a belt with metal skulls in both the first and second movie. As for never using her combat skills are you kidding? I'm going to use this copy of the HTTYD 2 plot for the following points.  Let's just consider where Astrid excels:   Movie Intro: she comes in first in the sheep races and is clearly admired by the entire village including Stoic as the most capable racer. In this scene she is clearly very competitive and easily beats all of the competition. What is called in the script as ""Scene 1200: Astrid Takes Charge"". Astrid worries about saving hiccup and the potential of him getting shot down by Drago and effectively organizes and leads a search for Hiccup. Astrid kidnaps Eret (who is just as strong if not stronger than Snotlout) and convinces him to take her to Drago through sheer intimidation. This as far from ""barbie doll"" as it gets and completely reverses the ""damsel in distress trope"". Astrid comes up with a plan when they encounter Drago after the previous scene to rescue stormfly and escape from Drago. She is the leader of the group when Hiccup is not around.   I don't think Astrid has lost any of her character, I just think they packed a lot into the second movie. They introduced Valka and had Stoic die and all of those took time away from Astrid and any interaction she had. It's not that she is less strong it's that she just doesn't have very much screen time given the amount of stuff they had to fit in and still make it only 1.5 hours long. The other thing to consider is not only is Astrid not your typical female character but Valka isn't either. She is more feminine than Astrid but she is the quintessential example of an independent female character in a movie.  If anything the only thing you can really argue about HTTYD is that it gives too much screentime to introverts since every single protagonist is introverted. But I'm not so sure that's a bad thing, traditional culture and movies favor extroverts and I think it works exceptionally well for this world. Most of the characters from Big Hero 6 on the other hand are extroverted.   One of the things that I think is really awesome about HTTYD and diversity is that Hiccup is an INTP (based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) protagonist which almost never happens. The last major movie I can think of that had that was the Matrix with Neo. Usually introverts in general are seen in supporting roles to extroverts and never as leaders or primary characters."
httyd,318tgz,nn123654,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"Just because someone is supportive and convincing doesn't make them a genius. Yeah, she organizes and leads her group to Drago, but they end up captured, and would've been forced to jumped into their icy deaths if Eret hadn't had a change of mind. To top it all off she ends up giving away almost all of Berks secrets and played a huge role in Stoick's death, though the movie doesn't want to acknowledge that because it'll ruin the message of girl power.  It's almost impossible for Astrid to lose character when you don't have any besides 'Strong Female Character.'  Astrid looks like a Barbie doll. Her face is as clean and as perfect as a Disney Princess. She's as skinny as Hiccup, though apparently she's a strong woman who can throw a weapon a thousand yards while Hiccup cannot. Her clothing makes her look like she walked right out of a photoshoot, when compared to what the rest of the vikings on Berk wear."

httyd,3103f3,Fifth5Horseman,0,Wed Apr 1 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"Why would toothless be able to fly further if he flew higher?   He wouldn't necessarily be able to fly further, but he would be able to see further. The higher you fly, the farther away the horizon is, as anyone who's ever stood on top of a mountain surrounded by much flatter terrain can tell you (this is also why old ships had a Crow's Nest). Because of this, if Hiccup and Toothless are surveying the islands around Berk, they should be able to rule out the presence of any islands larger than a mile across (this is really tiny, by the way) that could be reached in a single day very quickly (such an island, seen from a hundred miles away, would appear about as big as the moon). Islands smaller than that tend to be found close to bigger islands, so they would also be found fairly quickly. Basically, after five years they shouldn't be able to casually fly off in the middle of a dragon race and discover a new island. Valka's dragon sanctuary is probably close to a mile across and thousands of feet tall; it's practically a mountain. The ice might blend in with the sea, but it's so tall that it would still be easy to spot.   He can't fly high enough for the air pressure to make a significant difference (because he's not a machine, he needs to breathe etc)...   You'd be surprised: there are several species of birds that can fly over the peaks of the Himalayas, at altitudes where humans pass out and die without bottled oxygen. Birds have lungs much better adapted for high altitude than those of mammals, and it's not much of a stretch to think dragons do as well. The 12,500 foot limit I linked to is where altitude sickness starts affecting the pilot's decision-making so much that he/she can't safely fly a plane - which translates pretty well to Hiccup's reactions being slowed, meaning he can't control Toothless's tailfin. The figure doesn't take into account the pilot's being acclimated to high altitudes from living in some crazy mountain city like El Alto, Bolivia, but it shouldn't matter; Berk's village is close to sea level, and even frequent flights probably wouldn't make Hiccup tolerate high altitude that much better."

H and TL had been exploring the islands around Berk, we got to see a bit of that, it's fine.   There's actually only one species of geese that flies over the Himalayas, and that nearly kills them - even with their hypoxia adaptations. They're only able to get that altitude because the air being pushed over the mountains lifts them up and over. I don't think it's possible for a bird to achieve that kind of altitude above nothing but ocean, and a dragon is heavier.

Two species, the Bar-headed Goose and the Common Crane, fly over the Himalayas according to Wikipedia.   I don't think it's possible for a bird to achieve that kind of altitude above nothing but ocean, and a dragon is heavier.   From the article:    A flock of whooper swans was recorded by radar flying at 8,200 metres (27,000 feet) over Northern Ireland.[2][4]   I doubt Toothless could fly anywhere near that high, but it's really hard to say. On the one hand, dragons are bigger so they have higher stall speeds etc. On the other hand, they clearly have a much greater power-to-weight ratio than real birds.  I would guess that the dragon that could fly highest is something like a Timberjack, Typhoomerang, or maybe a Monstrous nightmare; they have huge wing area for their size, perfect for gliding in thin air. By the same logic, the lowest-flying dragons are probably species like Gronkles, Whispering Deaths, and Thunderdrums."

httyd,3103f3,Skyblacker,3,Wed Apr 1 06:56:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating the size of the world a bit there. First you need to pick a direction to head off in. Chances of finding Valka's hideout in 5 years? Slim. And that's only IF Hiccup started venturing out on his own at age 15. Hiccup hints that he's discovered other villages; perhaps he spent some time forming relations with the people he happened across before moving on?  Same with Valka. She was abducted by Cloud Jumper against her will. How long would it have taken her to form a bond with the dragons, and then how much longer to figure out her way back to Berk? Perhaps by that time she figured it'd be better to let go than to return and not be welcome. Besides, 20 years with no human interaction? Given the way she dressed, she probably thought of herself as a dragon. It wasn't until she met Hiccup that she realized what she'd lost.  If you really wanted to find faults in the movie, you could have at least mentioned the poorly-scripted baby dragon riding scene which immediately followed Stoick's funeral."

That would have been several pages all on its own. I mean, making a baby dragon carry a rider as heavy as itself sounds very unhealthy. Not to mention if they don't listen to anyone, how did they even get them to fly in the right direction at all?  But yeah... I actually think the pacing of the second half of the movie was seriously screwed up, especially with the mixture of goofy scenes like that with Stoick's death and the final battle against Drago. Personally, I would have had the two battles merged into one. This would eliminate the counter-productive mood whiplash, and the sheer shock of realizing he killed Stoick would have been an excellent explanation for why Toothless was able to break the Bewilderbeast's control. Also, the mental image of Toothless lighting Hiccup's arrow at Stoick's funeral is too sad and beautiful for words."

In HTTYD, the shock of the injury might have downed Toothless, but he should have been able to awkwardly fly away if he wasn't otherwise trapped.   It's closer to an airplane's horizontal stabilizer than a rudder. For yaw control, Toothless probably creates unequal drag on his left and right sides. This can be accomplished both with his wings, or by extending the two sides of his tailfin different amounts.  Honestly, he should theoretically be able to fly with half his fin missing, but not very well: This B-17 bomber lost the entire left half of its horizontal stabilizer (just like Toothless!) and returned safely to base. There's a story of an F-15 landing safely with almost an entire wing missing, but the F-15, unlike a dragon, generates a lot of lift with its body. But he probably doesn't know HOW to control his flight, and would have either starved to death or crashed and died before he learned. In theory, Hiccup could teach him by gradually retracting the artificial tail further and further, but Hiccup has neither examples showing that flying this way is possible nor the math and physics to calculate that it is (don't forget, this is before calculus or Newton's laws of motion).   And another note on the franchise in general and ""Gift of the Night Fury"" in particular: winter is not that sunny on Berk!

If Berk is in the north, then land of the midnight sun in summer becomes pitch black at noon in winter (but hey, pretty Northern Lights).   Well, Berk has been theorized to be in the Orkney Islands, the Shetland Islands, or the Faroes. The first two are about the same latitude as Oslo or a little further south, and the Faroes are still below the Arctic circle. Here's a link saying that on the Winter solstice, the day is about 5 hours link in the Faroes, as you said: http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/faroe/torshavn?month=12&year=2015 (you really can find anything on the internet). In Oslo or the Shetlands it's almost 6 hours, and in the Orkney's it's a little longer.  I wouldn't doubt if the animators set the sun angle a little high, though: this could probably be checked by looking at a bunch of shots of characters' shadows.  My main gripe with GOTNF, though, is that the winter solstice is the WORST possible time for an animal living at high latitudes to have babies; they're born just in time for the coldest part of winter (which is actually about a month after the solstice). Smaller animals have higher surface area, so they lose heat faster, and since baby dragons don't have fur, feathers, or blubber, and don't have burrows, this effect is even worse. The best time for baby dragons to hatch is around Thawfest, when it's just gotten warm, giving the chicks as much time as possible to grow before the next winter. But with sufficiently long gestation times, it's actually possible for the dragons to lay their eggs on Snoggletog and have them hatch on Thawfest.  My personal headcanon is that the story was a little embellished, perhaps by an inebriated Snotlout: Hiccup found the nesting colony with eggs, and later on many of the dragons that lived on Berk ended up realizing that the village was a nice, safe, warm place to build nests, and carried them back. Several months later, a series of Gronkle egg explosions started a Berkian tradition of scouring the village to find hidden dragon eggs (later replaced with chicken eggs) before they hatched, every year about a week after Thawfest. Sound familiar, anyone?"
httyd,3103f3,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:50:24 2015 UTC,"If Hiccup can build a self-retracting fin for Toothless, or an almost modern looking prosthetic for himself, I think understands enough physics to figure out that kind of flight even without Newton.  Though even he might not be able to explain how a Gronkle could stay aloft with such a tiny wingspan to weight ratio. Got any headcanon for that?"
httyd,3103f3,Dewmeister14,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:47:34 2015 UTC,"The tail and prosthetic seem to be based on principles such as gears, springs, and levers, which are contemporary - even the ancient Greeks them - and can be fairly well understood without calculus. Airfoils, stability derivatives, and such are a totally different ball game.  Toothless's prosthetic tail pretty much copies the real one, so aerodynamic theory isn't that important.  Hiccup's wingsuit is much more complicated; I would imagine it was developed using lots of trial and error with small clay, wood, and paper or cloth models. Maybe even a rudimentary wind tunnel (fan powered by a water wheel?). I suppose the same idea could be extended to Toothless's tail, but building a model that could deflect the whole tail downward, extend/retract the fin, etc would be incredibly difficult.  If Hiccup does realized Toothless could theoretically fly without the prosthetic, he probably decided not to try to teach him because, as shown in GOTNF, flying with Hiccup is so important to Toothless now that he'd most likely refuse to even try to fly without him.  As for Gronkles: they just beat their wings much faster than would be possible for real muscles and bones - the same is true for Toothless; according to this he can fly at over 300 MPH in level flight, and he probably wasn't even at top speed in that scene. The fastest bird in level flight is the White-throated needletail, which can reach just over 100 MPH (Peregrine falcon's can only reach their commonly cited 200+ MPH top speed in a dive).  If I had to guess, Toothless's absolute top speed would probably be limited by his wingtips breaking the sound barrier at somewhere over 400 MPH - possible even as fast as 500 MPH. Breaking the sound barrier would be nearly impossible; at around mach 0.8 the airflow over parts of his wings would start to become supersonic, causing severe buffeting and fluttering (especially since his wings are skin membranes). Since his terminal velocity is probably < mach 1, he would start losing thrust and be unable to go faster. However, at these speeds the airflow could twist his wing into a different enough shape to create a stall and extremely high drag, with the likely result being injuries to muscles, tendons, and ligaments, dislocated joints, broken bones, or even shredded wing membranes."

It is the fastest-flying bird in flapping flight, with confirmed speeds reaching 111.6 km/h (69.3 mph).  It is commonly reputed to reach velocities of up to 170 km/h (105 mph), though this has not been verified.     These birds have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. They build their nests in rock crevices in cliffs or hollow trees. They never settle voluntarily on the ground [citation needed] and spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks.  These swifts breed in rocky hills in central Asia and southern Siberia. This species is migratory, wintering south in the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Australia. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, but has been recorded as far west as Norway, Sweden and Great Britain. In June 2013, the bird was spotted in the United Kingdom, the first sighting in 22 years. This bird flew into a wind turbine and died; its body was sent to a museum.

httyd,3103f3,geesemaster,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not comfortable with those speed estimates. The P-38 Lightning, a WWII fighter of comparable size to Toothless (52 ft. wingspan) could reach a max speed of 414 mph... in the rarified air at 25,000 ft. of altitude, well beyond where Hiccup could go. I suspect the camera movement in that scene may have ruined the estimates. And at these speeds, compressibility off of the main wing gave the aircraft a nasty tail flutter, and Toothless' smaller 'horizontal stablilizer' tailfins would likely experience the same phenomenon to a greater extent."

httyd,30t7u2,Toothmax,-1,Wed Apr 1 13:31:10 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. If anything, it will predict that DreamWorks will dumb down HTTYD3 to appease helicopter moms to make money."

httyd,30slx3,MissRainbowtie,2,Mon Mar 30 23:11:46 2015 UTC,The model and the actual animation of action are two very different things that I think you're getting confused with each other.   Put it this way. I would agree with you in saying that Toothless' hyperactivity and domesticity in HTTYD2 was slightly off-putting but I would prefer that model and design with all its intricacies and texture over the Derpless lump of clay any day.

httyd,30s18y,Skyblacker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:57:47 2015 UTC,"Meh, I didn't care for it. It's a reaction shot to the end of the movie, but the emotions are predictable (everyone is rattled up? Duh!) and there's no new information.   Now if the story began with, I dunno, a scene of Drago plotting his comeback, that would be interesting.   I think the point of fanfiction is to add something that's not already in the official story. As you can see HERE, most fanfics either change something about the story to create an alternate plotline (example: What if Hiccup was raised by dragons?) or add details to explain something that's ambiguous in the story (example: Was Hiccup in a long coma at the end of the first movie?). Sorry, but your fan fiction does neither.   Also, when writing dialogue, each character's words should begin on a new line.   EDIT: By the way, it's not like I've written great fan fiction either (proof). Sometimes, the idea is in your head and you just need to put it in writing. And that's okay too. There's no punishment for writing bad fanfic -- and if you write enough of it, maybe you'll get good."
httyd,30s18y,Skyblacker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:58:07 2015 UTC,"its my first shot and I have exams right now so I guess I kinda expected something like this. hopefully (if you follow it) I'll be able to improve/impress you as I go on! I just really wanted to write something so I did something short and yea I guess predictable but I think for the most part I'll be writing as someone who wants to make movies someday (that's what I'm going to college for) and this is progressively the ""next"" scene that would happen if the movie was to continue. or so it happened in my head.   edit: Now I should say that exams are no reason to be shitty at things but I simply didn't have time to write really LONG things.  I hope to once mid-terms are done though"
httyd,30s18y,Skyblacker,2,Mon Mar 30 07:20:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, the length is fine; one-shots should be short. The issue is that it's not focused enough. Even within a few paragraphs, you should be able to:    Establish the relationship between characters (a line or two of dialogue can do this. Think of Hiccup looking longingly at the other teenagers who get to fight dragons, and then Gobber drags him back to his real job. That quickly establishes multiple things about Hiccup and his conflict with the world).  Set up the plot and premise. Preferably with the same lines that also established #1.  Continue the plot. This can be as short as the bridge of a joke, another scene, a second act, or multiple books. Size matters not! Just make sure that it leads to...  A surprising yet logical conclusion. I.e., the end.    The story I linked to as ""proof"" in my previous comment may be bad as fanfic (since it bears little relation to HTTYD itself), but you might want to read it as an example of a solidly told very short story. You don't need much time or space to get an idea across.   Also, I'm glad you're putting your story out for feedback. It's scary but it's worth it. This is the only way writers get better. I commend you for being a good sport."
httyd,30oa6f,Plailect,3,Sun Mar 29 05:05:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I felt like it was a pretty good story, but it could have been told in about 100,000 words less.   Also, good to see you back."

httyd,308yfr,MigMigg,3,Wed Mar 25 13:13:21 2015 UTC,Huge fan of the Rotoscopers and their podcast. Excellent article and cannot agree more with these quotes:   This makes the film feel a lot closer to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter than other animated films in terms of how the camera behaves.   I've mentioned this many times before but the establishing shot of Eret's boat drifting alone through the ice as well as the powdery texture of the snow when Toothless/Hiccup crash land after 'Flying with Mother' really are just two of my favourite things about HTTYD2.    This is an animated trilogy that is being built from the onset to stand alongside other blockbuster franchises. The style of cinematography in How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the different elements that make up that style definitely speak to that ambition.
httyd,308yfr,MissRainbowtie,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:27:43 2015 UTC,the establishing shot of Eret's boat drifting alone through the ice   Hellll yes. Shots like that one made the second movie so good - it would have been easy for them to cut corners on that sort of thing... so glad they didn't.
httyd,308yfr,geesemaster,2,Fri Mar 27 00:56:37 2015 UTC,"Great read, camera and the visuals were amazing in the second movie. Remember the moment when the ice was displayed up close for the first time?"
httyd,309lmu,HelpIcantfly,10,Wed Mar 25 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel, and I'll tell you now, it's not a bad thing. If you channel it right, it can be a tremendous source of motivation, and help you get better at something you aspire to.   The easiest way is to create something. Writing fanfiction is fine, if you really enjoy it, but don't do it just because it seems like the easiest way (because it isn't). Fanart is better, but try to put your own spin on it. I'd say, look at any area of the film, and try to imagine how it could have been done differently. You say you like Valka, so start with her - what else could her character have looked like? Say she had black hair, for example, or her staff was a different shape. What if she didn't have a staff at all, but some kind of whip, or snare? How could Hiccup's sword and leg actually work, mechanically? Maybe music is more your thing - say the film's soundtrack was done only on solo instruments instead of an orchestra, how would Valka's theme need to be altered? Would it even still work? Or hell, if you want to find out stuff about the dragons, find it out. Have a shot at drawing out the bone or muscle structures of some of them (how would a four-winged creature even work?) - do some light research, find out about how birds work, the square-cube ratio, see if you can find out why Cloudjumper's flying animation is UTTERLY WRONG (start out with hummingbirds, because they're coolest).   If you can't tell, I do this a lot, and it's helped me become way more knowledgeable about pretty much everything. ""What if"" is a very healthy question to ask, and answering it yourself is a very productive thing to do; you should still try to strike out from the films, and apply your love to the wider world, so to speak.  That said, if you're interested in animation or character design or visual storytelling, study the crap out of both films, because they're a masterclass. There's so much conveyed visually, that makes everything so much richer - Valka has such a presence because her woven armour stuff and the bright turquoise colour are totally alien to the rest of the world; Drago and Valka are mirror images of each other, down to the way they each portray a different method of training dragons from the books, etc.  TL:DR; It's hard to order thoughts on this, but the important thing is to drive yourself forwards. The people who created the film were all inquisitive, well-informed people who had to work out what they were doing for themselves. If you can do the same, and keep doing it (even though you'll suck to begin with), you'll be able to make things of your own that have the same richness and depth."

httyd,309lmu,MissRainbowtie,3,Thu Mar 26 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"No problem. Like I say, it's great to try out for anything you see in any film when you have some free time - if you can ask ""How does that work"", and the thing doesn't collapse immediately, you know you're on to a winner. Does amazing things for your problem-solving and visualisation, too."
httyd,309lmu,SevenCell,2,Thu Mar 26 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"This is a great response. I don't feel the way the OP does, but my love for these films is a big reason why I want to enter the film industry - especially the realm of animation. Hell, my dream employer (no pun intended) is DreamWorks simply because of how much I love the Dragon films and that I believe they show a lot of promise artistically through many of their works. They prove how animation, if done right, can encapsulate the magic of cinema even better than many live action films.  I am by no means an artist/animator, but I would love to become a screenwriter and write films like HTTYD. To tell stories through the animation medium yet not give into the category of ""kiddie"" and, in fact, be darker than the typical Disney/Pixar fare.   To the OP, do as the poster above me said. Channel your love, but don't let it consume you. Create something that others can enjoy just as much as HTTYD; something to inspire people much as these two films seem to have inspired you."

However, it's important to remember that there's a lot to love about our own world as well. Even if things seem mundane right now, keep in mind that there are real people out there who are just as passionate about these things as you are. Real artists created this movie from scratch, and tons of fans continue to make fan art and fiction to this day. There's a lot to explore :)"
httyd,309lmu,SonicSNES,2,Wed Mar 25 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"Actually browsing this reddit more and interacting with this community makes me feel a lot better, especially this message.  Thank you."
httyd,309lmu,SpookyLemon,2,Wed Mar 25 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, I know the feels. I felt exactly the same after watching the 2nd movie. The kind of feeling of awe, the feeling that you've just watched the best movie in the world, that you keep thinking about ""How awesome would it be to live in such a perfect world?"". I had it a little more complicated, mixed with the sad feeling of the death of Stoick. Don't be concerned by it, I don't think it's such a big deal. I think that many people had this feeling that are now on this subreddit, and many of us got here because of the itch to tell and ask the others about it. For me, the feeling went away after time, and actually, watching the movie less regularly, but only from time to time and enjoying every single moment also helped. All I can say is, welcome!"

And because I felt the air against my face more than I saw the wheels on the street, I could easily pretend I was riding Toothless. It was awesome!   Also, have you looked up your local Ren Faire scene? If you like medieval communities...  Tl, dr: Live the dream."

I am in talks with my artist about another larger HTTYD piece which I hope to get in the next few months, I have another to start before it though!

httyd,303zc9,sweatyforehead,5,Tue Mar 24 07:44:06 2015 UTC,My spouse and I always wondered if Toothless is the baby version of a Bewilderbeast.

httyd,303zc9,KerzenscheinShineOn,2,Tue Mar 24 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"I thought that he was just a basic green or whatever in the books wasn't he? The sea-dragons from the book would certainly be that name but not toothless. Left and right in the book he is described as being a small green dragon that's never going to be very big.  The books are almost 100% opposite of the movies except for some name similarities and that there are dragons. Does this need spoilers?  Edit: Well, I'm somewhat right.... I just did some research and in How to Betray a Dragon's Hero, Toothless is revealed to be a Maximus. I never got a chance to read that one by I've read all the books up to it."

I had to unsubscribe from blogs and Facebook pages to prevent spoilers. It was a long hual but finally the release was just days away.  I agree on a whim to see Godzilla with a friend. Don't think anything of it and we're looking for our seats in the crowded dark room, when the trailer comes on. There was nothing I could do but not look at the screen while the audio blared...  And that's how after weeks of being careful and years of being excited, a major plot point was spoiled. sigh. I tried to push it from my mind and still enjoyed the movie a lot. But I'm very spoiler sensitive, and wish it didn't take so much effort to achieve what should be a simple goal! At least for the important movies like this :p"

In the episode Frozen, the Speed Stinger made its first and so far only appearance. While Hiccup and Toothless were searching for Trader Johann, they could see a pack of these dragons running beneath them, on the frozen sea. It later turned out the Pack had taken over Berk, and paralyzed most of its citizens, including Stoick, Snotlout, and Meatlug. Ultimately, Toothless and Hiccup managed to lure the Stingers away from Berk, by capturing their leader, the Lead Stinger, luring it back along the path and forcing the other Speed Stingers to follow until Hookfang- ridden by Snotlout with Gustav Larson acting as his arms due to his paralysis- was able to melt the path and leave them trapped.

The ribs and their connecting membrane may be extended to create a wing, the hindlimbs are flattened and wing-like in cross-section, and a small set of flaps on the neck serve as a horizontal stabilizers. Draco are arboreal insectivores. While not capable of powered flight they often obtain lift in the course of their gliding flights. Glides as long as 60 m (200 ft) have been recorded, over which the animal loses only 10 m (33 ft) in height, which is quite some distance, considering that one of these lizards is only around 20 cm (7.9 in) in total length (tail included).

httyd,2z275l,moonexe,1 point,Mon Mar 16 09:40:39 2015 UTC,I think of them as a nice expansion to the movies. The first movie is referenced a few times but that's about it.
httyd,2z275l,TheSparrowX,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:21:38 2015 UTC,"That's kind of it. I generally don't think of the series as canon; mostly because of the major plotholes that they create and the evidently younger target demographic. For example, everyone is getting dragons all over Berk at the end of HTTYD 1, throughout the entirety of GotNF, and everyone has them in HTTYD 2, but they only arrive as plot devices or handy exposition in the series. Good for learning about new dragons not mentioned in the films, but not so good for anything else. Also, from what I saw, the design for the Thunderdrum is very different from HTTYD 2 to the series (considering the generally accepted theory that the dragons that Hiccup and Toothless pass in the 'Where No-one Goes' clip are Thunderdrums...) Nice pic by the way, Sparrow."
httyd,2z275l,LawOfTheSeas,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think concerning the series, it's best to think of it separately from the films. They have the same characters in the same world, but you shouldn't be too focused on consistencies between the two while watching it. That's how I see it anyway."

Anyway, we've seen new sheets stored in a pocket on his sleeve. I assume his other gear is similarly stored in other pockets, since his flight suit seems to be covered in various attachments.   In addition, we've yet to see Hiccup benefit from anything that makes him physically unique. His body tends to put him at a disadvantage, so it's up to his mind to build a way around it. That's been his M.O. since Toothless fell."

New Tail, Coming Back Around, Forbidden Friendship, Romantic Flight, This is Berk, See You Tomorrow, Test Drive, Sticks and Stones.  All fantastic tracks.  All the sequel really had was Dragon Racing (which was pretty much just from the first movie), Flying With Mother, and Where No Ones Goes.  Not at all saying the second ost was bad by any means, but the original was mindblowing.  There was simply more scenes in which the music is the primary audio - Forbidden Friendship, See You Tomorrow, Romantic Flight, Test Drive, and New Tail were all in scenes with little to no spoken words.  The emotions had to be expressed via the animation and music, since Hiccup/Toothless interaction had little speech.  Compare that to the second movie - there was a ton more dialogue, and once again, the best songs all came from the few low-dialogue scenes."
httyd,2yee6p,geesemaster,3,Mon Mar 9 02:53:47 2015 UTC,the best songs all came from the few low-dialogue scenes   Something that the second film really lacked and I really missed seeing
httyd,2yee6p,MissRainbowtie,3,Mon Mar 9 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Spot on. I would add Downed Dragon and basically the rest of the soundtrack from the first half of the first movie too. And the second movie had Stoic Saves Hiccup/Stoic's Ship. But really, the soundtrack from the first movie is significantly better, and really I felt that was a big shortcoming of the second movie. When the first movie is not using dialogue, it's illustrating the story through music and visuals (show not tell), which lacked somewhat in the second movie."

It felt more mature(as did the film in general), introduced fantastic new motifs, and brought back the old ones in unique new ways.  Right now, I am doing a little analysis of the films' scores, naming each theme and noting where it occurs(will post here when done).  Perhaps I will change my mind in the process."
httyd,2yee6p,MigMigg,5,Mon Mar 9 06:02:25 2015 UTC,"I like them both, but the first one gets the nod 100%. It was fresh and bombastic. The second one, while still fantastic. loses the surprise and joy of the first just by nature of being the second."

The first had many outstanding tracks, and a few mediocre ones, while the second was generally solid throughout. Overall I liked the first one better though. Favorite scores from each one in order:  HTTYD   Test Drive Forbidden Friendship See You Tomorrow Coming Back Around New Tail Where's Hiccup? This is Berk Sticks and Stones   HTTYD2   Where No One Goes Battle of the Bewilderbeast Dragon Racing Hiccup the Chief Should I Know You? Toothless Found Together We Map the World Two New Alphas"
httyd,2yee6p,Jdawg_,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:46:43 2015 UTC,"I would say I prefer the first movie's soundtrack. The second one has much better sound mixing, improved orchestration (battle of the bewilderbeast is much much better than battle of the green death imo) etc.  I think the themes and the way they are used is better in the first movie. (Forbidden friendship, Test Drive and Romantic Flight are all scenes with almost no dialogue, the music is free to do basically whatever it wants. This didn't really happen at all in the second film).  'Hiccup the chief' is a perfect example of this: The music is put together really really nicely, but the motifs just aren't quite as memorable.

httyd,2yee6p,Gonza116,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore both soundtracks.  They do have different sounds to them, though.  HTTYD1's is a lot more simplistic in the sense that it isn't as complex of a sound.  My favorite tracks from it are ""This is Berk,"" ""Forbidden Friendship,"" ""See you Tomorrow,"" and ""Test Drive.""  To me, just those four songs put HTTYD1's soundtrack on par with HTTYD2.  I would still say that I like HTTYD2's better though.  I feel like each composition is better and of a higher quality and you can hear it throughout.  While HTTYD1's soundtrack has some great tracks, I don't think it's as great as a whole.  I'll side with HTTYD2."

Hiccup is called Harold, which means absolutely nothing (in French, anyway) and completely ruins the whole ""ugly names"" thing, Toothless is called ""Krokmou"" which... Well, it's sort of a grammatically incorrect and stupidly spelled pun on the fact that he has no teeth. It doesn't work at all in the scene where he names him. I checked. Sounds ridiculous.

So that would be 7 frames in 350ms, which equals 20 FPS animation. For it to be 60FPS, it would require there to be 21 extra frames in those 350 ms in which the gif is moving, which is 3 times as much as it is right now :) Kind of a lot of work to do double the amount already done."

At the same time, doing something so dark in an american animated movie would be huge but in the end I think the amputation may have been even more risky. Think about it - how many animated protagonists in the US lose limbs at the end? It's one of the reasons I would argue that HTTYD was a bolder film than Toy Story 3 (which had a far cleaner ending - sad in its own right, but everything worked out without massive injury).  Personally, from what I hear, the third movie is going to be the darkest one yet. If it is pulled off well, I could see it being the catalyst for darker animated movies being released, and the HTTYD franchise going down as perhaps the greatest animated trilogy of all time (maybe surpassing Toy Story for people)."

httyd,2xmehk,nn123654,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the movie be about the transition of both Hiccup and Toothless to chief and alpha with the conflict point being having to deal with challenges to their authority and coming out on top. I don't think they should kill off either hiccup or the dragons but I could see a conflict between Hiccup and Snotlout and watching that play out in a fight for chief. Such a plot would also give a chance for Astrid and Valka to help toothless in trying to figure out how to be an effective leader.  Hiccup has done a great job transforming the world in which he lives but the second movie pointed out that the only reason he was able to make such a big change was because of his father's position as chief and him backing him up. The second movie ends before any conflict can arise and Hiccup having to fill any role or make tough decisions for his people. It's pretty clear from the first movie that most people see him as a ineffective viking and it's not that much of a stretch to think that the traditionalists would have a problem accepting his rule. It'd be interesting to see him get creative and once again fundamentally transform viking society into a democracy. This in a way is a similar concept to how the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series ended with them establishing a new way of life for everyone.  In the book series all the dragons die including toothless but I don't think you need to follow that ended in order to have a good movie. I'd be perfectly happy with a peaceful ending with everyone accepting a new system of government and with an ending of Hiccup, Toothless, Astrid, and Valka flying off together to map and explore the world, deciding they'd rather be with dragons than people."
httyd,2xmehk,ThePostItNote,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:21:58 2015 UTC,I could see a conflict between Hiccup and Snotlout and watching that play out in a fight for chief.   Eeeexceept that Hiccup is already chief.
httyd,2xmehk,nn123654,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"Well for now he is, but just because he's been granted the title chief doesn't mean that the people have accepted him in that role. What I'm thinking is more of a Coup d'etat against hiccup. The entire first season of Dreamworks: Dragons was mostly about the people of berk disagreeing with the leadership's decision to allow dragons on the island. When there isn't a pending disaster Hiccup usually has trouble leading people and getting them to listen to him. As with all leaders sooner or later someone is going to test his authority and challenge him to see if he can stand up for himself. Given his history in the first movie this is going to be a huge conflict, simply put it's not hiccup to go and order or boss other people around. Those feelings towards him don't stop just because he's been granted a title and a position of authority. It's inevitable that snotlout and spitelout are going to feel resentment towards hiccup being chief and work to undermine him as a leader.  That should be especially obvious with ""spite"" in the character's name. Spitelout has animosity not only towards Hiccup but also towards Stoick because he and Stoick are brothers and Stoick ended up becoming chief which would obviously make him jealous and spiteful. When you consider that his son Snotlout is stronger and a far more traditional viking than hiccup it's not hard to see why he'd be viewed as leader. If Hiccup was dead the power would transition to Spitelout since he is #2 after Stoick but being too old to lead he'd likely give it to his son, Snotlout. The connection between Stock and Spitelout is never explicitly expressed in the movies but instead implied from the Book Series where Baggybum the Beerbelly exists in place of Spitelout. In the book series he aggressively pushes for Snotlout to be chief.  What I mean isn't that Hiccup isn't already chief, it's that I could see a situation coming up where the people lose confidence in his leadership abilities and decide to side with a more traditional chief instead. Then you'd have two factions and a bit of a civil war going on. Some people would side with Hiccup and other people would side with Snotlout. With Stoick around Hiccup would have been able to lean on his father or other vikings to enforce his authority and transition into it. One of the reasons the directors killed him off was for the very reason that they wanted Hiccup to become fully independent of his father (as they explain in the documentary about how they made HTTYD 2). Without his father he'd have to figure out how to unify the different factions and stop an all out civil war with only Astrid and his mom to help him, which would make for a pretty interesting story."

httyd,2xlul7,windchaser_,4,Sun Mar 1 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely the first. I prefer the soundtrack, story and setting.   There are some parts without dialogue that the second film misses.

httyd,2xlul7,Bariqhonium,2,Mon Mar 2 03:18:07 2015 UTC,The first part has much better humour. Just every second of movie is filled by it. So this is why I prefer this part. The second movie is more dramatic for me. Both films has an excellent soundtrack.
httyd,2xlul7,tux_mark_5,2,Mon Mar 2 00:04:25 2015 UTC,"Why not both?  In all honesty, I prefer the second movie a little bit more. Even though there was more stuff in it that could make it overwhelming, I thought it was great. The soundtracks of both are amazing, though."

But most important for me is the sense of loss and overcoming it.  I've lost a lot of people and friends in my life, and the ability to be strong and come out of it okay has been something I've been working on. That move gives me so much hope for getting through things and being okay at the end of the day.  I love the first, but the second hits home for me a bit more."

httyd,2xkijh,bonosboner,10,Sun Mar 1 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, here's a crazy idea, different people have different opinions and some found BH6 a more enjoyable movie than HTTYD2. I'm one of them even though I'm a huge fan of HTTYD. The amount of salt over this is getting tiring.  Also who cares, it's just the Oscars. Their decision does nothing to change your enjoyment of the movie."
httyd,2xkijh,EdenBlade47,6,Sun Mar 1 16:54:58 2015 UTC,I think that this is one of the big problems with the Oscars. They tell most people: this is the better film butmake little to no effort to enforce such standards in their judging.   I know yu can enjoy BH6 more than HTTYD 2 but I haven't met anybody who could explain to me why it is the better film. I really discussed it at length with some of my friends who also like BH6 more than HTTYD but unfortunately I am better at analyzing and detatching myself from movies so everyone at the end can only say: yeah you're right but I still like it more. So no objective or semiobjective reasons why BH6 is better. I mean I am biased but I still see the flaws HTTYD has and can explain them to others but still I just think BH6 has more and bigger flaws while also not being as ambitious. Which is why I think it got choosen because of personal or public opinion (or name recognition).
httyd,2xkijh,werewulfking,5,Sun Mar 1 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"I think most of us are biased here, me especially lol. Granted, I haven't seen BH6 so it could very well be the better film. That said, what irks me more than anything is that it seems like everyone is on either the Disney or the Pixar bandwagon now. In my opinion, the Disney/Pixar fanbase is among the most obnoxious in existence.   I'm tired of everybody jumping onto the Disney bandwagon (and I say this as someone that really enjoyed Frozen). Even when HTTYD2 got generally better reviews than BH6, the latter raked in the dough.   Why?   Because people (and kids especially) love Disney. Couple that with the comic book element and it is a win-win. I can't tell you how many times I ran into people saying how great BH6 was versus how many people said they still haven't seen HTTYD2. It's really sad.  Dragons 2 seems to be more geared towards teens and young adults, while BH6 is more for the family. Even if BH6 has darker themes, it's Saturday morning cartoon with bright colors and toony look make it still popular. This makes it more enjoyable for kids, which is more often than not the determining factor regarding what Oscar voters pick -- which film did my little Suzy or Jimmy like best?   I still remember people on the HTTYD Facebook page complaining about you-know-who's death in the second film as being ""too dark"" and ""too mean"". Now we have people complaining about the third movie perhaps being even darker because, God forbid, animated films decide to take risks and be less cute.   P.S.: I don't know if it is just my own selective bias, but I feel like flaws that people notice and nit-pick in Dragons would get a free pass had they been in a Disney or a Pixar film. And from what I have heard BH6 rips off HTTYD quite a bit."
httyd,2xkijh,gomamon15,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"Nah there is really no ""ripping off"". It just shares a few similarities: Character death and friendship between a boy and a non-human but both are very standard tropes so I can't really fault them for it."
httyd,2xkijh,werewulfking,2,Sun Mar 1 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think he's referring to the carbon copy scenes of ""test drive"" (baymax falling off the golden gate bridge during their first flight test then pulling up last second proceeding with a fantastic flying scene) and ""romantic flight"" (sitting on top of the balloons above the clouds watching the sunset from above). There are tons of other similarities but I'd just choke those up to the similarity of the source material (adorable/awkward toothless/baymax). Overall I liked BH6's pacing Vetter, as Httyd2 was simply all over the place during the 2nd half. BH6 felt a bit more cliched though."
httyd,2xkijh,P3T3RSAM,1 point,Mon Mar 2 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Weak ass argument. It's like saying HTTYD1 Hiccup was a ripoff of Aladdin's misfit or how Romantic Flight ripped off the rug flight.

For example: if you eat really good food, you don't just stop and say: alright, I had enough. No, you keep staring at the empty plate wanting more! Same thing for movies: if it is really good, when the movie ends you sit there staring at the screen wanting it to go on, you want more.

httyd,2x66cj,Jdawg_,7,Wed Feb 25 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"That was good, as you would expect from Kyle Landry... but am I the only one who finds it a bit too showoff-y? Like he's more intent on showing what a great pianist he is rather than getting the feel of the soundtrack right. The main melody just gets kind of drowned out by all those extra notes, arpeggios and all that.  Mabye that's just his style though, I guess that's a subjective issue."
httyd,2x66cj,kiwit179,3,Wed Feb 25 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, I feel the same. I really like Kyle Landry but sometimes his improvisations are overly complicated and take away from the piece because of how distracting all the extra notes are."
httyd,2x66cj,rbloyalty,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"It's much slower than the source material, which gives it an entirely different feel from the original. I'm not a big fan of its style either, but it's just based how Kyle Landry envisioned the composition. It also doesn't sound as well-practiced as his other pieces."

httyd,2x2pjg,mt_xing,10,Sun Mar 1 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"The comment by ""Vicky Vining"" at the bottom of the page sums it up pretty well. Not about BH6 specifically as I have yet to see it (I don't think I can stomach watching it now, though, knowing how it beat Dragons 2), but how it looks as though there is little future for animation outside of Disney and Pixar.   I want to become a screenwriter, and one of my biggest dreams would be to work at a company like DreamWorks (solely as a writer - I can't draw to save my life) and write darker, edgier animated movies that are hardly ever made in the states (i.e. films like Akira, Grave of the Fireflies, Castle in the Sky, etc.) These are movies that tackle dark and difficult themes, showcase awe-inspiring environments, utilize orchestral music to its full potential, and are just so much DEEPER than pretty much any American animated films. And yes, that includes most Pixar films.  The HTTYD franchise, in my opinion, is the closest thing we have to this kind of animated film now. That is why I always found it artistically inspiring. If I wasn't determined before, it's loss at the Oscars this Sunday has pushed me over the edge and now it is my main goal in life to change the animation game and show people that animated movies don't have to cater exclusively for kids, nor do they have to be made my Disney or Pixar to be good. Plus I find obsessive Disney and Pixar fans to be the most obnoxious people on the internet (go to the HTTYD2 imdb board - I've never seen a more negative board for an animated movie).  Sadly, at this moment (as someone else said in a different thread) How to Train Your Dragon 3 could literally cure cancer and it would still not make the money Pixar/Disney films do. I'm convinced that the time has come to shake things up, and bring something new to the table even if it will not make Disney-level money."
httyd,2x2pjg,gomamon15,3,Wed Feb 25 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"I think many Oscar voters still don't get that animated film doesn't equal kids film.

httyd,2x2pjg,werewulfking,3,Wed Feb 25 09:43:40 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate why you think bh6 was more emotional? I have heard that sentiment thrown around quite a bit but just can't agree with it. The relationship between hiccups family is just  so emotional and very well brought across. And the toothless - hiccup relationship is a bit in the background until the end but it still gives you a big shock when hiccup just pushes toothless away.

httyd,2x2pjg,TheDranx,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:19:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah according to this article the reason they are having problems is because of 3 flops they've had close together.  Mr. Peabody & Sherman specifically was the result of the layoffs as it was a poor performer only making $273 million with a $150 million budget. Keep in mind studios often spend a significant percentage on marketing costs and more on distribution and other expenses above the actual budget that they spend to create a film. The above article says they took a $57 million loss on that movie alone. Even though HTTYD 2 and Madagascar 3 have done well it wasn't enough to offset the losses.  Turbo and Rise of the Guardians apparently also lost money and between the 3 movies they lost $157 million, which is pretty much the budget for an entire movie. Dreamworks isn't a big company where they can absorb big losses like that without having to really worry, a few consecutive flops and they will go bankrupt. Pixar for a very long time was at a point where even 1 flop would bankrupt the company.  Dreamworks took risks with these movies and tried to explore new stories and characters doing things that they've never done before. It seems that in this case it didn't pay off so I can fully expect that they will be more cautious in the future. This probably means more sequels and more mainstream movies until they get on sure financial footing again."

They just got all of the equity out of it by selling it off. It looks like they are going to keep the facility it's just for the time being they won't own it.

httyd,2wtxu7,runujhkj,18,Mon Feb 23 04:33:03 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't believe that Big Hero 6 can be held to the same level that HTTYD2 is. I don't think either are perfect movies, but come on. BH6 has so many flaws in writing, dialogue, character development, cliché...  I don't understand why it won Best Animated Picture other than it was a Disney movie."
httyd,2wtxu7,rubyshade,4,Mon Feb 23 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"I know! HTTYD2 was far superior in the writing department, and while BH6 dealt with themes of loss like HTTYD2 did, I don't think they did so nearly as well. The plot spun on the core of Hiccup coming of age, and everything in the story is meant to facilitate that, with Drago representing the opposite of what Hiccup is supposed to become. And thus, the story knew where it was going.  I didn't notice any of that kind of nuance in Big Hero 6. I really wanted to like it (San Fransokyo is one beautiful place, hats off to environment design), but I never felt invested in any of the characters. Kabuki Mask's motivation for doing all that stuff felt awkward. It was as if halfway through writing the script, someone went, ""Wait! He needs backstory!""   ""I've got it! How about his daughter was a test pilot for an alternate dimension ship! And the evil businessman was in charge of it, so he wants revenge!  And while the parallel with Hiro's loss was kinda cool, it didn't really resonate for me.  Hiro and Baymax's teammates were all static characters. Not always a bad thing, but they could have worked in some type of minor character arcs for them. Ruffnut's romantic shenanigans pick up the slack for most of the dragon kids, in terms of subplots. Valka has her (mostly internal) conflict on having left Stoick and Hiccup. Stoick provides a role model for Hiccup, the chief-in-training.  That ended up being longer than I expected. Tl;dr--BH6 was good but not Oscar good. And in my opinion, not even close to HTTYD2 good."
httyd,2wtxu7,the_random_asian,6,Mon Feb 23 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just saying that oscar voters are all completely subjective, so you can't be mad at a group of people for their opinion"

If only because this is just one more reason why the Academy is utterly broken and just keeps handing the same awards to the same people over and over and over again. I simply can't wrap my head around Big Hero 6 being better than How to Train Your Dragon 2 in any fashion. I literally can't think of one. I guess Big Hero 6 may have been funnier."
httyd,2wtxu7,ZeldaMusic113,-1,Mon Feb 23 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more than this. I would add that Big Hero 6 was probably supposed to be Disney's copy of the httyd movies. The companies have a history of competition with their movies. Certain scenes were practically identical, along with certain characters. Big Hero 6 was not a terrible movie, but imo, doesn't deserve most of the praise it gets."

httyd,2wtxu7,eduardische,11,Mon Feb 23 04:02:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a lot of people do need an academy to tell which movie is better than another, and as such the win would've brought much needed publicity to Dreamworks. As we saw with the Big Hero 6 win itself, despite Dragon being 1/6 with bookies, Disney doesn't really need it to promote its movies.  I get that people have different opinions, but my respect for the whole Academy Awards' culture is now non-existent. Especially after the quotes from the voters themselves which were poster here earlier today. Movies shouldn't be promoted just so that voters could see it. It should be a requirement to watch all nominations before voting. Otherwise it just becomes popularity contest of who can get the movie to the bigger amount of voters. And the release being late in the year helps as well, earlier movies just get forgotten/less publicity (The Lego Movie, anyone?). Until this is in place, we're just going to get this popularity contest, where Disney/Pixar have a huge advantage over everyone else. I mean, let's ignore Dragon 2 for the moment, how many % of voters do you think saw Song of the Sea or The Tale of the Princess Kaguya? Perhaps one of them should've won the award? Maybe, I haven't seen them, so I can't judge. So, yes, my opinion is biased. But I'm not a voter, so who cares. However I suspect majority of the voters haven't either, and that's the problem here."
httyd,2wtxu7,aquaz_,2,Mon Feb 23 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"My point exactly. It's not right for any of the parties - winner, and any of the other nominees.

httyd,2wtxu7,runujhkj,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:37:28 2015 UTC,I legitimately think that's an argument you can have. I simply can't understand saying Big Hero 6 is better or more deserving than Dragon 2.
httyd,2wtxu7,Mithent,5,Mon Feb 23 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Disappointing, but not entirely surprising after being reminded yesterday about the calibre of the voters. This category remains Best Kids' Movie or Best Pixar/Disney Movie to many, and they don't necessarily watch all the nominees before voting.   I did like Big Hero 6, but it was a bit weak beyond the Hiro and Baymax relationship, and I would obviously have sooner seen HTTYD2 recognised."
httyd,2wtxu7,TheLittleGoodWolf,7,Mon Feb 23 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"I liked it as well, I can imagine a lot of kids loving the heck out of that movie as well. Still it was very weak on the characters. I mean aside from Hiro and Baymax the most developed character was the stoner guy. The others were just empty shells with specific personality traits.  I was never really convinced by any of their relationships with each other, and couldn't really care much about the other heroes. Which is sad because I really wanted to, I would have loved to see much more development on them.  Httyd2 felt a bit lacking in the pacing but other than that..."
httyd,2wtxu7,nn123654,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:00:59 2015 UTC,"The Big Hero 6 seemed like it rush into pushing too much stuff too fast to me. I feel like they didn't spend enough time on character development and almost like it was a sequel and I was missing the first part. The animation was very good though, but as far as world design I think HTTYD did a much better job (obviously) even if Dargo was a very cookie cutter villain and not well developed.  Keep in mind though there are plenty of great famous movies that don't win the Oscars. One of the better examples is the Wizard of Oz which lost to Gone with the Wind. Both films are still usually ranked in the top 100 films of all time. I suspect HTTYD will be the same in animated films."

Leonardo Di caprio and this certain incident is a perfect example of this. I still love the Oscars but damn.  HTTYD2 push the boundaries of an animated film (For the most part). It was extremely well written, acted and animated. Not that Big Hero 6 isn't good, it's great and I LOVED it, but it has flaws.  I swear to GOD this was going to be DW's big year. No Pixar movie this year, other than the Lego Movie and BH6,  (The former wasn't even nominated, which is a crime itself) there wasn't much to go up against. But nah, Disney is better despite their movie being the weaker film.  I really am disappointed.  Edit: Apperently John Lasseter is part of the Academy. His ego probably got in the way along with his dislike for Jeffery Katzenburg."

Meanwhile HTTYD3 could be the best animated sequel of all time and still win nothing because it not ""popular"" enough and not mainly geared towards kids like most Disney/Pixar films are (yes adults can enjoy them, but the Dragon movies are far darker than pretty much any American animated films today)."
httyd,2wtxu7,BasileusBasil,8,Mon Feb 23 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not like it didn't win anything, it almost won everything except the academy, but as for the movies are sold oscar = good film. I don't know how many contents big hero 6 had in it, but to me httyd 2 was all around perfect, it was enjoyable from the younger audience but it was mainly directed to teens and young adults. This is clear in the whole part starting from Stoick finding Valka up to to the boat set on fire scene. Not only i was melting from the emotions, but the message of Hiccup's growth and him picking up his father legacy was truly felt. A child hardly can understand what means all of this. The academy voters through the years have clearly showed that they don't like too many ""grown up"" themes in them and i'm talking about ratatouille vs persepolis, ts3 vs httyd(to a lesser extent), frozen vs the wind rises and bh6 vs httyd2. I remember a mother complaining how the wind rises was too hard to understand for her son and that had too many painful moments for a child, it's a anime for god's sake! It is not meant for children! Today i feel like that mother voted at the oscars."

httyd,2wtxu7,werewulfking,2,Mon Feb 23 03:31:09 2015 UTC,So from what I gather the animation of GH6 was kinda praised a bit but not having seen it in 3D and having seen HTTYD can someone who has seen both tell me if the animation could be considered superior?  I mean i was always so impressed in the animation quality from HTTYD and still think it was the best 3D I have seen. But maybe it really was better. Because in all other categories I can think of the top of my head BH6 was not as good as HTTYD. I mean i don't think you are wrong for liking one more than the other but I would expect more obejectivity from the Oscars.
httyd,2wtxu7,WhiteMarauder,2,Mon Feb 23 03:38:17 2015 UTC,"No not really.  BH6 has a bit of a more vibrant color scheme than HTTYD.  Lots of reds, blues, oranges, and other colors going on there.  But the same can be said for HTTYD.  I never understood what the academy judged based on ""animation"".  Do they mean if the movie looks good in picture format?  Or do they mean that the animations in the movie are crisp and smooth?  I don't think they even know to be honest.    You can go watch the movie yourself.  It was nice to look at for sure.  Perhaps it was better than HTTYD in this aspect.  But I'm not one to say."

(It is, in fact, considered by some to be somewhat of a ghetto which largely keeps animated features out of the Best Picture nominations.)  Of course, as we've read from surveys of voters in this category, many in the Academy don't particularly care about animation, and are frequently more likely to vote for something that kept their kids amused than something which is artistically accomplished."

I've always suspected that the winnner in the animated feature category is more determined by popularity, rather than quality. Since 2007, aside from Rango, the winner in that category has always simultaniously been the highest grossing film of the ones nominated (that I know of). And since Big Hero 6 was much more successful in the US than HTTYD 2...   Could be a coincidence but I don't really think so. That's a shame, because I think it would be cool if one of the two smaller films would win if HTTYD 2 doesn't. That at least would put some more unknown artists into the spotlight.

If people voted solely on box office, I'd be happy, since HTTYD 2 trumps all, but I feel like domestic box office might play a bigger role in the voters' US-centric decisions (although the ""two Chinese films"" /s being nominated does give me hope). Either way, I just hope BH6 doesn't win simply because it's Disney. I whole-heartedly agree with FantasticMrPanda that if HTTYD 2 doesn't win, I want one of the foreign films to win."

Hell, just last year I was one of those people (I loved Frozen, but have since gotten sick of hearing about it) but since HTTYD2 was ignored by virtually everyone while now BH6 has been slobbered over for the past few weeks I've grown irritated.

I've heard that from a lot of people. It's charming and funny, but doesn't have the solid foundation of HTTYD. Disney had been more or less been ignored by the Academy until Frozen, so you can't really say that the Academy people obsess over them. Pixar does genuinely make good animated movies, and I think a lot of what they've won has been deserved. This year it's How To Train Your Dragon's turn though. It won the Golden Globes, and the Annies. Academy be damned if they don't win the Oscars.   As an aside, even though the Academy Awards are not by far an accurate judge of animation, the Annie Awards are not without their fair share of controversy. Most notably, WALL-E did not win a single Annie Award in any category, even though it was a clear favorite, and I consider it to be one of the best animated films of all time. There was a scandal about buying votes and such. The next year Disney boycotted and so HTTYD 1 swept the Annies."

Rango certainly got lucky, but it was completely deserving of its award (Kung Fu Panda 2 was also good imho).

But HTTYD2 introduced a whole new animation software, and I think in the long run the technical aspects of that movie are going to have a bigger impact. Now the academy probably doesn't know any of this, so I'm expecting it to come down to popularity. I'm hoping for Dragon, but I'm also not going to be surprised if Hero gets it.

I like even ""exotic"" dragons like the chinese ones or the quetzalcoatl from aztec(mayan? i don't remember) religion, it seems strange to me that they never mentioned in httyd Jörmungandr the son of loki. I can't stand the dragons that are too childish in appearance and i don't think that httyd ones are childish because they are actually perfectly mash ups of real animals and i like trying to discern every animal in them.

Copyright law was extended in the US to last 70 years plus the lifetime of the author.

This greatly limits what kind of stories they can do to mostly circular plots that won't affect the next episode.
httyd,2w0l70,fyrenwater,6,Tue Feb 24 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"I think Season 1 is awful. Like, flat characters, stories made for toddlers, and constant poop jokes awful. It makes me cringe.  However, it gets progressively better as seasons progress. So think of season 1 as the hill you need to climb to get to the fun sledding point that is the rest of the show.  It doesn't compare to the movies, but it's good enough in my eyes to recommend to fans of the series."
httyd,2w0l70,ProcrastinatorSkyler,4,Mon Feb 16 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I almost stopped watching after the first episode due to the whole dragon poop thing. I mean, what the hell was that all about? But it did get better. I actually really enjoyed the last few episodes of the second season."
httyd,2w0l70,MechBear,3,Mon Feb 16 02:20:33 2015 UTC,"I like it.   Of course, the animation isn't as fluid as the movies but it definitely fulfils my Toothless needs (in a non-Rule 34 way).  It's definitely for younger viewers but I am not complaining. I get to see more dragons and that's good enough for me :)"

I haven't been that hooked on a TV show since MLP:FiM. Now I'm inpatiently waiting for the third season. Like many of you are saying, the characters are pretty simple but I guess it's the dragons that make it worth watching."

httyd,2w0l70,LawOfTheSeas,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I had only two episodes which I really enjoyed. The rest, meh. Some were okay, some were downright awful...  If you want to know, they were 'When Lightning Strikes' and 'The Eel Effect'. Both seemed to me to have far better development in both Toothless and the actual storylines. Also, don't be deceived like I was about David Tennant in this show. If you are like me, then you are a fan of David Tennant, and that was how I first got involved in the show. After watching 'Thawfest', my hopes were significantly lowered. Then I thought I would watch the other episode, 'Race to Fireworm Island'. That was okay enough to convince me to watch the series in my spare time (I had a lot - it turns out that having the flu does have some advantages...). But really, to repeat the words of others, not as good as the movies."

httyd,2w0l70,TheCommonChild,1 point,Tue Feb 17 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/fyrenwater, in that season one is cringy and awful - I seriously had a hard time watching Mildew (Mildu? Their spelling's always weird...) as a character. Overall, original characters are, in my opinion, really one-dimensional and plain.  But, I still enjoyed watching both seasons. I guess it's a think where you'll find the TV series watchable (and, to some degree, bearable) if you're a bigger fan of the HTTYD franchise and just want some continuation, but if you're just a casual watcher you might as well just skip them.  Oh, and my biggest disappointment with the series is that it's situated chronologically in the five year span between both films... But no character grows. Like, at all. I need me some character development. Dreamworks pls."

So here's the description I wrote:  Picture: Jonas Blomqvist, Yle News  In Finland, we have a traditional high school senior party called Penkkarit, in which it's custom to dress up as something. Now, instead of simply buying an oil sheikh costume for 20€ (like my hover-hand friend barely visible in this crop), I of course decided to put a month of my spare time and over 120 euros on creating the flight suit Hiccup wore in HTTYD 2.  Since I couldn't afford more and didn't have enough time, the prosthetic, the pants accompanied by leather straps, the sword and the helmet are missing from the set, along with some detail work on the bracers and the belts. Otherwise I'm pretty happy with how it turned out - I'm no leathersmith, and this was also my first self-made costume ever, so some pride has to be taken.  I'll be doing a better photoshoot in the upcoming days, the results of which I'll add to this album."

So, I got the original images from the press book (like here) and will try to do the same thing (join and cut out 16:9 wallpapers in .png). As for the text, while I don't have necessary skills to remove all of the text, Photoshop's Context-Aware tool can handle smaller sections of text pretty fine, which allows the crops to be more centered (examples in .jpg: 1 2 3). After I'm finished, I'd be happy to share the end results on Mega to again avoid any further compression."

The ones available here earlier are smaller in size and likely undergone recompression by imgur. Joined: joined pages in .png's to avoid any further recompression. 16:9 Wallpapers: cuts from joined .png's. Not all of them are pure cuts, some underwent Photoshop's content-aware tool in order to get rid of text/leftovers from cuts. I don't have required skills to do a really great job of it, but I believe the end results look reasonable (22.png underwent the biggest editing with an attempt to remove parts of ships from the sides).

It does have its sequel nature against it, but the first would have a good chance of winning in a year that didn't have Toy Story 3.  Of course, the Academy works in mysterious ways, and few would have predicted e.g. The Lego Movie being omitted from the nominations entirely, so we certainly can't be sure. But the odds are good."

httyd,2viwiv,mt_xing,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what i was thinking. Since the establishment of the academy for the best animated feature pixar/disney won 8 oscars against the only two of dreamworks that, incredibly, won the second with wallace and gromit. Now... I don't know what they were thinking at the time, but they managed to win against Corpse Bride of Tim Burton and Howl's Moving Castle. That's an amazing accomplishment but it think that those film were light years ahead than wallace and gromit. The same goes for last year academy, i love frozen and it's really a good movie, but it has nothing on the wind rises. So, truth been told it's not like it's disney/pixar against dreamworks, it's disney/pixar against everything. I just hope this year they'll realize how much of a masterpiece httyd2 is. Not only for the plot, but because it's all around perfect direction, soundtrack, animation, everything. And it's the only one movie that i think surpassed hands down his previous movie, seriously i can't think of an animated feature or a movie capable of doing that."

If you're looking for achievements, they're aaaalright for that I guess? It's more a case of sticking through boredom for it. The second game is far worse than the first especially on this point. It features about 5 minigames that are repeated over and over in 'tournements'.  Couple that with the dreadful controls and you'll soon know why its chucked in the bin by everyone.

Probably if i can found some players of my native language the game could be even enjoyable as a mmporg and not only in single player.

It has strong (but not necessary) pay to play components and was developed for kids in mind. Worth a shot though, if you want to try it, some of the minigames are enjoyable, so if you're into minigames (specifically flying) it's a fun way to waste half an hour."

httyd,2vbkaj,fyrenwater,5,Mon Feb 9 23:46:14 2015 UTC,"I'd love a HTTYD MMO. A full MMO, not one of those lobby-centric games that pretends they're an MMO.  You ever play a game called Lair? It was suppose to be a launch title for the PS3 I think.  Anyway, it was made by a group called Factor 5, which did the well known Rogue Squadron series.  Now Lair was basically Rogue Squadron, but with dragons. You'd fly around and shoot down other dragons of various types, and strafe ground targets during some such war.  By all accounts the game was terrible, but from the playthrough I watch it seemed okay. Suffered from that whole need to remove colour and sepia tone everything but other than that it look fairly enjoyable. What made Lair even cool was the ability to land your dragon, as you can see in the clip in the second line (at 1:00).  So basically, take Lair's controls and shove the HTTYD world over it. Naturally and open world game, maybe even an MMO that encourages players to explore the unknown.  That's what I imagine an HTTYD MMO to look like."

httyd,2usb00,autowikiabot,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"Heather:       Heather is a very good actress. She was able to pretend to be a helpless victim of a pirate raid and use her beauty to her advantage as the boys (with the exception of Hiccup) all fawned over her and let their guard down, allowing her to ask questions about their dragons' potential in battle as part of her mission to learn more about the dragons for the Outcasts. She also fooled Hiccup with her stranded girl routine act (though he was not attracted to her like the other riders). However, she was not able to fool Astrid, who could see through her ruse. She stated she wouldn't put a ruse in front of her because she was ""too smart for that"" showing her deceptive nature. Despite this, she was shown to not actually be a willing accomplice to the Outcasts, but was forced to work for them as they held her parents hostage and would not return them unless she reported to Alvin and the Outcasts with valuable information about the dragons. She seems very close to them, considering she worked with Alvin to ensure their safety. However, after escaping her prison she borrowed Stormfly and quickly attacked Alvin and his crew, showing how much she disliked them. She also apolgoized to Astrid and the gang, stating she wouldn't have believed her story of needing to save her parents after what she had done to them. This shows she is at heart a compassionate and sweet person, and is also very understanding. She seems very brave, as she confronted Alvin and also rode a dragon, despite her inexperience. She is also very crafty, using her acting skill to win over the riders, bribing Stormfly with chicken to fly on her, and escaping from her prison. In some ways, this makes her similar to Astrid.

httyd,2uhm6f,MissRainbowtie,8,Tue Feb 3 03:01:22 2015 UTC,Nice! The show will probably touch on the expansion of the world and Hiccup/Toothless trying new things.
httyd,2uhm6f,okisiroki,7,Mon Feb 2 05:51:22 2015 UTC,High hopes! World exploration/discovery is part of what makes httyd so great.  It'll definitely give the writers more creative leeway to come up with some great episodes.

httyd,2uhm6f,Rakaith,10,Mon Feb 2 11:07:56 2015 UTC,"The Vikings of old ""discovered"" the other side of the world before Columbus did. They were great explorers, and ended up landing in Newfoundland area Canada. I think the whole ""edge of the world"" didn't dissuade them even a little.  I wonder if they'll infer the dragons are now all in Canada. That would be awesome. And, lots of places for them to hide."
httyd,2uhm6f,Eddyoshi,3,Mon Feb 2 13:33:32 2015 UTC,Well I more think Berk is supposed to be set in the Nordic countries and its not really a real location so how do they end up in Canada?
httyd,2uhm6f,Rakaith,4,Mon Feb 2 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'd do anything to signify it's Canadian soil, I simply mean I wonder if they're going to do major exploration and end up in a new world, because they're pretty good at using Nordic lore and history in the movies."

httyd,2uh0g6,ObviousTryHard,18,Mon Feb 2 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"Well he obviously knows his fan base well, writing more about Toothless lol.   I'm glad he doesn't want to drag out the series though. Of course I want more, but it needs to be good. Though, I kinda have a sinking feeling that when he says ""if it continues, I won't be a part of it"" (paraphrased), that it means someone else will continue writing HTTYD movies and idk how I feel about that"
httyd,2uh0g6,shrinkyshrink,4,Mon Feb 2 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's all a question of following the storyline. Television series was directed and scripted by different people and it came out pretty well so far (apart from weird looking Toothless maybe..)  On the other hand (and after so many declarations that this is a trilogy) I probably won't treat any movie that comes out after HTTYD3 as ""kosher""."
httyd,2uh0g6,aquaz_,10,Mon Feb 2 07:19:10 2015 UTC,"DeBlois said the third would “continue to play with the timeline, but the story itself doesn’t jump year’s ahead; it actually plays back in time and forward. So there’s an element of meeting Hiccup at different period of his life.   Very intersting. Does anybody else think this might mean the movie opens up with the ""There were dragons when I was a boy"" quote? Meaning it starts with an adult Hiccup in Berk without dragons, then it goes back in time, and the entire movie is about telling the story of the dragons leaving. And then at the end it's revealed that the only dragon that hasn't left is Toothless because he would never leave Hiccup.Icanstillhopeokay"
httyd,2uh0g6,FantasticMrPanda,5,Mon Feb 2 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"Does anybody else think this might mean the movie opens up with the ""There were dragons when I was a boy"" quote?   No, I honestly don't think so. Dean DeBlois has stated a couple of times that he plans to end the movie with that quote. And even though he's already given away the ending in multiple interviews, I doubt he'd want to outright give away the fact that the dragons will leave right at the beginning. He'd probably want it to be a surprise for the casual movie-goer (those who don't read up on interviews, keep up with news, etc.)."
httyd,2uh0g6,mt_xing,4,Mon Feb 2 09:47:34 2015 UTC,"An I the only one still hoping for a ""This is Berk"" monologue to end the third movie?"
httyd,2uh0g6,twigenator,6,Tue Feb 3 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"you know, at every stage of me seeing stuff for new HTTYD I think I'm gonna hate it. Saw the trailer for the first one, didn't see it because it looked terrible. Same for the second then I caught a couple episodes of the show, and then watched the movies.  Seriously though, for pretty much any other series I would have serious misgivings towards a fragmented time story, with jumps forwards and back. Those usually turn out to be terrible, but I thought that about him meeting his mum."
httyd,2uh0g6,Rakaith,3,Mon Feb 2 08:07:13 2015 UTC,"You know, I was absolutely convinced I was going to hate this movie. I've had a life-long reverence of dragons, and the idea of ""training"" a dragon seemed preposterous. I got the impression it was training it like a dog or something, and the dragon does silly little tricks.  It took just that first scene with Hiccup and Toothless to totally change my mind. I was blown away by the whole thing, and very happy to be wrong."
httyd,2uh0g6,StoicSalamander,3,Mon Feb 2 13:42:21 2015 UTC,well if we're being honest the trailer for the first movie did not look good or promising. I thought it looked stupid. Glad I was wrong.
httyd,2uh0g6,Stoick_the_Vast,4,Mon Feb 2 16:44:22 2015 UTC,All I want is a wedding scene. IS that so much to ask?
httyd,2uh0g6,MigMigg,6,Mon Feb 2 12:07:46 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Perhaps there will be longer no-dialogue scenes with Toothless and other dragons- similar to WALL-E's.
httyd,2uh0g6,the_random_asian,6,Mon Feb 2 02:41:31 2015 UTC,I'm most excited about seeing Hiccup throughout different stages in his life. Now I know why Gerard Butler was confirmed for the third.

httyd,2udv0e,gomamon15,5,Sun Feb 1 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"HTTYD2's success with both the Annies and the GG is huge and definitely elevates it to ""frontrunner"" status for the Oscar. That said, no animated film has won the Oscar without getting a BAFTA nomination. HTTYD2 was snubbed, so if either BH6 or Boxtrolls win that particular award then we have a race.   If Lego Movie wins the BAFTA, then I think its truly Dragons 2 Oscar to lose."

httyd,2udv0e,FantasticMrPanda,2,Sun Feb 1 07:12:20 2015 UTC,"That's great, but I think it should be noted that this doesn't mean it's guaranteed to win the Oscar. In 2009, Kung Fu Panda won 11 awards over Oscar fontruner Wall-E, and in 2011 How To Train your Dragon won over Toy Story 3. Which made a lot of people think Dreamworks has some influence in the voting process of the Annie awards.   That's neved been confirmed though and all these wins for HTTYD 2 are very deserved. I'm still optimistic!"
httyd,2udv0e,Kama_,2,Sun Feb 1 10:29:37 2015 UTC,"Which made a lot of people think Dreamworks has some influence in the voting process of the Annie awards.   Because obviously it's a conspiracy if they don't mindlessly vote for the Pixar one. It's not like KFP wasn't a great film too, and visually/animation-wise I'd say it was superior to WALL-E.   Still, between this and the GG I'm hopeful for the Oscar."

As for Prodigal Son, I hadn't heard of it before now, but the description seems interesting and I like the stories where Hiccup leaves, so I may try reading it in the future."

I sometimes end up reading some sentences several times until the image is believable enough :P  Anyway, I personally don't apply other voices, but simply create my own.     Most OC characters have some sort of origin detail that decides an accent. Description of personality and mood decides manner of speaking (aggressive, passive, inteligent, friendly, etc.)        Dragons I like to voice with a low, slightly gravely voice and unusually strict grammar structure to indicate that they are speaking a ""foreign"" language, and that they're used to different grammar rules.

httyd,2tmik2,Deathninja300,20,Sun Jan 25 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"You can handwave quite a bit of it away depending on the fuel used to light it, but your main considerations are how well it slides, the fuel's burning temperature (thermal expansion, D/B transition temp) and how long it burns. Not to mention getting the fuel uniformly distributed across the blade.  e: The fuel is baby dragon saliva and it's soaked in the hilt with this. You just need a metal that will slide effectively and seal well at each collapsing stage's joint while being resistant to thermal expansion due to the heat of the flame (judging by the color of the flame, it's not excessively hot) Of course, the nonexistence of dragon spit makes this quite a bit tougher to make in the real world...

httyd,2tmik2,Zaiush,10,Sun Jan 25 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you coat the sword in any liquid. Even if you used something as viscous as napalm, it would fly in your face as you waved it around.   However, it's certainly possible if you pumped gas inside the loop.

httyd,2tmik2,okisiroki,4,Sun Jan 25 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well, now the question is a 1:1 facsimile of the one in the film or one that gives the desired effect. The dragon spit is the in-universe explanation."
httyd,2tmik2,Zaiush,12,Sun Jan 25 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"Sort of, yes.  I imagine it would have to be hooked up to a pump for the fuel.  And it would be more of a flaming stick than a sword.  And that's all his sword is anyways.  No real blade to it, and the collapsible nature of it makes it a poor choice to fight with. It's more for training dragons and looking like a badass."

httyd,2tbpjd,H_M_Murdock747,2,Fri Jan 23 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I have to say though, that it seems a little bit like two stories (three if you count the short stories at the end of some chapters). The first half is an amazing fantasy story, but then the second half is just a pretty good science fiction piece. They tie in together, and it's really one continuous story, but there is definitely a shift towards the sci-fi side of things after about 300k. I enjoyed it, but I feel like I should warn people to not expect pure how to train your dragon all the way through it.  It reminded me a little bit like ""standing against, standing between"" for the second half.  So if you liked that you will like this story, but if you can't stand sci-fi then this may not be the story for you."
httyd,2tbpjd,Shireling,3,Fri Jan 23 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"I like ""Standing Against, Standing Between"" It is a decent story and there are 3 other books to follow in that story arc and a new story arc following the same characters that happens after the events of the first series.

And I've been playing him consistently for 8 years through 2 movies and 3 seasons of the tv show. Hiccup is very important to me.   Is there going to be a how to train your dragon 3? ...potentially   Do you ever wish Viking villages like in the movie How to Train your Dragon actually existed? Just a fishing village on a cliff with a bunch of people wearing fur coats and eating fish and drinking mead. I sure do. yeah seems pretty chill   This goes for jay baruchel -Why is hiccup so important to you? because of how much he means to a whole bunch of people and what he represents   Whether by coincidence or by cause, that recovery happened during and in the following days after I first watched the movie How To Train Your Dragon. I've watched it a lot of times since, and I hold it in extremely high regard not just because I'll always associate it with finally regaining my capacity to feel emotions (besides self-loathing), but also because it's a really great movie...what sort of creative control do you have as a lead voice actor on a project like HTTYD when compared to the writers? (summarized: Full thread [here]) Honoured that we could play even a tiny roll in you feeling better. It's something I fight and deal with every day! Solidarity! And Dean is very cool about letting me find my own way into whatever we do. Chin up and stiff upper lip.   Listen man, no joke, my 2 year old loves the How to Train Your Dragon Movies. Do you get to actually hang out with the other actors in the movie while filming, or do you show up and record in a box alone for a few hours a day? Ok fine, i love the movies too. you and yer 2 year old have terrific taste! usually just me alone in a box   My real question is what kind of dragon would you want to ride? (Besides, Toothless, Night Fury) I can't cheat on Toothless   What are your favorite parts of the 2nd How to Train Your Dragon? Another thing is what is it like working with Dean DeBlois? I adore the battle sequences and really like when Toothless becomes the Alpha. Dean is the man and one of the worlds great storytellers. And another boy from Quebec, so lots of love.   Hey Jay, what do you think about vikings of Berk playing Hockey? Do you think Hiccup would be good in this sport? think the Vikings could do it. Hiccup would be shit.

httyd,2t5qb1,Pethrusii,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"Well, not all games are centred around gameplay really(EX: Telltale's the walking dead [97/100 ratings on steam], Alan Wake [93/100 ratings on steam]). And really all it takes is some altering in the plot of a fan fic to make it suitable for gameplay, just like what Dreamworks did to the book series of httyd to make it suitable to be a movie."

When the line is moved to the back ( imagine layers) your brain translates the object in the picture moving toward you.  Credit to /u/climberoftalltrees

Unfair! :P (Won't be mad though if he wins, his score for the Deathly Hallows was brilliant).  Back on topic, I enjoyed Big Hero 6 but I thought HTTYD2 was a much stronger movie. I think it helped that being a sequel, it already had something to build on in terms of character development and the overall story progression. The animation was breathtaking, and they put in so much attention to detail - for example in the ""Together we Map the World"" scene with Hiccup and Astrid, you can see Stormfly and Toothless having fun in the background.  I can't offer opinion in regards to the other nominations though, since I haven't seen any more of them. Would LOVE to see a Ghibli film win it, if not HTTYD2.  EDIT: words"

httyd,2sspxf,MissRainbowtie,6,Sun Jan 18 03:17:04 2015 UTC,I'm not.
httyd,2sspxf,MigMigg,5,Sun Jan 18 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"... okay.  Sway me.  I think they're pretty much even on the grounds that if you take each movie as they are on their own, BH6 is marginally better.  HTTYD2 benefits a lot from the world that's been built by the previous movies and TV series.  The HTTYD score, while awesome, pretty much follows the same themes of the previous movie. BH6's score, is not super inspiring, but it's not horrible either.  Animation in HTTYD2 is a vast improvement on the first movie, as would be expected.  But compared to BH6... I dunno. Pretty even.  BH6's Visual design is all from scratch, while HTTYD2's builds from it's predecessors. They did a bang-up job of aging the characters.  Story-wise I think HTTYD2 has a good lead on BH6.  The emotional impacts are all there, good pace and nice resolution.  While BH6 leaves a few loose ends and feels a bit rushed through."
httyd,2sspxf,okisiroki,11,Sun Jan 18 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"I'm all for more discussion.  Score  Yes, themes are used from previous movie but Powell manages to expand upon these with leitmotif in a way that has more depth, maturity and emotional gravitas. It's also much more memorable that BH6's. Immortals is good too but it's nothing like HTTD2's orchestral.   Animation  Some of the human characters in BH6 felt a little too plastic to me, almost a regression from Frozen. The standout moments were introducing the microbots, the equivalent of 'Romantic Flight/Test Drive' with Baymax and the world through the portal. San Fran Sokyo was gorgeous but HTTYD2 blew me away with its landscapes and establishing shots. I wish BH6 explored a bit more of its beautiful cityscape. Also, the texture of the snow after 'Flying With Mother' scene left me stunned. Some moments felt a little forced too (probably because they're working with the new motion capture tech) but overall I prefer the visuals of HTTYD2.  Story  Agreed. Pacing was an issue in both films I think but BH6 felt markedly more rushed.   Character arcs: Hiccup matured into his own, Eret found redemption with the riders and Valka is slowly readjusting to her role as a mother and member or Berk society. BH6 has the maturing of Hiro coming to terms with grief but that's about it. The main gang are interesting but very one dimensional in terms of character. There's also the main twist/spoiler regarding the villain but that also felt slightly forced.   Plot points: HTTYD2 had a better flow when attempting to tie up its diverging story lines with Hiccup and this family vs the gang and Drago. BH6 started off shaky with a lot of forced exposition between the brothers.   Emotional impact  Both these films got me. But HTTYD2 hit me harder. I laughed more in BH6 but I came away from HTTYD2 feeling more complete. The Marvel-esque ending of BH6 really did detract slightly from the film."
httyd,2sspxf,Angelin01,2,Sun Jan 18 04:22:55 2015 UTC,hmm..  a lot to think on. I may have to watch both films again with those points in mind.  Thank you. :)

httyd,2sm40b,Usmarine33,5,Fri Jan 16 09:23:22 2015 UTC,"You get SO much more satisfaction if you don't watch the trailer. I didn't watch the HTTYD2 trailer (despite everyone thinking I was a crazy person), and not knowing about Valka put the entire movie in a different light than I imagine I would have seen if I'd known. I also had a feeling from the moment we learned about Hiccup's mom that Stoic was going to die--if I had known that from the trailer I would have been devastated."
httyd,2sm40b,penelope1873,3,Fri Jan 16 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"Just like what everybody says here. Dreamworks is just like your hyper-talkative friend that whenever sees you jumps to your side and burns the plot of half the year's hit films that he watched yesterday but you're still planning to watch.  what do you do? Avoid that friend and don't even dare glimpse at him, that's Dreamworks trailers for ya (coming to think about it, that's any modern trailer)"
httyd,2sm40b,imaginaryvenus5,3,Fri Jan 16 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm gonna avoid it like the plague.  Finding out about the whole Valka thing and that it was supposed to have been revealed in the movie not the trailer really irked me.  I know it's not a big deal but after hearing how it was supposed to be I was really bummed I didn't get to experience it that way and knew waaaay beforehand she was still alive.   When I was younger and more into movies, trailers were awesome, and got me amped up for the latest stuff.  Now with all the stale movies coming out there's only ever a few I want to see, and I don't need to watch the trailer to be excited for it.  Doing the same for the new Star Wars, saw the teaser but I will literally wait outside the theatre when trailers if I'm at a movie start to make sure I don't see anything else"
httyd,2sm40b,flappinginthewind,2,Fri Jan 16 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I can't help but think I would have enjoyed the second movie a lot more if I didn't know about Valka in advance.

(""He's back... for good"" or whatever it was) Trailer's spoil stuff. The only HTTYD2 trailer that didn't spoil anything (at least I think so) was with the flying scene.   I was really hate myself for watching other trailers. Especially because I knew who the bad guy was and his mother before I watched the movie.   Now I still enjoyed the movie very much. But if I didn't know these things, I'd have been so much more excited when watching it.   Be patient - be rewarded I guess."

httyd,2siiik,gomamon15,23,Thu Jan 15 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, really surprising about The Lego Movie. HTTYD2's chances are looking good after the Golden Globes win, and now this.   I'm a little disappointed that John Powell didn't get a nomination, but there are a lot of contenders in that category."
httyd,2siiik,Mithent,13,Thu Jan 15 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit bummed about John Powell as well, but 2014 was such an awesome year for scores that it's hard to be mad. Rooting for Grand Budapest Hotel in that category now, though like I said all nominees are fantastic.  The LEGO movie not being nominated took me completely by surprise too. To be honest, I thought it would win."
httyd,2siiik,FantasticMrPanda,8,Thu Jan 15 15:17:53 2015 UTC,I honestly feel like Powell will win the Oscar in 2017 for HTTYD3 was a reward for his whole body of work on the trilogy.
httyd,2siiik,Asdamk,14,Thu Jan 15 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"I hope so. I'm glad that Lego Movie got snubbed... it's decent, but not really a great movie. There's still Big Hero 6 in the category, though. It might win just because it's a Disney film.  Let's hope for the best."
httyd,2siiik,Kireshai,6,Thu Jan 15 13:57:44 2015 UTC,Indeed. Hope for the best prepare for the worst. Hopefully the Golden Globe win gives it some help.
httyd,2siiik,Stoick_the_Vast,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Lol, 'it might win because it's a Disney film'.Disney animated canon films were constantly snubbed by the academy until frozen, and they'll likely go right back to snubbing them again. Pixar films are the ones that get a free pass, like the year brave won over wreck it Ralph."
httyd,2siiik,Mithent,8,Fri Jan 16 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can see competing with How to Train Your Dragon would be Princess Kaguya. The art style is progressive and the overall quality is really good and it's made by Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Totoro, Mononoke) so the impressive lineage shows in the film. Big Hero 6 was pretty great too, but the overall quality is just below How to Train Your Dragon. The emotions conveyed didn't really go as far or hit as hard as HTTYD so that's where we lead on Big Hero. I am pulling for Hiccup obviously, but it will be a close contest between the three and let's be real, the Oscar's and the people who select the nominations and the winners aren't really the most neutral people."
httyd,2siiik,Stoick_the_Vast,3,Thu Jan 15 15:36:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Princess Kaguya yet (I should!) but while it's a Studio Ghibli movie, it wasn't by Miyazaki - that one's by Isao Takahata, the studio's other co-founder."

httyd,2siiik,twigenator,5,Thu Jan 15 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. It probably should have gotten a nom (like I've said before, I did like Lego Movie), but I think the internet's reaction has been hilarious.

httyd,2siiik,T-Rex_Is_best,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:06:31 2015 UTC,isn't it getting a nomination saying that person or group or whatever thinks it should get the Oscar?
httyd,2siiik,ThePostItNote,2,Thu Jan 15 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose so. I kind of see it as the nomination is kind of a ""Your movie was better than most this year"" which is true for the Lego Movie, it was good. I just don't think that it should be the winner."
httyd,2siiik,fortinj1354,2,Thu Jan 15 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"I kind of see it as the nomination is kind of a ""Your movie was better than most this year"" which is true for the Lego Movie, it was good   for us consumers, that is effectively what to look at it as. if you are making a nomination, it probably means you think it should win that Oscar."
httyd,2siiik,ThePostItNote,3,Thu Jan 15 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"HTTYD in my opinion, will likely win. Big Hero is an AMAZING movie, but it lacks the depth of HTTYD 2."
httyd,2siiik,Mizz_Fizz,5,Thu Jan 15 14:07:16 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree on the assessment of BH6. It wasn't memorable, the only cast that got any arcs were Hiro and Baymax (unlike in HTTYD and the sequel where the supporting characters got some kind of development.) and it felt like some parts were closely copied from the first HTTYD film. Also, I cannot for the life of me even recall any of the soundtrack.   There was a lot of emotion that they started out on promising notes....and then never went deeper into it because the story threads just weren't given enough time before they were resolved. Take Tadashi's death - it happened before we could get attached to him, and he was so damn perfect there wasn't much to relate to or love. Like him, we could, but not love him. So the death felt hollow."
httyd,2siiik,aquaz_,2,Thu Jan 15 15:13:10 2015 UTC,"If you are interested, check out the song ""First Flight"" from the soundtrack. It (naturally) has a very test drive feel to it."

httyd,2siiik,Hollandrock,3,Thu Jan 15 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't like big hero six as Much as most. To me, it was an hour or so of entertainment. It didn't stick with me as much as some animations. Definitely think Dragons should Win."
httyd,2siiik,shrinkyshrink,3,Thu Jan 15 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"I've never cared much about Oscars, but today it was all like ""GOGO DRAGONS"" :X And I think Powell should at least get a nomination - for me HTTYD2 soundtrack was as good as the previous one.  It's a shame that ceremony is always at night in my timezone."
httyd,2siiik,TheCommonChild,3,Thu Jan 15 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Dang, that stinks. And I do agree that Powell deserved a nomination this year, but as I've said below I truly believe his time will come. Most likely if he does as good on the third Dragons film as he has on the last two he will win then.   Until then, let us just be happy Dragons 2 not only got the Oscar nomination for Best Animated Film, but that it may actually be the frontrunner."
httyd,2siiik,jaketessem,0,Thu Jan 15 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"I would say the first one was better than the second. Leaving the theatre I was not as impressed. It is still a good OST but to me not as good. But I am going with Interstellar to win. Besides Stoick's Ship and Dragon Racing the songs weren't great. Not as strong. Unlike Forbbidem Friendship, test drive, this is Berk, new tail, see you tomorrow. For Interstellar the song where the protagonist is driving away from home, when they go next to the back hole. Strong stuff"

httyd,2sftmj,Zazama,2,Thu Jan 15 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"Since it is a trilogy, I think that ending on that note would have made for an interesting third movie."
httyd,2sftmj,Circularlogic54,2,Thu Jan 15 22:16:31 2015 UTC,Slow down Satan. D:
httyd,2sftmj,Circularlogic54,2,Mon Jan 19 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"Well let's stop and think. Besides the fact that it ending the movie there would likely tear every user on this subreddit apart because of the wait, more room could be created to have a second part to the events of the second movie. Then the current plot for the third movie could be the fourth movie. Depending on who you are, four movies is better than three and we could keep getting content from this universe for a little while longer. Also, I personally would liked to have had an entire movie dedicated to the gang getting home and finding a way to take Berk back from Bloodfist after he had already conquered the island. This would also give them much more time to explain alpha Toothless."
httyd,2sftmj,Circularlogic54,2,Mon Jan 19 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"From a normal movie point of view, I agree.   From my ""this is a children's movie and I remember how long it took to stop me from crying as a kid when I watched the fox and the hound"" I would like to maintain my last statement. Please Satan think of the children.   (I'm joking around here. I do see the potential behind it, but the movies target audience is children. It's really hard to deal with a kid after they see a sad movie, specially if the ending is sad. AKA if by some miracle I ever have children I'm never letting them watch watership down as kids.)"
httyd,2sftmj,Usmarine33,2,Mon Jan 19 02:54:37 2015 UTC,I stopped for a moment and thought about what you said and I realized something. Only children's movies have ever been able to make me tear up. But ya I see your point. You really can't end a children's movie on a note like that.
httyd,2sg2pw,gomamon15,7,Wed Jan 14 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like the internet will be really mad if the Lego Movie doesn't win Best Animated film, after what happened at the Golden Globes. That said, I'm still (obviously) on team HTTYD 2. The first one got snubbed already; we don't need a repeat."
httyd,2sg2pw,mt_xing,9,Wed Jan 14 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I'd welcome that. I'd welcome that so much it's not even funny.  I enjoyed Lego but the reaction from everyone on Reddit (with the exception of /r/HTTYD obviously) when Dragons 2 won has pissed me off to the point where I Would laugh if Lego didn't get a nomination - which probably won't happen, but I'm keeping it off my prediction list on the off chance it does. People act like Dragons 2 was a terrible film and Lego was like The Godfather. FFS   Then again, it's a movie with humor directly aimed at the Internet generation so no wonder they salivate for it."
httyd,2sg2pw,mt_xing,11,Wed Jan 14 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, both movies were good. They both had strong morals, many layers, deep thought, and appeal to audiences larger than 3 year old kids.  The key difference is that The Lego Movie tries ever so slightly too hard to pander to the 3 year olds in the audience. It still has appeal for an older audience, but less so. It's less emotionally satisfying. It's less risky. It's more formulaic. It's morals are simpler. And every potentially emotional moment is truncated for a bit of cheap slapstick humor.  The Lego Movie is a kids movie with some added moral baggage. How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a movie that just happens to also appeal to kids. That's the difference, and why I want HTTYD 2 to win."

httyd,2sa062,Shireling,5,Tue Jan 13 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"It reads interestingly, I have to say - Definitely some potential here, in my opinion.  Looking at the gang and Toothless at age six (or whatever corresponding age Toothless is) is certainly an interesting point of view, and a fresh one at that. Something you might want to keep an eye on is the dialogue of the kids - since they're only six years old, you might want to make sure their lines correspond to their age and knowledge. The dialogue felt good, but I feel you're close to the too-mature-for-their-age border, so keep it in mind when you write.  Your little insertion of Norse mythology is something I'd like to see more of, as I love stories which incorporate the mythology and practices of the Viking age!  Finally, a pro-tip for future chapters: I've seen a lot of stories that use phrases and sayings that cannot have existed in the Viking era, due to their referral to a modern invention, so watch out for that - not that you did it here, but I've seen enough of this problem in other fanfics to be nervous about it...  Otherwise, I feel the story as a whole as potential and could definitely be something enjoyable and interesting. I don't really know if I can comment on grammar and language, since English isn't my first language, but there wasn't really anything that stood out to me - except 'Stoic'; his name is Stoick, with a 'ck' ;)"
httyd,2sa062,ronitopp,3,Tue Jan 13 13:57:47 2015 UTC,"His name is Stoick!  I made sure to google every single name, except for Stoick. I figured, hey I can spell stoic, but I guess that shows what arrogance gets you.  Thanks for pointing that out."
httyd,2sa062,shrinkyshrink,4,Tue Jan 13 23:20:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything u/ronitpp says, tons of potential with your story, and the kids age is different. I don't know how I feel about it though, id like to read more before I decide whether I like it or not for sure, but I'm sure that as long as you dont give them adult thoughts/actions it'll turn out fine.   I really like the part from Toothless's perspective! Some fanfics IMO give him way too much human knowledge, or treat him as a creature that hasn't learned anything from observing the humans, and I think you give him a good balance.  Can't wait to read more!"

The story is set in the period when he comes back and beautifully incorporates details from both movies and takes an extremely interesting path of story in general and adds intriguing twists to the stories of several of the Httyd characters that fill-in a lot about them.

The fact that he let Hiccup regain the bond in the first place was stupid, but you can't blame him for thinking he had the game won with the Bewilderbeast alpha on his side."
httyd,2s4jxr,rozniak,3,Mon Jan 12 03:17:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was stupid of him to allow Hiccup to regain Toothless but at that moment in time he probably felt unbeatable and there was no way that anyone could stop him. He was trying to show Hiccup that there was nothing he could do and once Hiccup failed Toothless would attack him and then it would be all over for him. There was no way Drago could have expected Hiccup to regain Toothless and he did try to attack Toothless to stop him going back to Hiccup. Unfortunately for Drago, he was just too late"

httyd,2s4jxr,Angelin01,2,Mon Jan 12 03:33:48 2015 UTC,Erhm... I'm assuming the army eventually arrived and was welcomed by a hundred or so angry dragons. On wooden boats... on a big ocean... you know.

Everytime he readied an attack, he was blasted by hundreds of Dragon Fire. He had no choice but to retreat or else he would have faced further injuries.   With regards to the army, I'm sure none of the men were that loyal to Drago. As Hiccup said in the film, Drago needed dragons to conquer people so once Drago's men had seen that all the dragons were no longer under Drago's control and Drago and the Bewilderbeast were gone then none of them saw enough reason to try and take control of Berk."

And we just stood there a bit away from the kids area watching the movie standing up.

Instead of How to Train Your Dragon 2 we have Boxtrolls, the overrated 90-minute toy commercial, and Big Hero 6.  Oh, and apparently Big Hero 6 hasn't even been released in England yet, but it still got on there, because Disney."

httyd,2runqb,Saluco,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This award season has been a nightmare for me, except the success of The Grand Budapest Hotel. I f-cking love that movie, and actually think it may end up being a strong Best Picture contender. Also I'd love is Ralph Fiennes gets a nom, and maybe even win. He is LONG overdue for an Oscar.  That said, my 2 other favorite films of the year (Interstellar and Dragons 2) seem to be partners in getting snubbed.   I haven't seen Big Hero 6, but I feel like it's getting its nominations over Dragons because of it being a Disney film - same case with Laika as The Boxtrolls has a measly 74% on RottenTomatoes to Dragons' 92%, yet the former is getting far more award love than the latter. Heck, HTTYD2 has a higher RT and Meteoritic score than Big Hero 6 as well.  I went into this year thinking the Dragons franchise would finally get its Oscar due. Now I'm thinking it may not even get an Oscar nomination, which honestly would just leave me shaking my head at this point.  I'm sick of Disney and the blind praise it gets from everyone. I'm done with film awards and its politics.  I'm just done."
httyd,2runqb,Saluco,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"How can you compare Big Hero Six or Boxtrolls to D2 if you haven't seen them?   Here's an article about award ballots if you hadn't seen it before.  Basically the problem is not really politics, but that it's more of a popularity contest. You're trusting a large group of people to watch all of the nominated animated features and not just vote for the one you happen to recognize or the only one you saw this year.  I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade, I'm rooting for D2 as much as you are, but you should at least know more about BH6 and Boxtrolls than just their RT scores."
httyd,2runqb,Kireshai,2,Fri Jan 9 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yep I've seen that article before. Unfortunately it does little to calm my rage.  I agree too. Voters went with what was overhyped (Lego) and then with the more ""prestigious"" companies of Laika (Boxtrolls) and Disney (Big Hero 6)."

I'm just gonna not watch any of the award shows and hear later on who won. Seeing HTTYD2 lose would be too painful.  Though I do think if it somehow pulls off a miraculous win at the Golden Globes it still has a strong chance at getting the Oscar. That said I think actually Big Hero 6 is going to be the one to take the wind out of Lego's sails and win the GG, BAFTA, and then the Oscar. Lego has the Critic's Choice all but locked up at this point.   I hope HTTYD2 gets the GG and Oscar, but my confidence is dwindling)."

From the Sigur-ros website:   jónsi sang most songs in icelandic but a few of the songs were sung in 'hopelandic'. all of the vocals ( ) are however in hopelandic. hopelandic (vonlenska in icelandic) is the 'invented language' in which jónsi sings before lyrics are written to the vocals. it's of course not an actual language by definition (no vocabulary, grammar, etc.), it's rather a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music and acts as another instrument. jónsi likens it with what singers sometimes do when they've decided on the melody but haven't written the lyrics yet.   Cool to hear the song in its pre-release state :D"

The specific clip starts here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrX5JvcM_A8#t=91  I always thought the lyrics for this song fit the characters pretty well, so I'm not surprised that it may have been used as a placeholder sometime during production.  By the way, the rest of the album is pretty damn fantastic and a lot of the songs - especially Boy Lilikoi and Animal Arithmetic - have the same upbeat, driving quality that ""Where No One Goes"" embodies. The album ""Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust"" by Sigur Ros (go figure) is also excellent."

In fact, given how much you value emotional heft, I thought you'd love this story, or at least like it better than Zombie!Hiccup.   I'll admit that the nonhuman dialogue is a tricky move, which is possibly why it has so much narration to clarify it. It took me a while to settle into it, but it felt worth it because I was impressed by the author's thorough exploration of a feral mind.  I highly recommend giving this story another chance."

httyd,2rg59m,Angelin01,2,Tue Jan 6 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"It's not quite english. The Vikings of Berk speak english, but they write in a runic alphabet that doesn't quite match up. Complex words with redundant or extraneous letters are shortened and simplified.   For example, we have two letters that make a 'kk' sound (C and K) but the runic alphabet will only have one. It might also have specific runes for 'CH' and 'SH' type sounds, I haven't looked close enough to check.  You can totally translate what's written in runes into english, or even learn to read it, but it isn't quite english itself."

I still need to see Fantastic Mr. Fox in its entirety. A while back I caught some of it on TV and thought it was great. Actually, I need to start watching more Wes Anderson films in general. Saw Grand Budapest Hotel earlier this year and loved it."
httyd,2rf1q4,nukeclears,3,Mon Jan 5 19:15:31 2015 UTC,None really. Weirdly.
httyd,2rf1q4,PM_ME_TOOTHLESS_PICS,3,Mon Jan 5 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm on the same boat. I've been thinking of other animated movies I've really enjoyed, and none come to my mind. Maybe it is because animated movies are often much targeted for younger audiences. HTTYD really stood out on this, with deeper story and enjoyable experience for all ages.  Or it might be just that I don't watch movies too often."
httyd,2rf1q4,nukeclears,3,Mon Jan 5 23:10:58 2015 UTC,It's a general thing with movies for me. None of them stick with me. I just watch them..... And that's that.   Nothing more   HTTYD being that one odd exception.
httyd,2rf1q4,PM_ME_TOOTHLESS_PICS,2,Mon Jan 5 23:15:43 2015 UTC,Check out my reply to PM_ME_TOOTHLESS_PICS if you want my take.   I'd also add that I think Toothless not being able to talk is another draw for this franchise. He displays more character and personality solely through his fascial expressions and movements than most animated characters in others films do with complete dialogue. That shows great talent from a directorial standpoint.   And John Powell's music destroys literally every other animated film score of the last decade AT LEAST.
httyd,2rf1q4,Angelin01,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:47:27 2015 UTC,"Same here, strengthened by the fact I rarely watch movies. The one I can think of other than HTTYD is Cameron's Avatar, which was quite unique. The film industry can be really dull at times."
httyd,2rf1q4,nukeclears,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'm in with you on this one. Avatar and maybe Kung Fu Panda 2 are probably the only ones that stood out for me a bit more. Of course, right behind HTTYD :) (I still hate you, nukeclears, for this)"
httyd,2rf1q4,KingArthurP,2,Tue Jan 6 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"You should check out some Studio Ghibli stuff if you haven't already. They are ten times better than pretty much any american animated film AND they don't cater quite as much to younger audiences (and some, like Princess Mononoke, are for adults).  HTTYD, I personally feel, is sort of like an ""american anime"" in that it takes risks and touches on darker themes. Plus so much of the story if told through visuals as opposed through dialogue. Most American animated films are geared towards younger audiences and/or are comedic in nature. HTTYD is more focused on creating a unique and breathtaking experience while telling a great character-driven story.   In general, from what I can see, HTTYD is closer to something out of Studio Ghibli than films made by Pixar and Disney, but perhaps that is just me."
httyd,2rf1q4,babeman083,2,Mon Jan 5 23:43:12 2015 UTC,I can't stand anime tropes though.
httyd,2rf1q4,OrangeW,1 point,Tue Jan 6 11:32:21 2015 UTC,"Ghibli goes far beyond tropes though, that's why their films have achieved such critical acclaim, mainly because they're so accessible by any audience. Plus the fact that some of them can be quite dark and don't shy away from the disturbing e.g. certain scenes in Howl's and Princess Mononoke"
httyd,2rf1q4,H_M_Murdock747,2,Wed Jan 7 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"Megamind, Kung Fu Panda, Atlantis the lost empire and batman assault on arkham are my favorite"

httyd,2rf1q4,KingArthurP,3,Tue Jan 6 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"For me, I really liked Frozen when I saw it last year, but have since gotten really, REALLY sick of hearing about it (though I'm starting to feel that way about Disney in general). Plus it frustrates me to no end that HTTYD2 is a far better film, yet disappoints at the domestic box office while Frozen rakes in billions because of one really popular song and ""it's Disney."" For this reason, I've grown to be quite bitter the last couple of months towards the state of animation.   It's like people just want the same old animated films. They shrug off DreamWorks (even really good films by them) while flocking to the theaters for whatever film Disney or Pixar churned out. What's worse is that people claim it is because DreamWorks ""offers nothing new"" - even though Disney doesn't either. It's just a hive-mind of sorts. The only exception is when an animated film is a comedy (i.e. LEGO Movie). Serious animated films not made by Disney or Pixar never get the attention they deserve, and it is a shame.  Okay, my rant is over. <steps off from my soap-box>  I also liked Tangled, and have yet to see Brave. Not as big of a Pixar fan as most people. Their films are good, but to me they are overhyped. Also I am one of the few people that will say HTTYD was better than TS3."

Big Hero 6 was also a nice one that I got to see recently but I don't know exactly how I would rate it besides saying that it is better than most of the other animated crap that has been out in the past few years."
httyd,2rf1q4,herlifedistractions,1 point,Tue Jan 6 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I've also enjoyed the Studio Ghibli movies (I saw The Wind Rises recently). Otherwise, hmm... I quite enjoy animation in general, and it's difficult to pick a few stand-outs. I remember particularly liking Ratatouille, The Lion King, Finding Nemo and Lilo & Stitch, although I haven't seen any of them in years.  Of things I've seen more recently,  The Croods was better than I expected, and The Book of Life had a pretty unique art style, even if the story wasn't the strongest. Frozen was mostly good for the songs and the twist on the Disney formula, but I am surprised by its overwhelming success (I wouldn't have rated it much above Tangled, which was also not bad), and didn't really get on with Olaf. I want to see Big Hero 6 when it comes out here.   (Oh, and your username reminds me: not a movie, but I also remember being really into the first series of Digimon. I'd get up early to watch it on TV, and get annoyed whenever Fox Kids played the episodes out of order. I never did get to see the full thing.)"
httyd,2rco47,DefectiveHamster,5,Mon Jan 5 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"Good for Arnold, Dreamworks really needs some staff adjustment in order to succeed in the future. Hopefully this doesn't affect her schedule with Httyd 3, she's been a fantastic producer for the dragons movies."
httyd,2rco47,RuthlessRampage,10,Mon Jan 5 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I truly feel that if DreamWorks plays its cards right it can become the best animation company in the country. It has shown far more ambition and a greater willingness to touch on darker topics than Disney and even Pixar in my opinion. DreamWorks just needs to work on picking the right projects to carry out. People may laugh at them, but they have a LOT of potential."

Money was 29%/71%; domestic to foreign ratio.  Compared to 44/56 for the first film.  HTTYD2 grossed higher in total.  619 to 495 million."
httyd,2qybzi,MigMigg,2,Wed Dec 31 22:42:18 2014 UTC,"The sequel increased its take compared to the first in most overseas territories (for example, in the UK, $26.5 -> $41.5 million; Australia, $16.9 million -> $24.8 million; Germany $15.5 million -> $27.0 million) and also performed well in China, taking in $65 million.

It cannot rely on company name alone to draw a crowd. Had Dragons been a Disney franchise it would have raked in piles of cash. Because it isn't, its advertising team must work that much harder.  It did not matter how good HTTYD2 was, it was going to be overlooked because the only animated films that people care about now-a-days are Disney and Pixar, or are highly comedic (as in the case of LEGO). This is a shame because so long as this mentality exists the same kind of cookie-cutter films will be made.   Unfortunately we live in a world where HTTYD2 got overlooked by general audiences while Despicable Me 2 and Frozen broke records."

httyd,2qybzi,gomamon15,1 point,Fri Jan 2 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I think one of the reasons that Dragons 2 did not make as much money was because of how dark it was.  I was reading through comments on HTTYD's Facebook page on a link, and found a ton of people complaining about Stoick's death. One even said it 'turned him away from the franchise.'  I have come to the conclusion that people (esp. people in the US) want cookie-cutter stories when it comes to animated films. They want comedy and happy endings, that it all. That is why it did better overseas - the death was less jarring to non-American audiences. If there is a death in a kid's movie we expect it near the beginning with a character we hardly know, not near the end with a character that has been in 1.5 films and a couple of seasons in the TV show. It is a damn shame, but that is how I interpret this.  If this movie loses the Oscar, I can guarantee you that is the reason why."

Besides, if Drago was to be killed, the Alpha's would likely have fought anyways with a likely similar outcome, but without Drago involvbe anymore, I doubt that Hiccup and Toothless would have strengthened their bond like they did or nfind out about Toothless' Alpha powers (or whatever you'd like to call them).

Like for instance, i was hoping to hear a solid theme close to Forbidden friendship. But was happy to hear Test Flight in there as well. but i liked the first Score better. Also, no one can beat Hans Zimmer, he made the music to my favorite long lost game (MW2, i am no cod fan but i loved that game), Lion King, Interstellar, Pirates of the Carribean."
httyd,2qpdj8,TheCommonChild,2,Tue Dec 30 05:10:36 2014 UTC,"I always considered Flying With Mother as the ""equivalent"" of Forbidden Friendship in this OST. Both themes came at a time of the movie when there was a real shift in the story (I guess, dunno how else to put it), and the music just takes over."
httyd,2qpdj8,rithsv,2,Tue Dec 30 06:32:48 2014 UTC,I really didn't think the score to Interstellar was very good. Watching the film it just seemed to be alternating between white noise and absence of sound. I certainly wasn't excited by it.  Is this an unpopular/uncommon opinion?

httyd,2qo1ma,MissChicGeek,1 point,Tue Dec 30 06:50:19 2014 UTC,"the causeway is basalt columns, formed (iirc) by lava hitting the sea (no idea why it makes that hexagonal shape when it does, but there you go).      they exist all over the world (though not always on the scale of the causway).  probably a fair bit of the land around there has them as dragon island was basically a volcano.  It might have been a v volcanica area before that with a lot of basalt column forming?"
httyd,2qo1ma,uisge-beatha,1 point,Thu Jan 1 14:48:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wasn't aware that there were other locations similar to that in the world, but definitely a good point.  Like I said, it's completely plausible that they were just two totally different locations with the same formations."
httyd,2qkk78,Sango12592,3,Sat Dec 27 23:28:15 2014 UTC,"I never thought Toothless could be this creepy.  Looks great, though! Good luck, it must be really a lot of work, cosplay like that... Can't wait to see the final version. Keep on being awesome!"
httyd,2qkk78,Asdamk,3,Sun Dec 28 01:26:09 2014 UTC,"As impressive as it is, don't forget about the accuracy, the eyes are placed rather high up and the eyes are on the side of his face rather than ""flat""  or what to call it."
httyd,2qkk78,pogo101650,2,Sun Dec 28 01:40:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately I didn't notice the eyes were a bit off until I got too far along to fix it. I might fix it if I ever go back to do improvements, but with my current time-crunch it'd be a time waster."
httyd,2qkk78,Buhnanuers,2,Sun Dec 28 02:46:34 2014 UTC,"Ah I see, how long time would it take to fill those holes and add new ones? Would be sad if the eyes would take away from the final appearance."
httyd,2qlab9,Plailect,3,Sun Dec 28 04:18:13 2014 UTC,"I thought it was a sad fic... until I started reading it. Oh, there were a few moments that could be defined as 'sad', especially the ending, but it wasn't anything exceptional.  The fanfic was... decent. It lacked interaction with Toothless, that's for sure. On the other hand, I'm not entirely sure how said interaction could work with Hiccup being a bodyless spirit most of the story.  As much as reading about interactions with numerous gods and other creatures from Norse mythology, I can't get rid of the feeling that the whole story pulled a Pinball Protagonist. If Hiccup decided to just sit by his body and wait, everything would end up pretty much the same.  It wasn't sad, it was optimistic (well, kinda), and lacked emotional attachement to characters. It was an okay story in my opinion, but nothing more."
httyd,2qlab9,Asdamk,3,Sun Dec 28 19:19:44 2014 UTC,"I liked this story because it wasn't a downer. It's a surreal trip through the afterlife. Nicely bittersweet, but not too depressing.   While it might have been appropriate for the ramifications of death to sink in at some point, that's also a very obvious emotional reaction and therefore possibly a boring one.   What the author described well were all the little emotions of the moment, like when Hiccup wonders if he's going to make it and then he decides to stop painfully breathing.   This isn't a downer story because it's a Hiccup Being A Hero story, where death simply means that he gets to duke it out with Norse gods instead of dragons. I liked that. It's not death as the end of everything, but death as a transformation. Kind of an optimistic idea, really.   For me, the weakest part of this story was the plot. Yes, the action moves and Hiccup goes to exciting places and does exciting things like a good little hero, but for what? He doesn't really want to go to Hel, but he chases a plot coupon to gain admission there anyway. And all that action, for what? If he'd just sat tight for a few days, his funeral pyre would have happened regardless and the ending would be the same. I mean, okay, maybe adventuring around the underworld might have distracted Hiccup enough that he didn't have to suffer that emotional breakdown you think the story is missing, but it made no difference in the end."
httyd,2qlab9,Skyblacker,1 point,Sun Dec 28 05:09:01 2014 UTC,"All stories need to be good in at least one of two areas, the technical or emotional areas, to be good. The reason I didn't complain about the technical areas (the plot, conflict, etc.) is because the author didn't seem to be writing a technical story.  'I Hear Him Scream' is another story which puts the emotional area above the technical area. Unfortunately, 'Good Thing You're Already Dead' fails in the emotional area, leaving it to be a bland story with an interesting setting."
httyd,2qlab9,Skyblacker,1 point,Sun Dec 28 18:07:12 2014 UTC,"For me it was a concept story, so the novelty and non-boring pace was enough to sustain me. When becoming a zombie is a logical possibility for a character, I want to stick around just to see if it happens."
httyd,2qlab9,assassinii,1 point,Mon Dec 29 00:26:33 2014 UTC,"I thought this was a good story even though the plot was lacking. It was worth reading for the ending alone. The Norse mythology aspects were certainly interesting.  I really wanted to see more interaction between Hiccup and Toothless though. That's not what this story was about though, and I can accept that. For some reason I was expecting Toothless to be there with Hiccup even in his death. I guess that's what makes the story all the more sad."
httyd,2qlab9,assassinii,3,Sun Dec 28 14:41:57 2014 UTC,"While a common joke, not having Toothless is perhaps the biggest deal breaker in anything HTTYD related. From a purely objective standpoint, Toothless is the most important character, both by his actions and mere existence.  The problem with the lack of our dragon friend, is that Hiccup is not a character. Not in HTTYD, and not in any HTTYD fanfic I've read so far. He is always half a character, with Toothless being the other half.  Toothless serves as both Hiccup's best friend and companion, but also his protector, both metaphorically by keeping him in check with reality, and also physically through the obvious size and strength differences."

In addition, Kristian Harloff of the Schmoes Know also put HTTYD2 at his #10 spot on his ""Best of the Year"" list, which is especially impressive as he seems the more critical reviewer on the show (he even left Guardians of the Galaxy and LEGO Movie in the ""honorable mentions"" category so the fact that Dragons 2 got in is pretty impressive).  You can see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOxfJ7Zmm8E  Also is anyone else noticing that HTTYD2 is showing up on more Top 10 lists recently? Before it seemed like LEGO was the only one, but now I'm starting to feel it's ""frontrunner"" status is slipping and Dragons 2 is gaining some Oscars steam (as is Big Hero 6)."

In your description, you say you put more time into Toothless than Hiccup, but I honestly think the brushes and colours in Hiccup are fantastic!  As far as constructive criticism goes, I'd perhaps suggest you work on Toothless' neck a bit - in my opinion, it folds somewhat too harshly - as well as balancing the amount of details in the picture - Toothless' face is well detailed, but since Hiccup doesn't share the level of detail it throws the picture balance off. But, as you stated, you put more time into Toothless than Hiccup, so the detail thing is just that - a minor detail :)"

The word filicide derives from the Latin words filius meaning ""son"" or filia meaning daughter and the suffix -cide meaning to kill, murder, or cause death. ""A filicide"" may refer to the parent who killed his or her child as well as to the criminal act that the parent committed.

httyd,2py8h4,Plailect,4,Sun Dec 21 05:24:33 2014 UTC,"I started reading this fanfic because of your first thread about it, OP... and I must thank you. I've read it in... 3 days, I think? A true emotional rollercoaster.  While certainly a sad story, maybe depressing at times, it was beautifully written and emotionally engaging. It is not devoid of minor errors or mistakes, of course, no story is, but you can very easily ignore them once you start reading.  It's one of the first stories in many, many years (and I read a lot of dark/sad ones) that got me crying. Really, if you haven't read IHHS and you're reading this, I strongly advise to go and read it before proceeding, 'cause spoilers are going to appear in the next sentence.  The Queen was not the villain. She wasn't a great leader, was cruel and sometimes evil, but had her motives. Hiccup knew this as soon as he confronted the source of her magic in battle. The main villain, the main problem in this fanfic was not physical. Indeed, it was a story about Hiccup finding himself. Sorry for repeating what you said, OP, but I can't really think of any other way to put it.  As to Hiccup and Toothless... they basically save each other. They need each other, and would die multiple times already if separated at any point in the story.  Well, I'm not really that good with words, so sorry if my comment seems chaotic or something. Sorry for my English, too."
httyd,2py8h4,Asdamk,1 point,Sun Dec 21 09:02:10 2014 UTC,"Its been two or three months since I've finished reading it, but the way I read the story was: Hiccup dealing with his crap, Toothless dealing with his crap, all while building a relationship and trying to not be killed by vikings then once everything is all nice and peachy they die. Then they un-die and the story is left up to the reader's imagination. Its not that I didn't feel the queen battle  or individual issues were important, I just got the impression that the story was really about the relationship between Toothless and Hiccup and how it's built and less about the other things. A great story for sure though  I just wanted to get that viewpoint out there, but also because I like these fanfic discussions, and while I don't participate in each one, I don't want them to be cancelled due to lack of interest/participation"
httyd,2py8h4,shrinkyshrink,2,Wed Dec 24 05:37:05 2014 UTC,"My favorite thing about IHHS is the multiple levels of meaning and various interpretations. It can be seen as a simple story, or a more metaphorical one.  Unfortunately, replies have been dropping. Whether this is because of something I'm doing (please tell me if it is!), or just because I'm moving away from the more popular fanfics, I'm not sure.  Fortunately (or unfortunately if you hate these for some reason), I will continue to post these regardless of how many replies they get because the subreddit needs discussion about something."
httyd,2py8h4,Asdamk,1 point,Wed Dec 24 07:36:18 2014 UTC,"Well, not that many people actually have time to read a lot of fanfiction. I've read IHHS, and now I'm reading another one, but it's impossible for me (and I'm sure there are a lot of people in similar situations) to read more, even though I have more free time than usual now.  And I'm not going to even look at a topic that contains spoilers to a fanfic before reading said fanfic. That kind of limits my options. Yes, this sub really needs some sort of activity. Fanart and cosplays, while certainly a nice thing, are not enough to keep it running for a long time.  But a discussion that is only available to the few that had the time to read a couple of quite long fanfics is not going to be a huge spike in activity. But it's something - keep doing what you're doing ;)"

httyd,2py4rn,Plailect,1 point,Sun Dec 21 04:39:03 2014 UTC,"I agree that the label of Champions sounds somewhat belabored. They're fighting the Alchemist and that's it; giving themselves a label for it seems presumptuous. Maybe if there was a society of Champions, some community outside of fighting her, this label would make sense. But as the story makes clear, these characters only come together because of this single fight. It's too quick and ad hoc for them to adopt a name or fully formed group identity from this.  I like Qiao because she doesn't have a doppelganger. It's not like Hiccup and Nester, Toothless and Arc, nor Astrid and Saga. The villains seem original for the same reason, since Cervantes and the Alchemist are fairly different from Alvin and company. Watching Saga and Astrid interact is boring because they're so similar that you know they'll eventually get along well, and they do. But because Qiao doesn't have an obvious template in a canon character, she's much less predictable. I like that.   Also, I like Linebreaker. He's a captain by trade, but so fabulous it's hilarious. If this wasn't an adventure tale, you'd almost expect him to be collaborating with Hiccup on a designer line of saddles.   And speaking of objects that should have been made in this story but weren't, why doesn't Hiccup have a mysteal foot by now? Mysteal armor might protect Hiccup in battle, but a lighter, sturdier prosthetic would make his life easier every time he walks. And there's also that material Metal Fury is made of, which the author even says can perfectly mimic missing body parts. Granted, Hiccup never gets to handle Metal Fury like he did the mysteal objects, but I still think the author might have been setting something up there."

httyd,2psrge,whalesinwales,7,Fri Dec 19 16:26:01 2014 UTC,"Professional film composer here!  And I've actually talked to John Powell about it in person, which was super cool.  Okay, so usually something like this happens: composer gets brought on by directors/producers.  Composer reads script/looks at storyboards/talks about tone and story and all sorts of fun stuff.  After those initial meetings, which can happen months or years before the film actually comes out, the composer usually retreats into their studio and writes a bunch of demos and themes.  They get sent to the director/producer for feedback and by the time you have picture lock, you generally have all of the material needed to score a film, which makes the process a lot easier.  John started writing about a year before HTTYD2 was released, which is actually fairly early.  It helps that he had such a strong starting point with Dean Deblouis and Dreamworks in general.  If you want to ask me more about how the process works, I'd love to explain it!  I currently work in television and it's fascinating.  Feel free to send along a PM."

httyd,2psrge,okisiroki,2,Fri Dec 19 22:48:33 2014 UTC,"I don't know the specifics of their pipeline, but Powell probably started composing when the storyboarding is near completion and when the animation is still in its rough/blocking stage.

httyd,2psrge,RuthlessRampage,4,Fri Dec 19 16:36:15 2014 UTC,"Animation is done before the soundtrack is complete. Powell would get a early draft of the animated scene which then he implements his music by matching the tone, rhythm, beat, etc... with the with the mood or excitement of the scene."

httyd,2pekq5,RunninOnStalin,14,Mon Dec 15 22:28:06 2014 UTC,"It's very easy to see that these are fakes because they're simply not Powell's musical style. He has a way he composes all his soundtracks that's unique and consistent, and even the second movie kept some motifs from the first. Here's what separates these:   Heavy use of piano. Powell uses piano sparingly, and only when complementing the brass instruments and choirs he prefers. Obvious synthesizing. Powell only uses real orchestras. Early release. Powell wasn't finished with the HTTYD2 soundtrack until November of 2013, so it would be absurd to release music this early for the third.   Although good songs on their own, it's a travesty to tie them to such a beautiful franchise and composer."
httyd,2pekq5,Angelin01,5,Mon Dec 15 23:20:35 2014 UTC,"Also, Powell does make use of chorals when doing sad music. Just pay attention to ""Stoick's ship""."

httyd,2pekq5,Angelin01,3,Tue Dec 16 01:44:51 2014 UTC,"Again, I keep my argument of the chorals. Powell LOVES his chorals, and that had nothing to do with them. Thus me knowing that was fake."

httyd,2pa233,sim9,6,Mon Dec 15 04:31:42 2014 UTC,"I've said the same thing quite a lot, the games we've had so far, let's be honest, are cash-ins.  We don't even need some kind of massive RPG game or anything, at the very minimum they've got a tonne of assets and story, all that stuff that could easily be reimagined into a video game of some sort. The main problem is of course whether Dreamworks are willing to sink money into such a project, unfortunately who knows when or if they'll ever see reason to.  Just look at the past games, namely the HTTYD 2 game, I wouldn't get your hopes up (if there were any to begin with), and as much as I seem pessimistic, it's just something that doesn't make me very enthusiastic.  And yes, you are spot on about School of Dragons, I don't really know what they were thinking with that, it doesn't seem like they hit any kind of target market with it.

None of the games I've witnessed so far are interesting to me and I don't have any hope for it to change. HTTYD movie franchise, to me, is not going to be extendable beyond the films. Simply because the world of it is ever-changing. HTTYD2 has turned ""School of Dragons"" into a weird combination of characters from both movies, series and the game itself that I found even more repulsive than it was before to me. ""Rise of Berk"" and its 'storyline'  are annoying to me. Haven't played HTTYD game on my 3DS(and I'm getting rid of it too) so can't speak for that.   Another problem is target audience. Namely, children. You can't put an age restriction tag on it if you want to sell HTTYD game because it's simply going to fail you. It gives us risk of having overly sweet and possibly simplified game that will inevitably send older audience flying the other way."

Were it not for the [Berk Air Force], there wouldn't be much that Berk could do in a protracted engagement against Drago's forces (unless it was a simple infantry fight, in which case it's far more even)."
httyd,2p8g7v,Plailect,2,Sun Dec 14 04:23:54 2014 UTC,"I love this story. It captures the adventuresome feel of HTTYD but with compelling original characters. Which is an accomplishment! If someone writes a story with Hiccup being cute for the camera, I'll automatically buy into that. But if an author can keep my interest with characters and premises of his own invention? That's good writing!   I've read up through the Champions trilogy. It just keeps getting better. And I don't even see the distinction between canon and original characters because by this point, the author has fleshed them out so much that they are all original.   I wish the author would change these into original stories, much like that Twilight fanfic writer did with Fifty Shades. It wouldn't be difficult; the plot and premise are mostly original anyway. And since at least initially, Nester is an extreme version of socially awkward Hiccup and the Seer is likewise for warrior woman Astrid, you could easily combine those characters."
httyd,2p8g7v,Skyblacker,3,Sun Dec 14 06:31:53 2014 UTC,"The writing is absolutely brilliant! The original content is awesome and we can have Hiccup being cute for the camera, all in the same storyline.  The trilogy after this improves on the original in a way I had given up on for ""real"" books. It's been a long time since I read a sequel that I thought was better than the original (the last time being ""Speaker for the Dead""), and it is refreshing to read something where the sequels weren't shoveled in just to have them.  I'm going to disagree with you here. While I could see these as their own stories, the plot heavily relies on having both Nestor and the Seer and Hiccup and Astrid. Large swaths of the plot would be impossible without having the number of characters that we have."

I love this series =D"
httyd,2p8g7v,janzuka,1 point,Mon Dec 15 07:06:44 2014 UTC,"I wanted to add my two cents to this, what an awesome story this was. I never thought you could combine scifi/fantasy and httyd like this.  Speaking of scifi/fantasy aspects of the story, I'm not a big fan of magic in general. It just feels like cheating to me, we live in a world governed by the laws of physics and I think magic gives the writer a tool to make things and twists happen that are just too unbelievable. Maybe I'm just a very scientific thinker but this is how I feel.  That being said I like to think all the mystical things happening throughout the story are just pieces of artisan technology. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic after all.  Back to the story though, I'm currently halfway through ""I bring the thunder"" and both stories have been immensely enjoyable. OC's are very likable and the writer seems to have an ability to write very coherent and well tempoed text. Not once have I felt confused as to what was going on even though I have a tendencies to read very fast and unintentionally skip words. Backstory blended with ""real"" history seems to be a common theme in httyd fics and was executed very well here. There was a hint that the explosion that effectively ended the artisans could've been what killed the dinosaurs, I find these snippets very enjoyable."

httyd,2p5zr2,OrangeW,2,Sat Dec 13 11:52:36 2014 UTC,That is awesome! I often find myself singing or humming it. It's such a sweet song.
httyd,2p5zr2,ThePostItNote,1 point,Sat Dec 13 18:23:29 2014 UTC,Really? They nominated the 30 second long snippet instead of Where No One Goes?
httyd,2p5zr2,PetevonPete,2,Sat Dec 13 22:28:36 2014 UTC,"IIRC Where No One Goes can't be nominated because the melody was already used (from the film's own score, but still)."
httyd,2p5zr2,avw94,1 point,Sun Dec 14 02:05:31 2014 UTC,"So it's not original because it ripped off itself? By that logic, is the score for HTTYD 2 disqualified because it uses the score from the first movie? We know that's not true, because Return of the King won Best Score."
httyd,2p5zr2,PetevonPete,2,Sun Dec 14 02:53:52 2014 UTC,"The Academy is really wishy-washy when it comes to things like this. For instance, the score from The Godfather was disqualified because the main theme had been used by the composer in a different film (albeit significantly faster and more upbeat). But The Godfather Part II won for best original score despite containing the same main theme."
httyd,2p5yus,FantasticMrPanda,5,Sat Dec 13 11:06:49 2014 UTC,"This is noteworthy because scores that re-use existing music aren't always eligible for this oscar - Kung Fu Panda 2 wasn't, for example. Now, let's hope it gets a well-deserved nomination!"
httyd,2p5yus,avw94,1 point,Sat Dec 13 11:08:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the Academy is really grey on when and when not score sequels can be nominated."
httyd,2p5yus,gomamon15,3,Sun Dec 14 02:07:37 2014 UTC,"Okay, now that Birdman is no longer eligible I think Hans Zimmer has this one in the bag.  In addition, that leaves at least one open ""wild card"" spot that I think John Powell will manage to get. Now I would not mind if either Zimmer or Powell won since both of their soundtracks were phenomenal.   Don't forget, the music branch votes for the nominees and they tend to love Powell's scores so I definitely think it will get nominated for an Oscar even if every other awards show ignores it. If it does, then I think it should be looked at as a potential dark horse spoiler.   Last year's Oscars telecast used ""Romantic Flight"" during the ""Best Original Score"" nomination part despite the first score failing to win the Oscar. To me, that is HUGE foreshadowing that HTTYD2 will be highly considered by Academy members if it does get the nomination.   My current predictions: Hans Zimmer - Interstellar Alexandre Desplat - The Imitation Game Alexandre Desplat - The Grand Budapest Hotel John Powell - How to Train Your Dragon 2 Johann Johannssen - The Theory of Everything  Wild Cards Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross - Gone Girl  Thomas Newman - The Judge Steven Price - Fury  EDIT: Also Mica Levi for ""Under the Skin"""
httyd,2p5yus,WhiteMarauder,1 point,Sat Dec 13 17:54:10 2014 UTC,As much as I love this movie.  Interstellar deserves this one.
httyd,2p5yus,gomamon15,5,Sat Dec 13 14:16:41 2014 UTC,"I'm still rooting for John Powell. However, if Hans Zimmer does end up winning his second Oscar, I wouldn't be angry with the Academy like I was four years ago. Interstellar truly was a fantastic score as well."
httyd,2p5yus,gomamon15,1 point,Sat Dec 13 14:25:41 2014 UTC,"Also Powell is Zimmer's protegee, so if Powell gets nominated Zimmer may end up promoting Powell's score as well. If I remember correctly, Zimmer said he felt Reznor and Ross should have won in 2010 after they got nominated (I personally don't agree with this, but who knows. Zimmer may do that for Powell this time and get more of a spotlight on him.)"

httyd,2p204q,WhiteMarauder,7,Fri Dec 12 06:06:52 2014 UTC,"There was never an Eragon movie. It simply does not exist.  Seriously though, the number of key parts removed, details changed, and entire non-canon sequences added... I don't understand why they felt the need to change so much.  The books were a massive success, so why change everything?  Some details had to be removed for time purposes, fine, I can understand that.  But they didn't just remove things, they changed them. Sigh."
httyd,2p204q,geesemaster,3,Fri Dec 12 17:59:42 2014 UTC,"I don't get it. Inheritance never received a depiction on-screen. I only once saw a movie that stole the names of some characters, but it was nothing alike."

httyd,2oyznf,gomamon15,7,Thu Dec 11 13:49:24 2014 UTC,"Not really any surprise, but still nice to see. Of course Powell got ignored, but I'm not entirely surprised. He didn't get much recognition until the Oscars in 2010, either, so maybe he will get lucky there. Also LEGO Movie was only in the ""Animated Feature Category"" (not even a song nomination). Granted TS3 was also only nominated for Animated Film but maybe this is a sign it won't be as lauded by the GG and Academy as with critics and Dragons can sneak in there. Then again maybe I'm being too optimistic...sigh.  Also, from a personal standpoint, I'm sad seeing Interstellar only get a nomination for Best Score.   At the end of the day I probably won't be watching the Award shows this year. The idea of watching HTTYD2 fail to win any major awards like the first film is just too painful. Honestly wish there was some way we could show our appreciation for the film series regardless of the Oscar outcome."
httyd,2oyznf,FantasticMrPanda,6,Thu Dec 11 14:04:18 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I'm having a hard time taking the Golden Globes seriously. Remember that two years ago, they nominated Cars 2 for Best Animated Feature but they didn't nominate Kung Fu Panda 2 (which is awesome). Ugh.  John Powell not getting nominated was to be expected I think, and if I had to bet my money would be on the LEGO movie. Not that it's better, but I think it will ultimately win.  On a side note though, It's nice seeing the awesomeness that is Grand Budapest Hotel being recognized. I hope is has a few nominations at the oscars too."
httyd,2oyznf,thequesogrande,7,Thu Dec 11 15:11:10 2014 UTC,"Kung Fu Panda 2 was the animated movie I absolutely didn't see coming. DreamWorks has a thing for making great sequels. Cars 2, meanwhile, was a pile of ass by Pixar standards.  The LEGO Movie was awesome. No doubt. But I feel like HTTYD2 was better as a film. It deals with really complex themes that The LEGO Movie didn't come close to touching like self vs. community, death and sacrifice, and what it actually means to selflessly love another person. I think it deserves an Oscar for the way Stoick and Valka's relationship was portrayed alone. But the Oscars are so fucking political and DreamWorks has a bad reputation with navigating those sorts of environments. Oh well. The nomination is what really counts, IMO. And even then a film can get robbed. Where the Wild Things Are was amazing and got utterly shafted by the Academy."
httyd,2oyznf,Kama_,3,Thu Dec 11 17:36:56 2014 UTC,"Lego Movie hype is something I don't get and never will. Again, I did really like the movie but it's getting too much praise. And yes HTTYD2 was a far superior film on all fronts.   You know what would make me laugh is if this is the lineup for best animated feature: HTTYD2, Big Hero 6, Boxtrolls, The Tale of Princess Kaguya, and Song of the Sea.   Thing is, as unlikely as it seems I can see the academy picking those five films and ignoring Lego."
httyd,2oyznf,Snaz5,2,Thu Dec 11 18:02:52 2014 UTC,"Agree about Grand Budapest Hotel. I absolutely love that movie.  And as for Leg, despite me not understanding what exactly makes it so wonderful (it's a good movie don't get me wrong but not worth the praise it's been getting), I think it's a frontrunners but is it really the kind of film to get the Academy's attention? Based on a toy brand and full of pop culture references and that came out all the way back in February? I still think Dragons 2 has a chance. Not a big chance but a chance."
httyd,2oyznf,Chris857,2,Thu Dec 11 15:41:19 2014 UTC,"they nominated Cars 2 for Best Animated Feature but they didn't nominate Kung Fu Panda 2   I was really having a better day without knowing that, the KFP movies rank close to the HTTYD films for me. Apparently they didn't bother watching the movies but figured they needed a Pixar film in the running.  Bleh."

Not worth it.  Unless your dragon can feed itself after a while or steal something valuable without getting caught. Then it is worth it.  It is also worth noting that having a pet dragon might put you on the CIA/KGB top something list. And your dragon might need to obey FAA rules and all other legal stuff.

httyd,2ot1vf,Fascist_Pink,1 point,Thu Dec 11 12:28:35 2014 UTC,"If you'd subject the poor thing to be treated as an attraction you don't really deserve to have it.  The best suggestions are the ones about having the dragon hunt and live in a secluded location. That way he'd keep his natural instincts and would have plenty of space to roam. You can't just lock up something that big in your back yard.  The cost of having an ""exotic pet"". Adapt to their needs, not the other way around."

httyd,2opa8k,erico637,4,Tue Dec 9 09:33:50 2014 UTC,"Upvoting this for truth. Also, IIRC it usually includes both a front and a back piece, although I suppose one could only have a front to save weight. Either way, there's plenty of material for two helmets.  Also, the helmet has a much thicker brim and center. It seems like it would be very difficult to simply hammer a steel plate into that shape. Most likely the breastplate was melted down and re-cast/forged as the helmets."

I would have liked to see more of Hiccup doing the same (except reverse of course), but that may take place in the sequel (haven't read it yet so idk).   The story was worth the read for sure, but I just didn't find it tugging my heartstrings like I Hear Him Scream did, but that may have been just me."
httyd,2om0lw,shrinkyshrink,1 point,Mon Dec 8 03:55:58 2014 UTC,"Toothless learning to be a human is the only reason I continued reading. Every scene with him experiencing something new was a fresh change of atmosphere and pacing. Unfortunately, all of these seemed short lived as the pace slowed back down just as it started to get going, and the atmosphere became dreary once again.  'I Hear Him Scream' is a much more emotional read, with more empathetic characters (see: Toothless and Hiccup), which kept me going. IHHS is still my favorite read."

httyd,2om0lw,Xureality,1 point,Mon Dec 8 12:02:57 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Despite the multitude of errors, it was the story that kept me reading.  In such a long book, it was also pretty neat to see how the writer improved over time.  I preferred the sequel to the original, since it deals with the story that comes to a head at the very end of Becoming the Enemy.  I greatly enjoyed how (sequel spoilers!)the introduction of Hiccup/Toothless' mother affected the story.  Sequel isn't finished though. 200k words in, and still receiving regular updates.

I'd assume that Stoick disown hiccup while being forced to transform by Alvin. Stoick would know that, so why did he have to disown hiccup at all? it isn't like hiccup has willingly transformed, is it?  Scratch that, it was an unannounced dream sequence, now I feel dumb."

httyd,2ohnbd,Sir_Nameless,5,Sat Dec 6 22:26:17 2014 UTC,"People looking up isn't the issue. Toothless's radar cross-section is similar to a small airplane. Air Traffic Control radar would easily pick him up, at which point they'd immediately notice that he wasn't responding to radio transmissions. At this point, the military sends a couple jet fighters to take a closer look."
httyd,2ohnbd,HotDealsInTexas,1 point,Sun Dec 7 01:00:01 2014 UTC,"Especially given the speed at which Toothless flies- fast moving radar contact zipping around and not responding to radio transmissions? The fighter pilots of the [rapid response] flight would be quite... spooked/twitchy, I guess?  That's when you quickly land in a wooded area and watch the air show as the fighter planes make multiple passes to find out just where the heck did that [unknown radar contact] went.   Toothless can, IIRC, fly faster than the average Cessna, so they wouldn't be looking for a small [easily hidden] bush plane, but instead something a bit larger and less inconspicious."
httyd,2ohnbd,SCM7,2,Sat Dec 13 05:12:03 2014 UTC,"That's when you quickly land in a wooded area and watch the air show as the fighter planes make multiple passes to find out just where the heck did that [unknown radar contact] went.    You're assuming they'd try to evade the fighters, which seems incredibly unlikely. Toothless would probably see and hear the fighters first, followed by Hiccup hearing them. Neither would have any idea what was going on, since there's nothing in the medieval world that sounds like a jet engine. If the fighters generated contrails, Hiccup would make visual context next, but otherwise they'd see each other at approximately the same time, and the fighters would approach until (a) the fighter pilots realized that Toothless's wings were flapping, and (b) Hiccup realized the airplanes' wings weren't flapping. At this point, Hiccup will be just as curious about the planes as they are about him, and will most likely approach to the point that the pilots realize that the unidentified aircraft is a dragon with a teenage boy on its back, moving far faster than any flying animal known to science. Meanwhile, Hiccup might notice that the jets are very clearly not biological, and possibly see the pilots in the canopies.  At this point, the pilots are utterly astonished, and will probably radio back to base asking what the heck to do, and take pictures if they haven't already. Most likely they'll either retreat farther away and follow Hiccup and Toothless until they land, or try to signal Hiccup and Toothless to follow them to an airport.  Also, while Toothless is much faster than a Cessna, there are small propeller aircraft that can go that fast. Vintage or modified WWII fighters or purpose-built racing aircraft in particular might be capable of that."

httyd,2ofv42,Rakaith,1 point,Sat Dec 6 14:36:27 2014 UTC,Thanks! I check as many daily Tshirt sites as I can (Qwertee being my favorite) to try and get all the Httyd shirts when available. It's actually an exciting point in my day when all the shirts get refreshed   Edit: I didn't realize it took all the shirt sales from every site! No more having to individually remember to check each one.
httyd,2ofv42,pixiestix88,1 point,Sat Dec 6 15:19:36 2014 UTC,You sir are awesome! I no longer have to check like ten sites for shirts.
httyd,2ofv42,pixiestix88,1 point,Sat Dec 6 21:05:12 2014 UTC,adorable! Im a little sad its so late in the year. You can only really wear this one month of the year.

httyd,2odaoj,wacoede,9,Fri Dec 5 15:20:07 2014 UTC,"I tried it when it came out. It was okay for children, I suppose - I particularly liked that it had some activities that taught about the scientific method. But otherwise it was nothing special, and my dragon kept running out of energy, necessitating playing a frustrating fishing mini-game. A better fishing rod cost real money. I don't know how it's changed since then, of course."
httyd,2odaoj,Mithent,2,Fri Dec 5 18:51:22 2014 UTC,"You can earn the gems/diamonds/whatever hard currency by logging in each day. I have since forgotten to do it but when I did, there was a 5 day period of receiving gems each day instead of every 3rd/5th day. So... I bought a better than standard rod. Fishing was easy. Nevertheless the game didn't draw me back, some quests were displaying in a glitchy manner, some were displaying despite not being in quest book. And the mere fact you can paint your dragon whatever colour you want, necessarily meaning lots and lots of flashy nightmares and nadders should you play multiplayer, threw me off.  Still, it's a very nice game should one consider less-picky-than-me audience that has lots of money or time to spend. :)"

httyd,2oc28b,darthlala,2,Fri Dec 5 04:37:44 2014 UTC,Two part episodes are so much better than standalones. The extra time lets the writers actually get more of a real story going.
httyd,2oc28b,geesemaster,2,Fri Dec 5 07:50:30 2014 UTC,"Aww yiss, Toothless-centric episode!  I was hoping this plot point would be adressed, and it was certainly a great idea to leave it to the Finale. Of course, ""finding other Night Furies"" is a bit too important to really happen in the TV show, so the twist shouldn't really come as a surprise (if anything that will happen in the third film). But still, the lenghts Hiccup would go to find Toothless' family was very charming to see. That aspect of this episode was definitely the best, and one of the overall highlights of the show so far.  The episode as a whole is good too, although there are flaws. The dragon calls were just silly, in my opinion, especially Astrid's extremely manly shout to lure the Thunderdrum away (lol). I would have prefered this left out, but that might come down to personal taste. And let's not forget this is really a kids' show.   Otherwise a good episode, and definitely an interesting one to watch for people who don't follow the show otherwise."

httyd,2o2u9h,RuthlessRampage,6,Tue Dec 2 20:21:41 2014 UTC,"Don't know why the Lego film is getting all this praise. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, good humor, and a good moral message but overall I think it was a generic animated film with an interesting concept."
httyd,2o2u9h,OrangeW,5,Tue Dec 2 21:12:18 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I did really like it, but critics are giving it WAAYYY too much credit. I think it has more to do with the whole ""It was so much better than it could have been"" mentality.  I actually think that even though Lego won Screenplay and got a slot on the top 10, Dragons 2 winning best animation is huge for its Oscar chances. I still don't understand how these results are possible. Then again, Pan's Labyrinth won 3 technical Oscars and got a screenplay nomination, but lost Best Foreign Language film to The Lives of Others - which was the only category it was nominated for.  What this suggests is that the Best Animated Film race is not going to be one that Lego dominates as so many were predicting. Dragons 2 is going to give it a run for its money.   Also I've said it before and I will say it again. Lego will win over the Critics awards, but I think Dragons has a better chance at the Oscar. Lego may get the Oscar for Best Song as a consolation prize though."

httyd,2o1enk,xXAlphaWhiskeyXx,1 point,Fri Dec 5 13:55:43 2014 UTC,It depends on the size. The image ratio is 3 long by 2 width approximately that would make the maximum size around 1.2 x 1.8m

(Even though the trailers spoiled it... -_-)  I'm annoyed that the writers cut the scene with Hiccup/Valka because it ""slowed down the pace."" I thought the overall pace of HTTYD 2 was a bit fast, and it would have been cool to see them bond more."
httyd,2nvk6i,newcampnarakol,3,Mon Dec 1 17:40:47 2014 UTC,Yeah I know...I did like the start in berk but I dunno having that scene either right after the Toothless and Hiccup flight or just as they meet Eret and he describes what happened.  Yeah...more like SUPER DUPER fast... cough cough Drago Bloodfist cough cough.

httyd,2nr667,_Hawker,10,Sat Nov 29 13:04:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he is definitely hateable. Then again, the TV show is mainly aimed at a young audience, so I guess there's the reasoning behind having someone so universally unliked."
httyd,2nr667,Eddyoshi,4,Sat Nov 29 13:42:50 2014 UTC,"His episodes really ruin the pace of the show. I just watched EP8 and it was so... awesome! The whole story was really fun to watch, the episode before it( The one about the thunderdrum) was also fun. I just saw that ep9 contains Mildew. Let's hope it doesn't suck like the others."
httyd,2nr667,HotDealsInTexas,8,Sat Nov 29 14:22:45 2014 UTC,"For me the problem wasn't really Mildu himself because I understand having someone who thinks in the old ways makes sense and he kinda acts as a ""villain"" before Dagur or Alvin is introduced.  No what bothers me is how quickly the people of Berk agree with him. Multiple times in the series it seems like its:   People don't really care about the Dragons Mildu then comes along and says how evil dragons are. Whole town (and Stoic too) suddenly agree's for no good reason with Mildu. Hiccup has to convince them that dragons are not evil. Town is eventually convinced and Mildu gets all hissy.   Repeat this what feels like 3 or 4 times, Hiccup going so far to be struck by lightning to prove it!"
httyd,2nr667,Eddyoshi,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:10:02 2014 UTC,"I don't totally agree with that assessment. The first issue is that, as you said, most of Berk's population doesn't really seem to care that much about the dragons. Sure, nobody except Mildew seems disappointed that the war is over, but that doesn't mean the whole village is comfortable with having dragons living among them. Consider that probably every single person on Berk has lost friends and/or family members to dragon attacks. And even of the people who think having dragons around is overall a good thing, not everyone has a deep emotional connection to individual dragons or otherwise cares enough about the issue to tell Mildew to shut up.  So, to summarize, Berk basically consists of:   Mildew: actively complaining about dragons all the time People who basically agree with Mildew, but have enough common sense / better things to do with their time to keep their mouths shut unless there's a recent dragon-related incident. People who either are uncomfortable with dragons but not enough to join Mildew, or okay with dragons but don't like them enough to join Hiccup. This is probably the majority of the population. People who are actively pro-dragon: this includes Hiccup and the other teens, some of their families (Spitelout doesn't seem particularly fond of Hookfang), and a few others like Gobber.   Mildew doesn't NEED the majority of the village on his side, he just needs a loud, obnoxious minority.  My other disagreement is that Stoick isn't just ignoring Hiccup. He generally seems to make decisions that give Hiccup as much time as possible to prove the dragons' innocence while still preventing a riot. This is exactly what a chief should be doing. For example, in ""In Dragons We Trust"" all he has is Hiccup's word that Mildew was framing the dragons. If he banished or otherwise punished Mildew on an accusation from his son, Mildew's sympathizers would accuse him of nepotism, even if Hiccup is a hero. Berk may not be a democracy but the chief still can't ignore politics entirely.  There's one more thing that justifies Stoick's actions. Due to defeating the Red Death and saving half the village from being killed on the Dragon Island beach, Hiccup is extremely popular, probably even with the ""anti-dragon"" crowd. If Stoick banishes the dragons, Hiccup will leave with Toothless (the only reason he didn't in ""In Dragons We Trust"" is because he was making a final attempt to prove the dragons' innocence), and when that happens the entire village will be pissed off at Mildew. People would be clamoring for the return of the dragons within a week."
httyd,2nr667,dragonkuff,1 point,Fri Dec 5 01:06:13 2014 UTC,"First of all woah! 0.0  Secondly my statement wasn't a 100% just one because so far I've only seen the series once, and even missed the last 3-4 episodes :/  You do make very good points however.  One thing I disagree with though is what you said about Stoick and the dragons leaving argument.  What I was trying to say was that I remember quite a few times that while those big arguments happened about the dragons being pests, I do remember as the series goes on Stoick does more and more to try and paint Hiccup as the right person, but if I remember correctly near the beginning I remember it being multiple times of:   The town argee's with Mildue that dragons are bad/should go Hiccup tries to convince them otherwise, his father too. Stoick replies with something along the lines of ""I'm sorry Hiccup but they are right""   The second thing you said about the dragons leaving thing is in the episode you mentioned, where they leave all the dragons on the island I don't really remember anyone being super upset that the dragons were gone, except for the main characters.  Again I've only seen the series once so I could be completely wrong."
httyd,2nr667,TheMisterAce,5,Fri Dec 5 08:26:58 2014 UTC,"Don't forget that in HTTYD2, Stoic doesn't seem to listen much to Hiccup either.  It seems to be a constant problem."

httyd,2niqzp,janzuka,7,Wed Nov 26 22:20:30 2014 UTC,"My galaxy S3 was starting to slow down quite a bit so I decided to get cyanogenmod for it and oh boy is it good now. Last time I used cyanogen was with my trusty old Desire Z and the effect was just as profound back then.  As it is with anything customizable you just can't stop modding it, so here's my Toothless boot animation I made. If you want to to Toothlessify your phone here's a link for the animation:  Toothless with cyanogenmod text  If you want to add your own text here's a blank one:  Just Toothless with this remember not to use any compression with the .zip file.  !!!!WARNING!!!!  These animations are 720x720@24fps and obviously only tested on galaxy S3 running cyanogenmod 10.2. If you want to use these make sure your phone supports the format and resolution. I hold no responsibility if you somehow manage to brick your phone with either of these and as always backups are a good idea. I wouldn't recommend trying this outside cyanogenmod, stock roms especially are finicky about these.  To apply the animation copy it either to data/local or system/media. You need root access for both. I recommend data/local, as the stock animation is in system/media but your phone checks the former first. Also set the file permission to rw-r--r--.  Enjoy!"

httyd,2nj3vp,nekacookie,5,Thu Nov 27 00:19:55 2014 UTC,"The time frame... probably when Hiccup was really young, young enough not to understand what his father did properly. So I would estimate around 10 - 15 years before the first movie. Maybe it happened after Valka was taken by CloudJumper? That could've been what made Stoick attend such a meeting Anyway, about the other 2 chieftains, they probably weren't there."

httyd,2n7wzh,Plailect,2,Mon Nov 24 01:34:45 2014 UTC,"Spoilers  This story was solid, the interaction and building of the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless was good and delving into the Nordic religion is always entertaining, the reason that the author gives that our heroes can communicate is good and when the hidden cost of this power reveals itself was tense and got me worked up a bit.  But the whole subplot of a rebellion among the people of Berk who don't want dragons dragged and was mostly pointless.  Additionally the main villain was built up to be real threat and was dealt with pretty much instantly.  And as /u/Plailect stated the author's desire to have it fall between the movies and wrap up without disrupting anything made the whole story lack meaning and put a bitter disappointing end on the whole thing."
httyd,2n7wzh,AlphaSentry,1 point,Mon Nov 24 20:44:46 2014 UTC,"Fully agree with your points. It had a great concept with the Hiccup/Toothless relationship and cost of power; but that's the only thing that kept me reading.  There were so many original characters drummed up for the rebellion, and here was no character development that felt in any way meaningful.  That is one of the main problems with original characters in fanfictions; the author usually (not always), isn't good at it.  It's perfectly fine to use the movie characters, since they come with fully developed personalities, letting an inexperienced author write a good plot with little to no major character development.  But when OC's are introduced... an author's lack of experience immediately becomes blatantly obvious."

httyd,2n7wzh,pintocat,2,Mon Nov 24 03:56:56 2014 UTC,Hitchups is the most popular and well-known httyd fanfiction.  It contained a method of mental communication between Hiccup and Toothless such that actual conversations could be had.

httyd,2my8pr,geesemaster,5,Fri Nov 21 03:58:05 2014 UTC,"Considering Httyd probably would've taken place in 10th-11th century I generally prefer songs or soundtracks that gets it's inspiration from that time period (celtic/old english vibe)  -Robin Hood Soundtrack A very good soundtrack, some of the songs really stand out. ""Planting the Fields"" one of my favorites and I song I feel could be implemented in the Httyd universe (favorites: Fate Has Smiled Upon Us, Pact Sworn In Blood, Planting the Fields, Sherwood Forest, Robin Speaks, Walter´s Burial, The Legend Begins, Merry Men).  -2 hours of Celtic Music Very good album, almost directly influenced by Celtic Culture  -Here Comes The King I feel Like this song could be the trailer song for Httyd3, full of epicness  -Audiomachine-Tree of Life: Full Album Epic soundtrack, audimachine's songs are very similar in genre so I could relate most of these songs to the ""AudioMachine"" songs Dreamworks used in the trailer."

Dragonforce - Dawn Over A New World fits as the credits song (for those of you who dislike sticks and stones try this), and the piano solo at the beginning reminds me of romantic flight for some reason. Also there's dragon in the name as a bonus.  DragonForce - Seasons (Acoustic Version) Would be a good fit for hiccup's song if he ever lost toothless forever in httyd3"

httyd,2my8pr,janzuka,2,Fri Nov 21 13:30:24 2014 UTC,"I've always imagined alternative music choices within the movies, but the one that appears most vivid to me would be Fourteen Drawings by Helios, when Hiccup begins to bond with Toothless in the first movie.  It has a downtempo feel and is quite percussion-heavy, but is rather soothing with its ambience. The song is quite tranquil, and may be a little slow for the montage of Hiccup + Toothless, but I think it's a decent fit."
httyd,2my8pr,AnOctaveAbove,2,Fri Nov 21 16:16:01 2014 UTC,"Starset- Antigravity  The ending I can really imagine listening to during a flying scene, it's a fantastic instrumental bit."
httyd,2my8pr,karlizkool350,2,Fri Nov 21 17:13:43 2014 UTC,"Well, Kings and Queens was in the trailer, so probably that. The lyrics pretty much perfectly describe the events of HTTYD1.  Learn to Fly always reminds me of the movie, for obvious reasons, as does On Top of the World by Imagine Dragons (bonus fitting name :P). Lots of other Imagine Dragons songs seem to fit, like Fallen kinda describes Hiccup and Toothless's relationship I think.  The Parting Glass is a traditional Irish song that sometimes makes me think of Stoick's funeral.  Here We Go by Jason Gochin, Kick It Up by Paul Gordon, Run Around by Jasan Radford, and everything else from Digimon I will forever associate with a group of scrappy teenagers defeating evil with their pet monsters.  Behind Blue Eyes by The Who reminds me of Hiccup in the first movie."

I was always a bit confused by people calling it a ""failure"" so early on, like 2 weeks after it opened. Kung Fu Panda 2 also did not do all that well in the US, but ended up grossing 660 Million worldwide. Same thing happened with HTTYD 2, and even so, 175 Million in the US is a pretty good domestic gross. Might not be outstanding, but also not terrible or anything. And now it's even breaking sales records.   Also having my fingers crossed for Best Animated feature!"

httyd,2ml8oq,geesemaster,4,Mon Nov 17 21:23:22 2014 UTC,"So much for it being a ""disappointment"". :D  Also as I said before this will very likely help it win over Oscar voters initially turned off by its slow profit.   Spread the word!"
httyd,2ml4nx,StaRn3ss,5,Mon Nov 17 19:22:57 2014 UTC,"Contrary to popular believe, katanas were actually terrible weapons back when they were used.  They do look very stylish though, which is probably why they have gotten so popular."
httyd,2ml4nx,nukeclears,2,Mon Nov 17 20:53:13 2014 UTC,I wouldn't say terrible. It depended on who they were fighting. Samurais used many weapons and often relied on katana's as secondary's. They were by no means terrible if they were properly utilized.
httyd,2ml4nx,OrangeW,1 point,Tue Nov 18 03:16:46 2014 UTC,"I don't like how incredibly biased that guy was and how he generalized pretty much every katana with his own (possibly shitty one). But yeah, as I said, it depends on who they were fighting and how the katana was utilized. Not all katana's were made out of cheap sandore, and not all katana's were used against full armored enemies. It ultimately depends on the skill of the users and the materials of the weapon.  To give people an idea of how effective katana's can be, here are a few links. Vid1, Vid2 (This is not the greatest example since it depends on the quality of both the weapons used and the armor.)  Is katana the best weapon? No. Is it a terrible weapon? Absolutely not."
httyd,2ml4nx,geesemaster,2,Tue Nov 18 08:06:11 2014 UTC,"I have watched a few of his other videos and nearly all of them are riddled with conjecture and ignorance. He doesn't back up any of his statements with real data or actual tests of the swords capabilities. I would rather watch real non biased documentaries on sword history than some random guy's opinions on youtube. Wouldn't have been an issue if he talked about some of the misconceptions, but he does nothing more than rant and hate on the katana on almost all his videos. Think katanas are bad weapons? So be it, what ever floats his boat. ¯_(ツ)_/¯  Edit: Just saw your post, just wanted to, again, state that generalizing that all swordsmiths were bad and every katana was made from poor metals is completely incorrect. It's just like modern companies and electronics created. You would go to the better company for a better product. There is no reason that would be any different back in the day for weapons."

httyd,2ml4nx,Silent_Sky,2,Mon Nov 17 20:40:54 2014 UTC,"I'm not seeing the grain ripples and temperline patterns on the blade like you do with real hand-forged katanas and swords. It looks instead like molded steel sharpened and sanded down - I can see what looks like straight sanding marks made by a machine. The ferrule also looks machine sanded. The grain patterns on real katana blades is strikingly beautiful and very distinct - very much like Toothless' pattering on his sides. Even when polished, the pattering remains. A katana's identity can be verified by the grain alone since it is like a fingerprint and impossible to copy. It's also something you definitely don't mistake for a cheap fake - sometimes the grain looks a lot like wood grain. Other times, the 'grain' actually looks more like water (which I really love). These patterns are only made by folding the steel. They cannot be made by machines or even with applied chemicals.  Also, test the samegawa by scratching it with a fingernail (you won't damage it). Real ray and shark skin makes a kind of scritching noise, and almost as if you were scratching stone or even a sea shell.  It's something to look out for when you buy ""katanas"". If you take it apart (and you should be able to) then somewhere will be the maker's insignia. I hope for your sake it's actually a crafted blade in the katana-style, even if it's not a real katana. A co-worker got a ""real katana"" that he bought for $700. I told him to take apart the blade, and at the base of the tang (which would be embedded in the handle) it had ""made in china"" stamped on.  Here is a close-up of a katana's grain patterning  here is another one. You can clearly see both the temperline pattern and the metal's grain ripples.  Another close-up of the temperline and grain pattern.  I'm not trying to shame you or call you a liar, but there is a lot of business in making and creating katana-style swords and selling them as real katanas to people, especially with the popularity of anime, games, and samurai. Fakes range from the extremely cheap (a strip of metal machine sanded down to a sharp blade) to the better crafted katana-style swords made by actual swordsmiths or their apprentices, but not with the same techniques used for real katanas.   Real katanas, even real forged non-katana swords are incredibly expensive to make, as the materials have to be of high quality and it can take at least a week to forge -the learning, workshop, materials and time do not come cheap. If you spent less than $1000 on this sword I would be very suspect, and even then you ahould be careful. Normal price for a Tonbo Katana (Samurai Sword) is $4000-$7000. In Japan, a katana forged by a certified living national treasure (a person who specializes and is a master of a traditional craft) sword smith can be priced in the tens or even hundreds of thousands USD.  On the up side, a good fake is still a pretty wall piece, and can still be used for defense in the event of a home invasion. I myself have a cheap and very sharp knock off sword (not katana-style, more of a rapier-style) that would be a nice enough weapon should a burglar get in."

Cue dots are also used as a visual form of signalling on television broadcasts.  A pair of cue marks is used to signal the projectionist that a particular reel of a movie is ending, as most movies come to theaters on several reels of film lasting about 14 to 20 minutes each. The marks appear in the last seconds of each reel; the first mark, known as the motor cue, is placed about 8 seconds before the end of the picture section of the reel. The second mark, known as the changeover cue, is placed about 1 second before the end. Each mark lasts for 4 frames (0.17 seconds).

httyd,2mgptb,TacoGhost,6,Sun Nov 16 16:24:40 2014 UTC,"eh, not really.  MLP is divided into 5 'generations':   G1 G2 G3 G3.5 G4   G1 is actually somewhat good. It's creative, it's eventful, and it has pretty good animation quality compared to that times animation.  G2 is, well, meh. not horrible but still watchable. A little more 'toy selling' but still watchable. It deviated a LOT from G1, instead of being a fantasy show, it was about boys and girls and their interactions.  G3 was bad. It was made for toys, the animation was meh, the stories were dull, and it was just overall meh.  G3.5 was Satan. Literally. Horrid animation, horrid story, and it was made 100% to sell toys.  G4 is the current variation of the show, created by Lauren Faust (Which you may know from Power Puff Girls, Fosters home for imaginary friends and so on), with the intention of making a fun show for all audiences. Yeah Hasbro wanted toys, but the original intention of the creator did not take that into account.  A few videos about this, if you're interested:   A fan made documentary about the show, going over what I said (warning, 1 hour long. get popcorn.) Another fan made documentary, again, 1 hour long.

Has just about everything you can want in a fanfic: great plot, good pacing, and fantastic writing. A lot of subtlety going on throughout the novel which can go unnoticed, which really added the depth that 99% of fanfics lack.  Got to agree with you on the title. Honestly, I don't think it could have a better name, it suits it perfectly."
httyd,2mfpo7,geesemaster,4,Sun Nov 16 06:36:11 2014 UTC,"Oh man, the writing is so good. If someone gave me this in a printed form, I would probably be completely unable to distinguish it from an actually published book. Unfortunately, because the writing so incredibly fantastic, I can't read anything else without thinking of how great it could have been with this level of writing. Serious first world problem right there.   Also, I have to agree with your #1 choice - IHHS is incredibly good, and I feel like they are both great in completely different ways. Becoming Lífþrasir is a well edited masterpiece of literature, where as I Hear Him Scream is a powerful stream of emotion, which is represented in the writing, whether intentional or not. I also liked the theme similarities between the two with Toothless pulling Hiccup out of his state of depression."

For me, it raised the bar as to what I expect from fan fics as far as quality.    A handful of things I like about it: the recovery of the prosthetic.  A lot of this is covered in the sequel as well.  But it feels so real and goes into what the movie can't really get into.    The pov style writing in each of the different chapters.  How the writing of each chapter segment gets into their heads and understanding the characters  themselves.  When the author explained the relationship issues between hiccup and stoic in the epilogue, it made me think about, oddly enough, A Goofy Movie.  I haven't seen that movie in a decade or so, but as far as single parent/teenager relationship issues go, its not just about getting the girl at the end, its about communication between father and son.  I was incredibly satisfied with the ending because of this, and would have been fine with just the endings there and not diving into the hiccstrid heavy sequel.  I couldn't not keep reading however."
httyd,2mfpo7,NineyScratch,2,Mon Nov 17 20:26:24 2014 UTC,"This is definitely in my top 5 - absolutely fantastic. I loved every second of the writing; it was almost like reading a book. My favorite part was the use of dramatic irony, which was handled masterfully by the author.  The recovery of the prosthetic is an interesting point I didn't really notice when I read it, but now that you mention it I do recall it going much further into detail than the movie which just kind of skipped over it."

The trick here is that Dreamworks put the music as normal .mp3 (and .ogg) files on their webserver, since those are publicly accessible you can just download em from your browser. However you aren't allowed to just list all files in the directory, so we have to guess which files are there. Obviously they just named the songs 1.mp3 to 29.mp3. Therefor you have to manually rename 1.mp3 to 2.mp3 up to 29. Edit: Just made it easier for you, open all links in here and save those pages: http://lappro.net/random/httydscore.php"

I think now that all animations slotted for this year have released, it is now decision time for awards. I think the only animation that could give HTTYD2 serious competition for awards is Song of the Sea, which is to 2D drawn animation what HTTYD2 was to 3D computer animation. Absolutely gorgeous and a wonderful compelling story.   Boxtrolls did not score well with critics or audiences, and neither Book of Life or Big Hero 6 reach the high expectations. The Lego Movie surprised everyone and has amazing animation, but I think it's too much of a comedy to be considered for the more serious awards."

httyd,2lz3qk,YourAverageAnon,2,Tue Nov 11 20:58:42 2014 UTC,"Exactly. I wonder if the deeper storyline was a conscious choice by the director, knowing that the people who had seen HTTYD 1 had now aged, or a just something that happened."
httyd,2lz3qk,TheHelixNebula,2,Wed Nov 12 03:28:09 2014 UTC,"Well, being honest here. I absolutely love the first movie. I just rewatched it yesterday and got a bad case of the feels. However going back I couldn't help but notice that the animation quality has improved greatly with the second movie. I think they're on par in many regards and both are absolutely wonderful movies, but the second is just more visually appealing. So if you ask people which one they liked better and they vote for the second, it's not that they didn't like the first, they probably simply remembered an aspect of the second movie that stuck out to them as better than in the first."

httyd,2lsyat,dr0ma,16,Sun Nov 9 23:00:25 2014 UTC,"Yes; it's the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless that I find most compelling, and the first movie is all about that. Of course, it's still a major part of the sequel, but there can't be another Forbidden Friendship or Test Drive. I also found the first movie to have a tighter script and more time to dwell on key scenes.   Given that the past is just that, I did think that HTTYD2 went in the right direction, though, in expanding the world and upping the stakes. It hits some different emotions to the first, but does so very well, and the animation is beautiful.   But as much as I did enjoy the sequel (particularly after repeat viewing), I do find the wonder and joy of the first touched me a bit more."
httyd,2lsyat,Mithent,9,Mon Nov 10 01:27:27 2014 UTC,"You articulated this very well. I've seen the first movie so many times, but I can't bring myself to watch the second one again all the way through. I can't explain it, but I feel like the second movie went in a different direction than I thought it would from watching the first movie and the show... I think the second movie deemphasized the dragon/human relationships in favor of relationships between humans.    And you're right about HTTYD having a tighter script. SO MUCH happened in the second movie (Valka revelation, Dragon war, Stoic, Alpha fight...); it's really a lot to handle if you're very emotionally invested in the characters."
httyd,2lsyat,vowel_sounds,2,Mon Nov 10 02:39:12 2014 UTC,Spot on. This is a perfect explanation of my feelings as well.
httyd,2lsyat,imk0ala,1 point,Mon Nov 10 05:24:07 2014 UTC,I just wish I could forget the first movie entirely just so I can watch it for the first time again.
httyd,2lsyat,ProcrastinatorSkyler,6,Tue Nov 11 04:16:35 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. It's virtually impossible to beat the first movie in terms of discovery (the entire movie was discovery).  However, in terms of impact, I feel they were both on equal footing.  The original movie got its impact from that feeling of adventure/discovery, whereas the sequel obtained it by pursuing more adult themes (ie Toothless killing Stoick).  Thus I like both equally (more or less), but for slightly different reasons."
httyd,2lsyat,geesemaster,7,Sun Nov 9 23:24:47 2014 UTC,I agree. I prefer the first overall.
httyd,2lsyat,imk0ala,2,Sun Nov 9 23:37:36 2014 UTC,"Well, the first movie had a lot more character development. The second was all story(?), which isn't all a bad thing, but the only character who's any different at the end is Eret (and minor changes in Ruff, Snotlout and Fishlegs, but that hardly counts.)  It's very much the quintessential middle movie in a trilogy, except the trilogy isn't really connected in anything except setting and characters."
httyd,2lsyat,Snaz5,3,Mon Nov 10 02:19:31 2014 UTC,"How isnt Valka, Hiccup and STOIC different at the end of the movie? I say there was huge character development."

httyd,2lmv4s,RuthlessRampage,2,Sat Nov 8 01:11:51 2014 UTC,"Very nice.   These pictures seem to confirm my thinking process about how the sword works. Hiccup says the blade is coated in monstrous nightmare saliva that is close to napalm, which implies there would something akin to a sponge inside the hilt that'd coat the blade which would then burn as long as that stuff lasts.   But monstrous nightmares can put out their flame at will, which implies they need to constantly secrete this flammable stuff through their skin/scales. The sword seems to function similarly as there are holes in the blade to keep it burning, it extinguishes when retracted and started to fade away when the capsule was emptied in HTTYD2.   I'm quite interested though how Hiccup managed to pressurize the saliva, unless he's using some kind of a spring system, can't really tell by the video."
httyd,2lmv4s,janzuka,3,Sat Nov 8 09:20:24 2014 UTC,"unless he's using some kind of a spring system   Based on our past experience with Hiccup's inventions, I'd say it's safe to say there are springs involved in it somehow. He sure does love his springs."
httyd,2lmv4s,SimplyTheDoctor007,1 point,Sun Nov 9 03:23:18 2014 UTC,"Doesn't the sword ""rest"" in a position so the napalm pools up into the parts of the blades? Maybe the holes are just to fill them with a glue-like substance that wont drop that much, if it gotta stick to a dragon it sure gotta stick to a blade."

httyd,2llgih,gomamon15,16,Fri Nov 7 17:28:25 2014 UTC,"Powell deserved best score. The soundtrack to the first How to Train your Dragon was just absolutely incredible. It's my favorite music, I've got the CD in my car, I listen to it all the time. It just blows me away. How I'd love to be a part of an orchestra that is playing the HTTYD collection...

httyd,2llgih,StoicSalamander,6,Fri Nov 7 19:35:00 2014 UTC,John Powell was absolutely robbed of that Oscar.

I really hope this doesn't boil down to an inferior movie :s   I CANNOT, however, forgive Powell's snub for Best Score   Was he not given the praise or did he brag about it getting it? The former being the crime. Powell should feel free to brag about being the best composer this world has ever seen.  Also, welcome to /r/httyd! We have dragons!"
httyd,2llgih,KatzoCorp,3,Fri Nov 7 17:33:39 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'd much rather have HTTYD 3 to be delayed to 2018, just to have a more polished epic finale to the series and to not be contested by any major other film for the award.  Or have my dear namesake Katzenberg have someone burn Pixar to the ground. You know, whichever works."
httyd,2llgih,tomakotheblue,2,Fri Nov 7 18:59:13 2014 UTC,"Oh, I agree with your completely.  We all want How To Train Your Dragon to go out with a bang. It shall be remembered through time such as Shakespeare's work! That and John Powell's score!"
httyd,2llgih,FantasticMrPanda,1 point,Fri Nov 7 19:09:05 2014 UTC,"I'm actually torn on this.   Part of me wants them to take the safe route and push back to 2018 (though then they'll have to compete with The Lego Movie 2, but I seriously doubt it will be as good as the first one - could be wrong, but I just don't see what can be done with it).   The other, smaller part of me wants them to stick it out and decimate Pixar at their own game by getting better reviews and winning the Oscar over Toy Story 4. I know they are still Pixar, but I don't know what else they could possibly do with the story. The last film ended in such a conclusive way it just seems odd that they would make a fourth movie. Really odd...  Though my focus right now is on this year. As I said above, if Dragons 2 wins the Oscar this year my happiness will last for a while. I just wish some more Oscar predictors would throw their support behind HTTYD2 instead of Lego."
httyd,2llgih,SissySicilian,2,Fri Nov 7 19:56:48 2014 UTC,"The last film ended in such a conclusive way it just seems odd that they would make a fourth movie. Really odd...   The same reason they made Monsters University and Cars 2... Money. That's why. It doesn't matter whether the story demands for another sequel, those movies are always a safe bet money-wise (Toy Story 3 having made over a billion) so it's hard to resist. I'm getting the feeling Pixar is being pressured into making movies they don't really want to make."
httyd,2llgih,KatzoCorp,3,Fri Nov 7 20:30:39 2014 UTC,"I get the feeling as well that Pixar is being pushed because Disney owns Pixar and we all know how Disney likes to decimate (or buy out) anything that competes with it.    I unfortunately have to disagree on the beating Pixar part, though.  Disney and Pixar are so loved by young children and their families (and some older audiences with their earlier movies i.e. Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., etc.  I get the feeling that Dreamworks' franchises are almost geared towards an older audience, the teenagers/early adults.  I could see this as effecting box office numbers when the movies come out.  People will perceive Toy Story 4 to be a better movie because it made more.  I could definitely be wrong, but this is just the reactions that I see in my area."
httyd,2llgih,Razanur,1 point,Fri Nov 7 20:54:31 2014 UTC,"Agreed. While it is a ways off, and Pixar still can surprise, I do not think it will be as critically lauded as the previous 3. I just cannot for the life of me imagine what they would do for this film.   I'm just glad HTTYD is stopping after three (for now at least)."
httyd,2llgih,Razanur,2,Fri Nov 7 20:49:20 2014 UTC,"It actually comes down to which of the two, Lego 2 or Toy Story 4 will be better. HTTYD 3 will undoubtably be better than both of them, but if one of them fails miserably, Dragons 3 will have no trouble destroying it in the box office and at the academy awards.  If DeBlois sticks to 2017, let's just hope it is Toy Story 3."
httyd,2llgih,Razanur,2,Sat Nov 8 08:47:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks, happy to be here! :)  And I meant the Academy not picking the first Dragons soundtrack to win Best Original Score and instead going with The Social Network (don't get me started on this. I'm probably one of the only film nerds who finds Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross overrated as composers).  I also would have preferred Hans Zimmer to win for Inception, but Powell's soundtrack for the first movie is still one of the best I've ever heard. The fact that his score for the second film is just as good is remarkable, and he should get nominated again this year for it."
httyd,2llgih,FantasticMrPanda,3,Fri Nov 7 17:43:39 2014 UTC,"I was livid too. I'm a huge soundtrack buff, and you can usually predict whose going to get nominations based solely on if I bought the score immediately upon seeing the movie. I thought The Social Network had one of the dullest, most uninspired scores of that year, and then not only does if get nominated, it wins. I'm not saying HTTYD definitely deserved the win, there were a lot of good scores that year, but TSN was traaaaaaash  /endrant"
httyd,2llgih,Razanur,1 point,Fri Nov 7 19:18:47 2014 UTC,"That's actually a trend I notice. Film people salivate over TSN soundtrack, but film music buffs and soundtrack lovers despise it. I personally don't mind that it was nominated, it just didn't deserve the win.   And actually I think the Academy may feel bad about that decision. Last year at the Oscars they played 'Romantic Flight' before the Best Song/Best Score winners were announced - despite the fact that it did not win. That's why I think Powell will sneak in with a well-deserved nomination this year for HTTYD2. He probably won't win, but he'll get nominated. Wouldn't be surprised if they save his win for the third movie.   I'm probably over-thinking things here, but it's fun to analyze stuff like this. Now if only HTTYD2 wins the Animated Feature Oscar this year the pain of 2011 will subside. XD"
httyd,2llgih,okisiroki,3,Fri Nov 7 19:52:34 2014 UTC,"The older I get and the more Oscar nominated movies I see, the less I like the Oscars. It just seems really political to me anymore. And after Cloud Atlas got absolutely no nominations of any kind when it came out, I've never really been able to take the academy seriously again."
httyd,2llgih,FantasticMrPanda,1 point,Fri Nov 7 21:10:53 2014 UTC,"Funny you should say that, I've actually been meaning to check out Cloud Atlas after I read an article saying exactly what you said (I've pasted it below).  http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/10-biggest-mistakes-oscar-history/5/"
httyd,2llgih,bussianranana,1 point,Fri Nov 7 21:17:07 2014 UTC,"Do that. It's one of my favorite movies, and the soundtrack is amazing. I bought it the moment I got home from the theatre and finally stopped crying."
httyd,2llgih,okisiroki,1 point,Fri Nov 7 21:27:49 2014 UTC,"I guess this is an unpopular opinion among HTTYD fans, but I really liked The Social Network's score a lot and I do think it was very innovative in its own way. Just to get that out there. People tend to be too harsh on it because it won the oscar (undeserved, I admit), but I love listening to it while studying.   I too would have loved to see HTTYD win, but so what. You know who also never won an oscar? ENNIO MORRICONE. One of the most iconic composers of all time, and no oscars to show for it. So my advice to you is, it's okay to root for somebody to win, but don't take it too seriously when they don't.  I do hope Powell gets nominated for HTTYD 2 though! (For the score as well as for best song)"
httyd,2llgih,ThePostItNote,1 point,Fri Nov 7 20:38:32 2014 UTC,"I was probably most miffed at first about Dragon not winning, but as I've had time to calm down I realize I was mostly mad because I felt the weakest score won. I think I would have been okay (as in not so angry) if any of the others had won. It may just be because TSN's score was one that went with the movie, slow, quiet, introspective. It actually reminds me a lot of the quiet parts of The Dark Knight soundtrack, take that how you will. I prefer my music to have a voice, and I disagree with the idea of a score that you kind of forget about while watching the movie winning the Oscar. It was definitely the proper kind of score for the movie, don't get me wrong, but hell the score felt less like music and more like good sound mixing to me."
httyd,2llgih,ThePostItNote,4,Fri Nov 7 21:08:40 2014 UTC,"Regarding the Oscars, Disney/Pixar will usually win because the people voting are ignorant about animation. This article explains how many 2013 Oscar voters in either voted for Frozen or abstained from voting for the animation category. Was I disappointed that HTTYD lost to TS3? Yes! Was I surprised? No."
httyd,2llgih,Mithent,5,Fri Nov 7 20:28:33 2014 UTC,"Also, some members of the Academy admitted that they voted for Twelve Years a Slave without having seen it. I kind of start to understand why some people don't take the Oscars seriously.  Also, Wreck-it Ralph was robbed a year earlier. (Brave won instead)"
httyd,2llgih,HotDealsInTexas,2,Fri Nov 7 20:43:26 2014 UTC,"Wow. That's just pathetic. Not surprising, but pathetic none-the-less. I really like Frozen, but it's really sad the other films did not get any attention. I haven't seen The Wind Rises, The Croods (though I want to b/c Chris Sanders is the man), or Ernest and Celestine but I feel bad for them.   I still want Dragons to win an Oscar, and think it has a very strong chance, but man...oh man....oh man. At least I know if it loses, it is most likely because the Academy doesn't know a thing about Animation. Then again the trend is similar with live action films too, with biopics getting Best Picture over Sci-fi films/Fantasy Films/Animated Films etc.   Though this may play into HTTYD2's favor. Lego Movie had slightly better reviews, but it is full of pop-culture jokes and is based on a toy brand. Also it came out earlier in the year. That all works against it when it comes to Oscars - fair or not.  Big Hero 6 is getting good reviews, but not GREAT. True it has the Disney label, but I just don't see it winning. Nominated, yes, but not winning.  The Tale of Princess Kaguya is getting great reviews and will likely get a nomination. I love anime so I'll have to check it out, but I'm still pulling for HTTYD2 and I think it is not big enough (and it is foreign) so it will be overlooked for a win.  Pretty much every other anticipated animated film this year hasn't been up to par from what I've heard so that leaves HTTYD2. True it hasn't been talked about much, and it made its profit slower than Lego did, but the Blu-Ray comes out this week so chances are it will be discussed more and more. The reviews were very good, and I have a feeling a lot of people in the Academy were 'late to the game' like many people regarding this franchise. Fantasy also works better in this category, and reviews from critics aren't everything (as proven by Brave beating Wreck-it-Ralph though the latter had superior reviews). Plus remember it is DreamWorks Animations 20th Anniversary this year...perhaps voters will see this?   So it is definitely not a slam dunk, but I still see Dragons as the much under-appreciated front-runner.   tl:dr Despite being underrated to a fault, Dragons 2 is still the front-runner in my opinion despite online 'Oscar Predictor' pundits predicting otherwise."

That being said I did enjoy the rest of the story quite a lot. It was fairly well written and I enjoyed Toothless' perspective a lot, though this was the first Toothless fic I read.   I too felt Toothless' personality was captured extremely well and his and Hiccup's friendship matched my imagination perfectly. As you said I really felt them grow as characters.   What I didn't quite understand was if they ever truly understood each other. I felt during the battle that it was implied they had reached some kind of connection, but in the end they went back to how they were before which made me feel a bit cheated. Maybe what was meant was that they had reached a feeling of mutual understanding or something, I don't really know."

DreamWorks has no reason to re-render an entire movie. Rendering a movie at 48fps will essentially take twice as long as rendering a movie at 24fps. DreamWorks already has a lineup of movies for 2015/2016, so they need to dedicate their render farm to those movies, and not to a movie that has already shown in theaters.  Furthermore, it simply isn't profitable. How many people care about a higher frame rate movie and will buy this special edition? Not enough to justify the 200 million render hours that will be going into it.    If we are going to get a HTTYD movie at a higher FPS, it will have to be HTTYD 3. That isn't probable, mostly because Katzenberg (CEO of DW) wants to reduce production costs, not increase them."

httyd,2l8c4u,HotDealsInTexas,5,Tue Nov 4 04:32:00 2014 UTC,"A fighter, absolutely a fighter. Toothless's fireballs are certainly devastating against ground-based targets, but they're the only thing besides maybe a Skrill's lightning or the Screaming Death's fireballs that have the speed and range to be useful in air-to-air combat. Toothless's stealth, speed and maneuverability are also consistent with a fighter.  If we're talking about actual performance, Toothless's top speed has been estimated to be at least 300 MPH IIRC, and the theoretical upper limit is around 500 MPH - above this, his wingtips would be moving faster than the sound barrier. When a 12' propeller does this it deafens and incapacitates people hundreds of yards away. See this for details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_XF-84H#Noise Since Hiccup has not been rendered permanently death by repeated sonic booms, we can rule out supersonic wingtips. 300-500 MPH is the range seen in WWII propeller-driven fighters and some of the very first jet fighters. Toothless is a relatively small dragon, so he'd probably be a single-engine fighter, modified with additional avionics to support operations at night.  Incidentally, for those comparing Toothless to an SR-71, while the thing was fast it had no weapons whatsoever, being a reconnaissance aircraft. A better fit would be the Lockheed YF-12, a prototype interceptor (read: very fast but not so maneuverable fighter designed to shoot down enemy bombers). It was developed from the same predecessor as the SR-71, and was very similar looking and almost as fast, and carried three air-to-air missiles. Also, only three were built. The only criteria it didn't meet were maneuverability (it was supposed to get in the air as fast as possible, get near the comparatively sluggish bombers it was meant to destroy, and launch its missiles, NOT to take on enemy fighters) and size (it was HUGE for a fighter, and weighed more than the heavy bombers of World War II)."

Noise of article  Republic XF-84H:       The XF-84H was quite possibly the loudest aircraft ever built (rivalled only by the Russian Tupolev Tu-95 ""Bear"" bomber ), earning the nickname ""Thunderscreech"" as well as the ""Mighty Ear Banger"".  On the ground ""run ups"", the prototypes could reportedly be heard 25 miles (40 km) away.  Unlike standard propellers that turn at subsonic speeds, the outer 24–30 inches of the blades on the XF-84H's propeller traveled faster than the speed of sound even at idle thrust, producing a continuous visible sonic boom that radiated laterally from the propellers for hundreds of yards. The shock wave was actually powerful enough to knock a man down; an unfortunate crew chief who was inside a nearby C-47 was severely incapacitated during a 30-minute ground run.  Coupled with the already considerable noise from the subsonic aspect of the propeller and the dual turbines, the aircraft was notorious for inducing severe nausea and headaches among ground crews.  In one report, a Republic engineer suffered a seizure after close range exposure to the shock waves emanating from a powered-up XF-84H.

The only thing I know of that would theoretically come close is a tiltrotor. Perhaps a one or two-seat aerobatic tiltrotor with swept blades to avoid wave drag, electrically powered with room-temperature superconducting motors, a carbon nanotube frame, and futuristic batteries and/or capacitors with an energy density tens or hundreds of times higher than lithium-ion batteries. And that still wouldn't take a bola through its rotors at top speed and come out with just a missing horizontal stabilizer."

httyd,2l7i9y,Plailect,3,Mon Nov 3 23:44:57 2014 UTC,"Ehh I got pretty mixed feelings about Hitchups. As you mentioned the writing was very good but I think the story overall was quite mediocre. It works as sort of a memoir or diary, as seeing Hiccup grow and visit all kinds of different places is very satisfying, but overall it remains a bit dull. The time Hiccup spent in Constantinople for example was quite boring. OC's are good but eventually completely abandoned (I believe the author even acknowledges this). Author's plays with different languages and historical events was fantastic even though a bit unrealistic and I was surprised to see that Miklagard actually was Constantinople's name in old norse.   I also wished for more Hiccup-Toothless conversations. There were moments which screamed for Toothless' lines that sadly never came and practically all the conversations they had were bickering. I realize it was just friendly banter but there was hardly anything else. At least there were some serious and sweet lines, like when Toothless says how he can't live without Hiccup but isn't actually referring to his inability to fly.   I know a lot of people are not going to agree with me but I believe this story would've been better if all the mythology was left out. It just felt so patched in and detached from everything else. In my opinion the ending kinda sucked.   Overall an intriguing growing-up story with rather poor pacing and some mythology thrown in."
httyd,2l7i9y,janzuka,4,Tue Nov 4 05:54:13 2014 UTC,"I agree with you about the story, I disliked how long they spent in Constantinople and how boring the entire section was. This could have been alleviated entirely just by adding more Toothless. That part just screamed for more conversation between them, and more emotion could definitely have been put there.  I actually liked the mythology, especially how the gods and their legends were worked in, but I would have easily traded that for more of what I talked about above."

httyd,2l7i9y,AlphaSentry,5,Tue Nov 4 00:13:57 2014 UTC,"I loved how bittersweet it was, like the emotional ending ""Hitchups"" never had, but I think it was odd how Hiccup outlasted Toothless by so long. The impression I got from the story is that if one of them died, then the other would die as well. Even if that weren't the case, I feel like Hiccup's character as presented here would have lost the will to live almost immediately and would have not survived much longer. I also didn't realize how much longer the bond would lengthen his life. I thought decades, centuries at most, but this chapter presented him as living thousands of years."

httyd,2l4ku7,Plailect,7,Mon Nov 3 03:41:10 2014 UTC,"Glad to see you thoroughly enjoying fanfiction! I was the same way when I started, with that ""what is the stuff and why does it exist"" attitude, but once you start reading, it's surprisingly enjoyable.  As sad as I found the ending, I felt it fitting for such an emotional rollercoaster of a story, since it isn't necessarily a sad ending. They may not be able to communicate with each other, but they are together.  And hey, just look at the movies; their relationship is perfectly fine without the ability to directly communicate.  Will their relationship change? Yes, but it is by no means the end.  After an entire book of ups and downs, it managed to pull off an ending that fit the story; neither sad nor happy. Imo, it makes it stand out from all the other fanfics with the typical happy ending!"
httyd,2l4ku7,geesemaster,2,Mon Nov 3 04:22:49 2014 UTC,"I agree with you completely. The writing starts out sub-par but gets progressively better towards the end. The overall structure of the story is fairly good but drags out unnecessarily at times, like the time Hiccup spends in the nest. There were some parts that left me scrathing my head wondering just what the significance was and the teens obsession with stealing was a bit annoying.   Despite these flaws I still think this is a very good read, it's very emotional, depressing even at times and you shouldn't feel ashamed for shedding a couple tears along the way.  I'm still confused by the ending though: was it the last time they established their link, like a bittersweet last goodbye. Did it start anew, different? What excatly was meant by the very last line?"
httyd,2l4ku7,janzuka,3,Mon Nov 3 07:06:18 2014 UTC,It is an open ending: it depends on you. You are free to think wether their link remains or not.

It's very unique, and much darker than most of what I've read, and I liked that. I had been reading it before the last chapter was completed, and I thought the second to last chapter was the end and got so upset lol. I did really like how the author ended it though; sad, but not really at the same time. With just enough of it open for you to fill in with your own imagination."

I don't understand how people feel that it's weird. Watching a scene in 48fps for me feels smoother and more ""correct"", if that makes sense (probably just because nothing really feels stutter-y). Looking at the 24fps version, I immediately notice the missing frames, as it feels less smooth. The effect seems to be most noticeable for me immediately after I switch between the two- I'm not sure if that's due to me just getting used to the increased frame times from the lower FPS or if it's just based on what happens to be going on on screen at the time."

httyd,2kur05,darthlala,4,Fri Oct 31 04:02:09 2014 UTC,"I have mixed feeling about this one. I guess this is a pretty big episode with the introduction of Dagur, who I really enjoy as a character, so that's a big plus. But the way they combined it with the twins subplot didn't really fit, to the point where it just seemed plain forced. Come on, Hiccup is the master at handling dragons, I don't think getting one dragon out of the village would be that big a problem for him if it worked with every other one.   Also, I feel like the dragons lacked their own will at times. Barf and Belch seemed completely helpless without their riders, and where did that come from? The movies make it very clear that the dragons aren't pets, but here, the relationship between rider and dragon was very unbalanced. This also goes for these hand signals, which I'm very glad wasn't a recurring thing. Hiccup and Toothless could communicate just fine without things like this, don't turn this into Pokemon.  Don't get me wrong, I like Dagur, I really do. I just don't like the episode as a whole that much. Sorry :("
httyd,2kur05,FantasticMrPanda,1 point,Fri Oct 31 08:42:58 2014 UTC,"Come on, Hiccup is the master at handling dragons, I don't think getting one dragon out of the village would be that big a problem for him if it worked with every other one.    True. I also don't really like how the show acts like Zipplebacks need two riders. Sure, they'll be confused if each head is given conflicting commands, but there's no real reason that a single person could give commands to both heads. Perhaps the problem is that Barf and Belch are so used to the Twins' constant bickering that they refuse to listen to each other's riders... but that shouldn't prevent Hiccup from leading them out of the village.  I suppose another possibility is that Barf and Belch are not the brightest Zippleback in the flock...   This also goes for these hand signals, which I'm very glad wasn't a recurring thing. Hiccup and Toothless could communicate just fine without things like this, don't turn this into Pokemon.   I don't know, the hand signals are potentially useful where communication needs to be silent for stealth reasons (as with staging an ""attack"" without alerting Dagur). In theory, they'd also be useful if the dragons are too far away to hear, but in such a situation they'd probably also be unable to see intricate hand signals. Something like semaphore flags would work much better.   With Fishleg's first use of the hand signals, Meatlug's instinct was probably to rescue him first, so it does seem reasonable that he'd have to tell her to focus on the Twins. In that situation he could easily have just used words, but Fishlegs does seem like the type to use the new technique he came up with at every possible opportunity.  I do think the episode missed something very important: hand signals may have some value for communication between rider and dragon, but they'd be perfect for riders to communicate with each other while in flight. When flying at high speeds, the noise of the wind would drown out their voices, meaning at best they have to fly very close together and shout (fortunately this is something most vikings are rather good at)."

Really important bit of history that gives a far better perspective on the Pashmega vs ISIS than the news does.

httyd,2kgxx1,rodstudart,8,Mon Oct 27 22:15:05 2014 UTC,"The scenes with test drive and forbidden friendship always give me chills...but for some reason, i think my favorite scene is where Astrid learns about Hiccup's secret...just thinking about what Astrid was thinking when she saw Hiccup holding back toothless, almost as if hundreds of years of vikings vs dragons led to this moment, is pretty interesting..."
httyd,2kgxx1,dr0ma,5,Mon Oct 27 16:11:44 2014 UTC,"That also leads to one of my favorite quotes from both movies.   ""We just discovered the dragon's nest! The thing we've been after since vikings first sailed here! And you wanna keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon, are you serious?"" ""Yes.""  Funny how one single word can imply so much character development."
httyd,2kgxx1,FantasticMrPanda,2,Mon Oct 27 18:38:34 2014 UTC,"i think its funny how Astrid was like ""he's amazing"", then when they get back from flying she says this, almost like hiccup has a disposable pet that he has no emotional attachment to..."
httyd,2kgxx1,dr0ma,7,Mon Oct 27 18:45:07 2014 UTC,"For me, Where No One Goes flight. Its my favorite song, and I love the flight scenes where they separate. I also love Toothless always bailing Hiccup out of the bad flight paths..."
httyd,2kgxx1,coonwhiz,4,Mon Oct 27 15:41:21 2014 UTC,"For the first movie, it's most definitely the Test Drive scene. Even after all the times I've watched it, it's still exhilarating.  For the second movie, it's probably the scene where Valka first appears out of the clouds. It's so gorgeous, the music gives chills everywhere, and the cinematography is just...just LOOK at it..."

""You just gestured at all of me"" The scene where toothless is taken by the vikings to the dragons nest being similar to stoick's funeral scene ""We're vikings, it's an occupational hazard"" the scene in the 1st movie where toothless saves hiccup from the flames being similar to when hiccup falls towards toothless to save him."
httyd,2kgxx1,YoureDown,7,Fri Oct 31 11:57:46 2014 UTC,"For me is when he gets Toothless back from Drago and brings back the hope for all the people in Berk.   ""Yeah! Take 'em down, babe!"""

httyd,2kgxx1,palomonkey71,4,Mon Oct 27 15:28:36 2014 UTC,"I'd have to say:  1 Where No One Goes. Great music, great camera angles, and even better animation quality.  2 The montage where Hicucp is learning about Toothless/the dragons and starting to ""win"" in dragon training.  3 Battling the red death. Specifically the scene where he's falling into the flames and Toothless is diving in after him."
httyd,2kgxx1,Zverboj,4,Mon Oct 27 19:44:52 2014 UTC,"from the first i start to love more and more the 'New tail' part. love the music, and its just so much fun to see Toothless when he realize that Hiccup is on his tail  second, is straight after no one goes, when they land on the mini island and start to make the map. that part is just... wow, i want to do taht, explore and make my own map!"
httyd,2kgxx1,eXaLpHaXe,3,Mon Oct 27 19:35:29 2014 UTC,"There are quite alot of variety of scenes I quite love in both movies, but my most favourite are the fly scenes,    Test Drive - who could not say this should considered as one of the greatest scenes in movie history? Using the advantage of 3D, amazing camera shots, and such a fitting soundtrack, it's just felt like you were flying on the dragon. 10/10 would want to watch this in IMax again. Where no One Goes - really love it! Seeing Hiccup and Toothless flying, always makes me wonder how would be like to fly on a dragon? Amazing filmography, realistic physical movements, a soundtrack that makes you felt so relax and pump up. This is something you DO NOT WANT to miss. Battling the green (red) death,  I love all the camera angles of the dragon flying here, the best is when toothless just speed up and down chasing to save Astrid and catch her...oh shiet, I couldn't stop myself from my repeating that scene again and again."
httyd,2kgxx1,TheMisterAce,3,Mon Oct 27 17:19:31 2014 UTC,Romantic Flight.  It's such a beautiful scene.
httyd,2kgxx1,ab26,3,Mon Oct 27 19:23:42 2014 UTC,"Like others have said, test drive, forbidden friendship, the ""Where no one Goes"" flight scene. All those are great. I might have a new number one: In the sequel, when Toothless shatters the ice encasing him and Hiccup and we see Alpha Toothless for the first time. Such an amazing scene in a series with so many amazing scenes."

httyd,2kfywx,AlphaSentry,13,Mon Oct 27 06:46:17 2014 UTC,"Here's my list. Big old wall of text.  Note these are all either complete stories or winding down, they're mostly Hiccup/Toothless (No romance stuff ICK)  Hitchups  Most popular and probably well know fanfic, it answers the question at the end of the second act of the first movie of what would happen if Hiccup left Berk in exile. A story of growing up, it has a mystical tone and almost entirely focused around Hiccup and Toothless's relationship when Hiccup is given the power to speak to Toothless. Awesome story  I Hear Him Scream   Probably the most popular Hiccup gets turned into a dragon story it's somewhat a retelling of the first movie but darker and has some interesting (duh) twists. It is written in first person perspective which causes the quality to be a little weak at times and can be hard to follow. Still very good. The author also has some great one-shots and short stories that I definitely recommend.  Nightfall  A AU where Hiccup gets taken along with Valka by Cloudjumper and grows up half feral and then somehow ends up near Berk this story asks and answers some awesome questions regarding trying to interact with someone who's grown up and believes they're a dragon and doesn't know or can't speak a modern language. Only negative to this story it that it's written entirely in present tense and it can get confusing and weirdly worded at times.  Broken  Takes place 6 months after the first movie it's a (somewhat) more realistic take on how Berk comes to terms with having to live with their enemies after fighting against them for their survival for 300 years. Well written and edited their is some good stuff in here though it can be a little slow paced at times.  Standing Against, Standing Between  Probably the most criminally under-viewed series I've found, it's definitely slipped through the cracks of the entire fandom and that's a utter shame because this series is soooo good. It takes place roughly 2 years after the first movie and the premise is that Hiccup's curiosity and need to know everything gets himself, Astrid and Toothless wrapped up into a hidden world of ancient advanced civilizations and magic. Awesome OCs, great writing and editing makes this a utter joy to read and it's the first in a four part series! With a sequel series in progress at the moment, read this one please!  Honorable Mention (haven't finished it yet)  Good Thing You're Already Dead  Ugh this is a sad one, aka the reason I haven't finished it yet. A flying accident causes Hiccup to die and enter into the afterlife, pretty interesting look into the Viking afterlife and how our hero deals with being dead. Man is it sad.  Have any other recommendations/comments/questions don't be afraid to post! :D"
httyd,2kfywx,GodzillaSuit,3,Mon Oct 27 07:36:11 2014 UTC,"I just can't get into IHHS...The writing is just too sub par. The first person narrative really ruins it and the characters just act...well...dumb. Hitchups was fantastic, much more well-written and an awesome adventure story. I don't tend to go for the romantic angle, so I really like coming across a story whose focus isn't romance. I'll have to check out the other ones for sure."
httyd,2kfywx,PM_ME_TOOTHLESS_PICS,3,Mon Oct 27 11:38:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the list, I'll sure check them all out. Currently reading IHHS and I like it a lot but the writing isn't the greatest one. (BRACKETS!)"
httyd,2kfywx,ThePostItNote,2,Mon Oct 27 14:47:42 2014 UTC,"You should amend the Hitchups description. Hiccup cannot speak dragonese. The bond between him and Toothless allows him to understand what Toothless says, but not other dragons. The story at one point hints that forming bonds with other creatures might grant him the ability to understand them as well, but it was never explicitly confirmed."
httyd,2kfywx,ThePostItNote,1 point,Tue Oct 28 01:56:48 2014 UTC,"You just proved my point. As the author said, he can understand Toothless' dragonese. But he cannot speak it or understand other dragons. This is literally explained/described in the fic. There are many instances where Toothless has to act as translator for Hiccup. At no point does Hiccup walk up to another dragon and start chatting. They can understand him, Hiccup cannot understand them."

httyd,2kfywx,janzuka,6,Mon Oct 27 18:12:46 2014 UTC,"cracks knuckles (avoiding the main/popular stories covered by /u/AlphaSentry above)   The Dragon's King - Incomplete (sporadic updates)   Cloudjumper takes Hiccup with Valka when he is a baby.  One of my personal favourites. Good writing, good plot.   Becoming Lifbrasir - Complete   This is a 'what is Hiccup left Berk with Toothless' deviation, like Hitchups, except it focuses on Hiccup's return to Berk instead of his time spent away.  Incredibly well-written and worth the read (seriously, read this one).   Lightning and Death Itself - Complete (but sequels are incomplete)   On the romantic flight, Toothless turns both Hiccup and Astrid into Night Furies (thus beginning a dragon!Hiccstrid story).  This is actually a collection of 5 books. I would recommend the first one (the first 20ish chapters), and only continuing on if you enjoyed it.  Not the best writing, and I found the quality of the books to consistently decrease, but I still enjoyed the first story.   A Recipe for Disaster - Incomplete (regular updates)   Short and not the best story (it is still only a few months old), but it had some seriously adorable moments in it.  Centered around if Hiccup is accidentally transformed into a baby Night Fury.   Wild Hearts - Incomplete (regular updates)   Another Cloudjumper takes Hiccup with Valka movie deviation.  Hiccstrid.   Making History - Complete   AU in which Toothless didn't lose his tailfin. More than different enough from the movie to be fresh.   The Boy Behind The Mask - Incomplete (regular updates)   Another Hiccup leaves Berk deviation. Focuses on his adventure away from his tribe as he joins another.  OCxHiccup. And there is a Skrill :D   How To Help a Friend - Complete   After the events of the first movie, Hiccup loses his memory (to before meeting Toothless).  A story of his struggle to deal with people's dramatic change in attitude towards both him and dragons, and re-befriend Toothless.   Becoming the Enemy - Complete (sequel is 281k words and still regularly updated)   Dragon->Human and Human->Dragon transformation of a number of characters.  It's a long read (this + sequel is almost 500k so far), and the writing quality increases as the story progresses.  Really slow plot progression but has some great twists and an overall great plot (but it's too bad it progresses so slowly). The sequel is yet to be completed, so a lot of unanswered plot points so far.   Umbreytingu - Complete   I'm not a fan of this 'genre' (or whatever to call it) of human!Toothless, but this is my favourite in it.  If someone is interested in human!Toothless, this is probably the best fanfic to read.   Without a Hitch   For anyone who really enjoyed Hitchups and wants more.  A series of oneshots from the Hitchups universe.   Sleeping Arrangements - Complete   Fantastic oneshot.  General Hiccup/Toothless antics.  If you haven't read this yet, go do so. It's only a couple thousand words, no big deal. Take you 5 minutes, and it is worth it!   Mein Vollkommener Besch - Complete   Since I couldn't summarize it better, here is the summary from fanfic: Hiccup is horrified to learn that his tribe will be journeying to a gather with the other 12 Viking tribes. Toothless is even more horrified when Stoick commands dragons to be left behind to maintain peace with the other tribes . But Toothless will not be denied in protecting his rider, no matter what. Slight Hicstrid.  Good writing. Star-Struck-Inu is a classic author when it comes to httyd fanfics.   To Soar into the Sunset: A Night Fury's Odd Memoir - Complete   The original movie from Toothless' perspective.  Another well-written story."
httyd,2kfywx,Mithent,2,Mon Oct 27 18:14:43 2014 UTC,"I tried reading Becoming the Enemy but I couldn't get over the spelling mistakes and poor first person narrative.

httyd,2kfywx,TheCommonChild,1 point,Mon Oct 27 14:44:40 2014 UTC,"The writing in Becoming the Enemy is fairly poor at the beginning, but gradually does become better, especially in the sequel (however this could be due to me just getting used to it, I do not know).  As for spelling mistakes, they have never really bothered me in fanfics, so I don't judge based on that.  I read the stories more for the plots/stories, and can ignore minor errors."
httyd,2kfywx,_Hawker,2,Mon Oct 27 18:27:43 2014 UTC,I just finished To Soar Into Sunset and have to say it was a pretty darn good one. Follows the movie quite faithfully deviating slightly at times. Well written and the way Hiccup's and Toothless' bond was described was pretty much excatly how I've imagined it in my head. It was a bit weird at times and I don't really agree with the backstory or the whole timeline stuff but it was still a very good and emotional read.

Summary from fanfiction.net:   ""A veterinarian-soldier of the late 21st century gets thrown back in time over 1,200 years - and doesn't even realize it at first! Besides figuring out what happened, and finding a way home, he's about to discover several new patients of a species which never made it into any textbook.""         It's a bit unusual compared to most of the mentioned stories, in that it's based in a near future sci-fi universe. Now, the first thing that might turn people off is that Hiccup and Toothless aren't the main characters and that Berk isn't the main focus of the story. Well, in my opinion, the OC's are excellently-written and the world-building is great, definitely good enough to warrant stealing the spotlight. I personally enjoyed the hell out of it, and would urge everyone to have a look at it. It's 138k words and very much overlooked in terms of popularity."
httyd,2kfywx,geigenmusikant,2,Tue Oct 28 01:59:46 2014 UTC,"I like this one, it presents something new in contrast to the other fanfics, and I like the atmosphere of it, and the many many references and quotes it throws at the reader.                                   One thing it does is that it puts you in the perspective of a new character, a vet from the future, and tells you his story, it's not like the other fics where they're either a deviation from the movie's story or toothless's perspective or adventures starring hiccup and toothless. No, it's something unique, it took the movie's aesthetic and story, then built from there, predicting how the presence of dragons + the vet might affect the future, hence the story's name. Also, the main characters of the movie appear in 50% of this story, so it's not completely deprived from our favourite characters ;)"

His venture may be ill-timed, however, with tension growing in Berk and whispers of something horrifying growing on Fire Nest Island... [Takes place in-between films with some show references] A story about friendship and the forces that test it.  Hiccup is trying desperately to communicate with Toothless, and seeing his plight, Toothless takes him to Yggdrassil. Here, he is given the ability to speak to Toothless through their minds, however this has further unforeseen consequences.

It's a one-shot (though it has multiple chapters told in different character perspectives). I found it quite interesting and enjoyable to read, especially the author's input on other Night Furies and how their physical attributes (coloration, size, etc.) might vary from Toothless'.

Particularly from Toothless's POV. There are three authors who I think have done a neat job of tackling Toothless's future, and they are:  Lighty7  mathmonkey167  Proud2beMexican  Out of all three, I'd say math has done the best job, as far as quality of writing goes. Her first fic, Of the Night is complete, with a sequel up and a number of offshoots that take place between/during the original and the sequel.   Just thought I'd share!"
httyd,2kfywx,TheCommonChild,3,Mon Oct 27 07:43:22 2014 UTC,"People will recommend Hitchups, but I despise it. I commend the author on their dedication, but there are a number of dealbreakers for me:   It's not actually well written. The prose is average at best. I know this isn't proper fiction, but I absolutely fucking lost it when they described a campfire as ""moderate"" in the first passage of Chapter 2.  Its pacing is average. Telepathy? Please. Ugh. The telepathy would be tolerable, if it were not for just... Toothless is such a boring character.  And oooh, all those classic fantasy cliches...    It's not a good fanfic.  What is a good fanfic is Chasing Thunderstorms. It seems cliche'd, especially from its summary, but it explores Hiccup's and Astrid's characters, and their relationship, in a way that's almost unparalleled. The prose is nothing remarkable, and the climax is a bit meh (personally I kept on reading only because the denouement was so damn good), but the characterization is flawless! Absolutely flawless!  It also has a number of sequels.  The author of Chasing Thunderstorms (FoxyGirl?) is good pals with another author whom I'm fond of, Midrokkr-sami or something. She wrote ""Becoming Lifbrasir"" (there's some Norse characters there I can't reproduce). Becoming also attacks the question of ""what if Hiccup fled?"" but it is far better, in my humble opinion, than Hitchups.   That's all I remember for now."

It wasn't telepathy, though I see how you can get to that. It was pure understanding. Ever with your friends and you just know what they are going to say? It's like that in a way. Just exsaggerated. When you say fantasy cliches, what exactly are you referring to? Loki and Thor or the use of Greek Methology? I am at a lose with what you mean :/ but again, you are entitled to your opinions and at least you are a fan of the Movies ;)"
httyd,2kfvmf,H_M_Murdock747,5,Mon Oct 27 05:54:39 2014 UTC,I'm in a similar position. I just finished reading I Hear Him Scream and I have massive amounts of schoolwork on my shoulders. Well worth it though.

httyd,2kfvmf,Xureality,2,Mon Oct 27 06:31:25 2014 UTC,"I'm a pretty voracious reader, so I'm right there with you. I haven't read any HTTYD fanfiction (recommendations?), but the night before an essay is due would sometimes find myself in the middle of one.  Like right now."
httyd,2kfvmf,deprivedchild,3,Mon Oct 27 07:04:42 2014 UTC,Hitchups and I Hear Him Scream are the two most popular. Highly recommend both (although I prefered IHHS over Hitchups)
httyd,2kfvmf,geesemaster,2,Mon Oct 27 07:31:46 2014 UTC,Hitchups is meh. You should have read Chasing Thunderstorms instead.
httyd,2kfvmf,Fascist_Pink,3,Mon Oct 27 10:50:25 2014 UTC,"I am so very leery of modern AU. How highly do you recommend it? I mostly look for Hiccup/Toothless interactions in fanfiction (although I do love Wild Hearts, so a Hiccstrid focus isn't entirely offputting), how much of that is there?  You might be right about Hitchups - I very much want to enjoy it, but I kinda dropped it maybe a half dozen chapters in the first time I read it. I have been planning to try again."
httyd,2kfvmf,Althaine,3,Mon Oct 27 11:05:50 2014 UTC,"If you're looking for Hiccup/Toothless, no. But consuming only a particular subset of fanfiction is bad for your health.  Chasing Thunderstorms seems very cliche'd at first glance; the blurb, particularly. And as I've said before, the prose is nothing special. The climax is also somewhat mediocre. But, as an exploration of Hiccup and Astrid's relationship, it is peerless. Their depth is exceptional.   It's more a character study than anything else."
httyd,2kfvmf,Fascist_Pink,2,Mon Oct 27 11:12:30 2014 UTC,"But consuming only a particular subset of fanfiction is bad for your health.   Not sure how much I agree with that. Some people might argue reading fanfiction at all is bad for your health. (I don't just read in HTTYD or Hiccup/Toothless either, for what it's worth.)  Modern!AU plus a lack of Toothless just isn't enough to grab me at the moment. I'll probably read it one day if only due to to its popularity (and now your recommendation as a character piece), but probably not for now.  I saw you recommend Becoming Lífþrasir in another thread and might give that a go in the near future."

httyd,2ka59t,Snaz5,2,Sat Oct 25 18:48:24 2014 UTC,"Well, it follows the basic story of HTTYD, no major character changes or location changes, and (trying to not spoil anything here) as it says in the description Hiccup 'becomes the beast itself' (as you learn in the first chapter, he is 'turned' into a Night Fury by a very magical, very angry, and very shot-down Night Fury).   The story basically follows on from this, with Hiccup going through moments of despair, hope, loss and gain as he attempts to cope and survive with his new form, all whilst a darker and far grander scheme plays out behind him.  Very worth the read, a much more matured, adult and visceral story than the original movie storyline in my opinion."
httyd,2ka59t,janzuka,3,Sat Oct 25 19:31:25 2014 UTC,"Oh, so it's just a sorta perspective change retelling of the first movie?"
httyd,2ka59t,StoicSalamander,3,Sat Oct 25 19:34:37 2014 UTC,"Ehhh, sort of. There are definitely changes in the story (it's not a cut-and-paste version of the movie story, sorry if I was unclear!) and it does involve perspective changes between Hiccup, Toothless and Astrid, so it's not necessarily just a retelling.  I think the reason it's such a good fanfic (to me, at least, no judgment to any who dislike it) is because it takes the source material and doesn't just retell it in a different way, it builds upon it, making it's own little subuniverse within the original story by adding interesting yet lore-friendly and believable points to it."

She refused to play with ""boy toys"" like legos or video-games... And I did my best to fight it, but it's hard when the whole world is telling her what it means to be a woman.   Then came Astrid. Suddenly it's ""Astrid isn't afraid of anything."" ""Astrid is strong."" ""Astrid is tough."" ""Astrid don't need no man!"" (Ok so that was me not her!)  She kicks ass and I love her."

httyd,2k7sws,devanj,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:24:27 2014 UTC,omg awwwwww 2. just curious did they let her take the axe? i remember walking around in kindergarten dressed as a ninja fighting other kids with our costume weapons...ahhh the good old days...and now i feel old
httyd,2k7sws,devanj,2,Sat Oct 25 14:50:55 2014 UTC,"It was weird because before she went, I explicitly told her a bunch of times ""don't hit anyone with the axe"" and ""Don't let anyone take your axe because they will hit other people with it."" Then, when I went to pick her up, I offhandedly remarked to her teacher ""Haha, I hope she wasn't too much trouble with the axe. I wasn't sure if I should let her take it, so I hope it didn't cause any problems."" and her teacher laughed and was like ""Oh no, that's fine. She was very good!""  Then we got home and went about our day, and then like an hour before bed, my daughter said ""Mrs. so-and-so (not her teacher, some other name I don't recognize) said I'm in trouble for bringing a weapon to school."" I asked her why or what happened and that's pretty much all she could tell me about it. It was on a Friday (yesterday) so I guess I'll see monday."
httyd,2k9jas,Plailect,9,Sat Oct 25 05:11:11 2014 UTC,"I loved Where No One Goes, it was a great song, along with a great flight sequence.  It just barely tops out of Sticks and Stones imo"
httyd,2k9jas,geesemaster,7,Sat Oct 25 07:22:04 2014 UTC,Where No One Goes by far. At least it has the Test Drive theme and sounds somewhat relevant to HTTYD.  Go on you though! I bid you good luck on this quest.
httyd,2k9jas,MissRainbowtie,6,Sat Oct 25 05:42:10 2014 UTC,"Where No One Goes! you get the sense of freedom like you are just flying though the sky like a dragon. With its pump up beat, it gets you ready to do whatever you want. also test drive lol"
httyd,2k9jas,eXaLpHaXe,5,Sat Oct 25 06:15:17 2014 UTC,"As a song, Where No One Goes. I'm still not a fan of where it was in the film, or the way it kind of shoved the original main theme into the background. My own fault for getting hype for the Test Drive chords, but still."
httyd,2k9jas,SevenCell,3,Sat Oct 25 17:20:36 2014 UTC,"I think Where No One Goes, it just fits the mood so well. It creates such a sense of freedom with the scene it's incredible."
httyd,2k9jas,janzuka,4,Sat Oct 25 08:23:37 2014 UTC,"For the scene, I liked Where No One Goes more, but as a song, I liked Sticks & Stones more.  I don't really have a reason, I just do."
httyd,2k9jas,TheMisterAce,5,Sat Oct 25 09:17:26 2014 UTC,"I absolutely love where no one goes but maintain a strong dislike to sticks and stones because of how ""out of place"" sticks and stones is. The way where no one goes incorporated little motifs from test drive made it sound splendid and enabled it to fit in perfectly with the rest of the soundtrack, sticks and stones, that could be in any movie.  Still waiting for that instrumental version of ""where no one goes"" that plays at the end of the second movie."
httyd,2k9jas,P3T3RSAM,9,Sat Oct 25 14:00:09 2014 UTC,Both are overly modern for the movies.  With Where No One Goes being better in my opinion but I would have preferred it to be the credits song as it kinda sticks out in the movie as the only song with singing and a way more modern feel (for the dancing and dreaming being sung by the characters)
httyd,2k9jas,nukeclears,3,Sat Oct 25 15:07:52 2014 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting down voted just for expressing a perfectly valid opinion.   I partially disagree and partially agree with you; ""Sticks and Stones"" is an amazing song and I love too listen to it. That being said, I'm glad they only used it as the end credits song and not in any actual scenes (that I remember anyways), because it would have been very out of place.   ""Where No One Goes"", on the other hand, I like less as a general song, but I thought it fit the scene perfectly. I think the scene could have been improved by an instrumental version, but keeping the lyrical version for the credits."
httyd,2k9jas,nukeclears,1 point,Sat Oct 25 17:18:40 2014 UTC,"I still think ""beyond the clouds"" is vastly superior for the flying scene"
httyd,2k9jas,Randomixx,1 point,Sat Oct 25 17:35:09 2014 UTC,"Sticks and Stones just never really sat right with me, even the first time I ever heard it way back when. I still have no idea why, but the song somehow makes me feel ridiculously uncomfortable. /shrugs  Where No One Goes on the other hand is one of my favourites from both movies (out of a long list but shush). I'll admit that I thought it was a bit too Owl City-ish to fit at first, but it grew on me. Really fast."

httyd,2k9713,MissRainbowtie,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:43:20 2014 UTC,Can't wait to see what the creative people on this sub come up with!
httyd,2k92g7,StaRn3ss,7,Sat Oct 25 01:40:12 2014 UTC,"Fantastic job today /u/sim9 /u/StaRn3ss and all who set up the IRC! I had a blast live watching with you all.   Just reading the comments now there's an overwhelming amount of positive feedback, which is awesome. So I pose two questions:   Would you like more IRC live-watch community events in the future? How could your experience today be improved?   I'll leave the running of the IRC to these guys because they do such a great job at it. If you want the web link to be put in the side bar, also let me know by replying to this comment."
httyd,2k92g7,MissRainbowtie,4,Sat Oct 25 02:00:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks! In order to get the community more active, I believe more events in general would be great, as the turnout today was unbelievable.  One of the biggest things that needed improvements today was the countdown clock. As we have people from all over the world, I saw a few people come in late as they didn't realize there were time zone differences."
httyd,2k92g7,tomakotheblue,2,Sat Oct 25 02:09:17 2014 UTC,Someone doing a manual countdown in the channel would probably turn out for the better next time. Didn't seem like everyone's browsers were on the same time either.
httyd,2k92g7,sim9,3,Sat Oct 25 02:11:21 2014 UTC,"If you're up for it, a sidebar link here would be very appreciated :D  I'd love to do another live watch event in future.  We're thinking about putting together a back to back viewing of the first movie followed by the second for some time in the future.  We'll finalize the plan in the next few days and send out a scheduling survey so we can find the best day/time for everyone."
httyd,2k92g7,OrangeW,1 point,Sat Oct 25 06:12:47 2014 UTC,"Yes Have a livestream for future events- everyone was slightly out of sync, which ruined muh immersion."

httyd,2k92g7,AlphaSentry,3,Sat Oct 25 01:46:09 2014 UTC,Definitely. I am going to discuss with few people in the IRC and ultimately make a thread for holding an event. Maybe even a HTTYD marathon IRC party ;P?
httyd,2k92g7,vesrom,3,Sat Oct 25 01:47:43 2014 UTC,"Was a lot of fun, went by way too fast."
httyd,2k92g7,DragonBassist,2,Sat Oct 25 01:40:58 2014 UTC,Yeah totally didn't feel like 1.5+ hours
httyd,2k92g7,Lastandir,3,Sat Oct 25 01:46:39 2014 UTC,twas excellent
httyd,2k92g7,tomakotheblue,3,Sat Oct 25 01:41:08 2014 UTC,"Had a great time guys, thanks for making an already special event, much more :)"
httyd,2k92g7,nukeclears,2,Sat Oct 25 01:44:21 2014 UTC,Thanks! That was great time... Watching the movie with so many fans! And of course thanks for IRC channel - fantastic idea! I hope for more events in the future!
httyd,2k92g7,pixiestix88,3,Sat Oct 25 01:47:03 2014 UTC,"Glad you liked it, yeah we would love to setup more events."
httyd,2k92g7,AlphaSentry,2,Sat Oct 25 01:50:41 2014 UTC,"It turned out much better than expected, even thought a few were off-sync!  Count me in next time."
httyd,2k92g7,pixiestix88,2,Sat Oct 25 02:07:24 2014 UTC,"For the most part, we were all pretty synced with DW themselves. I thought that was a great accomplishment. After my countdown, I was surprised how many people kept up."
httyd,2k92g7,AlphaSentry,2,Sat Oct 25 02:10:11 2014 UTC,I was only there for like 10 minutes but it was fun.
httyd,2k92g7,pixiestix88,1 point,Sat Oct 25 17:45:50 2014 UTC,I failed to understand that you guys were streaming the movie live somewhere? i am confused?

httyd,2k92g7,janzuka,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:41:57 2014 UTC,The digital copy of the movie is out on itunes/amazon/etc.
httyd,2k92g7,OrangeW,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:48:39 2014 UTC,It's out on itunes.
httyd,2k92g7,Velith46,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:49:08 2014 UTC,Ah thank you guys. I will wait for the physical copy.
httyd,2k92g7,Velith46,1 point,Sat Oct 25 05:14:35 2014 UTC,"For the time I was able to spend watching it, it was fantastic.  The IRC made watching the movie with fellow fans sooo much better!"

httyd,2k7tpo,geesemaster,3,Sat Oct 25 07:23:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah definitely, I'll probably work on it and get it done this weekend.  Edit:  Ok so I have a working watchface now, looks like this. It's hard to find a picture that looks detailed enough when you shrink it, but that one looks really cool displayed on the watch."
httyd,2k7tpo,geesemaster,2,Sat Oct 25 15:41:24 2014 UTC,Nice! That's a great rendition of Toothless for something black/white and relatively low pixel count.
httyd,2k7tpo,okisiroki,2,Mon Oct 27 22:54:40 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I made a couple modifications and I'll probably throw it up on the Pebble store shortly for anyone interested."
httyd,2k6cha,8va,12,Fri Oct 24 06:49:37 2014 UTC,"Did you mention either of the soundtracks? More importantly, did you mention how much we adore him on this subreddit?"
httyd,2k6cha,MissRainbowtie,4,Fri Oct 24 07:43:37 2014 UTC,Unfortunately I only had a couple of minutes - this was the last picture taken before he went in to lecture. I basically said thanks for being a huge inspiration for me and then we talked about the kazoo.
httyd,2k6cha,StaRn3ss,2,Fri Oct 24 15:27:35 2014 UTC,How did you meet him? I am extremely jealous.

httyd,2k6p91,nukeclears,5,Fri Oct 24 13:10:24 2014 UTC,"Indeed, I remember this. This was the day I freaked out because my favorite movie would be getting a sequel.   Personally, I like Beyond the Cloud better simply because it sounds more epic."
httyd,2k6p91,okisiroki,2,Fri Oct 24 11:35:48 2014 UTC,"Personally, I like Beyond the Cloud better simply because it sounds more epic.   Agreed.  Though /u/8va did a good job too here."

httyd,2k6p91,Griclav,2,Fri Oct 24 10:55:07 2014 UTC,I actually prefer Where no One Goes. Something about it gets me so pumped when I listen to it.

httyd,2k1qkg,Skyblacker,4,Fri Oct 24 23:38:20 2014 UTC,"I hope to see a scene where Hiccup decides to test Toothless' new limits by seeing how high they can fly (possibly involving Hiccup creating a breathing apparatus for high altitude flights), flying high enough to see that his world is round.   Not sure this is possible. I did a little research and it sounds like you may have to go above 50,000 feet for the curvature of the horizon to become obvious. Unfortunately, this is also about the altitude where the air pressure becomes so low that even breathing pure oxygen there isn't enough for a human to survive. Hiccup being able to create an oxygen mask with medieval technology is highly unlikely, but there's no way he can build an actual pressure suit.  For that matter, Toothless could have problems. Even assuming that draconic lungs, like those of birds, are more efficient than human lungs, you eventually reach an altitude where water, and in particular the fluid inside the lungs, boils at body temperature and makes it impossible to get oxygen. For humans this limit is a little over 60,000 feet. If dragons have a higher body temperature... say, 50 *C compared to our 37 *C, their limit would be around 50,000.  There's also the issue that even if Toothless can get enough oxygen to survive, an animal his size needs a LOT of energy to sustain flight, especially in thin air.  However, the spherical nature of Earth is evident even from the ground: as a ship goes over the horizon, the hull disappears first followed by the sails. This has been discovered at least once in ancient times, and one Greek dude calculated Earth's circumference fairly accurately: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference As a culture of sailors, the Vikings would almost certainly know the Earth was spherical."

Like in The Last Airbender, people are much stronger, more resilient, and have been shown to exist in a different solar system than our own.  Also, it's fiction.  It doesn't necessarily have to follow the science.  We don't know that in the movie, they are aware that their planet is round yet. And in the books, they are not..  And yeah, they could know.  But it's one thing to know that the planet is round by seeing a ship go over the horizon, and another thing entirely to actually see that the planet is curved.  In short, I don't (usually) let the science get in my way of enjoying a great story and beautiful animation.  edit: and kudos to you for doing the research."

httyd,2jvrao,StaRn3ss,7,Tue Oct 21 16:18:33 2014 UTC,"Since each movie released with a short, the most fair comparison of DotDR would be with Boneknapper.  By this benchmark, DotDR falls way short IMO.  DotDR suffers from the same poor production values that the tv series suffered from.  Many of the environments are simple -- forest floors are flat textured planes.  The lighting is not up to movie quality, however it is better than the TV show.  However, a major problem for me is that Toothless looks notably off in many of the shots.  I've been trying to put my finger on it, but I'm not quite sure if it's the lighting, or the angles/poses he is shot from, but something is in the Toothless uncanny valley here.  Writing-wise, there isn't much emotional impact to the story, whereas Boneknapper did a better job of making you care about the characters.  Boneknapper's jokes are also much more funny, although DotDR definitely has a couple good ones also (just not as hard hitting).  Based on the credits, it looks like DotDR was shipped off for cheap overseas outsourcing, much like the tv production.  Wish Dreamworks could have put their A team on it, but I'm still glad to have any new Dragons content (at the end of the day, I'm a fan afterall ;))"

Hopefully, Dreamworks decides that they might want to have a Christmas special for HTTYD like how Disney does specials for Toy Story; however, I find this highly unlikely. Was it just me or did Gothi look kind of weird? And I never really noticed but Toothless has kind of a camouflage pattern on his body.

I thought it was humorous, more so than the show usually is.  The story wasn't anything special and it didn't feel much more than a TV episode.  Thankfully though, the animation quality was a bit better than what is seen in the show.  I wonder if this short was meant as a preview for season three seeing as how it's the same sort of animation and it does use the same end credits song.  Overall, it was pretty good, but nothing amazing like GotNF.  I do hope that Dreamworks proper makes a short for HTTYD2 like they did with GotNF."

httyd,2jugb1,tomakotheblue,1 point,Tue Oct 21 15:58:16 2014 UTC,I'm using a 20GB 1080p movie on a GTX 770. I've also got a monitor with a native refresh rate of 144hz so I imagine that makes a difference.

Nah, native refresh or not, it wont matter if the artifacts comes from mpc-hc."
httyd,2jugb1,tomakotheblue,1 point,Tue Oct 21 18:05:23 2014 UTC,"It runs pretty great unless the scene is moving really fast, I was able to change some of the SVP settings and get the artifacting to a minimum."

httyd,2jugb1,geesemaster,2,Tue Oct 21 01:44:11 2014 UTC,"I pulled up this image and the same frame from my copy of the movie, and there is a slightly noticeable reduction in quality.  I'm not saying the image quality is bad after the re-render, but there is an unavoidable reduction."
httyd,2jugb1,geesemaster,5,Tue Oct 21 01:47:41 2014 UTC,that is a literal print screen of before the quality reduction from a direct blueray rip. I'm also rendering it as a 0 quality reduction file.  file size is estimated to be a bit over double the original size.  be back with a comparison in a bit
httyd,2jugb1,dragonkuff,1 point,Tue Oct 21 01:58:11 2014 UTC,"Hmm, quality loss is probably just from the screen cap -> imgur upload then. Fair enough, you've convinced me, I would give it a shot!"

Any color and small quality differences due to a reduced bit rate are to be disregarded as these are not present in the video file."

httyd,2jugb1,palomonkey71,2,Tue Oct 21 07:42:20 2014 UTC,What does a frame look like that originally had a lot of motion blur? The sample is from a fairly static sequence.

httyd,2jugb1,H_M_Murdock747,15,Tue Oct 21 16:32:47 2014 UTC,It seriously does nothing to change the audio. That's like saying your popcorn is affected by the framerate.
httyd,2jugb1,mr_abomination,2,Tue Oct 21 01:36:08 2014 UTC,It most certainly affects my Slurpee though.
httyd,2jugb1,IAmSlimShady,5,Tue Oct 21 01:38:05 2014 UTC,The audio will be added directly via mkv merge and will not get a separate render pass so quality loss will be impossible and it should match up perfectly.
httyd,2jugb1,TaskForce247,1 point,Tue Oct 21 03:44:38 2014 UTC,I've seen audio sync issues when rendering it on the fly. When you pre-render it there shouldn't be any issues at all.

I find it hard to believe that Toothless is a full 1000 kg though. Half a ton maybe, but he's not significantly larger than a horse and they rarely exceed a ton."

This is just my personal guess but I'm also a little disappointed that they didn't use the same software as they did in the movie."
httyd,2jmu9e,nukeclears,3,Sat Oct 18 21:06:13 2014 UTC,Why don't they just copy over the character models from the movie..now that im thinking about it.
httyd,2jmu9e,nukeclears,3,Sat Oct 18 21:42:38 2014 UTC,"Probably cause the character models would look funky considering this software they're using isn't as sophisticated as the one they use in the movie (in terms of textures, physics, subsurface scattering...etc).  The teens are also younger in this one (guessing around 17) so it would make sense that they look younger and are wearing somewhat different clothing."
httyd,2jmu9e,MissRainbowtie,3,Sat Oct 18 22:25:08 2014 UTC,"Fair enough, but everything looks a bit too clean.  Something as simple as AO would probably go a long way in making it look more realistic.  I do wish they would atleast make toothless less derp though."

I'm a filmmaker but I think we've had this 24 fps nonsense for far too long and for no other reason than that it was the lowest(=cheapest) frame rate we could get away with back when the standard was set for motion pictures back in 1927-1930. Let's ditch 24 fps, skip 48 fps and go straight to 60 fps as the new default frame rate.  Yes it'll be more work and more expensive but it's well worth it and personally I'm way more excited about higher frame rates than I am about stereoscopic 3D or 4K/8K resolution (higher bitrates are far more important)."

httyd,2jmdhj,okisiroki,18,Sat Oct 18 17:32:36 2014 UTC,"Toothless had to grab Hiccup by the leg to catch him before entering the fire.  If you look at the way Hiccup is falling into the fire with his legs up and Toothless with his head down, the fastest way for Toothless to catch him would be to bite him by the ankle.  It also really creates a strong parallel between Hiccup taking Toothless' tailfin (saving him from the Queen's control), and Toothless taking Hiccup's leg (to save him from the Queen's fire).  I am skeptical to the burn wounds theory, since the fire would've taken a lot more than just a single leg if Toothless hadn't been able to catch him in time.  As for Toothless catching Hiccup but leaving one leg sticking out into the fire, I don't really see how that's plausible, considering Hiccup fell with his legs being nearest to Toothless, so those would be the most safe and receive less burns when Toothless caught him."
httyd,2jmdhj,geesemaster,8,Sat Oct 18 17:39:33 2014 UTC,"hmm, but in the second movie he says ""you couldn't save all of me"" which seems to imply that it wasn't done by Toothless. And i'd think he'd mention it."
httyd,2jmdhj,nukeclears,11,Sat Oct 18 18:52:19 2014 UTC,"Aha, that quote is one of the reasons for this theory :D  Toothless was unable to save all of Hiccup, since he was forced to injure his leg in order to save him (thus being unable to save all of him)."
httyd,2jmdhj,geesemaster,15,Sat Oct 18 18:56:50 2014 UTC,"I didn't think this was the case until the second movie came out and Hiccup says   Oh, yeah. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who... shot him down. [Valka gives him a puzzled look] Hey, it's okay, though! He got me back! [to Toothless] Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So, peg leg!   Especially 'You just had to make it even' seems to imply some blame, perhaps Toothless biting his leg to save him in time."
httyd,2jmdhj,sim9,8,Sat Oct 18 18:39:23 2014 UTC,"I just rewatched HHTYD 2 and remembered a scene.  CAUTION ! HTTYD 2 SPOILER AHEAD:  After Hiccup met his mum and she shows him the hideout of the Alpha, he tells her how Toothless was shot down by himself and says, quote ""I am actually the one who shot him down. Hey, it's okay though. He got me back. Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So peg leg!"" And points at his missing leg.  He said that in a sarcastically sounding tone, but maybe, he wasn't joking and knew what happened before Toothless grabbed him and he getting unconscious by the blood loss. So because of that, I actually think, Toothless really bit his leg off by accident to get to Hiccup in time and save him from the flames."
httyd,2jmdhj,DyedKitty,5,Sat Oct 18 18:40:32 2014 UTC,"i was thinking a lot about that as well, and reading that Toothless bit it off to save him makes a bit of sense, cos in the second film Hiccup says the ""you just had to make it even"" which could indicate that it really was Toothless"
httyd,2jmdhj,Zverboj,2,Sat Oct 18 18:45:37 2014 UTC,"I really don't think Toothless caught Hiccup by his leg. On the ground Toothless is holding Hiccup, how could they end up like that.   Sure Toothless could've grabbed Hiccup's leg and then tossed him upwards but I think Toothless just caught up to him and shielded him from the fire, and Hiccup lost his leg when hitting the tail or during the landing."

And I was like noo that can't be but I can see the point, Hiccup was pretty much engulfed before Toothless even reached him.   Similarly there are discussions about Hiccup's ""magic"" sword. Either these discussios are from before the movie launch or people haven't been paying attention, it's clearly mechanical. Only suspicious thing about it is how Hiccup keeps extending and retracting it, you need energy for that. Maybe it uses springs and pressurised zippleback gas or something."
httyd,2jmdhj,janzuka,2,Sat Oct 18 18:44:08 2014 UTC,I didn't even realize there was a debate about Hiccup's sword being 'magic'... just... what.  This should end that debate instantly. It is undoubtedly mechanical.  The third image explains the spring mechanism for extending the blade.

One of the biggest thrills I've had in recent memory is taking my car out on an open stretch of highway during the opposite of rush hour. No other cars, no cops in sight. I rolled down my windows, cranked the stereo to max, and put on the three songs I mentioned. I didn't check my speedometer very often, but I did check it once, and I was doing at least 110.

httyd,2jhbju,Plailect,4,Fri Oct 17 02:32:46 2014 UTC,"What do you think of the writers' choices regarding the characters? (Anything from traits to names)   For the most part, the main characters are very well developed for an animated movie. As for the secondary characters, this sums up my thoughts very well.      What major plot points did you like or not like? If not, how would you change them?   My thoughts on the matter are in this post if you want to check it out.  Personally, I think the movie could have continued on in the exact same way, minus the glowing and getting stuck in the Alpha's ice.      Did you enjoy the sequel more, the same, or less than the original. Why?   I liked the two movies equally, but for different reasons.  I prefer the first movie's storyline and overall feel.  Since videography stuff is a hobby of mine, I loved the second one for the awesome lighting/animation/cinematography.  Of course the video aspect is the first and the story of the second are both still awesome, but they definitely differ from one another.      What do you think of ""Where No One Goes""?   Loved it.  I am also liked Sticks and Stones from the first movie, and ended up becoming a minor fan of some of Jonsi's other songs as well (particularly Go Do and Animal Arithmetic, they are the most httyd-like songs of his).  However, I can see why some people do not enjoy it; it really is very different than the traditional John Powell score.      What do you think of the darker tone of this movie?   Enjoyed it of course!  The darker themes are what really sets the series apart from other animated movies, and makes it appeal to the more mature audiences."
httyd,2jhbju,geesemaster,1 point,Fri Oct 17 03:14:32 2014 UTC,"Alright, I have finally managed to get enough time to give a proper reply to these, and since yours has the most points, I'll start here.  Characters: I do think that the development of the characters was well done for the most part. Some of the secondary characters were a little flat in the first movie, but the second really cleaned it up. They had much more of a ""genuine"" feel which definitely contributes to why I enjoy the second one more. More on that in a second.   Major Plot Points: I actually loved the ending of the second movie. It felt like a necessary part of the development of the already very strong parallels between Toothless and Hiccup. Hiccup transitions into an adult between the first and second movie (I'm assuming it's shown in the show, but I haven't seen it), but Toothless did not have much of an equivalent transition, which was odd until the end of the second movie because both of them always seem to have striking parallels in their characters.  Sequel vs Original: I would like to start with saying that I loved both of these movies. They were absolutely amazing and is honestly the best franchise of movies I have ever seen. That being said, I prefer the second movie. The first movie was great, and I would be hard pressed to come up with any major criticisms. The second movie on the other hand, was a completely different experience for me. I felt like I had a connection with that movie, something about it that I found incredible. I believe that it is a combination of the genuine characters, the more mature direction, and the excellent soundtrack.  ""Where No One Goes"": Incredible. Just, amazing. I found it surprising, yet extremely appropriate for the flight scene where it was first used. The music gave that scene a more ""grand"" feel which really felt amazing to watch; I would honestly rank that as one of my favorite scenes in the entire franchise.  Darker Tone: Can't argue with you there."
httyd,2jhbju,geesemaster,2,Fri Oct 17 21:31:14 2014 UTC,"Characters   You could very well be correct regarding better development in the second movie.  I noticed it, but simply attributed it to my having watched the TV show and shorts prior to the second movie.   Major Plot Points   I am all for Toothless challenging the Bewilderbeast and becoming the new Alpha.  It was just the whole mega-blue-Toothless that threw me off.   Sequel vs Original   Personally, I preferred the soundtrack of the first movie over the sequel's.  Not to say the second soundtrack was bad, I still love it!   Where No Ones Goes   Couldn't agree more, definitely my favourite flight sequence."
httyd,2jhbju,MissRainbowtie,1 point,Fri Oct 17 22:12:17 2014 UTC,"First off, I love this post and your questions! Thanks for initiating some great discussion.  Characters  At first, I really didn't like the names Ruffnut, Tuffnut, Snotlout, Fishlegs. I thought they sounded rather immature and pandering to kids. But after watching the TV show, they really grew on me and I can't imagine anything else now. The show also does a great job of fleshing out their relationships. I particularly love the rivalry between Snotlout and Hiccup. The friendship between Fishlegs and Hiccup is also great when they first discovered the Typhoomerang. The twins are also hilarious additions to the cast that I can no longer imagine without.   I would've actually preferred for Valka to be kept as the antagonist as was originally intended. I feel her character could've been further explored. Drago fell a little weak for me after all the atmosphere building him up. Eret was fantastic but was understandably robbed of screen time.  Plot points  None in HTTYD come to mind. Perhaps the idea of a queen in charge of dragons. I never understood whether it used mind control to keep the dragons going back. That part was always a little unclear.  Drago's backstory and ability to control and subdue dragons was skirted over as many have already pointed out. Toothless' super saiyan mode was also a bit of a deus ex machina. The plot was more convoluted and complex than the first, not necessarily a bad thing but they could've done a better job of making things clear.  Personal impact  They cheer me up immensely and have completely shaped my reddit experience.   Original vs Sequel  I'm an original lover. My expectations for the sequel were raised ridiculously high (my own fault). I also love the original soundtrack just that tiny bit more.   Where No One Goes  Good song, but still a bit too modern. Shouldn't have been used in the beginning of the movie during the flight sequence.  Darker tones  Great and necessary. Some of my favourite parts of the movie was the atmosphere of Drago. In Stoick's first flashback and the gang's capture on his battleship armada. I have issues with the execution of the death of Stoick but I love the Viking boat funeral following it, so that compensates for it.     EDIT: Added HTTYD2 answers for the first three questions."
httyd,2jhbju,janzuka,1 point,Fri Oct 17 03:18:47 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  Characters: I still don't like the names a lot, but I feel like they needed something different about all of the names. I don't think I could take these movies seriously if someone were named ""Bob"" or something else equivalently boring. I haven't seen the TV show yet (top of my list!), so I can't really comment on the relationships it brings up.  Plot Points: The idea of a queen or alpha is a good idea in theory, although I do feel like it is more of a plot device then anything. It was more of a minor complaint, if one at all. Same goes for Drago (Seriously? No one thought of a better name than this?). I actually loved the ending of the second movie. It felt like a necessary part of the development of the already very strong parallels between Toothless and Hiccup. Hiccup transitions into an adult between the first and second movie (I'm assuming it's shown in the show, but I haven't seen it), but Toothless did not have much of an equivalent transition, which was odd until the end of the second movie because both of them always seem to have striking parallels in their characters.  Personal Impact: I felt much happier immediately after watching the second movie! It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and I honestly consider these movies to be on my top 5 all time movies list.  Sequel vs Original: I would like to start with saying that I loved both of these movies. They were absolutely amazing and is honestly the best franchise of movies I have ever seen. That being said, I prefer the second movie. The first movie was great, and I would be hard pressed to come up with any major criticisms.

I believe that it is a combination of the genuine characters, the more mature direction, and the excellent soundtrack.  ""Where No One Goes"": While I can't really disagree with it being too modern as that is completely personal opinion, I thought it was absolutely amazing. I also feel like the flight sequence was dramatically improved by that music, and it felt, for lack of a better word, epic. The music gave that scene a more ""grand"" feel which really felt amazing to watch; I would honestly rank that as one of my favorite scenes in the entire franchise.  Darker Tone: I loved the darker tone, and I really feel like it was more relatable than the ""pretty much everything turned out perfect"" ending to the first movie. I thought the execution of the death of Stoick to be a defining moment in the movie. I honestly thought, based on the first movie, that they couldn't possible kill Stoick, especially not with Toothless! Not only was that wrong, It definitely improved the movie by giving it a sense of great loss, which definitely helped the suspension of disbelief."

httyd,2jex5z,barracuda415,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:38:23 2014 UTC,"And in the German version, Toothless was translated to Ohnezahn (""Withouttooth""). I'm not a particular fan of that choice."

httyd,2jfb85,StaRn3ss,2,Fri Oct 17 07:41:36 2014 UTC,Wow 3 hours. Time well spent I imagine considering how its going to look great. Can't wait for the video!

httyd,2jf11b,darthlala,8,Thu Oct 16 13:53:24 2014 UTC,"I altogether liked the episode, it was a very enjoyable take on the vikings' culture and their superstitions. It was also nice to finally see a somewhat Toothless-centered episode that dealt with higher stakes than usual. The ending certainly is one of the show's most memorable moments.   The animation was great too, and the episode had quite a few funny moments. (My favorite beingwhen all the vikings fill up the buckets to extinguish the fire, and then Stoick just throws the whole thing over the house. lol)  The only real complaint I have is that I would have loved to see Toothless and Hiccup on their own for a while, as he suggested. We barely have any of this in the show unfortunately, so I was a bit disappointed when it quickly took another turn. But, for what it is, this episode was pretty great. Probably one of my favorites."
httyd,2jf11b,FantasticMrPanda,2,Thu Oct 16 15:51:18 2014 UTC,"The ending was one of the best episode endings. And overall it was very interesting to watch. I guess Hiccup and Toothless don't get much attention as a pair because the show is supposed to present the whole gang and not just them overall. They still get most attention anyway, even though it's not as evident as in the first movie."
httyd,2jf11b,ShadowRaven6,1 point,Fri Oct 17 08:03:12 2014 UTC,"The only real complaint I have is that I would have loved to see Toothless and Hiccup on their own for a while, as he suggested.   Unfortunately, that's probably just a limitation of each episode being <30 minutes. Imagine how each episode could be if they could use more time!"
httyd,2jf11b,FantasticMrPanda,1 point,Sat Oct 18 03:16:46 2014 UTC,"Not really, they could just do a two-parter as they did with Heather Report or the season finale, or just a continuous plot as they did with In Dragons we Trust/Alvin and the Outcasts. Aside from those, most episodes have little connection or continuity between each other, which is somthng that could generally be improved in Seasons 3 and 4."
httyd,2jf11b,ShadowRaven6,1 point,Sat Oct 18 07:14:47 2014 UTC,"True, but I'm assuming they'd want most of the episodes to be just 1 episode and save episodes that get split for stuff like the mid-season episode and the season finale."
httyd,2jf11b,MissRainbowtie,5,Sat Oct 18 13:26:09 2014 UTC,Science!
httyd,2jf11b,TheMisterAce,3,Thu Oct 16 13:53:34 2014 UTC,"I love the Vikings Have Their Tea ending. You could slap that onto the end of any episode and make it better.   Also, this."
httyd,2jf11b,PetevonPete,2,Fri Oct 17 00:01:33 2014 UTC,"Also, this.   I loved that bit. I really made me laugh."
httyd,2jf11b,nukeclears,3,Fri Oct 17 14:44:20 2014 UTC,"This ep has one of the best jokes on the show  ""She was cursed by Odin to sail to the ends of the Earth""  ""Did it work.""  ""No one knows. She kept showing up again from the opposite direction.""  Although this ep did annoy me because the metal perches would PREVENT fires, not start them. They ground the houses."
httyd,2jf11b,TheMisterAce,2,Fri Oct 17 14:41:50 2014 UTC,Maybe also link to where you can watch the show

httyd,2jbbt2,Silent_Sky,2,Wed Oct 15 16:51:27 2014 UTC,"I used pvc vinyl stickers and x-acto knife. Basically I traced the pattern over the stickers and then remove the bits of sticker I don't need. The red part is another sticker on top of the black sticker to make sure the alignment is correct. And then I lifted the whole thing using tape and place it on the tablet, and it just stays.  Since I'm making a couple for my friends I'll do a kinda tutorial/timelapse later today.  Also sorry for the late reply, I went to take a nap."
