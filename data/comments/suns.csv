They both have great shooting percentages and do not miss free throws. Throw Mark Price on some of the same teams as Nash did and you have a very comparable team. I think the average team would gladly take either one of those two.   The MVP trophies are great and all(trust me I've held them)  but neither of them won titles and both were just as deserving

I guess because its summer league and it doesn't matter but for real, he is a starter type of player, it would be nice to see him dominate some of this competition. I guess just because it doesn't count, there really isn't a point in him trying that much, idk."
suns,3e0zg3,bails903,11,Tue Jul 21 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"He'll need a PG who can set him up (pick-n-roll). If you think Len is capable to create his own shots, you're going have a bad time."

Now though? His SL performance looked awful. He's getting bodied in the paint and can't do a damn thing about it, and doesn't contest dudes when he knows he going to get dunked on. I really hope they were just playing it safe with him, because if his SL performance is any indication of what we'll see from him on the court.... Then he's got a lot more growing to do than I thought.   Zach Lowe said it best...

Also, some of those passes and receiving of passes could not have been lazier. Inexcusable after the fifth steal.  Only bright spots were James, Warren, and Booker. If those, only Booker and James we're surprises. James better have a contract with us. He's basically what you hope Price can do defensively and light years more useful than him offensively"

Keeping Knight should be good. Drafting Booker is looking better by the minute.   Len's mustache alone should get us into 'B' range."

suns,3dydvl,jray4033,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:36 2015 UTC,Listening to Isiah Thomas talk about basketball completely explains why he failed in management.
suns,3dydvl,scooper1030,16,Mon Jul 20 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"The guy who writes these articles is tasked with knowing about all 30 teams. That is hard to do unless you're Zach Lowe and have no life outside basketball. So the ""analysis"" becomes platitudes and stereotypes for lesser-known teams, with all of the attention placed on the contenders and big markets.   The result is something like this. It may be ""hard to get excited about the Suns' moves"" if you seldom pay attention to the team and are only interested in the big names like Aldridge. For us, names like Chandler, Teletovic and even Weems draw much more attention and excitement.  I'd give us a B. And a good chunk of that is simply due to the mentality with which they went after LMA."
suns,3dydvl,tisdue,4,Mon Jul 20 16:06:08 2015 UTC,A for Effort.  B for results.
suns,3dydvl,davemeisner,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"To give a team a C, in my opinion that means the team didn't get better or worse.   The Suns retained talent and the additions out weigh the subtractions. For that reason I would give a B-"
suns,3dydvl,yoursistersnice,7,Mon Jul 20 17:47:12 2015 UTC,Exactly our offseason would have been an A+ if we got Aldridge. We did great and they don't know what they are talking about
suns,3dydvl,bazzaretta,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"I remember last year there was a similar article posted about Suns finishing 10th or 9th at best in the West. Majority on /r/suns had the same reaction: ""Bullshit! They have no clue..."" You guys need to take your homer googles off and see it for what it is. You look at what other teams have done (besides Dallas) and C is a very fair assessment. It means we're nothing better or worse than last year. We're still going to be fighting for the 9th spot."
suns,3dydvl,juicy10,5,Mon Jul 20 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair we were definitely in playoff contention before the team got blown up at the break and we lost on like 6 buzzer beaters last year. Not saying we could have been championship contenders but an 8th seed at the beginning of the season wasn't too hard to believe.  I think the team got better in this off season, and a C implies that we just remained the same. Also, what teams are you referring to that overshadowed us in Free Agency, bar the Spurs getting LMA?"
suns,3dydvl,bazzaretta,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"The buzzer-beaters certainly didn't help, but we tend to forget that we had few other things going our way, specifically OKC struggling to stay healthy. You can bet on them getting back into the top 6 next season, un-less-likely they're hit with injury bug again. Out of 8 Western playoff teams only Mavs and Blazers have regressed. Pelicans look like a team ready to make a leap and even Wolves look more serious now with Okafor Towns and Wiggins. We have a solid but a lukewarm team - we're not hot enough to contend, nor cold enough to tank. And that's why it's a C."
suns,3dydvl,juicy10,2,Mon Jul 20 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"Okafor isn't in Minnesota though.. I also can't see them making a jump from one of the worst records to being a playoff contender (~45 Wins) in the West just because they drafted KAT; they really didn't improve much outside of that this off season as far as I know besides any individual improvement by their current players. I agree that Dallas and Portland regressed, I don't see either of them in the playoffs at the moment based on their rosters. The teams I consider locks in the West post season, obviously excluding injuries, are GSW, SAS, LAC, OKC, HOU, and MEM. I think the 7 and 8 seed is pretty much up for grabs between NOP, Utah, maybe SAC if they somehow manage to make the team not kill each other or the coach, and the Suns. I would say that getting into the 8th seed isn't too crazy of an idea if the team can mesh together like we hope they can.  I also don't really see how that makes us a C. We brought in a veteran center that knows how to win to both address our rebound issues last year and mentor young Len, who is definitely not as ready to be a full time center as a lot of this sub thinks. We replaced Marcus with Teletovic, which adds a solid three point shooter, something we were somewhat lacking, and will hopefully have a positive effect on Markieffs behavior, seeing as he rarely was having issues prior to obtaining his brother. Not sure if drafting Booker is considered in the grading, but there's only 2-3 players I would even consider rather having for this team that were available at his time. The rest are somewhat gambles on players that could have upside or could just sit the bench and get rotation minutes. I think at least a B- is a better grade, I thought we deserved a B though."
suns,3dydvl,rynmcdnld,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:15 2015 UTC,there should be a sports site that employs no writers and the content is 100% submitted by knowledgeable fans. does that already exist?
suns,3dydvl,phd2k1,3,Mon Jul 20 23:58:50 2015 UTC,"Len is still young, and coming off of multiple injuries. We'll use Tyson Chandler's last few remaining productive years, both to mentor Len, and also to give him limited minutes while he grows and gets back to 100% health.  In a few years, Alex Len will be considered an elite NBA center, and I believe that Tyson Chandler will be a big part of that growth."
suns,3dydvl,Kablaow,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"I actually think C is a fair grade. We got Chandler, which is a big pick up, but overall I still think we did ok. Maybe C+, B-."

suns,3dsnd1,Give_Me_Shuggah,12,Sun Jul 19 02:01:05 2015 UTC,Warren G - The Regulator!
suns,3dsnd1,bazzaretta,8,Sun Jul 19 03:05:13 2015 UTC,Knicks fan here. I also live a couple of miles from NC State. Warren sort of reminds me of Melo.
suns,3dsnd1,therealjgreens,9,Sun Jul 19 03:25:44 2015 UTC,Honestly Warren reminds me more of a young Paul Pierce.
suns,3dsnd1,thephoenixx,5,Sun Jul 19 16:39:13 2015 UTC,"I can see that.   What I was really comparing is their abilities to get the ball in the basket from every angle. Warren can basically take and hit every single shot on the court. That's what made him so fun to watch at State. He was very hard to guard, like Melo (and Pierce). Not a great 3 point shooter now, but he'll improve, as Melo did.  Both players wouldn't be considered supremely athletic by any means, but they both get to the basket at will, and can finish with contact. Melo & Warren are both 6'8"", so they measure up well. Like Melo, I don't see Warren as a flopper, or someone that accentuates contact. Warren had a weight problem coming into NC State, but he lost weight. Some people used to say Melo was carrying extra weight, but he's become lean.  When I made the comparison in my head, I wanted to see if anybody else made the same comparison, and I found this -   http://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2014/6/29/5853982/the-warren-report-feeling-melo  Whatever the case, if he is more Melo, or more Pierce, he is still going to be a hell of an NBA player."
suns,3dsnd1,therealjgreens,4,Sun Jul 19 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"Wrong former Knick top-notch scorer, I think he is more Bernard King"
suns,3dsnd1,TropangTexter,2,Sun Jul 19 08:34:06 2015 UTC,Melo reminds me of the King
suns,3dsnd1,therealjgreens,3,Sun Jul 19 08:56:20 2015 UTC,They're not very similar... Melo is primarily a face up shooter who plays off the ISO a lot. TJ is basically an inside the arc wing
suns,3dsnd1,TombaFan123,3,Sun Jul 19 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"Tomba fan, as in the game Tomba from PS1?  I'm not talking about their game on the surface. I'm talking about their measureables. Both are 6'8"". Both had like 8% body fat at the combine. Both can score at will from basically anywhere on the court. Melo is an elite scorer, and I think Warren can be similar.  Also, Melo was not a good 3pt shooter until several years in the league. Warren is not a good 3pt shooter either, but he is going to get better, just like Melo did, because he is so good every other place on the court.  I agree in that their games aren't very similar, but I feel like Warren can have a similar effect on his team as Melo did."
suns,3dsnd1,therealjgreens,2,Sun Jul 19 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"Tomba is my dogs name, named after an old Italian skier.  And good analysis, looks like you're right"
suns,3dsnd1,TombaFan123,2,Sun Jul 19 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"Ahh, got you. It was a fantastic video game from the 90s that jogged my memory.   It was a loose comparison regarding Melo/Warren. I just love player comparisons in general. I like the Piece one, as well.   In fact, I have compared Melo and Pierce before, but not necessarily their games, but the situations they've been through. Pierce pre big 3 in Boston, and Melo right now in NY with little help."

suns,3dsnd1,isetmyfriendsonfire,0,Sun Jul 19 20:51:10 2015 UTC,what are you talking about... he was complimenting warren all game
suns,3dsnd1,gosuns13,4,Sun Jul 19 21:43:01 2015 UTC,Of course he was complimenting him. He dropped 31. He just didn't know anything about TJ. So he referred to his performance as the type that would get him into the league even though he is a first round pick that is signed to a rookie deal.
suns,3dsnd1,devonschmidt,4,Sun Jul 19 22:54:46 2015 UTC,The Starters on NBA TV gave TJ Warren some love!!
suns,3dsnd1,therealjgreens,8,Sun Jul 19 04:02:18 2015 UTC,"State fan here. Dude was awesome at college as you guys know. He was able to score from so many different angles. I don't recall him being a great 3 pt shooter, but he was able to do everything else.  Dude's teardrop is sexy as fuck. I havent had the chance to watch him in phoenix. What specifically is he good at doing. What types of shots is he hitting most?"
suns,3dsnd1,redman012,2,Sun Jul 19 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"He's been really good with off-ball movement, if you watch some of last season's highlights where he played well, you'll see that he seems to be in the right place at the right time. He's really good at the rim, and where he made most of his shots. Has a solid midrange too. Could work on his D, 3 point shooting and catch and shoots."
suns,3dsnd1,TOUCHDOWNJOEMONTANA,3,Sun Jul 19 04:59:15 2015 UTC,He has been doing a lot of TJ work. The dirty get to the hoop and get off a short shot.   I would love to see him polish his foot work and ball handling. Would help him get to the rim smoothly.
suns,3dsnd1,rice_bledsoe,3,Sun Jul 19 14:51:25 2015 UTC,his best attribute is that he produces a lot of looks at the rim and then finishes them at an extremely high rate.  he uses his midrange as a fallback option if he's cut off.

suns,3dtfw6,scooper1030,6,Sun Jul 19 07:48:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't Knight known as a decent defender? I honestly wouldn't know since his sample size in Phoenix is so small and I didn't see too much of his play with other team.  I would say our defense will be around 12th-15th best, and I'd be disappointed if it's anything worse"
suns,3dtfw6,hailcesaro,11,Sun Jul 19 11:11:23 2015 UTC,"Well with the amount of times he's been posterized or crossed over, you know Knight actually is putting in the effort on defense."
suns,3dtfw6,UrRightAndIAmWong,3,Sun Jul 19 12:02:09 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on how the offense is run. The reason we gave up so many points is because we looked to score a lot of points. Our offense was very fast paced, didn't rely on actual plays, more hero ball, and taking threes with reckless abandonment. Of course when you have an offense that doesn't take its time, the other team is going to get more possessions on offense against a less set defense, if that makes sense. If the offense goes more towards the inside rather than settling for an iso 3 like we saw so many times, hopefully shooting percentage goes up, our team won't have to run it's heart out in transition and actually get set on defense. Hornacek needs to stop encouraging threes and have set plays, no more run and gun, slow the game down. But yes I do think, looking at the roster, that there is very good defensive potential."
suns,3dtfw6,UrRightAndIAmWong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:59:54 2015 UTC,"You have a good point. If we take our time on offense instead of pushing the pace, we can set up on defense sooner. We definitely have the roster for a more half court offense now. Morris in the post or warren, Bledsoe with the drives, Chandler off pick n rolls. Knight on the other side to reinitiate the offense."

suns,3dtfw6,losttobefound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"If Booker and TJ play some significant minutes, our defense will have a pretty big hole on the wings. I don't see Booker or TJ stepping up their defense that fast in a league that takes a good 3-4 years to get used to playing in. But I think Len will make big steps this year to becoming a reliable anchor. If he picks up anything from Tyson in the next 3-4 years, I daresay Len could compete with Gobert for being the best defensive center in the west."

suns,3dsnna,juicy10,8,Sun Jul 19 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"for those who missed it:   very ugly start. warren still a golden god. doing what he did in the second half after such a slow start is even more impressive to me than being good the entire game. booker looked good, but zero 3's attempted in 36 minutes. 3's kept chicago in this and apparently we still don't have anyone to shoot them back. classic archie. a few highlights and an automatic 20 points while at the same time making me forget that he's even in there. off game by len... that'll happen. still lead the team at +12 though so had to have done something right. mustache remains a wildcard. mike james very solid in the second half. i still prefer mcconnell to him, and i prefer both to jerel mcneal, who should retire. bobby portis kinda nasty. i for sure like booker better for our team, but if we ended up with him at the draft i wouldn't have hated it. announce team, absolutely terrible. isiah thomas seems to think warren is not under contract and is using summer league to prove his 5mpg worth to any team willing to take a gamble on him; other dude said the word ""jimmy"" too many times. we have the best squad in summer league."
suns,3dsnna,rynmcdnld,7,Sun Jul 19 02:19:48 2015 UTC,"Well Booker did sink a 3, it's just that an illegal screen was called on Len or Harrelson at the same time"
suns,3dsnna,Deagan_Jigsaw,2,Sun Jul 19 02:21:34 2015 UTC,yes. true.
suns,3dsnna,rynmcdnld,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:24:03 2015 UTC,"Also, I didn't realize this but Len had -4, the second lowest of the team. Archie had +12."
suns,3dsnna,Deagan_Jigsaw,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:58 2015 UTC,shit. this makes me -4 at reading and you +12 at correcting me.
suns,3dsnna,rynmcdnld,13,Mon Jul 20 00:44:02 2015 UTC,The people at the bull's sub are in love with Abby Hornacek right now. Maybe we can trade her for Jimmy Butler.

suns,3dsnna,tuneorg,3,Sun Jul 19 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a psycho B-level MMA fighter took that as his nickname (he even legally changed his name to War Machine) and is now in jail for beating up his gf."

suns,3dwvvg,K1ngdiamond,14,Mon Jul 20 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"He's not a stretch 5. At all. But there is a basketball coach named Alvin Gentry, you might have heard of him. He had utilized a stretch 5 named Channing Frye and this team was successful enough to make it to the west finals while beating the Blazers in 5 and sweeping the Spurs."
suns,3dwvvg,auggie5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:19:04 2015 UTC,"http://www.nba.com/suns/blog/suns-retorter-alex-len-stretch-5 Channing was throw in at the 4 spot because he wasn't big enough to play center and what got 12 ppg and 5 rpg, thats atrocious for center and also what happened when they ran in to a real center with the Lakers Bynum, he walked all over the Suns down low cause Amare wasn't a great enough defender to stop him and Channing couldn't get the boards. Also, there was really no need to be a smart ass."
suns,3dwvvg,h3dr0ncr4b,7,Tue Jul 21 01:43:58 2015 UTC,Wtf are you all talking about? Len is supposed to be a defensive anchor and he's shown his potential in that role. No one is expecting him to be a first option on offense
suns,3dwvvg,h3dr0ncr4b,0,Mon Jul 20 07:04:48 2015 UTC,"Meh, I wouldn't call him a great rim protector, I think Miles was a better rim protector than him by far because Miles went after everything out there and Alex Len isn't stopping guys from scoring consistently, yeah he gets like 1.5 bpg but its not like he is shutting them down out there and he will never be a 12 and 10 guys ever due to his inability to out muscle other centers. Also, when the suns call him a corner stone, that means 18+ ppg and 10 rpg, thats not going to happen."
suns,3dwvvg,h3dr0ncr4b,4,Tue Jul 21 01:30:49 2015 UTC,If you think Miles is a decent rim protector at all then I know you're full of it bro
suns,3dwvvg,ThomB96,0,Tue Jul 21 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"No I'm not, Miles just went after it, defended every shot, not necessarily blocking it, but challenged em better than Len."
suns,3dwvvg,raydenwins,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:45 2015 UTC,I think you're just literally wrong.
suns,3dwvvg,jray4033,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"Its okay to disagree, its just an opinion. But from my coaching perspective if I had to pick I would take miles."

Not only did he shuffle his feet before lobbing it, even though Blake Griffin lobs it to himself occasionally I don't think you're allowed to do that. But it's so flashy I think the NBA gives it a pass."
suns,3dqxmg,UrRightAndIAmWong,3,Sat Jul 18 19:34:33 2015 UTC,You can lob it and catch it as long as you're in the air.

suns,3doqnf,illCON,15,Sat Jul 18 00:31:23 2015 UTC,i don't know how people can take the Jazz over this team to make the playoffs
suns,3doqnf,rice_bledsoe,8,Sat Jul 18 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"Because the Jazz went 19-10 post All-Star break last season? And fielded one of the NBA's best defenses during that span? Hayward, Gobert and Favors continue to improve just as much as Bledsoe, Knight and Len. We don't have an advantage over them when it comes to young talent."
suns,3doqnf,scooper1030,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:18:41 2015 UTC,"well, what, do you think we're gonna go 10-20 in the first thirty games or something? It's not like they're going to be the new Warriors and we're going to be the new Sixers. I get that they have a good core but so do we, AND we have a strong veteran presence to hold things together."
suns,3doqnf,rice_bledsoe,6,Sat Jul 18 08:20:23 2015 UTC,"But here's the thing: The Jazz already proved that their young core is capable of succeeding when they went on a rampage last spring.  Our core of guys like Bledsoe, Knight, Len and Warren floundered when unleashed. We were terrible at the end of last season. A huge part of that was due to injuries, and now we've added some nice role players, but that core still hasn't actually proved anything yet. When we say the Suns are capable of being a 7th/8th seed, we're basing that solely on potential, not on past success.  Therefore, I have more confidence in the Jazz than the Suns. The Jazz have given the league a taste of what they're capable of, but the Suns haven't. We'll see what happens."
suns,3doqnf,scooper1030,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:25:10 2015 UTC,"there was also huge locker room issues after the uprising of the trade deadline... you put up some good points, but tbh the only place to go is up from here. Notwithstanding Markieff's fate with us, we have a full team with defined roles and hopefully we can work out our locker room issues and blast open.   I mean, we were a solid 7th seed rolling out Dragic + Bledsoe + Tucker + Kieff + Len for the first half of the year, even with locker room issues and Dragic whining. We can't be that bad."
suns,3doqnf,rice_bledsoe,2,Sat Jul 18 08:30:50 2015 UTC,What the Jazz can't go up?   There is a dropoff in talent from Goran/IT to Knight/Goodwin. That's just how it is. So there isn't anything to indicate that we'll even have as good a record as last year
suns,3doqnf,daynewma,3,Sat Jul 18 08:42:39 2015 UTC,haha ikr
suns,3doqnf,DixieRektt,7,Sat Jul 18 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"seriously.  one top 15 PG.  one top 10 sg / top 20 pg to run the offense for the bench unit.  Sf is our weak position for now, but we still have one of the best perimeter defenders + one of the most promising sophomores in the rotation.  two great shooting PFs.  Former DPOY who is really good at what he does and what we need him to do, who is also a grizzled veteran to lead the large amount of our young core to come together.  Bench Unit:  Goodwin at PG doesn't really make me happy, but we have Knight + McConnell (if he makes the roster) to take over that.  SG: Booker to give some great shooting spurts. I'm hopeful of what he can turn into. Great talent to look out for.  SF: TJ Warren, Lebron James is his number 1 fan.  PF: THREEZA teletovic  C: A little guy called Alex Len, you ever hear of him? Oh right he STARTED last year."
suns,3doqnf,rice_bledsoe,-10,Sat Jul 18 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Who is this top 10 sg? They must've signed someone today. Top 15 PG and top 20 PG aren't compliments. Morris is a decent shooter not a great one. Dirk is a great shooter. Oh yeah Len coming in to his third year after being picked fifth still needs to play in the summer league and averaged 6 and 6 as a starter, fucking exciting.  This team isn't going to make the playoffs, that roster needs so much help. Be real people, this isn't the east.  Even if they squeaked in as an 8 seed, they'd get swept. I could understand if people were looking forward to the next couple years like i am but there's nothing to get your hopes up about this year."
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,5,Sat Jul 18 08:12:26 2015 UTC,why do you have to be such a FUCKING DOWNER
suns,3doqnf,rice_bledsoe,-4,Sat Jul 18 08:15:42 2015 UTC,"Im just realistic, there's some good young talent but they aren't going to help this team make the playoffs this year. Len isn't one of those good young talents.  If you're starting PJ, whose defense and hustle I respect, you're in trouble. Would be a great role player off the bench for a good team."
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,2,Sat Jul 18 08:51:49 2015 UTC,"Len is still improving from his 6 and 6 numbers and he didn't even play legit starter minutes, plus he's good at defense. The top 15/20 is misleading. Skill is mostly a gradient, not a ranking. Bledsoe is close to top 5, and Knight is close to top 10. Which are both compliments."
suns,3doqnf,BornRreddy,-6,Sat Jul 18 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"Bledsoe is not a top 5 point guard. You're stupid. Let's see: Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Deron Williams, John Wall, Russel Westbrook, Kyle Lowry, and Kyrie Irving off the top of my head. Bledsoe is not close yet to those players. If I cared enough I could name more but Knight can just go fuck off, top 10 pg, you don't know shit."
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,3,Sat Jul 18 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"You listed Deron Williams who hasn't done shit since his Utah days over 5 years ago. I didn't even say Bledsoe is a top 5 pg, I said he was near. Read the comment before if you are going to attack someone, so you can have actual criticism not BS."
suns,3doqnf,BornRreddy,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"But he isn't near top 5, that was the point. Not close.  Deron Williams was stuck in shit hole Brooklyn, the Suns would get rid of Bledsoe in a second if they knew they could get Deron Williams."
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:21 2015 UTC,"No they wouldn't. Good players play good with or without teammates in the NBA. I'll list the top 5 point gaurds and a few after them:  Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Stephen Curry Tier Below: Damian Lillard, Jeff Teague, Kyle Lowry, Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic.   So there is a superstar tier of the top 5 pgs, and Bledsoe is in the tier below, which would make him close to top 5."
suns,3doqnf,BornRreddy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:05:46 2015 UTC,I guess we're forgetting Mike Conley and Tony Parker. He's now kicked off the list. Near a top ten PG is true. # 12 behind Dragic.
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,0,Sun Jul 19 03:44:39 2015 UTC,"One more thing which you are right about is that good players play good with or without good teammates. That's why this current generation's Great White Hope immediately after joining the Cavs, goes down hill. He wants a ring but BLATT doesn't know how to use him. The good ole days of KLove averaging 26 and 13 are over, could've done something in the west if the team stayed healthy but he quit on em to become a 3rd option and wait for quarter 3 passes. Sad. Oh well, I hope he never wins shit.  Had his team been healthy with Rubio, Pekovic, Martin and whoever the SF was, Brewer? in 2013-14 they would've made the playoffs. Anyone doing well during that season had injury issues. I don't know why I'm talking about Kevin Love and I don't give a fuck. Down vote as you always do like I give a fuck faggots."
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,3,Sun Jul 19 13:04:20 2015 UTC,Bledsoe is better than Lowry and CERTAINLY better than Deron fucking Williams. Are you kidding me? It's 2015 dude.
suns,3doqnf,ChaosDunkTheory,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"No he isn't. Deron Williams has been stuck in fucking Brooklyn with the worst management in the league. Lowry is a much better point guard, anyone who isn't a delusional Suns fan knows that. Replace Bledsoe with Williams and this team would win many more games.   Yeah I know the year bro."

suns,3doqnf,rice_bledsoe,-5,Sat Jul 18 04:17:29 2015 UTC,"Lol Len has to be on the negative side of the +- stats, if he isn't he sure as fuck can't be high on the plus side. Warren is pretty much unproven, only played after the season was over playoff wise and is doing really good in summer league against a huge % of non professionals. I think he will be a good player to have in the future though. Knight hasn't proven shit yet that he can do well in this system, he played 11 games last year. Half your rebuttal was bullshit.  I'd take Hayward over any Suns player except bledsoe. Dante exum will only get better unlike Len. It'll be a good matchup of non playoff teams IMO. In a year maybe two, Suns will be greatly improved. Trade Brandon Knight for a solid starting sg and we're good."

What did Dragic average the year before they signed IT, like 20 and 9? Now because the FO fucked up they have a major downgrade since they're sticking to the two starting PG shit."
suns,3doqnf,scooper1030,7,Sat Jul 18 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"He averaged 20 and 6, and that was really only because Bledsoe was injured so someone had to take the reigns. It was a great season for Dragic, but he's never getting that many touches in his career again. He certainly won't average 20/6 having to share the ball with Wade and Bosh."
suns,3doqnf,mrbitchtitz,-4,Sat Jul 18 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"True but they had 48 wins and were very close to making the playoffs for the first time since 2010 and he proved he was capable of taking the reigns. If they had waited for bledsoe to get healthy instead of signing IT right away with a stupid idea in mind (who the Kings wanted nothing to do with even though he'd played well) a team cancer taking minutes away from Dragic, they only would've been better. Thomas completely ruined the chemistry and kept bitching about playing time.  I know Dragic bitched too at the end but his was deserved, Suns fucked him. What a stupid fucking move to sign thomas after that season. Nope he won't get those numbers with Wade and Bosh but he'll be a great pg to go along with those two, dwade's knee are done for and will most likely get injured so it's possible he could average close to those numbers. He came out of it ok with a five year, $90 million contract anyway. He'll be done after those five years, then Goran and Zoran will go live as kings in Slovenia."

suns,3djxqm,07wcsf_wasFixed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"That is a ridiculous statement that couldn’t be more wrong.  Think about what you are saying.  Drafts don’t take place in a vacuum.  “5th overall” is meaningless since it’s relative to the talent left on the board.  Even comparing theoretical “best available” at 5 between two drafts would have different skill levels.  Go back and look at that draft.  Who did we pass on to take Len at 5?  Nerlens Noel.  We passed on him for health reasons, not skill.  We have the best training staff in the league.  If they don’t sign off on a draft prospect, end of story.  Sure, sometimes a player will go on to have a healthy productive career in spite of his mechanics/damage accumulated over the years, but you bet on the rule, not the exception.  He is the only clear-cut prospect we passed on for Len – for non-talent evaluation reasons.    McLemore, Caldwell-Pope, Burke, Carter-Williams, Adams, Olynyk.  They have had their moments just like Len, but none has established themselves a “potential star” relative to Len.  His upside remains higher than all of them.    Antetokounmpo, Gobert.  Both International players with question marks.  Ant drafted 10 spots behind Len, Gobert 22 spots.  If you want to complain that these guys should have been looked at, I will concede that point to you.  But remember that extrapolating International talent translating to the NBA is one of the hardest things to get right, scouting and projecting-wise.  Sam Presti and his staff, known for being great talent evaluators, also passed (even drafting another center ahead of Gobert).  It’s not easy to do."

What the fuck?   MCW had a lot more ""moments"" than Len his rookie year, he averaged 16 points, 6 boards, 6 assists and 2 steals a game. Len averaged 2 points 2 rebounds.  Len doesn't have the highest upside of any of them, no one except a Suns fan would ever say or believe that. Mason Plumlee, taken 21st or second in that draft averaged 7.4 points, 4.4 boards, and almost a steal and a block per game. The next year while Len the starter was averaging 6 and 6, he averaged almost 9 points and 6 rebounds though he did start 45 games. If you've ever watched Mason play and you think Len is better you're just a ridiculous Suns fan that can't admit it.  All Len has established is that he'll be a back up. The all rookie first team in 2014 was MCW, Oladipo, Burke, Mason Plumdog, and Hardaway Jr. 2nd team had Olynyk, Dieng and Steven Adams. Suns passed on all those players excluding Oladipo, that are SO much better than Len. I'd much rather have even that brute Stevens than Len.   Len sucks, it was a wasted pick. I don't know what the people on this sub think he's going to be. A starter somewhere averaging 10 and 10 or better than that? I'd really like to know."
suns,3djxqm,weedologist,2,Sun Jul 19 02:50:34 2015 UTC,"Anyone else underwhelmed with Len's post moves? His shot looks good, his free throws look good, but I just wish his post game was on a higher level. Shouldn't he be dominant in SL?"
suns,3djxqm,ck44,6,Fri Jul 17 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"Len doesn't have real post moves yet. I can see he struggles backing his man down and doesn't really have control of the ball when doing so. He's still very young though and can continue working on his game.  Even with the lack of post moves, his impact in every game is huge. Every time he sits, the Suns defense suffers. Now with Chandler in our team and Len as backup, we'll have solid paint defense at all times! Excited for this upcoming season."

Len was a terrible pick, he'll never be anything more than a backup in his career, I don't care if he's young it's coming in to his 3rd pro season and he is still playing in the SL. He should at least be fucking dominant, TJ Warren is amazing in SL coming in to his second year. Good things ahead with him and booker. Forget archie, tried failed. Waiting for them to see the same with Len"

suns,3dkbln,davemeisner,3,Thu Jul 16 23:55:36 2015 UTC,Very disappointed in Nash. I feel like there is bad relationship between him and the Suns
suns,3dkbln,feichalo,3,Fri Jul 17 03:18:59 2015 UTC,I remember his departure as peaceful. Sarver even asked him where he wanted to go and given that he was shipped to the Lakers shows that Sarver honored Nash's deal. I think he just likes staying in LA more given his dreams of directing stuff... I actually unfollowed him on twitter after he changed his profile pic with a laker jersey. I just cant deal with it...

suns,3diz5x,UrRightAndIAmWong,0,Thu Jul 16 20:52:37 2015 UTC,You're right. Speculation before the season starts when there's nothing else to talk about IS stupid. Especially when it's backed up with stats and observations from last season and Summer League. GREAT point.
suns,3diz5x,UrRightAndIAmWong,2,Thu Jul 16 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"I really can't tell if your capitalization means that your being sarcastic. If you are being sarcastic, there aren't any stats in the article and the observations don't even reveal anything new to even the casual Suns fan."
suns,3diz5x,Nicheslovespecies,0,Thu Jul 16 23:50:14 2015 UTC,"I was absolutely being sarcastic. The fact that I had to point that out doesn't surprise me however, after learning that you didn't see any stats in the article. If you think that, you obviously didn't read the article. There are stats from his rookie season on the second slide and stats from his Summer League play on the third."
suns,3dimtu,devonschmidt,14,Thu Jul 16 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"He's definitely coming off the bench. Since we traded Marcus and Granger, I imagine he will be coming off the bench pretty early."
suns,3dimtu,ORANG_DRAGIC,8,Thu Jul 16 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"For now, absolutely. We still have PJ on the roster and he's been the grit and heart of this team for the past three seasons (yes, despite last season's off-the-court problems for Tuck). TJ's perfect for the sixth man role at the moment.  With his work ethic and rapid progress, I definitely think TJ will easily become a starter by next season, however."
suns,3dimtu,abeLJosh,3,Thu Jul 16 20:00:23 2015 UTC,I could picture TJ and PJ playing one the floor together in small ball lineups with Len at the 5. PJ can guards some 4s and stretches the floor with corner threes opening up the mid-post and cutting lanes for TJ.

suns,3dimtu,Hornashit,11,Thu Jul 16 18:18:58 2015 UTC,PJ is still a very good player who brings a lot of heart to this team. His defense is crucial in a league where most contenders best players are wings. TJ can still get 30+ minutes a game off the bench in a 6th man role
suns,3dimtu,TombaFan123,5,Thu Jul 16 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"He deserves to but I don't see coming off the bench as something to look down at compared to starting, and right now, I think the Suns bench are kind of lacking in depth."

suns,3dimtu,UrRightAndIAmWong,2,Thu Jul 16 19:51:46 2015 UTC,It's a matter of opinion. I say TJ should prove himself this season and claim the starting spot. I don't think he deserves it yet

McNeal played pretty well with the minutes he did get last season (I know most of it was garbage) but he's look trash in the summer league."

There are plenty of things to look forward to this year."

Went to four or five games and watched more games the year before and Plumdog was clearly the better player. Could average 10 and 8 thereabouts consistently while I don't believe Len can even manage that.  I was at one game last year Len started, played 21 minutes and had zero points, rebounds, or blocks and one foul then hurt his leg. He wasn't impressive in any of the games I saw live and is weak. Anything is better than Gerald Green though. It's frustrating watching a guy shoot 15 3's and towards the end of the game make two after whatever mediocre east team had already sealed the game. I just kept wondering when Hornacek was going to tell him to quit fucking shooting or bench him. Fuck Gerald Green."

Plumlee is one of the worst players in the league. He could barely get minutes on a Milwaukee team whose starting center was Zaza Pachulia with essentially no other backup center.

Neither of them is so amazing at traditional pg skills that they can run a pg driven offense to success by themselves.  Also, think about this: Harden always gets hidden on defense on the weaker wing while Ariza guards the better wing. In a couple years, when Knight and Warren are starting to get really good, which one would you rather have Harden guarding? If Knight and TJ can play decent defense the rockets can't totally guard both wing matchups either way. Any team with a dominant scoring wing that can't defend well won't be able to hide him anymore."

suns,3dbbem,Hornashit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:59:49 2015 UTC,You are 100% right. 6 rebounds a game from a staring Power Forward is terrible.
suns,3dbqls,Hornashit,20,Wed Jul 15 01:06:04 2015 UTC,I think PJ should still and use TJ as a scoring 6th man honestly.
suns,3dbqls,theallseeingpotato,3,Wed Jul 15 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"This is the best option.   Every unit on the floor needs a guy to run the offense through. With the bench unit of either Bledsoe or Knight at PG with Goodwin, Warren, Teletovic, and Len, Warren is the scoring option. Without him, we'd rely too much on the PG on the floor to score and get others shots.  Just know that Warren will likely be the one closing out games."
suns,3dbqls,FriendEater,6,Wed Jul 15 10:34:09 2015 UTC,Maybe we can try to play PJ at the 4 a little bit more this year. If hes fat at the beginning of the season like last year..
suns,3dbqls,godsprofit,6,Wed Jul 15 01:59:15 2015 UTC,"I love TJ but I love the strategy of scoring off the bench and defense in the starting line up more. Right now PJ is still the better defender and we have him on contract for two more years. TJ will get his time to start, but I think it should be when PJ is gone or if PJ gets a lot worse."
suns,3dbqls,zz0rzz,3,Wed Jul 15 04:13:22 2015 UTC,Warren should be getting 25-26 mpg and tucker should be getting 30-31 mpg with them overlapping a little

suns,3d5ncn,mwachs,9,Mon Jul 13 18:42:22 2015 UTC,you're insane if you wouldn't trade Archie for Embiid. Embiids ceiling is leagues higher and we just drafted a guy whos the same position as Archie. Not even a question we take the chance if that was offered.
suns,3d5ncn,passworduno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"No, it's definitely something to think about. Archie is 20 years old and has NBA experience. Embiid hasn't played a single NBA game and has already had 2 surgeries on his foot. What are you talking about no question? I would agree in a perfect world Embiid has the higher ceiling but he's very high risk, even with our med staff. I say we pass on Embiid until further notice."
suns,3d5ncn,SwizzyDangles,0,Tue Jul 14 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"Nah to me its a no brainer. Archie doesnt have the injury risk but his upside is just too high to pass on. Embiid got picked for a reason, he has elite 2 way center upside. The injuries scare me too but for the small price of archie id take the gamble. I prefer Booker to Archie so he makes Archie expendable. Haven't seen anything to indicate archie being a cant miss prospect. Keeping him over embiid just because hes played games isnt really a valid reason."
suns,3d5ncn,passworduno,2,Tue Jul 14 22:09:29 2015 UTC,"not to mention, with Bogdan coming over and having great success in euroleague, it's likely he will be on the trading block anyway."

suns,3d5ncn,ORANG_DRAGIC,3,Mon Jul 13 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"Chances are high after 2 foot surgeries that Embiid falls into obscurity a la Greg Oden. To flip a raw, talented young and promising prospect like Goodwin for somebody unproven with a bum foot would be insane, let alone toss in a pick."
suns,3d5ncn,IamAKetchupBot,27,Mon Jul 13 19:30:37 2015 UTC,Archie is so overrated by a lot of Suns fans.

suns,3d5ncn,ORANG_DRAGIC,2,Mon Jul 13 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"How is he overrated by us? No one is calling him the next Kobe, but the guy is younger than my unborn daughter and has shown flashes of amazing in his limited playing time. The coaching staff has raved about him more than any other young player. Give him a few more years before calling him overrated (even if it is just overrated by a certain fan base)  EDIT: Archie is 20. If he were in college still he'd be a top 10 pick this year coming out. At SG his ability to sky rocket in productivity on the court is phenomenal. Is he a role player? sure. But imagine him with 5 more years under his belt, that puts him at a measly 25 years old. I'd hold the breaks on calling him overrated by anyone."
suns,3d5ncn,norseman23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:57:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  What progress has he shown over the three years he's been a Sun?  He still can't shoot.  He still can't play solid defense.  Yes, he can jump out of the gym, but so could Harold Miner.  I'd trade Archie straight up for Embiid, but no way would I throw in a pick for a guy who might never see the court."

suns,3d5ncn,auggie5,0,Mon Jul 13 21:34:43 2015 UTC,I'm not super high on him but the kid obviously has talent. I don't think teams so willing to trade their own prospects away -- see the Kings -- inspire much confidence. Gives me little faith in our ability to draft talent.
suns,3d5ncn,IamAKetchupBot,6,Mon Jul 13 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're talking about ""a raw, talented young and promising prospect"", Embiid with a foot injury is still better than Archie."
suns,3d5ncn,ORANG_DRAGIC,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"But Embiid may have more talent but him and Archie both are raw considering Embiid hasn't even touched the court. But Archie doesn't have any major injuries, Embiid does and it's a critical area for NBA bigs, the foot."
suns,3d5ncn,UrRightAndIAmWong,0,Mon Jul 13 22:22:44 2015 UTC,He can jump really high.  What's his other talent?

suns,3d4zm0,jray4033,13,Mon Jul 13 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"All he can do is putbacks and offensive rebounds, did you guys not watch the Finals? Why pay the max for that when Markieff has the total package, can hit 3s, the midrange, even post up, puts in good effort on defense? Also with his shooting he provides spacing, more complimentary of Len and Chandler. You guys seriously underrate Markieff since all this drama, trading his brother, the assault charges, his apparent attitude problems. If that's all such a problem we shouldn't overpay to get Thompson, we should've chased after another big man in FA like Enes Kanter or look to draft one. There were a lot of bigs in the draft this year that I thought had a higher cieling than Tristan Thompson."
suns,3d4zm0,UrRightAndIAmWong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:07 2015 UTC,"this completely. I hate Kieff's attitude problems but if he gets his act together, he could be a very solid NBA player. He already is tbh, TT is absent on offense."
suns,3d4zm0,SwizzyDangles,9,Tue Jul 14 17:55:25 2015 UTC,At least Markieff can actually hit the three... Our starting line-up would be terrible at shooting.  And at that price? Hell naw.
suns,3d4zm0,McDeezus,5,Mon Jul 13 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"Thompson worked on the cavs in the playoffs and finals because they can run an offense through Lebron. If we had Thompson, both him and Chandler can essentially do the same thing, so offensively we would be way too limited. King is wrong. Kieff is a much better basketball fit than Thompson. Has he ever heard of spacing? Or how about the fact that our cap would be insane with Thompson? King is a fool."
suns,3d4zm0,ORANG_DRAGIC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"Thompson showed a little bit of a post game in the finals, and that he can shoot when asked. He's just hardly ever asked to shoot."
suns,3d4zm0,auggie5,3,Tue Jul 14 00:09:28 2015 UTC,"Him in the post would be fine if Chandler wasn't useless outside of the paint, still terrible spacing."
suns,3d4zm0,ORANG_DRAGIC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:11:19 2015 UTC,The spacing doesn't always have to come from the 4. Our guards and wings can shoot... That provides spacing necessary to keep their man in check to prevent teams from collapsing the paint.
suns,3d4zm0,auggie5,2,Tue Jul 14 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"yes, with Lebron that works. I don't think it would work with most other teams. In fact, are there any teams that are successful doing that? Even the Grizzlies, who play two bigs, both of their bigs have deadly jumpshots outside the paint."
suns,3d4zm0,ORANG_DRAGIC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"It worked for the Suns from 04-08... Amare didn't have a jumpshot yet, and they had Hunter/Thomas/whoever as the 5. The wings created the spacing, the pick and roll created the spacing, penetration created the spacing.  The pick and pop is cool, and it works. But it is not the only way."
suns,3d4zm0,auggie5,2,Tue Jul 14 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"That was pre-Thibs. Defenses pack the paint like crazy now and the roll is less effective. I think Thompson would improve the defense a lot, but we are offensively challenged as is, and Kieff is a better fit. I think there is a reason not many teams use that approach now."
suns,3d4zm0,ORANG_DRAGIC,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"The Spurs make it work. Penetration and ball movement is their bread and butter. Duncan can shoot, but they don't play pick and pop with him and teams will give him the three everytime."
suns,3d4zm0,auggie5,2,Tue Jul 14 00:38:59 2015 UTC,They play pick and pop constantly! It's just with a dribble hand off screen on the right or left side instead of a high screen like the Suns.
suns,3d4zm0,ORANG_DRAGIC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"They do this with their wings, and if they do it with the bigs, they are catching the hand-off and looking for the entry pass or a skip pass. Duncan will take the shot if he's left on an island, but he isn't the threat here. The guard who makes the hand off is. In other words, the offense they run creates the space. Pop is the stretch 4."
suns,3d4zm0,auggie5,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:03 2015 UTC,That would definitely elevate our defense to another stratosphere.

I'd rather have the better player on my team 10/10 times. Why? Championships. I want them.   Thompson is a top 3 rebounder in this league, an excellent defender and a very underrated shooter.   Markieff has the 15 foot turnaround jumper going for him, has more range on his jump shot, but is glued to the floor when it comes to rebounding. On D he finds himself out of position sometimes, but rotates well. Has a hard time challenging shots.  I'm sorry but I'd rather have a guy with an elite skill with few weaknesses every time."

He was a great pass first point guard. Always looked to distribute the rock and can hit that occasional 3-pointer. His pick and roll game with Alex Len was superb.   Disappointed: I wasn't too disappointed with anything. McNeal didn't impress me at all made too many mistakes as well as Archie seemed to be knocking his jumper but when driving looked very sloppy and got bailed out by fouls. Another than that nothing too much.   The thing I was most disappointed was Danny Ainge was dressing.

suns,3d2p2r,Hornashit,2,Mon Jul 13 03:26:09 2015 UTC,"Booker, although missed many shots, looked really good. All the shots looked good some unlucky bounces. The shots will eventually drop it was his first two games. He played defense very well. Did not expect that at all. I honestly think TJ Warren is the one that is going to take a significant role. I have no doubt in my mind if he could develop a shot he would be lethal. His cutting and driving to the basket was amazing."

He had 2 notable gambles for steals, but I liked both of those gambles - the offense was in shambles and he read it perfectly, just came up a hair short both times."

Even some of the Brightsiders that were critical in the forum during the game admitted that he played well by the end of it.  With the first game of Summer League, it's easy to overreact to a player's performance.  With that said, I'm looking forward to seeing if Archie's jumpers continue to fall tomorrow.  If he can keep defenders honest, he's going to get paid handsomely in a few years."
suns,3czlww,travisstevens81,2,Sun Jul 12 08:34:57 2015 UTC,"I think he needs to really work on his hands and handles. He fumbled with the ball a lot. He really knows how to use his two steps though. He got to the line a lot too. I don't like his performance this game because most his points were off of foul shots in which he drove into the paint, used his two steps and got bailed out every time by contact. He was just driving wildly, couldn't finish for some and1s and if he didn't get the calls/bailouts his drives were pretty bad. Would have like to see more shooting from him. Seeing Booker play, I really prefer him to get more minutes then Goodwin."

He get to the rim with ease and his ability to finish or pass the ball seem to have increased dramatically. He also seems to be a much, much more efficient scorer.

I think it would have been hard for any coach to do well last season especially a relatively inexperienced coach. This next season will show how good he really can be in my mind.
suns,3cysr1,Thugnotes,6,Sun Jul 12 03:46:14 2015 UTC,Dallas is better coached. Carlise is really smart. Our coach is pretty decent and the opinion on him is pretty split. This seasons outcome will really dictate his future with the Suns.
suns,3cysr1,stridered,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like he fits a college team better than an NBA team. He's unable to control the players at times and whilst it's the players' fault, you'll expect him to get more respect than what some of the players were showing him last season."
suns,3cysr1,mbuff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I tend to agree with that after last season. One of the Suns biggest problems last year was Bledsoe ISO ball. And I believe that many of Bledsoe's turnovers were caused by the plays and lack of off the ball movement rather than his poor decision making. The only guy really getting open and making cuts was TJ Warren. Now if Hornacek is running the offense with so little movement, then I would say a lot of the blame for our piss-poor offensive game falls on him. If the players are just being dumb and not moving where they are supposed to, then again it falls on him because pretty much the whole team is not listening to him and he has no control over his players. I am ok with Bledsoe penetrating to the hoop and dishing it off, but the other guys need to be moving and getting into better position if it is going to work. It was painful to watch last year, and while I am not sold on Hornacek I am not saying he should be booted until we see how he adjusts this year."
suns,3cysr1,Hornashit,-5,Sun Jul 12 16:10:32 2015 UTC,The Bledsoe iso ball was the result of Hornashit deciding to have Dragic camp in the corner while Eric dribbles the air out of the ball.every posession. Worst decision making head coach in the Nba EASILY
suns,3cysr1,sirlorax,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hornacek doesn't actually coach like a Pop or Kerr and isn't really a player's coach either because he's not respected. So if he's not tactical and not inspirational, I don't see why he's a head coach of an nba basketball team. I think this for a lot of coaches in the league however. Scotty Brooks was another example for instance, same with Spoelstra."
suns,3cysr1,FriendEater,0,Mon Jul 13 16:06:21 2015 UTC,Fucking dreadful head coach  Elite Player Development Coach
suns,3cysr1,Hornashit,-9,Sun Jul 12 19:29:09 2015 UTC,Jeff Hornacek is pretty terrible as a head coach. Those teams are all better coached without a doubt.   This sub is filled with WORTHLESS and PATHETIC idiot Hornasheep that know NOTHING about basketball and don't even have a clue how to analyze the game or come up with opinions on their own.

suns,3cysr1,megustamucho26,2,Mon Jul 13 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"Kings have some talent but they way they are organized leaves me thinking they won't be contending. If they get things straightened out however they'll be in the thick of things. The Mavs won't be contending. Dirk is good but getting older, Ellis and all their centers are out and their PG situation isn't all that great, even with Williams. The Jazz have been rebuilding the right way and ultimately I think it comes down to them and us."
suns,3cysr1,ilovelamp42,3,Sun Jul 12 16:59:20 2015 UTC,No kings probably
suns,3cysr1,anuhope,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"I suspect Dallas is still better than us or the Kings, the Jazz have a chance of making the leap.  I think it'll be Portland who might dip out of the playoffs as well, outside chance any of these 4 teams are better but I cannot stress how much I think the Kings are just a train wreck despite having Cousins."
suns,3cysr1,tetsuoandme,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"I imagine a world where the Kings acutally start with a winning record. Even if they are combustable elements, the players with bad history (Rondo, Cousins) ARE good bball players i wouldnt count them out yet.  Trailblazers are dropping out, while i see Kings/Suns/Jazz fighting for the 8th."
suns,3cysr1,anuhope,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"I would contend that Rondo is just not very good. He has literally never looked good unless he has a good supporting cast, and his style of play has aged decades in the course of a few years as everyone rejects what he does as a way of winning basketball games in favor of objectively better play styles."
suns,3cysr1,mbuff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"Ok let's think about the teams that will most likely be in the playoffs in the west to see. I think it would be hard to argue against San Antonio, Houston, OKC, Golden State, Memphis, LAC, New Orleans being the top teams in the west. I think Dallas is probably next, even though they are a much weaker team this year. I don't think the Kings will be making a run at anything this year, and I find it hard to believe the Suns or Jazz finish above .500. I guess the Suns/Jazz may compete with Dallas for the 8th spot for part of the season, but I would say it is probably Dallas' spot to lose."
suns,3cysr1,blueborders,3,Sun Jul 12 16:03:24 2015 UTC,Its hard to gauge Dallas since they play a different team each season and they have two huge variables in post acl surgery Wes Mathews and 2015 Deron Williams.
suns,3cysr1,Marcotheernie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"Dude that Dallas Roster is fucking decimated. Jazz will probably finish above us but come on, Dallas best players are a washed up shell of deron, fresh off the operating table Matthews  and grandpa dirk. Kings suns, and jazz all finish above Dallas IMO."
suns,3cysr1,BizarTheStar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"I like hornacek. Let's see what he can do with a functioning roster.   Addition by subtraction...trading Marcus and letting Green, Thornton, Granger go was good. I think this year we will have a fast paced team like we used to. Seems like the type of roster Hornacek is good with.   I think 8th seed is totally up in the air right until the end of the season.  I'm positive the Griz will be in the playoffs so I think it's between Suns Jazz Mavs Pellies."
suns,3cyh4g,illCON,7,Sat Jul 11 22:43:34 2015 UTC,"Warren should just be shut down for the rest of summer league, everyone else needs the touches more for development.  Basically crushing effortlessly at this point...surprised how good some of his passing has been though, he's not usually a creator but he's been sharp  Len looks good playing to his strengths, but these post ups suck nuts, stop running the offense through him  Oh and Alec Brown randomly looked sick, which is nice.  He started at PF for those who aren't watching and that's probably his NBA position"

Hell, he was more aggressive during the regular season, he should be tearing it up right now.  I feel like it's all mental for him right now, so hopefully we'll see him pick it up in the next few games.  EDIT: late 3rd quarter and he's already stepping it up a bit."

suns,3cq43i,neemamahmoodi,29,Thu Jul 9 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"OH THANK FUCK WE FINALLY SIGNED A SHOOTER  edit: This is a great signing. One year, doesn't mess with our cap situation next summer and he's 6'9 with a killer 3pt shot. I'm STOKED! BASKETBALL CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH!"

suns,3cq43i,auustinp,22,Thu Jul 9 23:08:06 2015 UTC,We are just racking up these lowkey 2k gods.
suns,3cq43i,uknowme3331,12,Thu Jul 9 21:56:25 2015 UTC,McD is looking out for us 2k players.
suns,3cq43i,ck44,4,Thu Jul 9 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"He really is, although he gave up a 2k God in Gerald Green, signing Mirza is a step in the right direction."
suns,3cq43i,Hornashit,5,Thu Jul 9 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Dude seriously. I was pumped when we got Tyson. If Booker is even a halfway decent shooter, and Bledsoe gets some more love from 2k (81 overall is ridiculous he's like an 85-86) then I plan on dominating with the Suns this year."
suns,3cq43i,Hornashit,-9,Thu Jul 9 22:25:59 2015 UTC,He is one of the worst shooting PGS in the entire league and his ball control rating should be really low. I understand he's an elite athlete but 85-86? Really?
suns,3cq43i,uknowme3331,6,Thu Jul 9 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"Defense. Go into 2k and look at his stats, on ball D is like 75 and should be 83-84 same with steal and defensive awareness. That alone would make him 85-86 without touching anything else"
suns,3cq43i,Hornashit,4,Thu Jul 9 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that his defense should be higher. I don't know what the rest of his ratings are but overall, 81 seems about right."
suns,3cq43i,TombaFan123,5,Thu Jul 9 23:41:22 2015 UTC,I'd say 83 should be about where he is if you improve his defense.
suns,3cq43i,ilovelamp42,3,Thu Jul 9 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"His shooting is all mid to low 70s and ball handling and passing around 80 which is all spot on, just his defense is pretty under rated. He's on par with guys like Kyle Lowry and Kemba Walker who are 85-86."
suns,3cq43i,ChaosDunkTheory,5,Fri Jul 10 01:02:58 2015 UTC,Kemba Walker is that high!? Yikes.

suns,3cq43i,SwizzyDangles,10,Fri Jul 10 00:01:04 2015 UTC,Nice signing. Pretty good offseason even without LMA
suns,3cq43i,ORANG_DRAGIC,7,Thu Jul 9 21:52:28 2015 UTC,This is the offseason we hoped for. No one coulda guessed we'd be in the mix for LMA
suns,3cq43i,Evan5050,9,Thu Jul 9 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"I'm fucking excited! He's actually one of my favourite players in the league, ever since this.. He'll be a great fit here!"
suns,3cq43i,juicy10,6,Thu Jul 9 21:43:58 2015 UTC,Man that was a huge overreaction by James.  Also what was up with the jersey names though?
suns,3cq43i,EnigmaBTH,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:03 2015 UTC,each team had a jersey made with their nicknames
suns,3cq43i,stridered,5,Thu Jul 9 22:39:39 2015 UTC,my god lebron was huge back then.
suns,3cq43i,Hornashit,2,Thu Jul 9 21:46:15 2015 UTC,Yeah he's slimmed down a lot. Probably a reason why the Cavs' small ball didn't work as well in the finals.
suns,3cq43i,p1rke,2,Thu Jul 9 21:48:27 2015 UTC,I still don't understand how he can get a flagrant if Lebron got the offensive foul though...

suns,3cq43i,EnigmaBTH,5,Thu Jul 9 21:51:52 2015 UTC,Take care of Mirza. My hometown boy will help you a lot. He catches fire... Quick. And has ridiculous range.
suns,3cq43i,crisp_bacon,3,Thu Jul 9 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"The only thing I dislike about this signing is that we only got him for 1 year.  One of my favorite non-Suns players is now a Sun, hell yeah.  Overall while I'd still rather seriously double down on the rebuild (aka tank), if we're going in on making the playoffs, I really enjoy the signings we have done."

suns,3cq43i,McDeezus,3,Fri Jul 10 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"Love the signing, I wonder if there are more moves coming???"
suns,3cq43i,darth_shishini,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:51:04 2015 UTC,Probably nothing significant. McD said in the Tyson presser that he likes to have 13 guaranteed contracts which I believe we're now at with this signing.
suns,3cq43i,BryanFair,3,Fri Jul 10 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome pickup, this guy is deadly at the 3 point line, even more than Channing Frye I dare say."
suns,3cq43i,fishFUNK,3,Thu Jul 9 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"McD with another surprise signing. Except this one is actually proven to be good, Teletovic was one of BKN's most consistently good players until the embolisms."
suns,3cq43i,rynmcdnld,3,Thu Jul 9 22:06:09 2015 UTC,SO FUCKING HYPED. Lord Mirza has been on my wish-list for a while. Great pick-up.
suns,3cq43i,DixieRektt,3,Thu Jul 9 22:08:37 2015 UTC,Let's turn this to a Mirza upvote party!!!!!!

suns,3crimp,TombaFan123,12,Fri Jul 10 04:50:18 2015 UTC,He had a hip injury and blood clots and shit like that.  This is a gamble that his true talent level is closer to the 13-14 season than the 14-15 season that was marred by injuries
suns,3crimp,TOUCHDOWNJOEMONTANA,2,Fri Jul 10 05:09:09 2015 UTC,Thanks that makes sense. He only played 40 games last year.
suns,3crimp,scooper1030,5,Fri Jul 10 05:10:23 2015 UTC,He played on the Brooklyn Nets.   We nabbed Frye from NY where he played poor. We stole Dudley from the Horncats and he turned out good.   I think he will have a great season here
suns,3crimp,phxlife,7,Fri Jul 10 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"Slight correction, Frye was with Portland before he signed with Phoenix. Though he was drafted by NY."
suns,3crimp,phxlife,2,Fri Jul 10 07:56:21 2015 UTC,He's a power forward.
suns,3crimp,ORANG_DRAGIC,4,Fri Jul 10 05:00:32 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be hyped about his ""shooting talent"" from the arc and he seems maybe slightly above average"
suns,3crimp,mayonnaisehands,3,Fri Jul 10 05:04:14 2015 UTC,I think everyone is just pumped we got a stretch 4. Those are hard to come by
suns,3cqaix,6Vibrations,3,Thu Jul 9 22:30:08 2015 UTC,What an overreaction by James. Someone pissed in his cereal that morning.
suns,3cqaix,JohnnyDestiny,2,Fri Jul 10 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting, watched them all, good stuff! Unbelievable range!"
suns,3cqaix,crisp_bacon,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:28 2015 UTC,That range though! And he has some Raja Bell in him.

suns,3co8g9,blueborders,9,Thu Jul 9 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"I just hope he does not do that to us on his return to PHX. I loved Gerald Green, I understand what the complaints were but as a bench player he had upside, but hey guess it was time to move on."
suns,3co8g9,Angel_V,7,Thu Jul 9 14:20:43 2015 UTC,He had upside but man did he kill any semblance of an offensive scheme that we ever played
suns,3co8g9,TombaFan123,6,Thu Jul 9 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he did not have great basketball IQ and man did it piss me off when he ran point. Great talent wasted, if he could have just smartened up and took to the scheme he would have been so deadly coming off the bench."
suns,3co8g9,Angel_V,8,Thu Jul 9 16:29:43 2015 UTC,That arena was insane on that day. Best it had been since Nash.
suns,3co8g9,ORANG_DRAGIC,6,Thu Jul 9 16:13:39 2015 UTC,God that was such a good game. I was there and i remember being made a pseudo beat-reporter by some dudes in the game thread that were worried about Westbrooks injury
suns,3co8g9,IAmTheNick96,23,Thu Jul 9 23:43:01 2015 UTC,Solid pickup for the Heat. I enjoyed watching him on the Suns but it was definitely time for him to move on.
suns,3co8g9,Nashty10,7,Thu Jul 9 13:56:29 2015 UTC,"Much appreciated! Happy you guys got yourself an amazing Center in Tyson. Also a bit jealous you guys got Booker haha (the day I watched the draft, I wasn't aware that Winslow wasn't picked yet and was so ready for us to get Booker). I enjoyed watching Booker's highlights and hope he makes teams regret not picking him and (obviously) become Klay Thompson 2.0  What are some of Green's strengths and weaknesses? Only highlights I could find were of him and Dragic combining for like 45-50 points one game and then of all of his crazy dunks from the 2013-2014 season"
suns,3co8g9,Mellothewise,20,Thu Jul 9 14:50:08 2015 UTC,"He's one of the dumbest basketball players I've ever seen. Although if his shot is wet, lookout.   Don't let him dribble more than once, don't expect ANY defense at all, don't expect him to be capable of passing, but for a minimum deal, you will enjoy him. If he plays big minutes, you will lose the game though."
suns,3co8g9,ORANG_DRAGIC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:16:00 2015 UTC,He's made some pretty OK passes in his career with us. Mostly jump and dump passes based on athleticism of course.
suns,3co8g9,illCON,-1,Fri Jul 10 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"He is definitely one of the dumbest ever to don a Suns uniform, Fortunately for the Heat, I cannot imagine Spo, Riley, Wade (though he is guilty of much of the same), or Bosh letting him get away with chucking up low % shots each time he gets the ball. This could actually be good for everyone."
suns,3co8g9,djreluctant,7,Thu Jul 9 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"A very inconsistent shooter who takes contested 3's.... However, when he's 🔥, watch out. That dude will make 4 in a row and pump up the whole crowd. Plus, I believe he's the best dunker in the league. He can catch any lob you throw at him. Total energy guy. He was my favorite player during the 12-13 season, hopefully he can get some consistency with a new team."
suns,3co8g9,StepFatherGoose,3,Thu Jul 9 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was looking at his stats and saw a ton of inconsistency.  It seems like he also works well with Goran right?"
suns,3co8g9,Mellothewise,3,Thu Jul 9 15:47:38 2015 UTC,They seemed to play well together. Don't expect a whole lot though bro
suns,3co8g9,StepFatherGoose,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not.  I'm just looking at a good enough off the bench player to back up Luol Deng or Dwyane Wade when they need rest and hopefully help the Heat not lose a lead or not be a detriment and increase a deficit further haha"
suns,3co8g9,Mellothewise,3,Thu Jul 9 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"Strength - shooting, athleticism   Weakness - Intelligence, turnovers, ball handles, passing, rebounding, defense, shot selection"
suns,3co8g9,TheBorzz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:50:52 2015 UTC,So he's more of a finisher than an initiator is what I am gathering from this guy
suns,3co8g9,Mellothewise,9,Thu Jul 9 17:39:47 2015 UTC,good luck making him not initiate
suns,3co8g9,TheBorzz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:41:20 2015 UTC,Haha ooooh boy
suns,3co8g9,Mellothewise,2,Thu Jul 9 17:44:15 2015 UTC,He's a more athletic version of JR Smith and has the same low bball IQ. You'll love him and hate him.
suns,3co8g9,mikehayman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:59 2015 UTC,if he is hot he is fucking hot if not your in trouble
suns,3co8g9,peanutdakidnappa,12,Thu Jul 9 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"Im actually kind of sad he signed for the minimum. I wanted him on another team, but I want him to make some money too. Seems like a good guy."
suns,3co8g9,ORANG_DRAGIC,4,Thu Jul 9 15:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sad too.  It was really kind of a downer watching him be so putrid and deflate his value last year, I thought he was finally going to earn a big contract after bouncing around.  Instead he was one of the biggest culprits behind us mysteriously losing games and was all around backbreaking.  Ah well."
suns,3co8g9,TOUCHDOWNJOEMONTANA,11,Thu Jul 9 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"Nah bro, didn't you hear? The people who don't watch the Suns are saying we just cut his minutes for no reason. Yet another reason we lost literally every game after trading Goran"
suns,3co8g9,hailcesaro,9,Thu Jul 9 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"hah, i remember begging and pleading for his minutes to get cut even more than they were.  he was destroying us pre trade deadline"
suns,3co8g9,TOUCHDOWNJOEMONTANA,7,Thu Jul 9 15:35:27 2015 UTC,The heat have no fucking clue what they are in for.  Like. Good fucking riddance.  I never have to see a shitty 3 jacked up 3 feet beyond the arc over 7 defenders with 33 seconds still on the shot clock.  Peace.
suns,3co8g9,edtehgar,2,Thu Jul 9 17:04:49 2015 UTC,this.
suns,3co8g9,TheBorzz,0,Thu Jul 9 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"Good thing he'll be playing in a system where he can come off the bench for 10-15 minutes with actual veteran leadership, a coaching staff with a history of producing better defenders, a competent GM in Pat Riley, and a world-class organization around him that has three banners in the rafters. Oh, and for the minimum.  He'll flourish."
suns,3co8g9,heisenberg0,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:43 2015 UTC,Cant wait til he dribbles around and waves off wade and dragic then launches a ridiculously bad 3 over 4 defenders.
suns,3co8g9,edtehgar,0,Mon Jul 13 00:57:16 2015 UTC,Defenders will be too worried about Whiteside/Bosh/Wade to have THREE bodies on him. Who were defenders worried about in Phoenix last season?
suns,3co8g9,heisenberg0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:57:34 2015 UTC,If hes coming off the bench how much time will he be playing with those guys?
suns,3co8g9,edtehgar,0,Mon Jul 13 04:53:08 2015 UTC,"The sole reason we signed him was to stretch the defense with just the threat of his shot (something D Wade and Luol Deng couldn't do for us last season). You can't leave the guy wide open all game.  Has he ever played with an actual threat in the low post? Whiteside and Bosh are going to make his job way easier.  He's going to be more wide open than he's ever been, and I'll take 37% (his average with the Suns) from three all day."
suns,3co8g9,heisenberg0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:33:25 2015 UTC,He will still miss. But whatever makes you sleep better at night.
suns,3co8g9,edtehgar,0,Mon Jul 13 16:32:00 2015 UTC,37%.
suns,3co8g9,heisenberg0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:39:09 2015 UTC,That must be the % of time he actually cares about defense.

suns,3co8g9,c0de1143,2,Thu Jul 9 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"Glad to see him still in the NBA. He's a tiring player at times with some major flaws, but when the guy is hot it's an absolute thrill ride."
suns,3co8g9,theripped,2,Thu Jul 9 17:07:28 2015 UTC,"He's going to have a great year, get a good contact, and then under perform."

suns,3co8g9,phd2k1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Good for him, but he is the Jason Williams of dunking.  Amazing highlights, but bad for the team overall"
suns,3co8g9,PapaBrice,7,Thu Jul 9 14:43:46 2015 UTC,Hopefully that parallel holds up with the Heat.  Miami acquired Jason Williams for the 2006 season that resulted in a championship
suns,3co8g9,yrogreg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:20:08 2015 UTC,"I'll miss him. I hope he has a really good year, and then gets paid. So much untapped potential in Gerald."
suns,3co8g9,phd2k1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:40 2015 UTC,Hes like 30. Im pretty sure he has no more potential left. He is what he is.
suns,3co8g9,edtehgar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you are saying, but I'm still rooting for him to have a resurgence. 2 years ago, he had several 20 pt games, and was creating 6th man of the year talks, and not just locally. Even last year, the narrative was ""Can Phoenix have 2 6MOTY candidates in Green and Thomas?"". When the system allows him to have fun, and play within his skill set, he can be really effective.   After the all-star break last year, we completely changed from a running style offense, to a much more slow paced, half court game, and it didn't work well at all. With Dragic, Bledsoe, Thomas, and Green, we were a fast team with depth. After the break, we became a much more conventional offense, with no real strengths. We started to rely on PJ's defense, Bledsoe's athleticism, and Markieff's mid range shooting.  I'm just hoping that Green can find success again, because I really enjoyed having him on our team."
suns,3co8g9,phd2k1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Gonna miss this guy so much, but this year some of the ways he use to play use to make me scratch my head, but still gonna miss this dude. Basically the players the Suns got 2 years ago are all gone."

suns,3co8g9,BryanFair,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:20:02 2015 UTC,why did his stats drop completely after december? I feel like his slump was another reason why the suns kind of lost it in the 2015 part of the season. They were doing decent in the beginning of the season
suns,3co8g9,bobloloz,0,Fri Jul 10 07:55:43 2015 UTC,"poor heat fans, one of the more frustrating players I've ever watched."
suns,3cpqyz,ORANG_DRAGIC,4,Thu Jul 9 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Tyson's a pretty classy dude. Never really heard him speak before and it sounds like he's really going to help out in the locker room with his experience and maturity.  I'm still hoping Markieff doesn't leave us as his talent is undeniable, and if so, hoping for Chandler to set him straight."
suns,3cpqyz,ck44,2,Thu Jul 9 20:48:03 2015 UTC,Tyson is the best fucking locker room guy and an on-court defensive leader/coach.
suns,3cpqyz,fkndead,2,Fri Jul 10 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think they talked about him being a mentor enough...  For real though, I'm really excited about him being in Phoenix and I think he is going to be a very influential addition on the court and in the locker room."
suns,3cpqyz,jhady,2,Thu Jul 9 20:39:45 2015 UTC,Tyson has a nose ring? What a hip motherfucker
suns,3cpqyz,Chibbssamcro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know what to make over McD's comment towards the end about ""probably going over the cap"" in regards to remaining free agent signings? Or is this just referring to the Weems/Price deals?"
suns,3cpqyz,ianwallace1111,3,Thu Jul 9 21:31:25 2015 UTC,I don't think he's referring to Weems and Price because their deals weren't for very much at all. We apparently had enough space for LMA so what happened to all that.

suns,3cqc55,Nabz23,5,Thu Jul 9 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"I think Booker is about 2% to make the regular rotation (if that, even) barring major trades.  He's an 18 year old kid who couldn't accrue rebounds/steals/blocks against college competition, meaning there's like a razor thin chance he's going to be able to handle the physicality of the NBA and profitably play >800 minutes this season.  Plus, he'll have to re-tool his shot a bit for the NBA line + dealing with closeouts from NBA athletes.  I predict a lot of splashing in Bakersfield.  That being said, I'm sure he's fine to take on a role next year.   Bled/Knight  Knight/Weems/Goodwin  Tucker/Warren/Weems  Keef/Tel  Chandler/Len  are the guys I see getting regular minutes.  Solid chance Warren plays himself into a large share of the wing minutes, he grew a lot as a player last year."
suns,3cqc55,TOUCHDOWNJOEMONTANA,2,Thu Jul 9 23:20:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, Booker should really take advantage of the D-League this year. Signing Weems will provide a good buffer at the SG position until Booker can get stronger and faster. I believe I read somewhere that he's still growing too so I can see management treating him like Archie and giving him time to grow into his body."
suns,3cqc55,ianwallace1111,2,Fri Jul 10 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"Posted this in another thread:  Here's an idea of what I'd like to see rotation wise, off the top of my head:  32m - Bledsoe  32m - Knight  30m - Markieff  28m - TJ  25m - Chandler  25m - Len  18m - PJ  18m - Archie  15m - Mirza  10m - Booker  7m - Weems, Leuer, Price, etc.  • Booker well have to earn his way into those minutes, so Weems I expect to definitely get some run early. TJ won't get this many minutes, at least not early, but I feel he deserves them and hopefully earns them.  What initially jumps out at me is just how much flexibility the addition of Chandler brings to the table. He's such a versatile front court defender that Hornacek will be able to experiment with all sorts of lineups. Here are a few ideas I'd love to see in action:  Bled, BK, Archie, Chandler, Len - the twin towers concept is really enticing to me, especially like this, giving opponents too much speed to deal with as well. With this combo I envision lots of steals, blocks, outlet passes, and Archie murdering rims.  Replace PJ for Archie in the group above and you have a ruthless defensive group.  Bled, BK, TJ, Mirza + Chandler or Len. Oh my gosh, with the guards penetrating, and TJ slashing to the rim, and Mirza lurking for threes, and the center lurking for dunks, this can be an imposing offensive group. I don't think Len is quite yet ready to anchor a defense this exposed away from the basket, but Chandler is :)  Replace Markieff for Mirza in the group above for a crunch time, slow pace, half court offense.  Markeiff is really the wild card in all of this. Does he step it the fuck up and do LaMarcus Aldridgey things, and force Hornacek to run the offense through him on the elbow? Does he play cranky and offended and disrupt team chemistry? Does he take a step back but man up and destroy opponents benches and lead the second team? I have no idea."

I think playing in a historically great West is also tainting how solid of a position the Suns are in right now too.
suns,3cr3gq,Baby_Powder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:41:38 2015 UTC,"We've gone through some lean years. This year is no worse. So to say the team was gutted is saying there has been a change. We may very well get the 13th pick again this year. The team is young. The coach is inexperienced. The roster lacks low post scoring and shooters. We have no all-stars. There are many easily identifiable negatives. This is what is commonly called rebuilding. Our only fault is that we won too many games and got low lottery picks so we couldn't draft elite players. Now we are forced to build from the middle, which requires a lot of movement."
suns,3cr3gq,ianwallace1111,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"If by gutted you mean that we're going to be a bottom of the barrel team?? Definitely not. The only position that's thin right now is PF (this of course depends on the Markieff conundrum).  I liked Goran too but all things considered the Front Office did a sufficient job of damage control.    Regarding Bledsoe, even without the addition of Chandler there would have been much more stability this year, which would make him play better.  Adding Chandler compounds chemistry & experience which should help Bledsoe's productivity that much more.   I'm glad we're getting these signings done so early in the summer too so they can all be at training camp to mesh, I really think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

suns,3cl89p,queryquest,2,Wed Jul 8 20:51:22 2015 UTC,Clarification; He's developed his mid range a lot. I wouldn't trust his shot beyond the arc. He was a scoring threat alongside a developing Derozan.
suns,3cl89p,ABondaxFan,2,Wed Jul 8 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"He was always a great mid-range shooter, the problem was back in the Raptor days he thought his range was out to the 3 point line when it clearly hadn't developed yet.

suns,3cl89p,TOUCHDOWNJOEMONTANA,5,Wed Jul 8 21:00:51 2015 UTC,"There's at least some nice stuff about this signing.  I always love the smart teams in the NBA poking around the scrap heap for their shooting.  Instead of paying barf worthy contracts for shooting in free agency (Jodie Meeks, for example), the smart teams are rooting around in the D-League, Euroleague, 2nd round, end of NBA benches etc. for 3&D guys.    Maybe Weems fixed his shot up in Euroleague and it's not a mirage, he lights it up as a 3&D guy and we get to trade Tucker for some frontcourt help or assets?  Or if Warren breaks his hand again, I don't have to watch the Suns call up replacements on the level of Seth Curry, AJ Price etc. since they have some replacement level talent on the roster that comes (fairly) cheap.    Uninspiring signing, but at least it's not 0% to pan out into something positive, which is good."
suns,3cl89p,BillMurrie,2,Wed Jul 8 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems really low-risk and it makes Tucker a lot more expendable. If he doesn't pan out,  he's not the type that's going to cause problems on the bench. This signing doesn't make my pants tighten but I suppose we needed depth at the wing after shipping out three of them and letting two more in Green and Thornton walk."
suns,3cl89p,Reddilutionary,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, smart teams have always done this. Teams like the Spurs have always been good about finding serviceable Roger Mason type guys and only paying them for a season or two.

He may have been raw in the NBA but playing overseas is a totally different style of basketball and he seems to have developed his overall skill set.   It begs the question of where will his minutes come from?

Back to your question. I would be all for getting Parsons but what assets do we have to give? IDK if we should trade a pick. If we do, management should stop having their feet in 2 different places. If we are taking on extra salary then we should be aggressive as possible at trading to pick up players. I'm not saying Nets aggressive but if would be a waste of future cap to get Parsons if we still couldn't male the playoffs.

But I have a feeling Knight is ready to embrace the starting SG role since he immediately took that contract the Suns gave him and he got along with Bled. Their play didn't really translate that well last season, but that was only a short sample size and, of course, Knight had to adjust mid-season and then got injured.

suns,3cgt05,ORANG_DRAGIC,6,Tue Jul 7 20:44:46 2015 UTC,The thing that bugged me about Channing was his ability to foul and give up the easiest layup/dunks ever. He would never foul anyone hard enough to alter their shot. It happened like twice a game for 5 seasons.
suns,3cgt05,vivaphx,3,Tue Jul 7 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"I always hated his whiny ass face when he'd do that too. Like ""AWWW WHAT COME ON"" after he'd girly slap his man's arm while they dunk over him."
suns,3cgt05,thephoenixx,2,Tue Jul 7 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't so much mind him on the offensive end, though his streakiness was maddening and he was too soft to play in the post.  It was on the other end, he always got outmuscled on the glass by smaller guys and abused in the paint when defending.  And when it wasn't getting beat up in the post, it was just plain getting beat because of a low defensive IQ.  I like the guy, loved some of his big 3s and how he stretched the floor, but when he got into a shooting funk he was basically 7 feet of wasted space."
suns,3cgt05,phd2k1,3,Wed Jul 8 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"And he's only 22 years old! What if Alex becomes a bigger, stronger, Dirk Nowitzki? I would be ok with that."

suns,3cgt05,auggie5,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"As long as he can hit that 15 footer consistently, it will go a long way towards keeping defenses honest on him.  He was given that shot all season long and couldnt quite make them pay.  Id like to see him used more as a dive man on the P&R.  He's got the hands, the size, and the aggression. The footwork will get there.  In those situations, Markieff (or Amar'e :D) will provide the threat of the kick-out because of their range. Knight would be the ball handler in this instance, because his shot is more of a threat."

suns,3cgt05,BBQHonk,9,Tue Jul 7 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"I don't get why all these big guys work on outside shots.   Spacing. Otherwise, Bledsoe and Knight won't have any ample opportunities to slash and score or kick-out if Chandler and Len both play together or if Keef's in the paint with Len.  Alex won't be a pure shooter and spot-up all the time like Channing Frye, obviously, but it helps to have something like this up your sleeve."

suns,3cgt05,TheEspo,3,Tue Jul 7 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to potentially play Len and Chandler together, one of them is going to have to play outside the paint.  Chandler certainly isn't that guy."
suns,3cgt05,auggie5,0,Tue Jul 7 20:58:04 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean you need to force the development of on outside shot. Moving well away from the ball and setting efficient screens will do more than enough to get better spacing.

I think we have a shot too but I honestly think it all hinges on how we start the season. If the Markieff rumblings simmer down and we jive well from the get-go, that will bode well. If we go .500 the first 20 games I will be incredibly disappointed.   Even if Markieff gets traded mid-season, nothing drama-wise will compare to last year so we'll get through it. I just hope it won't be too late by that point."
suns,3cfvb7,auggie5,2,Tue Jul 7 16:47:37 2015 UTC,We have to eat the pacific division for us to have a shot. I mean we have to go .750 in our division to have a shot. That's 12 games. If we go .500 against the rest of the league that's 33. 45 wins will give us a shot.   Edit: I want us to have a shot

Seriously, with or without Kieff I'd imagine we're going to pick near the same spot in the draft anyway, barring a surprising season from the Suns or a major change in the roster. Plus Anderson is going to be a FA next season so if things don't work out, it's not going to take a hit on our salary cap (after this season).  But you do bring up a good point. Taking a gamble on Kieff this season to see if he plays hard could work really well for us. Then he'd be MUCH more valuable.

suns,3cchbe,mbarnar,2,Mon Jul 6 22:20:12 2015 UTC,Man I think getting rid of this guy would be good in the long run. After missing on LMA the seasons looking like it will be decent at best. Might not be a bad Idea to move him for a 1st and get an earlier lottery pick for next year.
suns,3cchbe,gpthatslife,2,Mon Jul 6 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"I think McD is too wise to not flip him for something. The recent salary dump was low risk, high reward although it obviously didn't pan out.

There's a difference between scaling an image correctly for different resolutions and simply forcing an image to a specific resolution.   Not sure if it was an error or you don't know any better, just thought I'd say something because while some people don't notice/care about things like this, the new image you linked isn't ""right."" Plus with the whole ""learning Photoshop"" thing, resizing images correctly is integral in content creation."

The pic I used of Bledsoe and the original pic had a different ratio, so I changed it to 1440x2560 as best I could with minimal distortion, but of course some of it stayed.   I did a bit of research and I think I used the best method? Like I said and you pointed out, still learning haha. But if you have any advice feel free to share!"
suns,3cfp03,vonvoldov,7,Tue Jul 7 15:35:33 2015 UTC,Not as a straight up trade. Wizards would have to at least include a pick because of NeNe's age.   My knee-jerk reaction after the Pistons trade was to also trade Markieff because he'll hold a grudge and his past history but now I'd wait to see how he plays the first couple months. If he's still immature than maybe by that point a proper suitor will emerge who we can trade for.

Having Chandler around will hopefully help. I wish we still had Granger around since by all accounts he was a consummate professional.  If I recall correctly, when Tucker got his DUI he was suspended for a couple games but then he was right back to being a high energy, high character player."

suns,3cgjan,Hornashit,14,Tue Jul 7 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"I don’t bother replying to your posts because I find the assumptions you make naïve.  Why argue specific points when I don’t even accept the premise and framework of your statements?   I can't think of another coach that would completely abandon an extremely successful system of Dragic and Bledsoe being co-point guards running up and down the floor   Can you picture a league that is short SG and long PG?  A team that is attempting to acquire undervalued assets to trade?  Did you consider that the “co-point guard system” could be a euphemism, an attempt to be diplomatic towards the fans and players?  “This extra point guard is redundant, but he was undervalued so we signed him anyways thus creating potential value, don’t fall in love, we will trade him by the end of the season” is a hard sell to both fans and the players themselves.     I can't think of another coach that would turn Brandan Wright into a fucking dribble drive player who shoots 12 foot jumpers   I can think of 29 teams that don’t have Dirk, so no matter where he landed, Wright’s game wasn’t going to look the same as Dallas.  I’m not a fan of the dribbling either, but for the record Wright took more shots out of the paint in Dallas than with us last season – the exact opposite of the narrative you are pushing of Jeff turning him into a jump shooter.  I’d rather have him trying a 12 foot shot then something farther out.     I can't think of another coach that would start Miles fucking Plumlee over Len for a month and a half.   Can you think of a team with the best training staff in the league?  Can you picture a GM who put a limit on his developing, often-injured center’s minutes to let him continue to recover from surgeries that happened only months prior?"

I can't think of another coach that would completely abandon an extremely successful  system of Dragic and Bledsoe being co-point guards running up and down the floor and instead have turnover machine Bledsoe dominate the ball while Dragic camps in the corner. I can't think of another coach that would turn Brandan Wright into a fucking dribble drive player who shoots 12 foot jumpers. I can't think of another coach that would start Miles fucking Plumlee over Len for a month and a half.   Don't you find it interesting that me and the others who criticize Hornashit all point out detailed basketball things such as what I listed above? The only thing I've ever heard from Hornasheep is ""oh but we had X wins with Y roster!"", ""nobody expected us to be good anyways"", and of course the classic ""but the front office gave him too many point guards!!!""  None of you sheep have ever once talked about fucking basketball when talking about Jeff. It is always just vague, unintelligent shit like that.

How many 12ft + do you see for the entire season?  Not many.  Regardless of what team he was playing for he wasn't shooting mid fucking range jumpers last year.  Plus he played more than half his games with the Suns.  That's a fair representation of his shot chart for us.

Not to mention he shot around the same fg % with boston as he did in phoenix. Like you said Chandler is a lob threat. Boston nor Phoenix had one so maybe he had to improvise more?  and thats my shitty analysis. toon in next week to see why LBJ isn't even top 5. #4 Will shock you!

Wright in Phoenix was a backup 5 .. Most of his time was spent with Archie ""dribble with my head down"" Goodwin as his point.. Try running a lob base offense through Archie... Lemme know how it works.  When he got starting time did you just expect the whole offense to revolve around him?   Phoenix didn't have the personnel to play the lob game the same way he did in Dallas..  Not to mention you're basing all this off a small sample size where our roster was a clusterfuck and we played like 8 ppl a night, if we were lucky.  Calm down bud... Maybe you should at least give hornacek a chance with Tyson before you start calling for his head?"

suns,3cgjan,mbarnar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"Probably a poor choice of words but Archie's court vision was definitely something he could improve.  Rushed some plays too much and didn't look at the bigger picture (aka potential lobs to wright).  Not a knock on Archie he's just young and needs to learn.

suns,3c9toa,xxTheexx,12,Mon Jul 6 06:15:03 2015 UTC,If he cuts the turnovers (knight coming back makes it easier) and improves his jump shot he gonna make huge progress in the upcoming season.
suns,3c9toa,petersuns13,7,Mon Jul 6 06:21:36 2015 UTC,I think he could cut down on the turnovers if the other guys learn to cut more to the rim as well. There were so many instances where the defense would collapse on him as he drove to the rim but every one else just waited for the outlet at the three point line. This caused Bledsoe to force tough passes and shots leading to turnovers and bricks.
suns,3c9toa,JimmyKibble9,7,Mon Jul 6 06:27:14 2015 UTC,off ball movement?  Dear god we have the perfect off ball movement guy sitting on our bench.  give me TJ warren starting minutes please.   Even better can we like fuse TJ and PJ into one perfect defender with an amazing offensive game

suns,3c9toa,ianwallace1111,4,Mon Jul 6 08:12:46 2015 UTC,"Playing consistently with Knight will most definitely help decrease turnovers. Like others have said the wing players need to move and cut more without the ball (Warren was exceptional at this. Goodwin needs to do it more often until his outside shot comes together). I think having Chandler on the interior will help as well because he will be better at positioning his body for easy buckets/lobs than Len, at least until Len gains a bit more strength. I feel like when Len got the ball under the rim, often times he would bring it down by his waist (huge no-no for big men) instead of keeping the ball high and going straight up with it."

suns,3c9toa,Hornashit,4,Mon Jul 6 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"Besides a pretty higher turnover margin, what else specifically would you consider to be ""serious"" flaws??

I think he'll actually be better now that he doesn't have his brother around. I think, with brothers, you get this whole ""Us against the World"" mentality. Now he must realize that he's part of a team with the rest of the roster. He'll need to make friends on the team outside of his brother, and will have to humble himself to a veteran presence in Tyson Chandler.  I really hope I'm right, because Keef has serious potential. If he continues to improve, along with Bled and Len, then we have a very bright future."
suns,3c77ki,phd2k1,3,Sun Jul 5 22:09:08 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking. We have faith in keef unlike others in this sub
suns,3c77ki,DixieRektt,2,Sun Jul 5 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"He's only 25 years old, and there's no way that they reasonably expected to play for the same team when they entered the NBA. This is just getting things back to normal. He'll be fine, and if not, he'll be a valuable trade piece later this year. I'm not worried."
suns,3c77ki,phd2k1,3,Sun Jul 5 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly hoping this is the case, especially since the PF position is so thin as the roster stands. Last year when he kept talking about being the team leader and a mentor for the young players was obviously premature; it was clear that he was still a young player, at least mentally. You don't deem yourself a leader then trash talk the fans enthusiasm.   For the fans who think the Tyson Chandler contract was too much for a player his age; if he is able to help settle down Markieff, mentor Len and help him with his overall skill set and help this young team get some playoff experience, his contract will be well worth it."
suns,3c77ki,ck44,2,Mon Jul 6 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"This. You hit the nail on the head by mentioning Markieff playing 2 years without his brother.   While Marcus isn't a terrible player, it was evident that by being together with Markieff, they both got a sense of entitlement and thus the season full of technicals and unprofessional antics by both of them.  I know Markieff isn't too happy right now since his brother got traded and we tried to get his replacement here, but if anything, this should be a wake up call for him.  This is a business as much as a sport, and if you don't do your job, you are let go by your employer.  I believe Keef has the potential to be a great player in this league as his midrange shot is money. At this point he just needs to act like a professional and do his job without whining."
suns,3c77ki,AMPA-R,2,Mon Jul 6 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"I love Kieff's game, but he seriously needs to act less like a child and more like a pro. Off court shenanigans? Arguing with refs? Refusing to talk to media? You're a member of the Phoenix Suns. This is your job, and you're getting paid millions to do so. Mature up."

If he can't handle it, I'll take a Brandon Bass/Amare combo over a lackluster, disengaged Mafkieff any day."

Ever.  When I say that we'll win 25 games, that is an expression of hope or optimism. That is a good thing; top 4 pick   Suns won't make the playoffs. Jazz will this year taking Portland's spot. Kings got better too as did OKC who will probably take NOL spot, even they improved via coaching. There's just no room in the West."
suns,3c77ki,daynewma,6,Sun Jul 5 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"25 games?? If you are hoping we lose just for the sake of the next draft I can't support that. If you're truly projecting we will only win 25 games based on our current roster, I strongly disagree. We were a 40 win team last year (44-45 if you count buzzerbeaters) with arguably the most cringe-worthy team chemistry plagued season in recent memory (Thomas/Dragic fiasco, Technical fouls, Morris twins antics on & off court). We got rid of the largest cancer (Marcus Morris), added stability and leadership in the front court (Tyson Chandler ) and freed up minutes for budding young talent who I believe will turn heads this year (Goodwin & Warren).   The Kings got better on paper but that's a very volatile collection of players. The Jazz at best are on par with the Suns, I don't believe you can say they're a shoe in for Portland's spot. You are correct about OKC though, barring another injury ridden season, they will make the playoffs."

suns,3c77ki,ganxBice,5,Mon Jul 6 14:48:43 2015 UTC,If you actively root for your team to lose then you are not a real fan. I understand the mentality of wanting a top draft pick but come one man. Are you saying that when you're watching games this year you will be pulling for the other team over the Suns? If so we don't need your negative ass on this sub reddit.
suns,3c77ki,edtehgar,6,Sun Jul 5 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"""Real fan""'. What even is that? When I'm watching games I hope they win. I also hope that the team isn't listening to yahoos like me and has the fortitude to think big picture. I hope that the long term plan is to win a championship, not the 8th seed.  Do I need to hope that we stay in the same place? Would it be nice if we win 50 games this year and make the playoffs? Yeah. That would be pretty cool. But realistically I think we stay in the same place which blows. It hurts the team. We went big for LMA. Lost, fine. But now the plan is what? To get a helpful piece that will help us get back to the same limbo?   This team was trying to tank in 13-14. Should McDonough be fired for that effort? Is he not a true fan? We would have been so much better off. All we got for that was Frye leaving on a big deal, a big deal for Bled/Mori, IT in FA, and a meeting with LeBron as a favor to Bledsoe.  The Jazz are not in the same situation as us, despite what others say. They went 19-10 while we closed 10-19. Because of the draft.  Does losing suck? Yeah. It does. It feels like shit. But 39-43 and the 13th pick ALSO FEELS LIKE SHIT. Getting a top pick is a great consolation prize. I'll bet the Twolves Reddit is much more optimistic and realistically so. Will they make the playoffs this year? Maybe not. But they have real hope that eventually they can win the big one. Excitement over a possible franchise player in Towns.   That's all I want. Some glimmer of hope in the horizon. You might see it, and good for you. But I don't and I think a lot of neutral nba viewers would agree."
suns,3c77ki,edtehgar,-1,Sun Jul 5 22:42:38 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, but I have no idea where we go from here. What do you think?  I think the Tyson pickup was great as it really made us contenders for LaMarcus and even though it didn't work Tyson will be a good veteran presence and good for Len. It was a gamble I think was worth taking because I doubt we would get a high enough draft pick with Bledsoe and knight on the team even without Chandler.  Even though the draft is probably our best source for finding a franchise PF, the draft is still a gamble just like going after Free Agents. There are basically no free agent PFs next year worth going after except maybe Al Horford.   I'm just not sure how we get over the hump when we can't seem to get Free Agents, but we are too good to get top draft picks."
suns,3c77ki,auggie5,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:33:13 2015 UTC,The top picks in the draft are much less risky than FA.  Historically the top 5 players chosen pan out very well. When you look at top 3 the numbers are even higher.
suns,3c77ki,edtehgar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean the draft is risk free, which is my point. To hit a top lottery pick we'd probably have to dump Knight, Bledsoe, or both.  I'm behind the FO on the idea of going all on on Aldridge was worth it, rather than blowing up to get a top draft pick.   Although now that we're here in the position we're in, we gotta figure out a game plan which very well might include blowing up and heading to a top pick."
suns,3c77ki,daynewma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:29:13 2015 UTC,No but id still rather have ashot at drafting the next hakeem or duncan or lebron or iverson or worthy or magic anyday of the week.  All you need is 1. When you get that 1 you are good for nearly a decade.  I can guarentee those types of guys typically dont fall past the top 10.
suns,3c77ki,rice_bledsoe,2,Mon Jul 6 17:35:36 2015 UTC,And im sick of dumb fans wanted us to shoot for the 8th seed every year instead of building a true championship team.  Anthony davis john wall kyrie irving dwight howard  chris paul carmelo anthony chris bosh kevin durant andrew bogut deron williams lamarcus aldridge al horford mike conley russell westbrook kevin love blake griffin james harden derrick favors demarcus cousins  All of these were top 5 picks. Yes you can get a shitty pick. But the chances of getting a great one are much higher.  Yet this sub is so fucking stubborn. They cant put aside their pride for 1 fucking season to get us stability for 5+.  You mean to tell me you would rather have year after year of 10th-7th seed instead of getting one of those guys and having franchise security for the next decade?  I want a championship. Top 5 players historically lead teams to  championships. If we cant get one in FA then we need to get one in the draft. And that wont happen if we keep getting the 7th-10th seed.
suns,3c77ki,daynewma,2,Mon Jul 6 08:23:42 2015 UTC,Big free agents don't sign with bad teams. So your logic is weird.

So far we've had a good offseason - obviously getting LMA would've been incredible, but I still feel good about the progress we're making."
suns,3c5ib5,AMPA-R,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:45:50 2015 UTC,Not sure Kieff will mature up. In which case we might have to just stop him from playing too much and keep him as an asset in case future trades come up.
suns,3c5ib5,tisdue,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:30:19 2015 UTC,I hope Brandon Knight can learn to relax out there this season.  He constantly looks like a deer in headlights when he's on the court.  I see good things for him this year if he can get a little more comfortable.

Great opportunity for him to learn from one of the greats, as well as taking some minutes away for a little so he can stay consistently healthy for a decent amount of time. Very excited for the season to start!"

suns,3c6b3q,Awesome_ShowOff,3,Sun Jul 5 06:19:51 2015 UTC,I hope to see Patric Young ball out
suns,3c6b3q,StepFatherGoose,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:20:20 2015 UTC,I read yesterday that he's signed with a team in Europe so he's not going to be playing in the Summer League.
suns,3c6b3q,StackOfMay,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:48:03 2015 UTC,"oooh, I probably should have mentioned this but he's gone. Signed with the Olympiakos."
suns,3c6b3q,scooper1030,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:12:50 2015 UTC,So that means he can't audition for summer league? I was actually kind of excited ha
suns,3c6b3q,StepFatherGoose,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:30:57 2015 UTC,"Often times what happens is that players go into summer league knowing that even if they don't get an NBA deal, there are European scouts there that like to recruit Americans (and all nationalities). For Young, I guess once he had some guaranteed money from one of the top teams in Europe he decided it wasn't worth his time to continue on."
