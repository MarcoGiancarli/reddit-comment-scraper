He remained in captivity until 1919, when all Germans were sent to Germany and the colony was annexed by the British.  In 1920 he became president of the German Colonial Society and in 1930 honorary president. .   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Dictionary of National Biography.

Boelcke is considered the father of the German fighter air force, as well as the ""Father of Air Fighting Tactics"".   He was the first to formalize rules of air fighting, which he presented as the Dicta Boelcke. While he promulgated rules for the individual pilot, his main concern was the use of formation fighting rather than single effort.

The monitors withstand the fire from the shore batteries, blow up a torpedo launched by the Germans, and by 6:30 A.M. anchor and open fire. Return fire from the Königsberg finds the range and slams two shells into the Mersey, killing four seamen and wounding four others. The exchange of fire continues into the afternoon, with the monitors expending 635 shells, four of which hit the Königsberg, killing four seamen and opening a hole in her hull. With their guns overheated and their men weary, the monitors head back down the river past the German gauntlet and return to the safety of the delta at four-thirty""."

So basically adding wife in front of murder is a concious decision. As if killing your wife was a different sort of murder. Then even worse, a girl was killed because she flirted. All fault was directed towards her, and not the motorcycle riding man who picked her up. Article explains it was an accident, only to add that Kate was actually 10 years old. WTF?"
