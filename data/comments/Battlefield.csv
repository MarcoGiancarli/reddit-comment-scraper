Battlefield,3e28x6,Octosphere,9,Tue Jul 21 11:58:26 2015 UTC,We have no language rules at all. You can say whatever you want on TV and anywhere else. Could be the Server Provider maybe.
Battlefield,3e28x6,Aznkiller,6,Tue Jul 21 14:00:38 2015 UTC,I don't know but I agree that this happens almost exclusively on German servers. Maybe they have stricter language rules on TV and that somehow carried over to their game servers and communities? Personally I don't like servers with rules at all (besides racism/hacking and a few others) so I usually stick to my favorite server.

This is goverened by the amount of times you write to a it. IE: every new file you dl, every patch, everything that moves data around on the SSD will tick off a bit of the life the SSD has left. And they aren't like HDDs, one day they just die. If you want your files to be safe always store personal things you don't want to easily lose on a secondary HDD and put your OS on it's own SSD.

If you play any game that edits preferences, or updates itself(large patches) your gaming SSD has a significantly shorter lifespan than a ""storage"" ssd. If you add on OS updates to that you are lowering the life of the drive.  I don't get what your comment is trying to say. What I posted are known limitations of SSDs since they were first designed. All flash media has a lifespan dictated by the number of writes to a single cell of it's storage medium."

One shot with a DMR, two with a Carbine.  Then toss a hand flare on it, and you're golden. Test your chosen carbine/DMR beforehand to make sure it's actually priming the SLAM, and neither detonating it early, nor doing insufficient damage.  Good luck! :D"
Battlefield,3dh8fg,BakedAlaska,2,Fri Jul 17 00:33:01 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Battlefield,3dh8fg,SirNLeo,7,Fri Jul 17 00:41:08 2015 UTC,That editing was painful to watch
Battlefield,3dh8fg,Scroachity,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that. I'm just starting out trying to edit video with some quality to it, so my work is going to be well outside perfection for a while.  Is there anything specific you think I should have done but didn't, or did do and shouldn't have? Thanks for the reply!"
Battlefield,3dh8fg,SirNLeo,4,Thu Jul 16 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked it, it was different than others and it paired well with the music, which made it actually pretty funny to me!"
Battlefield,3dh8fg,qrokodial,2,Thu Jul 16 17:02:33 2015 UTC,I'm glad you enjoyed it! Thanks for watching! :D
Battlefield,3dh8fg,Madlydevoid,4,Fri Jul 17 00:33:23 2015 UTC,Not cut it so much. Just show one kill and move onto another. Was really hard to follow along with the setup of one kill into the setup of another.
Battlefield,3dh8fg,XPostLinker,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. However, my goal with making this video was to put the gameplay and soundtrack in sync; this worked best for the first and second ""phases,"" where I was sneaking and setting up, then the frenzied later section of the music was dedicated to the hurried tossing of hand flares. Finally, the explosions, which didn't line up with the music as well.  If I were to do as you say, and leave the clips intact, the audio would no longer serve any purpose in the video, and I might as well make a 15 minute video of the dozens of kills I've managed to record. It'd be more boring, it most likely couldn't have an interesting soundtrack, and it wouldn't be a challenge or a pleasure to edit.  I'm not saying you're wrong. I definitely need to improve and learn to edit better, and the style of this video will not agree with everyone. I thought it fit, and at least some people seem to agree.   Thanks again for your time!"
Battlefield,3dh8fg,AwkwardSeaOtter,2,Thu Jul 16 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"obviously it's up to you whether your video is made to be a good viewing experience or synced to the music. as it stands now, there is waaay too much buildup and confusion."
Battlefield,3dh8fg,HellaFella420,2,Thu Jul 16 17:20:45 2015 UTC,Meh I honestly thought that made it funny. Really watching them 1 by one would of been a boring.
Battlefield,3dh8fg,Graftonious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"That's how I felt; I feel like after five or so hand flare kills, it would be pretty boring. All the clips did have a sort of three-part theme to them;    Buildup, as I was sneaking up to the targets Readying, when I was tossing the hand flares Watching as the explosions killed my enemies   Maybe this isn't enough for it to work on a really good level, but it's the way I made it, and it seemed to fit pretty well.  Thanks for watching. :D"

Battlefield,3ddcb5,bez_lightyear,6,Wed Jul 15 17:27:18 2015 UTC,I guess we may just have to take it that some companies may have their arms twisted to have to back on earlier words. eg: DICE on BC2: We'll never charge for DLC. --> BF3: Paid DLC

Battlefield,3ddcb5,gensolo,2,Thu Jul 16 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"Nice. My Battlefield experience started several years ago, when I picked up Battlefield 2 for about $5 at a garage sale. That game blew my mind when I played it for the first time. The squad/commander system, the all out warfare, the teamwork, etc... Played it for hundreds of hours, and I still do today (usually in SP with mods, which is something I miss a lot in the new Battlefields.). Definitely one of my favorite shooters of all time."
Battlefield,3ddcb5,BrawlerAce,2,Thu Jul 16 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a lot of games for PS3 back in '08 and discovered Bad Company through the demo/online beta. It was so much better than Call of Duty with vehicular warfare and large maps, it convinced my cousin and I to switch and we stayed with the series up til BF4(I switched to PC over the PS4).   Even though I never played Play4Free or Heroes I know Battlefield has been an amazing series over the years and it's a shame if any one of the games gets taken off life support."
Battlefield,3ddcb5,mechanical_animal,38,Thu Jul 16 05:57:52 2015 UTC,I know this was not a title loved by many but it was where my Battlefield experience began and so I wanted to share this post to say thank you to DICE for having had it available as an introduction to the BF series. Have not looked back since!
Battlefield,3ddcb5,LongBowNL,21,Wed Jul 15 11:28:40 2015 UTC,It started at Play4Free for me as well. I left it because of the Pay2Win practices that got worse.

Battlefield,3djxup,endallsuffering,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:33 2015 UTC,"NO! FUCK NO! People are trying to get absolutely rid of 3d spotting. ESPECIALLY with the night maps. The minimap is not only for spotting. It gives info about players who need a medic or a pickup, it shows dead players and it helps new players to find their way. AND 3D spotting is WAY more strong than minimap spotting. Minimaps are hard to use. You need to time when to look at them. And HUD clutter? I rather have a box in the corner (which you can size to very small sizes) Than have tons of dots and icons in the middle of the screen. I know the devs will never do this but I said it anyway."

I was 14/15 at the time and i really wanted to like this game, however the microtransactions for weapons especially really ruined the game for me (this was before the op weapons because i quit before that). I don't think it is a bad thing asking money for cosmetics, heck ask as much as you want (which they clearly tried), but guns that behave differently should not be charged for imo. Personal preference of gameplay should not be paid for when cash can be spent for cosmetics.  Just my 2 cents"
Battlefield,3daa4a,porkfatrules,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:13:34 2015 UTC,I enjoyed this game and probably spent more $ than I should have back when it first came out...
Battlefield,3daa4a,chainjoey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"Man, the beta and release of this game was so fun! I loved riding on the wingtip of a plane and shooting down on people. Also the planes were super easy to fly which was just so good. I remember this one spot on one sea side map where you could use dynamite as a sniper to get up to snipe people from it was great. I stopped playing perhaps in 2010 or 2011 maybe. I just got burnt out on having to pay for weapon time. This game was the first that I really had a ton of fun in online. As you said, being underage really cut down on being able to buy weapons... I think one or two times I spent 20 bucks on a visa prepaid card to get a gun that someone else had or something. I left before too much of the pay2win stuff came but while I was there it was just a blast. (heh)  Just my thoughts."

It was a holdover from BC2 in trying to make a console friendly BF game but at least that one had destructible buildings and wider combat areas."

Battlefield,3d5pzz,CrazyKiller5150,3,Tue Jul 14 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"Because it is tedious and unrewarding. Another reason is the fact that it is hard to communicate orders, hearing ""attack this objective!"" doesn't inform the player of what to do. Most player don't understand that the green line pointing to an objective means that they are supposed to go to that objective(its not their fault, there is no tutorial explaining that) it would be nice if there was an icon on their screen saying ""go to objective ___"". Another cool thing would be giving separate orders to players in vehicles, like if the commander want air support on ""B"" he can order all pilots to that objective."
Battlefield,3d5pzz,TheRealRolo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:21:33 2015 UTC,"BF4 doesn't need players thinking more about dropping a deuce than PTFO so EA/DICE dropped support for tablets.

Battlefield,3d5pzz,1EyedMonky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:08 2015 UTC,Because it was half assed. It was boring. It didn't give you anything to actually do.   Here's an idea that wouldn't suck... Mortars suck and whoever let players have them to torment people playing the game should be fired.   What mortars should have been given to is the fucking commander. That'd give them something better to do. I wouldn't mind if the commander mortared my position but I'm not happy when l0lrektgitgud666 mortars me from spawn like a cocksucker.
Battlefield,3d6igr,Z0mb13S0ldier,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:41 2015 UTC,"This doesn't really answer your question but if I go support without taking an ammobag I made damn sure I brought with me the UCAV (when it wasn't yet patched) and C4. C4 is something you need for specific situations (close encounter clearing/destruction, that is) while the ucav is a support gadget that is only useful when you're 100m from the enemy. Now why do I not need an ammobag? 3 C4 is enough, you rarely use it for infantry and 2 is enough to take out a vehicle. It depends on the gamemode you're playing but if it's rush, you won't be likely to encounter 2 vehicles in one lifetime anyway. Plus, there's a perk that increases your C4 capacity. The thing with the ucav is that you don't even need an ammobag, at that time you just had to wait 60 seconds for another one to spawn.  Edit: I only clarified my way of not bringing an ammobag. My reasoning would be to bring total chaos and destruction on the battlefield I guess"

Battlefield,3d4uxo,Calestia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"IMHO, it wasn't worth buying premium.  I bought it a couple weeks after release, and it's not that I regret dropping the $50, but I could've spent my money in a better place.  I don't use any of the dog tags they gave me, or sadly, the maps.  If you queue for standard BF4 maps, you'll never play the DLC because you have to specifically queue for those maps to play them.  If it were all random tho I would like that a lot better.  I just hate queuing up for strictly 4 maps.  Takes out randomness of it.  As a result, I never queue up for DLC maps.  Only thing I got out of Premium were the gold packs once a month, but still they're not anything special.  If you're really looking to play the maps then go right ahead, but beware that in order to play them, you can only play them one set at a time.  Unless there's another way I'm currently unaware of.  Also, I find the base weapons are my favorite too as I never go out of my way to do the extra challenges for guns and shit."

Then some little kid popped in to my squad, and after about one minute he said ""Man shut up"".

Battlefield,3czz1j,jabroni_smasher,2,Mon Jul 13 05:57:38 2015 UTC,"The culture of typing instead of talking seems to be permeating through society, but look at it this way.. you'll be talking to people you'll likely never meet and don't know who you are. The addition of communication if you find other likeminded players enhances gameplay significantly. If you talk and people don't respond or worse still, make fun of you - mute them. Someone prepared to make fun of someone else's voice while playing a game says more about them than it does about you. They're scraping the bottom of the barrel of insecurity and douchebaggery if that's their motivation."
Battlefield,3czz1j,Dmazzone1,3,Mon Jul 13 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"See another HUGE problem is... My family. See I'm from the middle east and I have the best family ever! I love them and cherish them just as much as they love me! But since our mother tongue is Arabic... They will no joke make fun of me for talking in English (my English is actually very good when speaking and thank god I don't have a super rough accent.) so that's another problem. (I play in a place where they can hear me easily. It's quite sad.  (on phone please forgive any spelling or grammatical errors).  Edit: though I'm not throwing the idea out of the window! You absolutely made me feel better talking to others, I'll try it soon. Thanks again!"
Battlefield,3czz1j,rockpapersucker,4,Mon Jul 13 01:51:12 2015 UTC,I agree im on ps4 i usually have a party gping if i hear a mic i invite to the party or switch to in gane chat and invite squad mates with mic. Hell i dont add friends with out mics.

Battlefield,3czz1j,Zamory,2,Sun Jul 12 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"Love on PC, probably more than half show up with mic detected buy you'll be lucky to hear one guy talking every ten games lol."

I tried to say hello or asked if anyone had a mic, no responses. I play on PS4, maybe it's different on PC but it kinda sucks.   Anyway I can talk english, it just sounds crappy due to my accent but if anyone want to team up on PS4 please say so!"

Battlefield,3d27af,RoadRunnerdn,3,Mon Jul 13 00:59:50 2015 UTC,It's extremely unnecessary. It does not fit battlefields army theme. It's extremely unnecessary.

However I think it'd be cool to put in some news clips and interviews plus 'footage' of the fighting in as an optional lore, perhaps accessible from the main menu just to flesh out the story and have the battles you fight have a real feeling/reason to it."

Battlefield,3cy1sm,absinthedoctor,11,Sat Jul 11 21:37:36 2015 UTC,There's a campaign?
Battlefield,3cy1sm,Calvinatorr,7,Sun Jul 12 01:30:44 2015 UTC,"They are extremely bad, linear, and boring campaigns. It's honestly a shame considering Bad Company (1 and 2) both had really fun and interesting semi-open campaigns."

Battlefield,3cy1sm,Sk0rdil_Wabramop,5,Sun Jul 12 19:05:09 2015 UTC,TIL people actually play the campaign
Battlefield,3cy1sm,ImTheReal_TuongLuKim,3,Sun Jul 12 04:20:02 2015 UTC,So wrong on many levels. SA IS in the bf3 timeline. PLR happens to gain power because of the coup during the earthquake.  China gets involved after north Korea got involved bf4 book..
Battlefield,3cy1sm,ImTheReal_TuongLuKim,2,Sun Jul 12 06:12:16 2015 UTC,"Again, as I said It is speculation. The DLC is called Second Assault right? Then that would mean that its a second conflict. I would like to say that it takes place two years after the original conflict as all the buildings are rebuilt, but if you check the metro in operation metro, there are clear signs of a conflict that took place, but not recently. I never read the book for battlefield 4 so im sorry. Thanks for the info BTW."

Battlefield,3cy1sm,NCH_PANTHER,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:03 2015 UTC,That creates a plothole really. How can a city rebuild it self after a conflict and a nuke blast in a couple of months?
Battlefield,3cy1sm,rainypixels,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:55:35 2015 UTC,Nukes vary in sizes. that was a tiny suitcase nuke. did you play battlefield 3? That case is small. The blast damage won't be as severe. Paris has also many buildings. That are not wooden. Which is why it doesn't look like hiroshima. You see the building where the nuke went off. Not that big. It killed 30000 people at the stock exchange weekend event and surrounding areas. It didn't level the city
Battlefield,3cy1sm,NCH_PANTHER,2,Sun Jul 12 22:24:05 2015 UTC,How is Jin Jie assassinated before the campaign of BF4?
Battlefield,3cy1sm,rainypixels,3,Sun Jul 12 04:00:38 2015 UTC,"They thought he was dead, thats why when you meet him and Hannah hes wounded and is then shot again."
Battlefield,3cy1sm,NCH_PANTHER,3,Sun Jul 12 06:03:56 2015 UTC,He survives though?
Battlefield,3cy1sm,N1cknamed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:09:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. In the last mission he tells all the Chinese soldiers that invade your ship to stop and that he's alive. The bad guy keeps attacking from his warship though.

Battlefield,3cy1sm,DmitryStrelnikov,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, if 2142 is really in the same timeline, then America will probably lose. Hard. Because in 2142 there is no america, only europe and asia. Or america lost in a different game at a later time, or they have isolated themselves from the war."
Battlefield,3cy1sm,HappyGangsta,2,Sun Jul 12 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the reason America is not involved in 2142, is because during an Ice Age most of North America get frozen but there are not enough nations in North America to create political tensions that could escalate to warfare. Compared to Europe and Asia where Northern regions freezing over would cause more problems as people flee South."
Battlefield,3cy1sm,DmitryStrelnikov,2,Sun Jul 12 09:30:35 2015 UTC,Except the fact it's stated to be in the 2030s in BF3...

Battlefield,3cy1sm,DmitryStrelnikov,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"Paris would be a strategic resource to France and its allies, not America specifically as is stated here. America doesn't own France, or Germany, or any of Europe for that matter."
Battlefield,3cy1sm,HappyGangsta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:30:49 2015 UTC,But they are allies and can be stationed there with a good stockpile of weaponry
Battlefield,3cy1sm,DmitryStrelnikov,2,Sun Jul 12 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the post was worded in such a way to indicate that the NATO countries were completely inactive in their own defense, or that their armies just up and left."
Battlefield,3cy1sm,Z0mb13S0ldier,2,Sun Jul 12 04:10:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe the NATO allies are fighting in the war, it's just that the battlefield games are focused on the U.S. perspective."

Battlefield,3cxjgy,Calestia,6,Sat Jul 11 23:09:20 2015 UTC,Good gunners have become such a rare thing in BF4 compared to BF3. Combination of repair torches being not as efficient / disables being not as deadly.

I didn't care about the characters in the BF3 campaign because there were too many and no development for either (also the jet mission was never really tied in, they led up to it, then just dropped it even if it was cool) in BF4 there are fewer members in the squad and again I don't care about any of them, I probably care more about the battlefield friends cameos characters than anyone who has an official name"

Battlefield,3ctnzr,wk_bsagw,5,Fri Jul 10 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"Only practice I'm afraid. I switched from 360 to PC about 5 years ago, and it took a month or two before I got used to the keyboard and mouse. But after that point, I became better with it than I ever was with a controller, so you just have to stick with it. The controller probably doesn't feel the same since you're used to aim assist.   The only other things I can suggest are some general things to make sure you aren't putting yourself at a disadvantage:    Set your FOV to about 90 (horizontal), so you can see more.  Make sure you have more than 60fps at all times, or your game play will suffer.  Make sure vsync is disabled to avoid massive input lag and allow higher frame rates.  Lower your sensitivity until aiming is easy (but slow), then gradually increase it over a few weeks until it's fast enough to turn quickly.    And if you have the money:    Make sure you have headphones that give good directional sounds, so you can tell the location of an enemy from sound alone.  Get a comfortable mouse with a fast response time.  Get a mechanical keyboard with switches that you feel comfortable using (usually red or brown for gaming)."

This is not a great tip in my opinion, i play at REALLY low sens and topping the scoreboards, just have a medium sized (++) mousepad and move your mouse quickly. If you have high sens you prolly overaim targets and get killed, even if you saw him first."
Battlefield,3ctnzr,turtlegiraffecat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"That's why you slowly increase it. I have pretty high sensitivity and have no problems aiming. At first you will over-aim at high sensitivity (hence why you start low). With practice you get very good at fine movements. Start low where your aim is comfortable, then bring it up gradually and you'll learn finer control, and you'll be comfortable at higher sensitivities. Stop increasing when you don't improve after ~1 week on the new sensitivity, drop back to the last one you did get good at, and stay there.   And then you have the advantage of lightning quick turns without large arm movements, which has saved me many times when I start getting shot in the back. At a lower sensitivity I would die before finishing the turn, but at high sensitivity I can snap round quick enough to give me a good chance at killing them first. I also have to option to lower the sensitivity instantly with a button on my mouse, but I rarely use it now since it's not needed."
Battlefield,3ctnzr,Zergonaplate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:32:55 2015 UTC,Thanks man! Great tips.  I have a killer mouse (steel series Sensei) and a great keyboard (ducky shine II w/blacks).

My favorite setup is the M240b with flir, suppressor, bipod.  In a defensive situation with 2 ammo boxes down you will never run out of smoke or ammo with near constant fire.    Another overlooked combo is putting a flir on a sniper rifle.  Obviously you can no longer engage at max range, but for counter sniping ops at less than 300m just toss smoke at your feet and stand out in the open to get the perfect shot.  If I am not mistaken the flir also does not have the annoying scope glint."

Battlefield,3ckyaa,durtysanch,11,Wed Jul 8 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"Going through changed my whole aspect of FPS. I was always on the whole CoD bandwagon, but this, this changed everything!

Battlefield,3ckyaa,5uspect,4,Wed Jul 8 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Except you don't fly the jet and the entire sequence boils down to a turret level, just like Thunder Road.  Why oh why couldn't they have kept the campaign open like the original Bad Company rather than a scripted corridor shooter."

Battlefield,3ckyaa,5uspect,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"Oh it was ages ago, right when it came out.   Of course I'm exaggerating, however the BF3 and 4 campaigns are rubbish, pretty, but rubbish. They're memorable only for extraordinarily pretty scenes like these followed by uninspired gameplay and bug ridden scripting. An average side quest in the Witcher 3 has a deeper story than both games combined.   Something's gotta change with these new BF games. DICE have been taking the franchise in increasingly frustrating directions with each release. They appear desperate to emulate the CoD formula and have damaged what makes a Battlefield game in the process."
Battlefield,3ckyaa,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,9,Sat Jul 11 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed, 100%.  I was big on Black Ops 2 prior to playing BF3.  I started playing online, and was getting wrecked - hard.  Totally different games, and ever since then I've felt like Battlefield is the perfect balance of military sim and playable FPS.  I picked up BF3 for PC and playing through it again brought back a lot of feels lol."

I still remember the first time I shot the m4a1 in the bf3 beta and being blown away. Dice does sound better than all. I love if when you're in a hallway or something and it changes the acoustics of the ambient gunshot sounds. The positional accuracy is also impeccable, at least with a proper dac and stero headphones. Whenever I kill a guy and his buddy screams ""man down"" I know exactly where he is. My only complaint is the lack of dampening through structure, but they are working on it. At least they fixed the footsteps :)"

Battlefield,3ckyaa,Wee_Mad_Arthur,5,Thu Jul 9 04:51:52 2015 UTC,Isn't it a little ironic that they're moving toward a COD type game rather than going more simulation?
Battlefield,3ckyaa,psyRhen,15,Thu Jul 9 16:58:03 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you mean Hardline and after the terrible reception it's been having I think it's safe to assume they won't go toward CoD type of games in the near future. At least no one in their right mind would.. So I suppose the next game would be more Battlefield-y to appease the franchise fans.
Battlefield,3ckyaa,Wee_Mad_Arthur,7,Wed Jul 8 21:05:15 2015 UTC,Didn't DICE say something along the lines of moving away from the fast-paced combat from BF3 and BF4 and more toward the slower tactical combat for BF5?  I may have been dreaming...
Battlefield,3ckyaa,5uspect,2,Wed Jul 8 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that. I might have missed it but all I could find in 5 minutes of research was that BF5 is going to be military themed like its predecessors and it's going to have ""More features. More extras. More destruction."". I really like the ""More destruction part."" but again, I don't know if they're going tactical or maintaining the fast-paced action."
Battlefield,3ckyaa,Gothic_Banana,4,Thu Jul 9 02:31:01 2015 UTC,Why? All you can do in this level is look around from the weapons seat and shoot spammy enemies. The level is entirely on rails just like so many turret sections in COD.
Battlefield,3ckyaa,Marioxorz,2,Thu Jul 9 08:44:40 2015 UTC,"Look at hardline'a failure, then look at what dice has done with BF4 recently. I'm quite positive it's going a different way."
Battlefield,3ckyaa,5uspect,2,Wed Jul 8 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"I agree the campaign is very linear, but I actually enjoy that kind of gameplay and story progress every once in a while. Maybe it's just me, but so many games seem to focus hard on being open-worlded and have diverse gameplay, which is great sometimes, but other times I just want to get carried through. I played the bf3 and bf4 campaigns not so much for the gameplay, but for the story and the beautiful visuals."
Battlefield,3ckyaa,Borborygme,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:44:57 2015 UTC,"It also wasn't very compelling. The story was naff, they even ripped the protagonist's name from COD. BF4 somehow managed to do even worse. Add to this the appalling scripting bugs.   At least BC didn't take itself so seriously."

They are still adding new content with a few new (some throw back) maps. Not sure if it is 1 or 2 more packs. Not all the map packs are utilized it is more so the select favorites, which the better servers run. If a server has any expansion map in the rotation you wouldnt be able to join said server even if it is on a vanilla map."

More weapons, assignments, maps, etc. Makes the game a heck of a lot more fun. IMO, the more content you have the more fun the game is.   The new map packs that are coming (Throwback, Night and I think there's one more) as well as the recent Gun Crate DLC are all going to be free and will download with Vanilla."
Battlefield,3cp4e9,FyzzyMetalhead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:58:46 2015 UTC,"Premium. There's still a sizable Premium playerbase, and the DLC maps are, in my opinion, a lot better in most instances than the vanilla maps. Mostly. Except for the China Rising maps, they suck."

It had a secret airport, that was not a flag and far away from the action but had planes there.  Another one I really liked was Inshallah Valley, specifically made for DC. Again, narrow valleys which make for good helo gameplay."
Battlefield,3cnlhu,ApparentlyNotAToucan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:13:55 2015 UTC,"Bad Company 2 had great maps.    My favorite was Harvest Day:  well evenly spread out points, sniping positions, GROUND ONLY.  there was a bunch of tanks and atv/jeeps to get you wherever and a beautiful fall farm atmosphere where by the end of it every bridge was destroyed and every barn was too.    there's something fun about being given a map by DICE where you didn't have to worry about a air attack at all and were given plenty of tanks.  I'm not even a tank guy and I loved it because tanks went from meh it's whatever to king of the battlefield and it was just a different dynamic that BF3 and BF4 failed to capture.  all the maps now are either COD style or ""Lets shove tons of vehicles in the game"".     the China Rising map Propaganda is ground only with tanks but the tanks are slowed by shit all over the map and they aren't that imposing of a force.     Harvest Day was the first BF I remember playing where tanks took center stage which was different and refreshing."

Battlefield,3chr7r,nmezib,16,Wed Jul 8 12:35:31 2015 UTC,"I want them to take the series back to its roots. No 3D spotting, health regeneration or pop-up squads. A commander that can actually play the game. Better squad management, and a voice codec that actually allows me to understand what the hell my squadmates are saying. No cheesy mechanics like IR, lock-on or jets with barely any room to fly. Certain vehicles should be able to pull more weight on the battlefield without being overpowered and disposable.  Functionally, the next game in the series should play like BF2. It should have one or two sizeable expansions instead half a dozen half-baked DLCs.  As others have pointed out, a return to WW2 would be great! I've been wanting to play a decent WW2 game with modern graphics.  Bonus points for:   Non-canned destruction More varied class roles, or more classes A Battlelog server browser that actually works right (or better yet, no Battlelog at all!)

Battlefield,3chr7r,PvsNP_ZA,2,Wed Jul 8 08:14:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And i have to admit, i'm fed up of seeing russia vs US vs china in modern fps games.  For example, why not consider the UN blue helmets? Why not consider other armies, like Medal of Honor Warfighter did?"
Battlefield,3chr7r,Mechanicalmind,3,Wed Jul 8 08:21:46 2015 UTC,"Several reasons for that I guess. Massive conflict between powerful countries is an interesting concept (although overused by now), there is some potential for such conflict IRL which adds to immersion, and the size of their armies allow the devs to pick and choose which of their equipment to include in the game.  I've heard it's also to avoid offending anyone. The Chinese government will ban the game anyway, and the Russians don't give a fuck what they're cast as, so these two countries are the best to use in a conflict scenario."

Battlefield,3chr7r,HobbieK,4,Thu Jul 9 07:02:01 2015 UTC,A buddy of mine had an idea of a themed story that covered all the wars starting with ww2 and goong through Afghanistan. Could be cool. Saddams oil fires. Jungles of Vietnam or ho chi Minh trail.  Normandy invasion. Berlin wall. Korean war. Cuban missile crisis
Battlefield,3chr7r,IWantThatInMyMouth,4,Wed Jul 8 04:15:58 2015 UTC,Definitely WW2 or Vietnam. By the time I started playing BFBC2 the Vietnam servers were empty
Battlefield,3chr7r,spartan7621,4,Wed Jul 8 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but I think a Battlefield game taking place in the Korean War would be pretty awesome. Since the war started not that many years after WW2, the pace of the combat as well as the weapons and vehicles used would be still on par, for the most part, with WW2 itself.  This would allow players to use tanks such as the M4A3 Sherman, as well as the Russian T-34-85. However, this would also allow for the use of vehicles that were more so developed following WW2 such as the Centurion tank and the M26 Pershing.  Another thing that they could do for vehicles is have players use some of the many different aircraft in that war such as the MiG-15, the F-86 Sabre, and the Gloster Meteor, which haven't received much attention in Battlefield games afaik. But then there's also the military helicopters used during the war that could be used such as the H-13 Sioux and the OH-23 Raven.  The campaign for the game could be pretty cool as well. UN forces took part in the Korean War, so the game could possibly follow a squad of UN soldiers as they fought their way through Korea. This could allow for a variety of different characters, personalities, weapons, and vehicles.  Overall I think it'd be pretty epic to make a game out of since it hasn't really been explored upon by any of the major fps game makers before, as well as it'd give players the opportunity to use some vehicles that they haven't been able to in the past.  It most likely won't happen though, unfortunately."

Battlefield,3chr7r,Hockman,3,Wed Jul 8 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"i think a door-to-door FPS would be pretty sweet, but going off of your idea, I can imagine a gamemode like this. Call it ""ambush"", give one side (insurgents) a minute or so to set up an ambush point on a main road in a map, then let the other side come up and be ambushed, then they have to get out and capture a point, or something like that.. The game mode could also just be no respawn and whichever side is knocked out first loses. I don't know, just some thoughts."

Battlefield,3cgds5,Habanero-Ranch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:03:54 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure, but I don't see a reason why it wouldn't. Hopefully in the near future."
Battlefield,3cgds5,New_Y0rker,0,Wed Jul 8 05:56:30 2015 UTC,"I would assume there is no hardcore mode in the CTE, right?"
Battlefield,3cgvv9,shark-bait,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, sniping copter pilots all day"
Battlefield,3cgvv9,tonydiamondmia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:44:39 2015 UTC,most people never look up that high so you can snipe all you want as long as you watch your shots and don't reveal your spot.
Battlefield,3cgrf7,MakinDessert,13,Tue Jul 7 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"BF is more focused on teamwork. Your abilities help everyone on your side perform better, not just yourself. Things like spotting and resupplying aren't nearly as exciting as stuff like Killstreaks.   I like this style of FPS more but I understand why it isn't as popular. Millions of people still play battlefield, people can like what they want."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Will_Im_Not,2,Tue Jul 7 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"CoD is definitely more accessible. I always compare it to jet skiing. You can have it easy and ride a sitdown (affectionately called a couch) or put in the time and effort to learn how to ride a standup. What that opens up is more control, more abilities, and more tricks you can do."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,sobedog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"Stand up jet ski? I haven't seen one in 15 years... Man those were fun, but exhausting on the legs."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,sobedog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:21:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kawasaki stopped making them a few years ago, Yamaha makes one, and there's a bunch of super expensive competitive ones still out there. But they are definitely few and far between"
Battlefield,3cgrf7,L4NGOS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"Took me a while to learn how to stand up, I remember being dragged holding on to the handlebars and my trunks slipping away.  Good times!"
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Splinter_Pizza,3,Wed Jul 8 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of your points, Battlefield is, as a concept, the penultimate shooter for me. One thing I'll say though is that I do not enjoy playing battlefield alone except in TDM, it is just too frustrating because to have an effect on the game you need teamwork as you said. This is probably also the reason why CoD is a bigger game than Battlefield, because CoD is easier to access and takes less effort and, I guess, is less frustrating a lot of the time. Lonewolfing in Battlefield is frustrating and it is only really when you play with a full squad and communicate and cooperate that you unlock the full potential of the game. Personally I hope they never ever dumb down Battlefield (further, one might argue) in an attempt to appeal to more casual fps players because then I don't know what I would play, Arma is no alternative (running simulator) and neither is CoD..."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,L4NGOS,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:29:00 2015 UTC,"Id agree, there has been a dumbing down of BF with BF4, and even more with BFH. But at least they leave in the ability to play as a team."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Samiambadatdoter,2,Tue Jul 7 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I do feel that some of the changes in BFH were good though. Like taking ammo from people's packs.  In BF4 I almost always try to find other people to coordinate w/. It's the only way to play the game correctly unless your pub stomping in a chopper or something.   The problem w/ playing alone is if the opposition is working together. You will get absolutely stomped where as in CoD one or two people can carry a team.   /u/L4NGOs SQUAD is a good alternative to BF and I assume if BF got dumbed down enough another shooter would take it's place quickly. I don't think dumbing down BF is a good idea(financially) considering EA has Titanfall to scratch that CoD itch.   EDIT: I'd also say that BF4 is less dumbed down than BF3. BF4 feels like the game BF3 should have been."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,turtlebro_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"Well if you are looking for a more permanent place to find people to play with (PC, Europe) you should check out gamewithpure.org or /r/pure (not too active these days)."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,03Titanium,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good point, I have way more hours logged in BF4 than BF3. I guess I just didn't realize that"
Battlefield,3cgrf7,PillowTalk420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:01:31 2015 UTC,The dumbing down started with Bad Company 1
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Moerkbak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"Whenever I'm on with no one else, I just hop in a chopper/jet/tank and do my own thing."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,tallball158,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:02:05 2015 UTC,Battlefield has multiple fronts. That's usually too many. You have to analyze what you're doing and think of what you should be doing to win. In COD you also do that but the maps are smaller and the grand scheme of the game is a lot smaller.
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Splinter_Pizza,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"I've been playing the BF games since 1942 (er... The game, not the actual year), and as the years go by, the complaints I often see about the game is how unlike BF2 the newer games are.  But, as someone who's played every single BF game, I don't see what the hell they're talking about, as it's felt pretty much the same in every iteration. Some small things here and there, some have a lack of certain features while others have added features; most of the time, they don't have a dramatic effect on the over-all game's feeling though.  I don't see them becoming any more or less casual than the original game. Though, I could understand if the biggest complaint was the lack of modding support like BF2 had. Server control in BF3, 4 and Hardline are not as robust as it was originally in BF2. Being able to control the stats/mechanics of the weapons for a higher level of competitiveness changes quite a bit in these games."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Splinter_Pizza,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:10:09 2015 UTC,"its harder to be good as a solo player, simple as that"
Battlefield,3cgrf7,centerflag982,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:18:55 2015 UTC,Well said sir. That sums up my fps experience as well. I find that BF is very challenging. Even after a few years I still struggle.
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Awesomedeer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"Edit: I realize battlefield is incredibly popular, but I just think it deserves more than CoD.   CoD is easier to play. You pick it up and you can start fragging people immediately. Not only that but their SP campaigns are actually decent. BF3 and 4's campaigns are garbage.   Not only that but CoD just has more content to explore. You get a robust coop mode in nearly every CoD game.  I'd rather play BF MP than CoD any day but for SP and CoOp I'd go w/ CoD.   CoD marketing is also MASSIVE compared to BF. The commercials they release are just ridiculous.   EDIT: BF is already huge but the poor launch of BF4 and Hardlines poor reception really put a dent in their credibility."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Splinter_Pizza,2,Tue Jul 7 20:25:36 2015 UTC,"I never thought about the content part of it... huh... yeah the zombies thing is a huge draw I'm sure. I guess it may jsut be that I like the multiplayer aspect of games so much more than anything else (campaign, co-op, etc.)."
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Splinter_Pizza,3,Tue Jul 7 20:27:42 2015 UTC,Yea BF's multiplayer is way more dynamic than CoDs. I find it much more thrilling.
Battlefield,3cgrf7,irishmountaingoat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"BF3 and 4's campaigns are garbage.   I've never really gotten this, honestly. I've never felt they were any better or worse than CoD's - both franchises have pretty generic/cliched plots"
Battlefield,3cgrf7,Poketz,2,Tue Jul 7 23:07:08 2015 UTC,EA pls go
Battlefield,3cii2u,RyEKT,3,Wed Jul 8 04:17:57 2015 UTC,"The most populated BF title is far and away BF4, which has a similar population on both PC and XBone (about 25-26K peak on a given day). There is still a sizable community for BF3 and BC2 on PC, however.  As for a realism mode, there is a hardcore game-mode which reduces everyone's health to 60 so it requires about 2-3~ less bullets to kill people, and also disables a few things like minimap and 3D spotting."
Battlefield,3cii2u,Samiambadatdoter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:06:01 2015 UTC,Does the hardcore game-mode have large player battles with vehicles or is it more of a small squad thing?
Battlefield,3cii2u,TheTypicalFox,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, hardcore is available for every gamemode I believe."
Battlefield,3cii2u,Phx86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"It's up to the server admin as the settings, you can run HC mode on any game type or even a mix of settings. However, is more common to see more infantry heavy maps in HC."
Battlefield,3ci2l1,Barca_messi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"You can check out the player base here, http://bf4stats.com the game is still played quite a bit and its definitely much much better than the last gen versions. I would do it!"
Battlefield,3ci2l1,Caraphernelia56,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"I just rebought BF4 for PS4 after having for PS3.  It's smoother and the explosions of every kind are better.  Also, the scale of it is bigger with more players.  Worth it."
Battlefield,3ci2l1,MusicMelt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:01:53 2015 UTC,"I was in the exact situation as you!  I'd recommened getting it on ps4 as its a lot of fun! However in saying this I think it is very dependent on where you live, for example I live in australia and will struggle to find specific game modes (domination and conquest small) on weekdays, however weekends have full servers. But if you keep this in mind, I'd highly recommend it"
Battlefield,3ci2l1,tjdub12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:07:32 2015 UTC,"I owned it for Xbox 360 and eventually got it for Xbox One. Not quite the same as Playstation obviously, but other than the nice graphical changes, I didn't find that there were less bugs or anything. It does still has a decent player base but if I were you, I'd maybe save my money."
Battlefield,3ci2l1,_Nocte_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:56:11 2015 UTC,Hardline in my humble opinion is terrible. Bf4 to me is a much better game. Hope that helps.
Battlefield,3cdmw4,ron975,4,Tue Jul 7 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Why do you guys need Steam overlay for Battlefield?  I've disabled the Origin overlay cuz it was annoying and took to much CPU power,isn't the Steam overlay basically the same but with your Steam friends?"
Battlefield,3cdmw4,DancingWithKiwis,3,Tue Jul 7 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, but Steam's is quite a bit more optimized. I've never noticed a performance hit using it while in game. I think the bigger benefit is not having to use Origin."
Battlefield,3cdmw4,philter,3,Tue Jul 7 14:10:53 2015 UTC,"I just need steam so that I can use in home streaming. My gaming desktop is hooked up to a big tv which I can't really use for gaming, so i stream to my laptop."
Battlefield,3cdmw4,mihirpatel14,3,Tue Jul 7 14:18:10 2015 UTC,But isn't the lag horrible?  I heard that it makes shooters impossible to play.
Battlefield,3cdmw4,DancingWithKiwis,3,Tue Jul 7 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"Nope, no lag. I set up an ethernet powerline connection so it's speedy. I've even tried over wifi and there's no lag."

Battlefield,3cdmw4,mihirpatel14,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"The bandwidth throughput isn't the issue really, it's the latency."
Battlefield,3cdmw4,KnifeFed,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"Friends, doesn't take up any extra resources at all.  Not that I noticed anyways.  Also, you can already use the Steam overlay by running Origin through Steam and launching your Origin games normally."
Battlefield,3cdmw4,Deakul,3,Tue Jul 7 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"Battlelogium basically runs Origin through Steam. It just also runs the browser along with it, so Steam hooks both Origin, Battlefield and Battlelog."
Battlefield,3cdmw4,DancingWithKiwis,2,Tue Jul 7 16:39:26 2015 UTC,Disabling Origin's overlay gave me about 5 FPS boost.
Battlefield,3cdmw4,ConsuelaSaysNoNo,0,Tue Jul 7 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"Because Steam > Origin, duhhhhh"
Battlefield,3cdmw4,a_posh_trophy,2,Tue Jul 7 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"if anyone had issues with the installer, it should be fixed now.

Battlefield,3cdmw4,a_posh_trophy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:13:13 2015 UTC,My issue is that it fails to remember my login credentials. And now I cannot uninstall because apparently 'the file list is not found'.
Battlefield,3cdmw4,mihirpatel14,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"You have to click login every time, its just the way Battlelog handles logins, there's no need to reenter your credentials. If you can't uninstall, just delete the Program Files/Battlelogium folder, the app is completely portable and doesn't set any registry entries. I'll look into the uninstaller again and see if I can fix that bug."
Battlefield,3cdmw4,a_posh_trophy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"It remembers my username, not my password. Annoying because I don't know it and I have to find it in Last Pass.

Battlefield,3cdmw4,DancingWithKiwis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"That odd, try clearing the cache, and ensure you have 'Remember Me' ticked. Battlelogium just wraps Chromium Embedded so it doesn't do anything special to save password information (nor would you want it to), so that's pretty odd. Edit: Add to Steam has been broken for a while"
