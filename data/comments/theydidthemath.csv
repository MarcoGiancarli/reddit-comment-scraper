theydidthemath,3dzcg3,gcanyon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:51:14 2015 UTC,"But a ship is just a big boat.  If you tell me otherwise, you're being nothing but a pedant."
theydidthemath,3dzcg3,gcanyon,6,Tue Jul 21 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"Rough estimate here. I'm going to assume the height of the cable-safety-fence-railing thing around the edge of the ship is 4 feet. It looks like it's about eight of those from the superstructure to the bow of the ship, so call that 30 feet. In the shot from above it looks like the bow is pretty fully covered, about to the depth of the railing. Further, the shape of the bow looks roughly 2/3 as wide as it is long from front to back. So that's a triangular prism roughly 30 feet tall with a base of 20 feet, and a thickness of 4 feet.  So that's about 20 * 30 * 4 / 2 = about 1200 cubic feet of water. A cubic foot of water weighs a bit over 60 pounds, so that's about 70,000 pounds of water.  The force is difficult/impossible to calculate: it happens over time, the film looks like slow motion at an undetermined speed, the ship is at an angle to the earth's gravity, and most importantly, the whole thing is CG so there's no guarantee that real physics was simulated in any way accurately. But ignoring all that, if we assume the impact takes about 1 second to start and .1 second to transfer the bulk of the force and just wing it:  The water travels 30 feet to reach the superstructure, and accelerates as it moves, so assume smooth acceleration to get an end speed of about 60 ft/s. [(60 + 0)/2 = 30 average] It hits, and in about 0.1 seconds let's say that it decelerates back to 20 ft/s overall, and the non-compressibility of the water allows it to transfer, let's say one-tenth, of that force to the superstructure. So that's 40 ft/s of velocity change over 0.1 seconds, so 400 ft/s2 of acceleration, * 70,000 pounds, multiplied by the 1/10th transfer factor, so call it 3 million pounds of force -- yes, I understand I'm being really loose with the term ""pound"" throughout this. Then if the superstructure is 16 feet wide and the water starts at a depth of 4 feet, we have about 60 feet of surface area. That's 60 * 144 = about 9000 square inches, so 3 million / 9 thousand = about 300 pounds per square inch. I just checked and that's about the pressure at 650 feet under water. It's only for a fraction of a second, so maybe that's survivable (for the ship)."

theydidthemath,3e3ln0,gee_iwonderwhy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"This answer is heavily dependent on where, exactly, we explore on the land. Some locales on Earth contain more animal life than others, and (spoiler) we haven't explored a whole lot of the ocean so the starting location matters a lot.  The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says that ""To date, we have explored less than five percent of the ocean.""  We'll assume that this means 5% of the surface area of the ocean has been explored.  Wolfram|Alpha says that Earth's oceans cover 131.6 million mi2 . To find how much we've explored:   0.05 * 131,600,000 mi2 = 6.58 million mi2   First we'll assume there's a linear relationship between land area explored and species discovered. As I said above that's not really true, but anything else means taking the physical starting location of exploration into account, which is (I think) a little out of scope for a reddit post.  Wolfram|Alpha says that land on Earth takes up 57.58 million mi2 . If we had explored 6.58 million mi2 of that, then we would have explored:   6,580,000 mi2 / 57,580,000 mi2 * 100% = 11.43%   11.43% of the total land area of the Earth would have been explored.  For species data we're going to use this site. I've checked out their source material, it's legit.  I'm going to include amphibians in our ""land animal"" count.  We want to include both vertebrate and invertebrate animals in our count, but discount Fishes, Mollusks, Crustaceans, and Corals. This gives us a total of:   5513 mammals + 10,425 birds + 10,038 reptiles + 7,302 amphibians + 1,000,000 insects + 102,248 spiders and scorpions + 68,827 others = 1,204,353 species of land animal   That's how many land animals we've discovered with 100% of our land area ""explored"" (we will no doubt discover many new land animals, but for the purposes of this answer we'll consider everything explored). If we apply the percentage:   0.1143 * 1,204,353 species of land animal = 137,658   If we had explored the same area of land as we have of the ocean, we would have discovered 137,658 of 1,204,353 land animals.  That's all well and good, but there's a different (easier) way to find an answer as well. We can just take 5% of the total land animal species:   0.05 * 1,204,353 species of land animal = 60,218   If we had explored the same percentage of land as we have of the ocean, we would have discovered 60,218 of 1,204,353 land animals.  Keep in mind that these results are assuming that land animals are evenly distributed on all land masses - which is not true at all. I don't know how to do it any other way, though, so here we are.  You've asked a very insightful question, and it really highlights how little we know about our oceans.  tl;dr: 140,000 of 1.2 million if comparing area, 60,000 of 1.2 million if comparing percentages"

(if a rail car can hold 31,800 gallons)  It costs .03 cents per ton per mile? apparently for a freight train.....   How 11 trillion gallons would be 88 trillion pounds if a gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.  Which is 44,000,000,000 tons.  It's about 2100 miles from wisconsin to cali by air, so lets just say 2500(I've tried to find train rail miles but I can't right now I'm trying to finish this before I get fired.  so .000344(billion)=132000002500=33,000,000,000 so about 33 BILLION dollars in shipping costs. (minus logistics/profit and stuff.  The average price for a gallon of water is 1.50/1000.  So lets just say, 11,000,000,000*1.50= 16,500,000,000.  So. The cost of water is 16.5 billion.  The cost of shipping from train is 33 Billion(assuming the train car doesn't need to come back and there are 300-400 million train car tankers in wisconsin)     And that's only 49.5 billion dollars.   Not much.  Lets say we need to get the cars back, so add another 15-20 Billion.  Cost of water would go up probably. add another 10 billion.  But that's still less than 100 billion.

theydidthemath,3e3tcd,Specktagon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to answer this in terms of lux, or lumens per meter2. Basically how much visible light is falling on a square meter at any given time.  Some preface and clarification: If the sun goes supernova, Earth will be destroyed. Not in the ""most of humanity dies out but we're fighters so we survive"" kind of way, but in the actual planet is entirely vaporized kind of way. Everyone and everything would be dead before we even knew what happened. Think of Earth as a bowling ball and the Sun as a nuclear bomb ten feet away. With that in mind, it doesn't really matter if it's midnight or not (the sun is putting out the same amount of light no matter what time of day it is, it's just that the other side of the planet is where that light is landing).  Surprisingly enough, there aren't a whole lot of academic sources on how many lux various celestial objects put out. This is somewhat disappointing, but we will soldier on. In lieu of actual data, I'll have to come up with some really close approximations myself. This Wikipedia page says that SN 1006 (yeah, scientists aren't the best at naming cool things), the brightest recorded supernova, was roughly one quarter as bright as the moon. It was about 7,200 lightiyears away.  This Wikipedia page says that a full moon on a clear night has a brightness of 0.25 lux.  One-quarter of that would be:   0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625   One light-year is equal to 9.461 * 1015 meters (also known as ""a really long way""). So to find the distance from SN 1006 to Earth:   7,200 light-years * 9.461 * 1015 meters/light-year = 6.812 * 1019 meters   SN 1006 was 6.812 * 1019 meters away.  Wolfram|Alpha helpfully says that Earth is 1.52 * 1011 meters away from our sun.  In math textbook word problem form: From a distance of 6.812 * 1019 meters, the supernova cast 0.0625 lumens of light onto one square meter of land here on Earth. How many lumens per square meter would the supernova have cast on earth if it were only 1.52 * 1011 meters away?  How to answer this? We're going to go use SCIENCE (well really physics, but that's science so it still counts).  In physics there's a type of equation called an ""inverse square law."" It's essentially a way to compare intensities of gravity, magnetic forces, light, sound, radiation, and electric waves at different distances.  The inverse square law is: Intensity1 / Intensity2 = Distance22 / Distance12  Luckily for us, we have three of those four unknowns so we can totally solve this equation.  Putting our known quantities [into the inverse square law:]()   0.0625 lux / x lux = (1.52 * 1011 meters)2 / (6.812 * 1019 meters)2 x = 2.00845 * 1017 lux   There's your technical answer. Roughly 2.00845 * 1017 lux of light. I know that doesn't really say a whole lot, but it's hard to have any comparison. This would be, by far, the brightest thing any human has ever seen. It would kill you just from the visible light, not counting the other kinds of radiation it'll be giving off.  2.00845 * 1017 lux of light averages out to roughly 8.12106 * 1014 Joules per meter2 on Earth's surface. Here's some Wolfram|Alpha comparisons of that energy. Keep in mind this is per second per square meter.  This is equivalent to 194,098 tons of TNT going off every square meter every second. This is equivalent to the energy released by this meteor impact every 12 meters every second. This is equivalent to having an entire, individual, full-blown hurricane packed into every square meter that is receiving this light."

The few are so much more that they could skew the average. I'm not saying this happened to your data, but that it certainly could.

theydidthemath,3e1skx,wabal,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:15 2015 UTC,"Now I had some fun figuring out a formula which would hold all different relationships at once:  Let's say there are 3 boys prepared to date boys. Thy are numbered A-C So there is AB AC and BC: 3 relations if you add a new guy D the only new relationships are DA DB and DC: 6 total. If you add another new guy E the only new relationships are AE BE CE and DE. 10 relationships. Start to see the pattern?  This is the triangular number sequence. The wiki gives n x (n+1)/2 but because our N needs 2 people for one relationship we need to substitute N with N-1 (it gives 1 for n=1 and 3 for n=2 but we want it to be 1 for n=2 and 3 for n=3). Result is n × (n-1)/2= the amount of unique relationships between n guys willing to date guys. Now this obviously also applies to girls so:  Total possible unique relationships= AxB + C(C-1)/2 + D(D-1)/2  Where A is guys willing to date girls, B is girls willing to date guys, C is girls willing to date girls and D is guys willing to date guys. Just substract any exceptions from your total anwser."

The run through with N=16 with 8 straight guys, 2 gay guys, 5 straight girls and 1 gay girl is obviously fine, possible unique relationships=41, less the cousins=40.  How about N=16 with 7 straight guys, 2 gay guys, 1 bi guy, 5 straight girls, 1 gay girl, 1 bi girl? So A=8, B=5, C=2, D=3. Note that A+B+C+D=18!=N=16. I got possible unique relationships as 44 in this case which seems about right, agreed it works?  Then just minus 1 due to the cousins to get 43 possible unique relationships."

theydidthemath,3dyjo2,QuariYune,12,Mon Jul 20 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"As you can see in that video, the water being poured from the kettle doesn't instantly freeze, only when it's thrown and the surface area of all the water increases dramatically does it freeze very quickly.  If the water was poured from a bucket/pot I believe that it wouldn't instantly freeze as it would if thrown or run through a shower head."
theydidthemath,3dyjo2,KizzieMage,4,Mon Jul 20 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"Well I was only answering the original question which assumes the water is separated into individual droplets which means the surface area is at its maximum and it would freeze instantly like the video.     so you can assume the water is separated into individual droplets so it doesn't insulate itself.      But assuming instead of individual droplets, you tried to keep the stream as ""intact"" as possible, then it would be impossible to tell unless more conditions were specified (Such as how big/small/thick/thin the stream is, which isn't constant either). And I don't think it would matter much, as you can see here (at 0:36) he throws a huge pot of water and despite the water not ""separating"" into small droplets initially, it still freezes pretty much instantly as soon as it leaves the pot.      So realistically, there are too many variables to accurately determine how far away the water has to be dropped from in order to get an accurate temperature like 43 Celsius, since most of the variables unlisted in the OP can drastically change such a short distance.     Edit: Also to address the water not freezing from the kettle (at 0:30), he is pouring it with a very thick, short, and uninterrupted stream. The hot water is barely in contact with the cold air and as soon as it enters the cup, it insulates itself from the air. That prevents the water from freezing instantly like we see when the water is not being caught."

No where in the original question does it state anything that would make you assume that the water is being separated into individual droplets.   The pouring of a pot would initially create droplets at the bottom of the stream where air resistance separates the water. But the stream that would follow would be subjected to between -10 and -30 degrees Celsius (The average temperatures at coastal stations in the winter)."

theydidthemath,3dzdw2,Au_Struck_Geologist,6,Mon Jul 20 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"You mention the distance people are from their phones so I guess you want an answer that goes all out, huh. OK.  The speed of sound changes based on the temperature of the air the sound is traveling through. Room temperature is generally accepted to be 21° C. The equation for finding the speed of sound in air is:   V = 331 m/s + 0.6 m/s/C * T   where V is the speed of sound and T is the temperature. Thus, the equation for the speed of sound at 21° C is:   V = 331 m/s + 0.6 m/s/C * 21 C   which is equal to 343.6 m/s.  To find how much time it would take for sound to travel one foot at 343.6 m/s we first convert one foot to one meter:   1 foot = 0.3048 meters   Then we find how long it takes:   0.3048 m / 343.6 m/s = 8.871 * 10-4 seconds   To find the total amount of time it will take for the speech to get from person to the other, we need to take into account the two feet of room-temperature air (one foot for each person) and the latency of the cellular network from NYC to LA. The latency is variable, and probably is a bit higher when the network is under a lot of load. It probably doesn't change a ton, though, so we'll just take the latency as it is right now. This AT&T page says that, at the time of me typing this, there is 67 milliseconds of latency between New York City and Los Angeles. That means it will take 67 milliseconds for your speech to go through the network. 67 milliseconds is equal to 0.067 seconds.  To find the total time:   2 * 8.871 * 10-4 seconds + 0.067 seconds = 0.06877 seconds   So it would take 0.06877 seconds for the information to leave your mouth, travel one foot at room temperature into your phone, travel across the United States through the network, and travel another foot to the ears of whomever you're talking to.  ------------------  That said, there are some things I didn't take into account. For example, it'll take a little bit (a very very small amount of time) for the phone to translate the analogue sound waves into digital bytes and move that information to the antennae when the sound comes into its recorder, and the other person's phone will take a little bit to move the information from the recorder to the speaker. Additionally, the other person will need a few milliseconds to process what's being said, but that depends on your definition of ""sharing information."" Overall, I think the above is a good example of the kind of timings you can expect.  EDIT: Your post also talks about average speeds and how the speed of sound affects it, so I'll add some of that, too.  The distance from NYC to LA is 3935.55 kilometers.  That distance is traveled over the network in 0.067 seconds. Including the sound waves, the trip took 0.06877 seconds.  Finding the average speed without the sound waves gives us a speed of:   3935.55 km / 0.067 s = 5.87 * 107 m/s   Finding the average speed including the sound waves gives us a speed of:   3935.55 km / 0.06877 s = 5.7228 * 107 m/s   That doesn't look like much, but it's actually a difference of 1.572 * 106 m/s, which could be read aloud as ""just over one and a half million meters per second.""  So the addition of two feet of space brings down the average speed by 1,572,000 m/s, or 2.712%."
theydidthemath,3dzdw2,h3half,2,Mon Jul 20 20:06:51 2015 UTC,"✓  Thank you, this is what I was looking for. So given that the distance between NY and LA is roughly 3,940 km, the time you calculated gives a speed of 57,670 km/s, which is 0.192 c.  So the 2 foot of talking slows the whole transfer down to less than 20% of C."

For 24,000 miles, that's 1200 gallons. With a 1% efficiency loss, it's an extra 12 gallons a year.

theydidthemath,3dy75a,h3half,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"One important thing to note: The legend was written during the Three Kingdoms period, roughly from 220AD to 280AD. From what I can tell, sadly using Wikipedia as a resource, the calendar that would have been used during this time is probably the Grand Inception Calendar, or ""Taichu"" (or sometimes ""Tai Chu"").  Sources for this claim: This page about Chinese calendars which says the late Han dynasty used the Taichu calendar, and also gives a length of each year in that calendar, and this page showing that the Han dynasty lasted until the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history.  So let's find the number of days Pangu pushed the sky:   18,000 years * (562120 / 1539) days/year = 6.575 * 106 days   Note: The Taichu calendar defined a year as 365 + 385/1539 days. 562120/1539 is the improper fraction form of that.  Each day:     The sky grew ten feet higher The earth grew ten feet thcker Pangu grew ten feet taller   We'll assume that the sky started at a height of zero, since the legend goes that Pangu separated the sky from the Earth with his sword. Swords are less than one foot thick so we'll just round down to zero (the numbers will be so big that one foot will hardly matter anyway).  Getting a starting size for the Earth is much trickier: the legend really doesn't mention that at all. I'll pretend it was zero as well, and we can go back to this and reflect after we have our final answer. We will assume that the Earth becoming ""thicker"" means the diameter increasing.  This means that both the sky and Pangu grew by a height of, and the Earth a thickness of:   6.575 * 106 days * 10 feet/day = 6.575 * 107 feet   Pangu and the sky would, naturally, be roughly the same height since he's holding up the sky with his arms. I suppose Pangu would technically be shorter, unless he was also lifting with his head, but we have no way of knowing how tall Pangu started out as (""giant"" is a pretty nebulous term) so we'll say they're the same.  This gives the sky and Pangu a height of 6.575 * 107 feet, which is just under 12,500 miles, just over 20,000 kilometers, roughly twice as ""tall"" as the Earth itself, and, as Wolfram|Alpha fittingly points out, is 95% the length of the Great Wall of China.  Back to the diameter of the Earth. It also grew by 6.557 * 107 feet, but, unfortunately, that's larger than the Earth actually is today. Wolfram|Alpha helpfully points out that the diameter of the Earth at the Equator (where the diameter will be largest) is a mere 4.185 * 107 feet. This makes the finished Earth in the legend 44.16% larger than the real Earth.  tl;dr: Pangu and the sky were 20,000km tall, the earth was 44% larger than it actually is"

According to Wikipedia there are variously reported statistics for self-identified sexual orientation across countries and even generations. The issue with many of these surveys are that people have to say what they believe they are, which is difficult for many to do honestly. Culture stigmas could force people to believe they aren't what they're born to be. For example, there is a video clip from a Louis Theroux documentary of a lesbian who was 'saved' by a church and claims to no longer be a lesbian. It is a powerful clip, but I don't want to link to is as it's copy righted. (just google ""Louis Theroux meets lesbian saved by Jesus"", skip ahead a minute or so in the 2:38 min clip)  But let's try tackle some rough estimates. Let's used the UK, a pretty open country. This would help us assume that perhaps the same numbers hold for the rest of the world but simply can't be reported as such. Here are the statistics for the UK population:    1.1%  identified themselves as Gay or Lesbian. 0.4% identified themselves as Bisexual. 0.3% identified themselves as ""Other"". 3.6% stated ""Don't know"" or refused to answer the question. 0.6% of respondents provided ""No response"" to the question. 2.7% of 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK identified themselves as Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual compared with 0.4 per cent of 65-year-olds and over.   There is a conflicting issue with the statistics, particularly the first and last. The 2.7% of 16-24-year old stat doesn't immediately  add up to the 1.1% of gay or lesbian and 0.4% of bisexual. An obvious issue is simply how large those age groups are. However, because of cultural issues across age groups, this 2.7% stat is probably more accurate. Another issue is that this Wikipedia page shows different numbers for the US. Namely, 3% gay and 4% bisexual.   We will use that 2.7% stat for gay/lesbian/bisexual. Further, we will assume that being gay is not more prominent in one gender than in another. Though if anyone has any stats to show that this is not the case I'll gladly update my answer.   The world has 7,000,000,000 people. The Natural Ration in 2002 is roughly 1.06 males/females. So, if we take all males, excluding the ""non-respondents"", ""don't knows"", and ""others"" we get that 100%-0.3%-3.6%-0.6% = 95.5% of males are attracted to females. Swapping this around, 2.7% of females are attracted to females.   Ultimately we get 7,000,000,000x((0.955x1.06/2.06) males + (0.027x1/2.06) females) = 7,000,000,000x(0.4914 + 0.013) = 3,530,800,000 people are attracted to females.   On the other hand, 7,000,000,000x((0.027x1.06/2.06) males + (0.955x1/2.06) females) = 7,000,000,000x(0.014 + 0.4636) = 3,343,200,000 people are attracted to males.   What the numbers in the equations mean is that 49.14% of the population are males who are attracted to females, 1.3% of the population are females attracted to females, 1.4% of the population are males attracted to males, and finally 46.36% of the population consists of females attracted to males. Note that 49.34+46.36+1.3+1.4 = 98.4%. There are several reasons why this doesn't add up to 100%. First, we subtracted away all answers on the survey that were of no use to us. This was 4.5% of the population. Second, there is round off error.  Edit: typos, grammar, etc."
theydidthemath,3dy96w,tommypr,8,Mon Jul 20 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"If we take the consideration that coal is made of 100% Carbon then the sun would produce considerably less energy than it currently does.   [quick explanation to why] The way the sun works is by fusing two hydrogen atoms into a helium atom and releasing energy in the process. Right now the sun is comprised mostly of Hydrogen (74.9% of the sun's mass) and Helium (23.8% of the sun's mass) and a few heavier elements (1.5%). The sun produces its energy by fusing the two Hydrogen atoms into helium, then two Helium atoms to Lithium, and as the sun ages it's mass becomes >[removed greater] >>lesser and >[Removed greater] >>lesser than what it currently is; and because an objects potential energy is (simplified) it's mass multiplied by the speed of light squared. So as the mass increases exponentially the energy output has a linear effect. As a side note this process will continue until the sun reaches Iron which can no longer be fused together; and the sun will no longer be able to hold its original size becoming a red giant to accommodate the added mass with less energy output  Now to answer your question right now the sun puts off around 1.055 * 1023 kW of energy every second. If you were to replace all the matter in the sun with Carbon (ensuring that it doesn't go unstable and explode by making the proper energy and size adjustments) then you would find that it would produce around 1.794 * 1017 kW of energy every second.  But of course if that were to occur the sun would already begin entering it's subgiant phases which would turn the Earth's surface temperature hotter than that of Venus's."

Reasoning:    Anything radio (besides BLE) is going to be a huge power draw.  Wifi is more power than Bluetooth, AND more likely to involve expensive CPU-based recompression as the protocols are more complex (e.g. ChromeCast or AirPlay).  The internal speaker is putting out far more power (in terms of sound pressure waves) than headphones and thus likely draws more power.  Headphones and line-out will be similar power, as their load specs are similar (100 ohm usually)  Finally where exactly USB audio out fits in (for example playback to some cars over USB) depends on nuances of the phones audio decode hardware and how closely tied to the analog-to-digital it is.  Most likely it's going to wind up similar to line out, with similar signaling termination loss, saving a bit of power skipping A to D, but spending more on CPU overhead."

Lastly, assume we are just going for a single harvest.   According to the USDA, long grain, brown, cooked rice has 111 calories for each 100 grams. So each day, for each person, we need roughly 1801.8 grams of rice. Which means we need 1801.8x365 = 657657.7 grams per person. Again, according to google the earth has about 7 billion people. So we need, roughly, 4.6x1014 grams of rice.   According to this website, Sri Lanka gets yields of around 3000 kg per hectare.   This means, that we need 4.6x1014 (grams)/3,000,000 (grams/hectare) = 4.6/3 x108 hectares of land. Or roughly speaking, a little over 1.5x108, ie 150,000,000 hectares. Sri Lanka apparently has 1,200,000 hectares of arable land. Clearly we're going to need a bigger country.   Let's go next door to India. According to this site India has 157,350,000 hectares of land!

theydidthemath,3dwg72,neilson241,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"Related Straight Dope thread.  Not much math that I see, but it looks like you could easily pack a few thousand joules of kinetic energy on the balloon.  That's enough to be rather dangerous, even if it is just water- we are talking martial arts level impact here.  A bucket full would less dangerous, as it is unlikely to focus the energy as much."
theydidthemath,3dwg72,sebwiers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Let's assume you're dropping a 6 inch (15.24 cm) spherical water balloon.  Its volume is 1853 cm3, its surface area is 729.7 cm2 and its mass is 1.85 kg.  28 stories is a maximum height of 85.34 meters.  The density of air is 1.275 kg/m3.   The projected area of the balloon is 182.415 cm2.  The drag coefficient of a sphere is 0.409.  Knowing all this, we can calculate that the water balloon will have a final velocity of 37 m/s and final acceleration of 0.647 g (6.345 m/s2).  That's a force of 11.74 N.  For comparison, a mass of 1 kg exerts a force of 9.81 N down on Earth's surface.  So the short answer is no, it wouldn't be dangerous."
theydidthemath,3dwg72,nullvader,3,Mon Jul 20 07:47:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think the final acceleration is relevant, the force on the head is equivalent with the deceleration from its final speed."

By ""final acceleration"" I think you mean ""average acceleration"".   That's a force of 11.74 N.   Wat?  If something traveling 37m/s, how hard it hits you depends on how quickly your body stops it, and how much energy it transfers into you vs absorbs by deforming.  Not on how quickly it was accelerated in the first place (which is totally irrelevant).  1.8 kilos of water at 37m/s has a lot of momentum, and it would transfer that to a human target fairly well.  If it hit the top of your head you'd get knocked flat on your ass, maybe have a broken neck and very likely a concussion."

How much force is needed to get the water in a 6 inch balloon traveling at X speed to come to a halt in 6 inches (the diameter of the balloon)?  That's roughly the amount of force the impact will cause.

theydidthemath,3dw7g2,Taconut,5,Mon Jul 20 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"tl;dr 21 llamas  If we gut this bus of all the chairs, we have 430""x90"" to work with (roughly 35 by 7 feet). I'm not going to worry about height because I've decided that stacking llamas on top of one another would be animal cruelty.  A llama can be roughly 5 feet long, and let's go ahead and assume that they are 2 feet in width on average, but that would certainly vary depending how fat these llamas are.  We can maximize the number of llamas if we face them longways in the bus because we'd be able to get 7 rows of 3 llamas.  That's 21 relatively obese, unstacked llamas in an ordinary chairless school bus. No llamas or school buses were harmed in the making of this calculation."
theydidthemath,3dw7g2,dommitor,3,Mon Jul 20 04:46:50 2015 UTC,"Good calculations, but mathematics is not about animal safety - I wonder how many animals would fit stacked? Still not llama purée, but comfortably stacked?...  I've done calculations (I converted to Metric because I'm Australian)   Bus: 1,092cm x 228cm x (assuming height is 2 metres, it's approximately that on our buses) 200cm = 49,795,200cm3  Dimensions of a non-squashed llama: 152cm (h) x 60cm (width) 121.92cm (length) = 1,111,910cm3  ie. approx 48-49 llamas can be stacked without being squashed."

I.e. 1.32trillion / value of modal note = number of notes  Notes: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, 10000 modal note: say, $20 as it's also the median  $1.32tr / $20 = 66 million notes  Cost of printing/sealing an Australian note: 34c AUD  34c AUD = 25c USD (currently)  66 million notes * 25c = $16.5 million for all the notes.  To me, that seems like very little.... This could have something to do with the median note I chose. Here are calculations for choosing other modal notes.  Modal note: $10  1.32x109 / $10 = 132 mil  132mil x 25c = $33 million  Modal note: $5  1.32x109 / $5 = 264 mil  265 mil x 25c = $66 million  These are also quite little for such a drastic change.

You paid back two pounds total: one to Mom, one to Dad. You owe 49 to each, for a grand total of 100 pounds either repaid or left too repay.  The one pound you keep is not a debt incurred or repaid, and so can't be counted with the other debts."
theydidthemath,3dvufq,Rocket_stuff,8,Sun Jul 19 23:35:46 2015 UTC,"You now owe [mom] 49 and dad 49   Up to and including that, all is well.     so 49+49 = 98   That was the switch.  49 owed to mom plus 49 owed to dad is 98 owed in total.     and your 1 makes 99   Or maybe that was the switch.  You can't add 1 held to 98 owed.  It doesn't mean anything.    Basically, instead of adding your 1, you need to subtract it, which makes that magic 98 sum turn into 97 instead of 99.  (Think of that as paying the 1 back to dad or mom.)  That leaves the debt sum (now 97) equal to the price of the shirt, clearly accounting for all the money.  As for ""dealing with"" these posts, I tried explaining it to this teenage girl once, and it was like explaining how to use a microwave to a dog.  It should have worked, though.  I tracked each lump of money through each step of the story.  There's four locations: Store, You, Mom, and Dad.      event Store You Mom Dad    start 0 0 50 50   borrow 0 100 0 0   buy 97 3 0 0   partial repayment 97 1 1 1    This clearly shows no money is missing; so, it shows that the problem is not in the scenario, meaning the problem must be in the presentation."

Then your total debt is £80, and you have £10.  If you only gave back £5 each, your total debt would be £90 and you would have £20.  If you gave back £1 each, your total debt is £98 and you have 28.  It's pretty clear that the debt and your money shouldn't be additive, but that you always have the difference between what you owe your parents and the price of the thing you bought -- which is the case whether you gave them change or not."

theydidthemath,3dqtwl,ikeisco,10,Sat Jul 18 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"As a chemist, I agree with that.  Our most accurate volume measuring apparatuses have a set volume they can measure.  Like,a 250 cm3 flask, You simply fill it with liquid until the meniskus(dunno English word, Hungarian chemist. Basically, the bottom of the parabola that water makes in a thin tube) reaches the line marking 250 cm3.  Even (very accurate, there ARE graduated ones too)pipettes work like that. They have 2 lines. You fill it with liquid so it reaches to the top line, then when ejecting the fluid, you watch for the bottom line and stop, leaving some liquid at the bottom which you empty in a collecting dish.  As a matter of fact, by exploiting liquids and container volume, we can ignore volume when calculating density!  Using a small, 25-50 cm3 piknometre (like a tiny flask), which we fill to the brim/line (depending on liquid), we...  Measure the mass of the dry AND clean piknometre  m(dry) Measure the mass of the piknometre filled with water  m(water) Measure the mass of the piknometre filled with the unknown liquid. m(Unk) Measure the temperature of the water we used. Using the temperature of the water, find the allotted density. Rho(water)    Use Analytical scale for the purpose, the container has a stopper so evaporation won't change values. Keep all 4 decimal values.  Then use the following formula to determine the density of the unknown liquid:  Rho(Unk) = {[m(unk) - m(dry)] / [m(water) - m(dry)]} * Rho(water)"

theydidthemath,3dqtwl,Hoihe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:40:32 2015 UTC,The problem with cooking and volume measurements is that not all ingredients are liquid and must of them are easily compressed - which then changes the amount of ingredient used.   For example flour - 1 cup of flour can have a lot of margin depending if i scoop it from a large package or pour it into a cup measure.   If you shake it a bit - it will settle and one cup might become 1.1 cups - if the recipe calls for 100g flour it will always be 100g flour - there is just less possibility of making mistakes with SI units in cooking.   And yes - a difference of 10% or more can make a huge difference

While the geocentric velocity isn't mentioned in the link, we can estimate it to be around 14 km/s (it's 13.79 km/s relative to Pluto, and Earth is currently relatively perpendicular in its revolutionary motion). It will slow down to about 13 km/s as it exits the solar system. Using 13 km/s will give an upper bound.  The resulting calculation yields about 1.14 billion seconds, or roughly 36 years.  Sanity check: New Horizons will encounter the heliopause in 2047 (Source), which Voyager 1 did in 2012. The difference is 35 years. New Horizons being slower, the ""catch-up time"" will likely rise to 36 years."

theydidthemath,3dqunz,TommyK154,7,Sat Jul 18 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry if inappropriate, anecdotal not math answer but,  On a 9-ball rack I have sunk 7 balls on more than one occasion. I have most definitely had plenty of breaks myself, and witnessed even more that had all 9 balls end up over at the other half of the table. So for a 9-ball rack I would say it is certainly possible to sink all the balls, although it would be extremely rare.  8-ball racks have an additional ~7~ -edit, 6 of course ! balls, hence would need quite a bit more energy to make all the balls travel enough distance to reach a pocket. Not only that, I'm guessing there would be an additional factor of the complexity of the pattern with so many balls rolling around. Perhaps even some more energy lost with all the collisions going on.  Rough estimation, hitting the white ball on an empty table, flat out at a certain angle, some guys can get it to go around approximately 3 times. Assuming you could whack it a bit harder on a full rack without the cue ball flying out, but probably not that much more, I'd say the most energy you could probably get on a ball (using a cue and a legal hit) is about 7 or 8 table lengths.  Assuming perfect transfer of energy, this is about 70 feet of travelled distance which would equate to 70 / 9 = ~7.5 feet / ball on a 9 ball rack and 70 / 15 = ~4.6 feet / ball for an 8-ball rack. Since the width of the table is 4.5 feet, I'd say it is impossible to sink all balls on an 8-ball rack by quite a bit. Perhaps someone with more time, and or mathematical skills can elaborate.  If not using a proper rack, but get to set up the balls, trick shot style, the most I have ever seen anybody make is Earl Strickland. He used to do a 14-ball shot, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNZpbolTaM as you can see he does not shoot it that hard, but that is possible because over half the balls are already laying in the pocket's mouth."

On the other hand, speed / energy wise it seems to me that it would definitely still be possible on a 9-ball rack, under ideal conditions."

theydidthemath,3dqunz,JannaIsFreelo,3,Sun Jul 19 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"I think theoretically all that is necessary for this to be possible is that the momentum of the cue ball has to be sufficient to give enough momentum to all the other balls to get them to a hole. The fastest breaks are in the 30 mph range  with a weight of ~170g so a momentum of 2.279904 m kg / s. In 8-ball, there are 15 balls, so each would have an initial momentum of 0.1519936 m kg / s or an initial velocity of 0.89408 m / s assuming perfectly elastic collisions. The rolling resistance force is given by F = c m g, where c is the coefficient of rolling resistance (we'll say it's .01), g is gravity, and m is mass, so F = .01 * 170g * 9.80665 m/s2 = 0.016671305 Newtons.   Now we want to find the distance traveled, which is given by the formula d = v2 / 2 a, where v is initial velocity, and acceleration a is F / m. So d = 4.0757 meters. A tournament pool table is typically 9 ft (2.743 meters) long, so all the balls could travel the length of the table at least once, which means there should definitely be enough energy to get all the balls to a hole.  This is neglecting energy lost in the collisions, initial slipping resistance, and a bunch of angular shit probably, but I think there's enough headroom in the estimate that it doesn't matter."
theydidthemath,3dqunz,xanados,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think you are underestimating the rolling friction and other loss quite a bit.. based on my experience in how far you can get a white ball to roll on an empty table.  I couldn't help but also do a bit more calculation on this which goes like this: Width of the table is 4.5 feet, so the spot (position of the rack) is 2.25 feet from the side and bottom rails. Assuming 8-ball on the spot (although most rules play the top ball of the rack on the spot) the distance to the center pockets and bottom corner pockets is sqrt(2.252 + 2.252) = ~3.2 feet. The distance to the two corner pockets at the top end is ~ 7.2 feet (I have rounded up as the balls have to actually roll into the pockets).  So for an 8-ball rack, if all balls were to run towards any of the 4 closest pockets there is a total distance of 15 * 3.2 = 48 feet to be travelled. But this would be totally unrealistic as over half of the balls would hit at least one rail and therefore travel a bit further. going to any of those 4 nearby pockets via 1 rail is a distance of 7.2 feet, same as to the two far pockets. So let's say timing wise, you would be able to send 4 balls directly into the 4 near pockets, the rest would have to travel either to a far pocket or via a rail. Minimum distance travelled in total would become (4 * 3.2) + (11 *7.2) = 92 feet of travel.  Comparing to my earlier estimation of being able to give the cueball enough speed to travel about 70 or so feet, I'd say it is quite impossible indeed to even get enough energy into the rack to sink all the balls."

First off, Antartica's population varies from 5,000 in the summer months down to 1,000 in the winter.[1][2] Based on the information available on the US Army McMurdo base, the scientist population will peak in the summer months at around 1,000, and the service staff population remains year round, at roughly 250.[3] So from this we can roughly estimate a 3:1 ratio of scientist to service staff for the semi-permanent population of Antartica.  In addition, however, tourists turn up to the Antarctic. For the ill-defined 2014/15 season, a total of 27,243 tourists landed on the continent. (Note, this excludes people on fly-bys or cruises who didn't actually set foot on Antartica.)[4]Looking at the expedition records, the average length of visit seems to be roughly 2 weeks[5], so we can assume that at any given time there will be roughly (27,243/26) or ≈ 1,050 tourists present at any given time.  So, for maximum IQ reduction, we should try for summer time, as the average continental IQ will be higher due to all the scientists being resident during these 6 months (This being roughly November-April for our purposes). [2] Ideally we want, the least amount of tourists, as I'm assuming average IQ for these.  IQ by profession is a bit trickier, as the most widely cited study is this[6], which studied a sample size of 30 men and 30 women, all from Wisconsin. Also, found on a blog[7], is a test done by 10-word vocabulary tests, which seems subjective, but that was the best I could come up with. From that, we're going to assume an average IQ of 115 (figure 12[8] of aforementioned study) for the scientist population, 100 for the service staff (based on the electrician value from the previous link) and 100 again[8] for the tourists.  The average IQ of all the IQ scores would be something like:  [(3375 * 115) + (1125 * 100)+(1050 * 100)] /5550 = Average IQ of 109.121621622. .

You have the average distance walked in miles per hour, and you convert that down to meters per second. That's kind of an awkward conversion considering you're only using two significant digits and you're doing a miles/meters units conversion and changing the rate to 1/3600th the amount of time in the same process.   My recommendation would be to use the moon's distance in miles, which is a known quantity of 225,804 miles. That's 72,840 hours to get there, 3,035 days, or about 8.3 years. You had 8.1, so your unit and time conversions cost you 0.2 years, or a 2.4% margin of error."

theydidthemath,3dpcei,snethx,3,Sat Jul 18 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"when i took first year calculus at university, i struggled with these kinds of things (which are called combinatorics ).   what helped me was this: take for instance the numbers 1,2,3,4. now start to order them and find out how many unique ways there are to order them without any number re-occurring. we of course start with 1234, then fix the first number: 1243, 1324, 1342, 1423, 1432 - 6 possibilities. you can repeat this 3 more times (starting with a different number and do the same thing). 4*6 = 24 = 4! possibilities. you can do that with 5,6 or more numbers, but the possibilities become much larger with every number.   so now it is not yet obvious how this 4! came about, we just verified that it's really 24 possibilites. another approach is: for the first digit you have 4 possibilities to choose a number, then for the next step you have one less to choose from, so 4-1 = 3, for the next one 4-2=2 and for the last one 4-3 = 1. when we multiply them together we get 4 * 3 * 2 * 1=4!=24 possibilities.   bonus: there is a link between this and the binomial coefficients (n over k), because they give you the number of possible sub-sets of numbers. for small numbers you can do the counting by hand to understand the concept. for instance (5 over 3) is the number of building a series of three number when you have 5 to choose from (it's 10).   if we start with 12345, we can take the first 3: 123, for those we have 3! possibilities to arrange them and for each of these we have 2! possibilities to arrange 4 and 5 --> 3! * 2!. since we have 5! possibilities to choose from we have to take all the possibilities (5!) divided by the possibilities to arrange them. this gives 5!/(2! * 3!). or generally: if you have n numbers ans want to build a subset of k numbers you have n!/(k! * (n-k)!) = (n over k)  hope that helps.   edit: format"

theydidthemath,3dqvkk,hank01dually,2,Sat Jul 18 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"In case someone attempts a frame-by-frame analysis, be warned that the clip suffers from something called temporal aliasing. This technically makes the answer indeterminable. However, by accounting for that, we can get a lower bound value that would be very likely correct.  I will do that a few hours from now. Sorry for not having math yet.  EDIT - The speed can be estimated with a frame-by-frame analysis. Bad news - while the playback is at 30fps, it seems the video was recorded at 15 or 16 fps. It'll hurt our accuracy a bit. The blades undergo two complete rotations in about 0.84 seconds (3.02 to 3.86 sec in the video), or 2.38 revs/sec. That is an angular speed of about 14.95 radians per second. Seeing as the framerate limits our accuracy anyway, we can round that to 15.  The force/energy is a lot trickier - there isn't a straightforward expression in accident analysis. Also, there isn't much information about wind turbine blade weights. The Hornslet wind turbine's rotors were 43m in diameter (mentioned on Wikipedia) - a length of 21.5m each. This link mentions blades about twice as long weighing 40 tons. The subreddit favorite 'cubing method' of weight estimation won't work, though - cross sections don't vary as much as length. Other links I've found are much too recent and use weight reduction technologies not in use in the 1990s. A regression fit using the power generation suggests that the ratio of weights is roughly the square root of the corresponding ratio of power generated (I'm very excited by how good an estimate this seems). This means the blade assembly weighs around 23 tons in total, or almost 8 tons per blade. Looks good - I got a similar result with pixel width (and thus, volume) estimation.  Nearly there.  Using the total moment of inertia (see calculation) of 3.7x107 kg m2 and the angular speed of 15 rad/sec, we get the total energy contained in the blades - 4.16x108 Joules. That's about a third of the energy contained in a lightning bolt, and equivalent to the energy generated by the 600kW wind turbine in nearly 12 minutes."

The orbits are in a (roughly) 2:5 resonance as the original poster said, meaning Venus orbits the Sun 5 times every time Earth orbits twice. Any sort of resonance will draw something pretty like this with that line of connection between the planets - a ""flower"" is quite common in mathematics, as are pentagons and almost any other kind of polygonal object.  In real life the resonance is not exactly 2:5 so that flower will quickly gain hundreds of additional, tiny tips, looking more like a Lie group (It actually has nothing to do with Lie groups I believe, but they just look similar to what the resonance will look like.). So yes, it's a fake, but rounding off to significant figures 2:5 shows a rough pattern - and any two bodies as /u/yopeasants said will form a rational fraction (resonance). In case you didn't know what that means, essentially it is a/b where a and b are integers (whole numbers).  EDIT: I've searched this up and they tend to be more in a 0.6 resonance, with 243:395 being one of the more accurate resonances (smallest ratio found is about 8:13)"

According to Columbia Health:   To be more precise, a woman is born with about one to two million immature eggs, or follicles, in her ovaries.   This means that any given couple has a quintillion or 1018 possible children. Let's assume the average couple has 2 children, 1 male and 1 female, and that the average generation is 20 years.  In 2000 years (or 100 generations), there are (10^18)^100 possible children for the descendants of the original couple, but at most 2100 ≈ 1030 descendants will exist. This means any living descendant will be roughly 1 in 101769 (an insanely large number). For 4000 years (or 200 generations), the odds jump up to roughly 1 in 103539.  Note: These numbers ignore inbreeding, which would inevitably happen after this many generations. (1030 is astronomically greater than 7.2 billion, the current number of people living today.)

theydidthemath,3dm3jk,Axle-f,9,Fri Jul 17 11:16:29 2015 UTC,"If you're buying solar in the American Southwest and building large-scale plants (like 40-100+ MW) then you can buy it for about 5 cents per kWh right now on a 20 year contract (see here or here).  The US uses about 3,832,000,000,000 kWh a year.  So as a really basic calculation you could buy 20 Trillion kWh of solar and we use almost 4 Trillion kWh a year so it would last about 5 years.   But in practice that obviously doesn't work. First, when you build the plants, you have them for 20 years. The 5 cent number is financing the thing and spreading the costs over 20 years. So it might be more appropriate to see how many MW you could build for a trillion, assume that lasts for 20 years, and then see what % of our energy that is.  From the articles above, you'd get about .56 MW of solar out in AZ/NV for every million dollars. And the utility-scale plants produce  ~2,200 kWh for every kW (according to here).  So you could build 562,500 MW of solar which would produce 1.2T kWh for 20 years, which is about 1/3 of our national power consumption.  Two major problems:   Energy has to be used when it is produced. Without significant investments in storage, we wouldn't be able to use up that much solar because during the times when it was producing most, we wouldn't be using all of the energy it was producing. Roughly eyeballing it, if you start getting much more than 10% solar, you also need a lot of batteries, which are more expensive than the solar was. You'd need to add a bunch of transmission lines to transport the solar from the deserts to the cities. Getting it to the western part of the US would be manageable, getting it to the eastern half wouldn't be. If you build solar out east, you'd get less output per MW. Maybe you could do wind instead? Either way, the 'generation' part of electricity is half the overall cost once you include the cost of transporting it. If you wanted to solve that problem by building solar on houses and buildings, then you double the cost of the solar because you lose economies of scale. You could get the best of both worlds (no transmission costs  while getting economies of scale) if you live in Phoenix or Las Vegas but that's not going to help the rest of the country. So either way, you're probably not getting more than half of that 1/3 of total US energy to solar (for 20 years) for $1 Trillion.   So overall as a back of the envelope calculations you could probably get 10-15%ish of the US electricity generation as solar (for 20 years) for $1 trillion dollars.  The point though, is the way that we use electricity, you can't really just have one source. So you'd have to do an exercise like above for each source to get anything near realistic. I don't want to go through that much work for the others so you could just use this table where I add the ""years of Energy"" column by dividing the LCOE (levelized Cost of Electricity) by $1T divided by the MWH used annually in the US:    Source LCOE Years of Energy    Geothermal 47.8 5.46   Wind (onshore) 73.6 3.55   Natural Gas 72.6 3.59   Hydro 83.5 3.13   Coal 95.1 2.74   Nuclear 95.2 2.74   Solar PV 125.3 2.08   Solar Thermal 239.7 1.09    TLDR; we spent more on electricity during the Iraq war than we did on the Iraq war."

With a trillion dollars you can build a lot of power plants but that is only half the battle. You need the infrastructure to transmit the power as well so doing some rough math you could do some massive upgrades to each states infrastructure and increase the power supply.   I estimate you would spend about a billion dollars per state so about twenty years for the entire U.S. and we would have a much better energy grid than before. (Sorry I can't give too much more detail without giving away trade secrets but the number is fairly accurate with what I do)

theydidthemath,3dm3jk,Itchywasabi,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"Reuters reports that the Iraq war has cost $1.7  trillion with an additional $490 billion in benefits owed to war veterans, which over the lifetime of those vets could grow with interest... but let's just pretend we have 1.7 tril plus 490 bil to work with right now. Total of $2.19 trillion  The average solar panel costs around $1/watt wholesale today. Wattage ratings are pretty dang optimistic, but for an actual home solar system, you can get about 75% efficiency after converting it to A/C for the home.  There are additional infrastructure costs involved in ""cleaning up"" solar input to the power grid ... to the point where the ""total"" cost is closer to $2/watt.  This is around the same cost as building large wind turbines and hooking them up to the grid.  Since they're comparable in cost-per-watt, let's say that we can get renewable energy built and put into the grid for $2/watt.  $2.19 trillion / $2/watt is 1.095 trillion watts of power.  Hm, okay, this is very interesting. If I'm reading this right, the peak power generation capacity of the U.S. -- that is, the most that it ever has to produce on the highest-demand moment of the highest-demand day of the year, is 1060 GW. 1.060 trillion watts of power.  So if I did that math right, the cost of the Iraq war would just about pay for replacing our entire electric power generation capacity with clean renewable energy.  Obviously there is more to power generation, like base vs. demand loading. (To keep the grid stable, you have to be able to generate ""right now"" power in a way that's more responsive than solar or wind.) There are also other ways to create renewable power, like hydroelectric and geothermal, that actually come out lower per watt but are restricted to certain localities. And of course, some of the power we have in our grid currently is already renewable, with wind, geothermal, hydro and solar all contributing. (about 15%).  Still, it's kind of surprising to me that the round figures look the way they do. Putting an Iraq-War worth of money into renewable energy would get us in range of having free, clean electricity nationwide. I'm sad now. (Hey, maybe I made a decimal error somewhere!)"

Eg we spent about 2 trillion on the war, and it costs about $4 per W of solar installation, so we could have bought ballpark about 500 MW worth of solar panels, for a production of maybe 365*8*500MW = roughly 1.5 PWh per year worth of production.   The U.S. uses about 30 PWh per year.  So we could have purchased and installed roughly enough panels to supply 5% of our energy needs.   Also I disagree with your general premise. The government likes spending all the money it has on stuff. We spent an enormous amount of money on the wars. If we hadn't done so, we absolutely would have spent it on other stuff.

Industrial demand is not super elastic i.e. if platinum suddenly became abundantly available, the industries which use platinum would not suddenly start using a whole lot more of it so the excess supply won't get absorbed in Industry. They might use somewhat more but certainly not a million times more.  Same for Jewelry and Investment, in fact platinum jewelry and investments would no longer be prized if it were abundantly available.  Since the supply would outstrip demand by a margin of a million times, I'd venture that platinum would intrinsically become completely worthless (assuming no hoarding). Basically as long as demand outstrips supply, the price will keep falling. Since demand is not very elastic, the price will keep falling till it hits zero or practically zero. Its price would then only be equal to the cost of cutting/gathering the required quantity, packaging it and shipping it from where its available to where it needs to be.

theydidthemath,3dmnp7,psj009,2,Sat Jul 18 01:04:26 2015 UTC,That gives you the mass of the heavy water in the person's body. You still need to calculate the difference between this and the mass of regular water in the same person.  In pratice we only did an extra calculation (1.11-1).  Diff_Mass = 0.7* 0.11*61.

The body has some really finley tuned reactions going on. Heavy water, and specifcially deuterium makes stronger bonds than plain hydrogen. The extra bond strength stops the body from successfully completing some reactions.  If you fancy a video answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyK6kPi8k78 (I haven't watched the video for  a while so my write up might be a bit wonky!)  Edit: I notice you put 2H2O for heavy water. Heavy water is actually D2O, where the hydrogens have a neutron they normally don't which makes them deuterium. H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide, best known as hair bleach. This would definitley kill you pretty fast, after first bleaching your insides!"

theydidthemath,3dlg54,bidi123,11,Fri Jul 17 12:12:23 2015 UTC,"no, it will still weigh the same as a pack of cards and be the size of a single card, it is simply about triple the density of gold and 4 times that of lead, so it will feel remarkably heavy for its size is all. it would have no more gravitational pull than a pack of cards does. only a portion of it needs to be atomically compressed. if all of it was converted to neutronium it would be invisible, smaller than a single atom and still weigh the same as a pack of cards. it would also fall to the centre of earth.  oh, it would also be extremely unstable and explode very very badly. just checked and neutronium half life is 10 minutes, the compressed pack of cards is going to be very very hot for an hour or so. like inside of a nuke hot."

theydidthemath,3dj72j,LiterallySagan,3,Fri Jul 17 08:51:06 2015 UTC,"There are three types of diarrhea according to the segment of the gastrointestinal tract affected. Each type causes a different kind of diarrhea, is mediated by a different parhogenic mechanism and is caused by a different microorganism:  -Proximal small bowel diarrhea: It is caused by organisms that release toxins or adhere (but do not invade) the bowel wall; therefore, there is almost no damage to the bowel and the diarrhea is caused because water is not absorbed in the bowel or because it is secreted. This is an extremely watery diarrhea with symptoms such as nausea and vomitting. Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus cereus (reheated rice), Staphylococcus aureus (most common cause of foodborne intoxication) and rotavirus cause this.  -Distal small bowel diarrhea: It is a penetrating diarrhea in which organisms invade the bowel and beyond, even invading other locations in the body; thus, it is associated to fever. It is caused by Salmonella typhi  -Colon diarrhea: It is caused by death of the cells in the colonic wall either by cytotoxins or direct invasion. Since cells are dying, this diarrhea may cause diarrhea with inflammatory cells and blood in the stools, associated with severe cramping and pain on defecation. It is caused bu Shigella, some strains of Escherichia coli and Entamoeba histolytica.  TL;DR: Watery diarrhea with nausea and vomitting (proximal small bowel), bloody diarrea with severe cramps (colon) and enteric fever (distal small bowel)."

theydidthemath,3dosyq,SpitFir3Tornado,2,Sat Jul 18 00:53:17 2015 UTC,"To recap, the Unix Time Stamp is a 32 bit signed integer counting the seconds up from 1970, Jan 1, midnight, not counting leap seconds. As stated in the source thread, it will overflow on 2038, Jan 19, just before quarter past three AM, and systems that haven't switched to 64-bit systems will show the following progression:   2038-01-19 03:14:06 (UTC) 2038-01-19 03:14:07 (UTC) 1901-12-13 20:45:52 (UTC) 1901-12-13 20:45:53 (UTC)   This is because at 2038-01-19 03:14:08, exactly 231 seconds will have passed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00.  Now, a bit of history. Just before the turn of the millennium, computer engineers feared that two-digit datestamp systems would freak out having to deal with year numbers greater than 1999. It was a load of panic about nothing, the systems transitioned just fine, but problems were expected, and the problem was affectionately called the Millennium Bug. The Unix Time overflow is also referred to as a Millennium Bug, but this will probably have further-reaching consequences.  In order to circumvent it, a new 64-bit standard is being implemented, which stores it in a 64-bit signed integer instead of a 32 bit one. This will mean that the next millennium bug will be 263 seconds after the start time at new years', 1970. That moment has been calculated to be on AD 292 277 026 596-12-04 15:30:08 UTC. Assuming the sun will last us 5,5 billion years from now, Earth will be long gone by then."
theydidthemath,3dosyq,ChromeLynx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:47:57 2015 UTC,"The sun will not supernova because it's too small. It will become a red giant and then fade into a white dwarf in about 5.5 billion (5.5e9) years. The universe will stop forming stars in about 1-100 trillion (1e12 to 1e14) years, stars and black holes will fade over time, and in very roughly 1e200 years, the heat death of the universe will occur. Not with a bang, but a whimper.  How will our 64 bit time fare? That depends on what 64 bit time standard you use.   If you use a signed 64 bit count of microseconds since 1970-01-01, we have about 292,000 years (2.92e5) in either direction. Just a day in the life of the sun. (292,000 to 10 billion is the same ratio as one day to 93.8 years) If you use a signed 64 bit count of milliseconds since 1970-01-01, we have about 292 million years (2.92e8) in either direction. Now we're talking about a decent amount of time, even from the sun's point of view, but still well within its projected lifespan. If you use an unsigned 64 bit count of seconds since 13.8 billion years ago (the start of the universe), you can count time from the start of the universe to 570 billion (5.7e11) years from now (I made this standard up, it may not be practical, but it gives us a fully-useful range, instead of leaving almost half of it behind the earliest moment). The sun has long since become a white dwarf. It will likely not have cooled to be a black dwarf yet, a process which we estimate takes 1 quadrillion years (1e15). But, this is still within the estimated time of star formation: the universe is alive and well, though stars are being built from more and more heavier elements as previous stars have used up much of the universe's hydrogen and helium in their own fusion, leaving behind heavier metals in star-forming clouds.   (there are others, but it's usually in inconsequential-to-us choices of epoch, leap seconds, etc. so I'll stop there)  How many bits would we need to count to the heat death at 1e200 years in seconds? 1e200 years is 3e207 seconds, and ceil(log_2(3e207)) is 690. 690 bits would do it. Add about 20 more and you can count to it in microseconds."

(There are actually infinite solutions, but I'm declaring only positive values and whole numbers of pennies as ""plausible"".) Any two numbers that add up to $110 will solve it.  The current ticket total ($1200) is 40/11=~364% times larger than the original ticket total ($330). It is also $870 more than the original price, which is an increase of $145 per ticket.  If we assume both ticket prices increased by the same factor (~3.64 times), then the original tickets A and B were $68.75 and $41.25, respectively.  However, if we assume that both ticket prices increased by the same amount ($145) instead of the same factor, then the original ticket prices A and B were $105 and $5.  Note that ($68.75, $41.25) and ($105.00, $5.00) are both solutions to 3x+3y=$330. Now, if we apply some real-world knowledge, we can see that the first result looks closer to actual ticket prices than does the second one (who ever heard of a $5 ticket?). Also, knowing that the tickets were probably divisible by ten, it's more likely that they were $70 and $40, which also solves 3x+3y=$330. I wasn't playing around when I said that there are thousands of plausible solutions.  So I am going to say $70 and $40 because they are the only numbers divisible by ten that increase realistically to give you your current ticket price, but with the strong caveat that multiple other plausible possibilities exist and without more information, we cannot say anything for sure.  tl;dr I cannot know for certain, but $70 and $40 is my best guess."

theydidthemath,3dip9r,dotzak,0,Thu Jul 16 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the express stops only exist on Lines 6 and 7. Other lines like 5 and A have express lines, but they don't use the same stops and so can't be compared.  Line 7 schedule  Flushing to Times Square takes 28 minutes express and 35 minutes local.  Times Square to Flushing takes 30 min express and 37 minutes local.  So both ways you save 7 minutes over the entire trip. 21 stops total, 10 stops skipped.   7 minutes / 10 skipped stops = 42 seconds saved per skipped stop.    Line 6 schedule  Parkchester to 3rd takes 12 minutes express and 18 minutes local.    3rd to Parkchester has a lot of variance, but most common looks like 13 minutes express, 17 minutes local.   These skips 9 stops, so you save 40 seconds per stop in one direction and 27 seconds per stop in the other.   The average of all 4 is 37.8 seconds per skipped stop.  Practically speaking I don't think there's a general rule for whether it's worth the wait because it depends on what stops you’re using and the schedule at that time. If you want to get from Flushing to Times Square or back as fast as possible it is always better to skip the local and get on the next express. For Mets to Woodside it doesn't matter if you wait, they'll both get you there at around the same time. Woodside to Queensboro the trains leave at the same time, and the express will get you there faster."

For example, you might be on the 5 or 6 and see that its a 3 minute wait for the 4 (express) train.

I also know from using a treadmill that 2mph is really slow to the point of looking awkward, so I'm going to estimate It at 2.5 mph  2) In order to spend 24 hours at home, you would need to be at home when it's 24 hours away. It covers 60 miles in one day, and I'm going to assume you're capable of travelling at 60 mph. This means that It would have to be 1 hour further past the 60 mile point when you're driving home from 60 miles out.  1 hour x 2.5 mph = 2.5 miles  So you're at 60 miles, when It is at 62.5 miles. Working backward to see when you passed it.   2.5miles/ 57.5mph = 0.043 hours  = an extra 0.11 miles  So in total, you would have to travel out 62.61 miles, wait for 24 hours for It to catch up, and then head back home.  3) Ideally you want It to have to travel 12 hours one way and then 12 hours in the other. This means that you want to be leaving work exactly 12 hours after you leave home. Your work would have to be 12 hours x 2.5 mph = 30 miles away. Since it takes half an hour to commute, your ideal work day would have to be 11.5 hours long.

Rich people could just spend half their time on one side of the planet and half on the other. Sister cities would be formed on opposite ends of the planet for maximum efficiency.

theydidthemath,3devqc,Treyzania,158,Wed Jul 15 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"Pluto has a surface area of 1.765×107 km². Let's say you want to paint both hemispheres, so there is a flag no matter which way it is facing.  For paint coverage, I found an exterior paint at Lowes, 5 gallon bucket, that is paint and primer in one, but they suggest 2 coats. This 5 gal bucket covers approximately 2,000 ft².  1.765x107 km² = 189,983,000,000,000 ft²  189,983,000,000,000 ft² / 2,000 ft²/bucket = 94,991,500,000 buckets x 2 coats = 189,983,000,000 buckets.  At $115 each, that will cost 189,983,000,000 x 115 = $21,848,045,000,000 ≈ $22 trillion for paint  A bucket of paint should weigh about 50 lbs. SpaceX is looking to make it less than $500 per pound to orbit.  94,991,500,000 buckets x 50 lbs/bucket = $4,749,575,000,000 ≈ $5 trillion to take the paint to orbit. Let's double that to get it to Pluto (wild guess), so $10 trillion.  We're at $32 trillion. This doesn't include a way to spread the paint...  The Mars rovers cost about $1 billion to build, launch, land, and operate for the 6+ years. That seems like loose change here."
theydidthemath,3devqc,zeug666,148,Wed Jul 15 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Wild guess is wildly wrong.  This SpaceX post suggests that at most 40% (1 over 2.5) of something launched to low Earth orbit can make it to geostationary transfer orbit. According to this delta-V map, that's 2440 m/s of delta/v, and due to the way orbital mechanics work, for each 2440 m/s of delta/v you have to divide the mass that gets there by 2.5.  From low Earth orbit to Pluto landing, there is 12300 m/s of delta-v (as per the map I linked to). It is 5.04 times more than 2440, which means that for every pound that makes it to Pluto, you'd need 2.55.04 ≈ 101 pounds that make it to LEO.   94,991,500,000 buckets x 50 lbs/bucket = 4,749,575,000,000 lbs (on Pluto)  4,749,575,000,000 lbs x 101 = 479,707,075,000,000 lbs (on LEO)  479,707,075,000,000 lbs x $500/lb = $239,853,537,500,000,000 ≈ $239 quadrillion.  Compared to that, the cost of the paint is loose change."
theydidthemath,3devqc,ASBusinessMagnet,47,Wed Jul 15 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"This smells right.  I had a very hard time believing that transportation would be that cheap.

Lets assume it gets more efficient and can take 25000kg to space. This means there would be 189,983,000,000 buckets x 25kg / 250000kg = 189,983,000 launches. Times 1.2GJ makes 225 * 1015 Joule.

Imagine a car company adding 1 billion to the GDP right now. If all the sudden they were forced to make space components, they wouldn't be as efficient because they aren't as proficient in making space components, so maybe they'd only add 750 million to the GDP.

Instead, lets assume that we send out enough New Horizons spacecraft such that we can transport all the paint there, then because we're smart humans back here on Earth, the delivery mechanism is worked out just perfectly, and we can paint the proper design.  *  Pluto has a surface area of 1.665*107 km2 according to a google search.  A can of paint covers 400 square feet, which is about equal to 4*10-5 km2 .  This means we'll need 4.1625 * 1011 cans of paint to cover Pluto fully.  Can of paint costs about 30 dollars or so.  *  The New Horizons mission cost ~700 million.   I'm making a wild estimation here, but the New Horizons spacecraft weighed ~480 kg when fuelled, so lets assume it can hold 75 kg of paint instead of scientific equipment.  A can of paint weighs about 5 kg. This means that a single New Horizons spacecraft can hold 15 cans of paint.  Because we need 4.1625 * 1011 cans of paint, this means we need 2.775 * 1010 New Horizons spacecraft.  *  Total cost:  (4.1625 * 1011 cans of paint) * (30 dollars/can) = $1.24875 * 1013   (2.775 * 1010 spacecraft) * (7 * 108 dollars/spacecraft) = 1.9425 * 1019 dollars  TOTAL = 1.9425 * 1019 dollars  TOTAL = $ 19 425 000 000 000 000 000  *  That is over a million times the GDP of the US (16.77 trillion).

Error between the two is likely me, so using an average of 14.5 seconds to round the bases and assuming constant speed and straight-line distances (despite the curvilinear path).  Bases are 90 feet apart, so 360 feet around the diamond.  360 ft / 14.5 seconds = 24.8 feet/second, 16.9 mph, 7.57 m/s  360 feet is about 110 meters.

theydidthemath,3dikk2,zeug666,2,Thu Jul 16 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"There is a way to account for that, but the math is currently escaping me. A more empirical look at it, a curved path slightly off of the straight path could add between a few inches to a few feet per segment.  The run to first looked to be pretty close to the line, first to third seemed like a big arc, and then third to home was pretty close again. Making a circle/arc that goes from first to third, with the apex going through second - an equallateral triangle with two 90' sides, a base of 127.28', and a height of 63.64' creates and arc of 199.93'. I used AutoCAD, in case you were curious.  So, that rounded path would add almost 20 feet to that half of the run. I am going to assume the home to first and third to home runs are only slightly curved, so let's say 5' per, for an additional 30' total. 360 feet becomes 390 feet.  390 feet / 14.5 seconds = 26.9 ft/s, 18.34 mph, or 8.2 m/s."
theydidthemath,3dhsok,Doogg6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:31:22 2015 UTC,I don't think catching a skyscraper is possible for humans. Since you would not have enough torque to slow it down. Lets say wee have some infinitely long mass-less beams fixed to the sky scraper so it looks like this              ^          /     \   -----------|......... |--------------          -----------|......... |--------------               -----------|......... |--------------              -----------|......... |--------------                 -----------|......... |--------------                -----------|......... |--------------                then only people on the bottom of the skyscraper would be able to hold on. It would really act a giant pivot and hit the people at the top end with such speed that it would just rip their arms of. It could be maybe done if we assumed indestructible beams. I will give it a calculation when I get back from practice maybe in the meanwhile you could think of the dimensions of the skyscraper you want me to do the calculations on.
theydidthemath,3dhsok,grizzlez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"There is no definition of what makes a skyscraper tall enough, but according to this it is typically expected to be at least 20 stories, or about 66 meters tall.  Now for the mass of it, since the title ""skyscraper"" is so vague, I looked at famous American towers he may be standing under. The Empire State Building (381m w/o spires) is 3.31e8 kg and the Willis Tower (442m w/o spires) is 2.018e8 kg.   3.31e8 kg / 381 m = 8.69e5 kg/m 2.018e8 kg / 442 m = 4.57e5 kg/m 0.5 ( 8.69e5 + 4.57e5 ) = 6.63e5 kg/m 6.63e5 kg/m * 66 m = 4.37e7 kg  Averaging these and applying it to our minimum-sized 66m tall tower (math above), we get that it has a mass of approximately 4.37e7 kg.  Since the top would need proportionately more people than the bottom to support it, we'll calculate the middle of the tower and pretend it applies to the whole tower to prevent useless calculation.  Using the Law of Conservation of Energy, the P.E. in the start must roughly equal the K.E. in the end. I'm assuming with something like a skyscraper forces like friction to be negligible to the total amount of force at play.  So halfway up the building (33m)...  PE = m g h PE = (4.37e7) * (9.8) * (33) PE = 1.41e10 J PE ~= KE KE = 0.5  m  v² 1.41e10J = 0.5 * (4.37e7) * (v²) v = 25.44 m/s  This means that to slow it down and ""catch"" it, everyone would have to slow the building from an average of 25.44m/s to 0m/s within the distance of an arm's total motion (mine is around 1.5m)...  vf² = vi² + 2 a d 0 m/s = 647 m²/s² + 2 * (x) * (1.5) x = -215.8 m/s² vf = vi + a t 0 m/s = 25.44 m/s + (-215.8 m/s²) * (x) x = 0.1179 s F * t = m * ∆v (x) * (0.1179 s) = (4.37e7 kg) * (25.44 m/s) x = 9.44e9 J  So the people would have to make up a combined 9.44e9 J, and considering the average adult male should be able to lift about their body weight especially in a life or death situation (88.68 kg according to the CDC), this is a force of 869 N. So, dividing the total force among everyone holding 869 N, it would take 10.859 billion people. So yeah, it's impossible were it to happen today.  TL;DR Yeah, it's impossible."
theydidthemath,3dhujo,smishmortion,3,Thu Jul 16 11:55:23 2015 UTC,"t = (Vf-Vi)/a  20 sec = (250 mph - 0 mph) / a  a = 250 mph / 20 sec =    0.003472 mi/s²  (miles per second squared) 18.33 ft/s² (feet per second squared) 5.588 m/s² (meters per second squared) 12.5 mph/s (miles per hour per second)   Now the distance:  s = (Vi x t) + ½ a t²         (Vi is zero, so the first part goes away)  s = ½ a t² = ½(18.33 ft/s²)(20 s)² =   3,666 feet 0.6943 miles 1.117 km 1,117 meters   The above is assuming a linear acceleration, which it isn't, but the overall should be pretty similar.    I am sure there is more info pending, but when the Bugatti Veyron was tested there were some interesting things like going from a full tank to empty in about 12 minutes, the seemingly short lifespan of the tires, etc.    EDIT: Oh, it should probably come to a stop too. I couldn't find data on the Regera, but the Bugatti Veyron can go from 250 mph to 0 in about 10 seconds and about 1/3 of a mile, although the regenerative braking may help the Regera a bit there.  Quick math for stopping:  t = (Vf-Vi)/a  10 s = (0-250 mph)/a => => a negative acceleration meaning it's slowing down   -0.006944 mi/s² (miles per second square) -36.67 ft/s² (feet per second square) -11.18 m/s² (meters per second square) -25 mph/s (miles per hour per second)   Stopping distance:  s = (Vi x t) + ½ a t²  s = (250 mph x 10 seconds) + ½(-25 mph/s)(10 s)² =    1,833 feet 0.3472 miles 0.5587 km 558.7 meters   Which makes sense, if the car goes from 0-250 mph in 20 seconds and 250-0 mph in half the time, it will cover half the distance stopping as it did starting.  So, from start to stop the car will cover:   5,499 feet 1.04 miles 1.68 km 1,675.7 meters"

If your head is 1 foot above your heart, than in a 100G environment your heart would need to function as though it isn't pumping blood 1 foot up but 100 ft up. Given the specialized structures giraffes need just to pump their blood 10-20 feet up I think its safe to say that it would be impossible for the human heart to do 100ft."

Basically you would experience time travelling into the future.  However, these relativistic speeds are, for all intents and purposes, impossible. You would probably need to be going at more than 99% the speed of light to experience such striking time dilation. The math is such that the force required to accelerate your mass increases exponentially as you approach the speed of light. Carrying enough fuel and having a means to create that much sustainable thrust for any length of time is mind boggling.

From what I've read from people who know a lot more about this than I do the only really feasible way to do with is with nuclear engines since then the fuel would only weigh a tiny fraction of what conventional fuel does.

It is amazing that such groups can ignore obvious day-to-day deaths in automobiles yet alarm the public with false atomic threats.” Woodfill said that the opposition to RTGs has been most unfortunate for the sake of human and robotic exploration of the solar system.  “The limitation of traditional rocket fuels handicaps improvement in propulsion,” he said, “and for the past five decades, little progress has been made in rocket engine specific impulse improvement known as the ISP.”  Additionally, for several years NASA has been facing a shortage of RTGs for powering robotic spacecraft limiting the scope and lifetime of missions going to the far reaches of our Solar System.  ...  And what happened to Apollo 13’s SNAP-27? In the book “Thirteen: The Flight that Failed”, Henry S.F.

One is that a propulsion system exists that could accelerate something at 9m/s2 for 9000 hours.  Another is that the universe runs on Galilean relativity, not special (or general) relativity.  While the answer makes sense mathematically, it doesn't make sense physically because of the assumptions made. We might as well assume that people can be accelerated to 900m/s2 .  The issue that special relativity raises is (in very rough terms) that once your spaceship has accelerated to 1/2 c (from the point of view of Earth), from its point of view, the speed limit is still c faster than it - so it has to speed up by another c. But again, once it has sped up by another 1/2 c the same thing happens; from its point of view it still needs to speed up by another c."

theydidthemath,3ddiyo,TheGrumbleduke,3,Wed Jul 15 23:08:39 2015 UTC,"General relativity.  To accelerate a mass to the speed of light would require infinite energy.  Relatively infinite is close to the way you should think about it, but not exactly quite.     No matter where you are, no matter what speed you're going, no matter which direction you're looking, a photon always is moving at the speed of light--relative to your perspective.    Even if you and a photon are going the exact same speed in parallel paths relative to a stationary observer, to you that photon is still moving the speed of light faster than you.    Another way of thinking about this is to the stationary observer, you are frozen in time, moving at the speed of light across the universe but never aging.  To you, time is infinitely fast, the universe ages in a single moment, every event that ever happened or ever will occurs in a that moment, and the photon beside you travels away at the speed of light.  Science is fucking amazing."
theydidthemath,3ddiyo,pdinc,3,Thu Jul 16 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"There is a speed, usually labelled c, often called the speed of light (unhelpfully, imho), which is a limiting speed in the universe.  Under special relativity, is it the speed that is the same in all inertial frames.  Under Galilean relativity (or Newtonian), velocities are all relative to the observer, but that can be dealt with by adding the velocities together. So if you have a stationary observer Oscar, another observer Alice moving at velocity u (relative to O), and an object moving at velocity v (relative to O), then if we want to know how the object is moving relative to Alice, we take v and subtract u.  But this doesn't work in the real world. In the real world there is this speed, c, which is the same in all (inertial) reference frames. In the above example, all three observers (Oscar, Alice and the object) would measure light travelling past them at c. If Alice was travelling away from Oscar at 1/2 c and shone a torch at him, the light would leave her travelling at c but would also reach Oscar travelling at c.  The consequences of special relativity are that when you accelerate, distances and time intervals become messed up - they can expand and contract - relative to an observer not accelerating. While we are used to ideas of speeds being relative to the observer (we're stationary at our desks, but also zooming around the Earth at a pretty spectacular speed - and zooming around the Sun...), it is harder to understand that the same happens with both distances and times. Two events that happen at the same point in spacetime for you may happen at a different point for me.  Anyway. c is the hinge that holds this all together. It is the speed that remains the same whichever inertial reference frame you are in.  From your point of view (in the space ship), you are stopped. The universe is accelerating away from you. Which means that you observe weird effects outside the ship, in space and time. But c is always c away.  From the point of view of your mission command, as you accelerate away, your internal time appears to slow down, and your space (I think) contracts in the direction of travel - meaning that your acceleration appears to reduce.  It's all rather messy, and much easier to sort out with the maths, and when it isn't 4am."

So it would take 30,000,000 seconds to accelerate to light speed at 1 G in Newtonian terms.  I also happen to know that 30,000,000 seconds is about a year.  So relativistic effects notwithstanding, about a year. Time dilation at 90% of c is a little over 2:1, so you could reasonably expect to hit 90% of c within about a year.  If you want to get crazy, you could accelerate at 2 Gs, or maybe 3 Gs, but you'd want really strong astronauts to put up with that for months on end. For comparison, the space shuttle accelerated at less than 3 Gs at launch, and maintained that for only about 10 minutes.  But if you managed to find astronauts who could withstand it, you could reach 90% of c in about 4 months."

According to Wikipedia, a typical human can withstand up to about 5 g's before losing consciousness. (Rough roller coaster ride forces.) With special suits and training, pilots can withstand up to 9 g's for sustained periods (though probably not as long as will be needed here.)  For purposes of presuming the maximum that a trained and properly equipped astronaut would need to 'survive' in the sense of being able to do the minimal tasks necessary to their survival, I'm going to cap this at 5 g's -- 49 m/s2  From that, I come up with 70.81 days.  If you want to take it slowly and comfortably at 1 g (which will also give you Earth-like 'gravity' onboard during acceleration), it will take 354 days."
theydidthemath,3ddiyo,yocum137,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"The short version is, ""Longer than you've got.""  Here's the long version:  As you go faster, you get more massive relative to anything that's not moving as fast as you are. To an outside observer, the mass of a moving object would seem to increase by a factor called the Lorentz factor, often represented by (and called, in shorthand) the Greek letter Gamma.  γ = 1/(1 - v^2 / c^2 )^0.5   At any human-achievable speed, this difference is so small as to defy measurement by all but the most sensitive devices (which almost certainly wouldn't survive measurement at said speed).  To give an example:  Imagine George Clooney rides a Soyuz capsule into Low Earth Orbit, about 160km.  It's going about 7.8 km/s. To give some perspective on how fast that is, the Naval Surface Warfare Center has achieved a muzzle velocity of nearly one third of the speed required to maintain orbit.  Now imagine Sandra Bullock launches a Space Shuttle into retrograde (backward) Low Earth Orbit.  This takes more thrust (Add more boosters) because instead of giving you a 460 m/s head start, the ground is going the wrong way, making you earn an extra 460 m/s.  In any case, the final orbital speed is the same, 7.8 km/s  Those two capsules will pass each other with a relative speed of 15.6 kilometers per second.  The only man-made object to achieve a higher relative velocity was (I am not making this up) a nuclear powered manhole cover, which left the ground at nearly five times that speed, and achieved the rare feat of burning up on the way out of Earth's atmosphere.  15.6 km/s is Really Fast.  Light is Really, Really Fast.  If Clooney sent Bullock ""Give me your position!"" just as they passed, the signal could circle the Earth and come back to him before he got through ""Gi-"".  Light moves 19,230 times faster than those two spaceships pass each other.  What does moving that fast do to Clooney's body mass?  Clooney weighs 78 kg.  Clooney's Gamma relative to Bullock (and Bullock's relative to Clooney) is:  1/(1 - 15.6^2 / 300000^2 )^0.5 = 1/(1 - 1/370000000)^0.5 = 1/(369999999/370000000)^0.5 = 1/0.9999999986486 = 1.0000000013514 * 78 = 78.0000001054   To Bullock, Clooney's mass would change by one tenth of one milligram.  So what does all this mean to OP's question?  All we've seen so far is why we never ever think about relativity, even a little bit, in our everyday lives.  (Physicists are approximated by spherical cows in this model, and are neglected in the final calculation.)  When you start to get near the speed of light relative to something else (like your origin or destination), your Gamma starts to become really significant.  In fact, if you were ever to reach the speed of light, v2 / c2 would be one.  One minus one is zero.  The square root of zero is zero.  One divided by zero is infinite.  Thus, you would have infinite mass at the speed of light, and you would need infinite energy to get there.  Here's the kicker:  As you continue to accelerate, time does the same thing as mass.  Your seconds get longer to an outside observer (and theirs get longer to you, but it balances out because you're the one accelerating, and the math gets really hard here and I don't understand it so we're going to pretend the acceleration never happened LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU).  By continuing to accelerate, you're still reducing the amount of time you have to wait to get to your destination, even if you'll still get there at basically the same time to an outside observer.  Instead of asking, ""How fast can I go?"" you need to ask, ""What is close enough?""  How long are you willing to wait to get there?  Say you're going to Alpha Centauri in a ship with a Magical Zero Point Energy Drive (MaZPEDTM : We get you there faster... To you!SM ) that can constantly accelerate at 1 g.  Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years away.  No matter how much energy you pour into this spaceship, it will never get there any sooner than 4.37 years from the time it launched.  You're aboard the ship though, and you really don't want to carry 1600 days' worth of Pringles, so it's time to get speedy.  Say you want to carry only a week's worth of food.  This means you need a Gamma close to 1600/7 = 228.6.  We can back-calculate the speed you'll need to achieve that!  γ = 228.6 1/(1 - v^2 / c^2 )^0.5 = 228.6 (1 - v^2 / c^2 )^0.5 = 0.0043744532 (Precision starts to get really important at this point) 1 - v^2 / c^2 = 0.0000191358 (Because numbers start to get really small) v^2 / c^2 = 1 - 0.0000191358 v^2 / c^2 = 0.9999808642 v / c = 0.9999904321   So you'll need to go 99.999% the speed of light to shorten that trip to one week.  How hard is it to go that fast?  Fortunately, someone else has already done that math for us.  To take our MaZPED up to .99999c would take somewhere north of 100 years.  You'd still experience five years inside the ship, just accelerating!  Indeed, accelerating constantly for half the trip, then decelerating constantly for the other half, you could only shorten the trip by less than a year!  So the short version of the long version is, Einstein sucks donkey balls, and he really wrecked space travel for everyone.  Edit: Formatting is hard.  Let's do math!"
theydidthemath,3ddiyo,NeoshadowXC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"I want to point out there is a loophole here. If the entire space ship is in free fall, no acceleration will be experienced by anyone or anything inside the ship. If the ship would be accelerated by, for example, a singularity being projected outside the ship, it could be accelerated to near the speed of light very very quickly.  This is the way ships are moved at sublight speeds in the ""Star Carrier"" book series, which is better than it sounds."

theydidthemath,3dhjb0,Pepsikoala2,2,Thu Jul 16 09:15:57 2015 UTC,"Well, there's two different things going on here. One is body temperature, and the other is power. Normally, a human is running at around about 100W.    There's about 30 million KM3 of ice in the ice caps.  and it's usually around -20 to -30 degrees C. So consider one KG of ice. You need about 4000 * 25 = 100 000 Joules to raise it from around -25 to freezing, as the specific heat capacity of water is around 4000J/Kg/degree. Then you need to turn it into water, which takes far more energy. This is why ice is so good at cooling drinks. It takes another 330 000J to turn that ice into water.    So that's 430KJ per kilo, which is about a 10cm cube. (It's a little off due to the lower density of ice, but these are rough figures) So 430 MJ per m2. Multiply by a billion to get the energy per cubic Km, and then by another 30 million, and you get 13 * 1018 MJ of energy required.    13 000 000 000 000 000 000MJ at 100W would take a very long time, so you're going to have to get hotter.     The power you radiate relates to temperature by the Stefan Boltzmann law, which states power is proportional to the difference of the fourth power of temperature (T4 - T04 ). You're going to get hot enough that your temperature will completely dominate the equation, so we'll just make it T4. You're going to want to be putting out around 1025J, but you don't need to put it out all at once. Let's say you take a minute or so to melt the ice caps (ignoring for now how exactly you spread all that heat around) then you'd need a power of about 1023 Watts. Your surface area is around 2m2, and your emissivity is around 1, so we can take the fourth root of 1023, and see that you'd need to be about half a million degrees C (or kelvin, as there's little difference at that point). 900000 degree Farenheit.     As an aside, if you had a regular thermometer about 5cm long, graded from 35 to 42 degrees C, you'd need to extend it to about 4Km long before you could fit your temperature on the scale."

As Pluto's radius is 1185 km, that means Charon is 18,386 km away from the surface of Pluto. If you draw a line to the middle of Charon and then another line to the perimeter of Charon, you can determine the angle by the inverse tangent of (604/18386), which is 1.882°, or 0.0328 radians. The solid angle is measured in steradians (radians squared) and is calculated by solid angle = 2π (1 - cos(theta)). Here, this results in 0.00339 steradians.  Our moon and sun are about the same angle from Earth, with the moon clocking in at 6.67 * 10-5 steradians. From Pluto, Charon would be about 60 times larger than our moon is from us.

theydidthemath,3df7xp,Semaphor,3,Wed Jul 15 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if there is a stable circular orbit around Pluto due to the effect of Charon. Charon (the largest satellite of Pluto) and Pluto orbit each other around their center of mass (barycenter). This set of calculations ignores that and imagines that you could circularly orbit around Pluto and that the center of mass is the center of Pluto.  This question is governed by the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation where change in velocity (delta-V) is dependent on the natural log (ln) of the mass of the total payload with fuel over the mass without the fuel. In simple terms, change in velocity = speed of the emitted fuel * natural log of (mass with fuel/mass without fuel).   New Horizon's engine with 77 kg of fuel allows the engines to accelerate the payload by 290 m/s. From the rocket equation, that means the speed of the emitted fuel is 1620 m/s, a number which will come in handy shortly.  The relative velocity of New Horizons to Pluto at its closest approach is approximately 49,600 km/h or 13.8 km/s. This is the change in delta-V which we would need to bring it to a complete stop around Pluto. At 12,500 km above the surface (closest approach for New Horizons, and 13,685 km away from the center of Pluto), there is an orbital velocity of 253 m/s, so we'll round up and subtract 0.3 km/s from the necessary burn. Orbital velocity is calculated by v = sqrt(gravitational constant * mass of the planet in kg / radius of the orbit in meters) This would leave us in a slightly elliptical orbit, but probably keep us in orbit.  Let's revisit that rocket equation. If we need to change our velocity by 13.5 km/s to stay in Plutonian orbit and we have a 1620 m/s fuel velocity for a 470 kg probe (let's assume we want the same amount of fuel available for maneuvering) it becomes a trivial problem. With a little algebra, we can find the mass needed to keep 470 kg in orbit. If we currently have 13.5 km/s = 1.62 km/s * ln(x/470 kg), where x is the mass of the full probe prior to orbit in kg, we can solve for x = 470 * exp(13.5/1.62). X is therefore 10647 kg, or over 22 x more massive than the probe without that fuel...That is 10,177 kg...or 10 tonnes of hydrazine fuel!  Now we have the much more difficult problem of flying all that fuel up to Pluto. See, the New Horizons mission used the HUGE Atlas V rocket, and just barely sent it fast enough to get to Pluto (after stealing some energy from Jupiter in a gravity assist). There's no way you could increase the payload mass by a factor of 22 and launch it up with the same launch profile, as this would take a huge increase in the fuel required, and I cannot even calculate it (most notably because of the influence of atmosphere on the larger vehicle and several stages in the flight).  I hope this answered your question, but I'm happy to answer anything else you're curious about!"

Given these parameters, I'm trying to find the speed at which Object A is moving towards Object B.   For example, imagine a right triangle with base 1, length 5 and hypotenuse root 26. The length is the path traveled by A, the base is the distance B is from the path, and the hypotenuse is the distance from A to B. A is traveling at 1m/s.   At time 0, B is 1 meter from the path traveled by A. A is currently located 5 meters from the right angle intersection of the closest point of approach (CPA) to B. The distance from A to B (d) is root 26.    At time 1, A has traveled 1m and is now 4 meters from the CPA. The d is root 17.   At time 2, d is root 10.   At time 3, d is root 5.

Essentially, you take the percent increase of a given population (whether it be people, money, or whatevers) and divide the number 69 by that value.

So if we add 0.2% of today's population.  The World Population Clock shows 7,238,708,661 billion people when I looked. Add 0.2% of that (14,657,417 new people) and you get 7,253,366,078 as the new population."

theydidthemath,3daj7d,SocksForBreakfast,64,Tue Jul 14 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"1000 light years is about the order of magnitude of the distance at which we can see bright stars. So the odds are roughly similar to the fraction of the night sky that is taken up by stars: very very little.  For a slightly more precise answer, consider that Wikipedia's list of closest stars places 54 stars within 16.3 light years. Now, assuming the density of stars in space is roughly constant, the number of stars at or near a certain distance scales up as r2 but the solid angular size of each star scales down as r-2, so the solid angle occupied by all stars at or near a given distance, per unit distance is independent of distance. As a result, if there are 54 stars within 16.3 light years and the occupy a solid angle A, the stars within a thousand light years will occupy a solid angle 1000/16.3*A = 61.3A.  To figure out what A is, let me make an order-of-magnitude estimate that the ""average star"" from Wikipedia's list is the size of the sun (roughly a million miles in diameter) and is 10 light years away. That means it takes up a solid angle of 2x10-16 steradians. With 54 stars, that puts us at about 10-14 steradians, and then extrapolating to a thousand light years' distance, we get 10-11 steradians. That's out of 4pi steradians in the entire sky, so the ratio is 10-11/(4pi) ~ 10-12.  That's if you don't count the sun. The sun is about a quarter of a square degree (order of magnitude), which takes up roughly a hundred-thousandth of the sky. So if you include that, it dominates the calculation.  Other large objects in the solar system are listed on Wikipedia's page on angular diameter. The moon is about the same size as the sun, so if you count that, it doubles that one-in-a-hundred-thousand figure, but that was just an order of magnitude estimate anyway. If you leave out the sun and moon, the next largest object is Venus (if it's close), which is about a thousand times smaller in terms of apparent size. So that takes up a hundred millionth of the sky. Jupiter is similarly sized and Saturn is ten times smaller, so those don't make too much of a change.  TL;DR:   1:50,000 (roughly) 1:50,000,000 (order of magnitude) not counting the sun and moon 1:1,000,000,000,000 (order of magnitude) not counting anything in our solar system     This does of course assume there's nothing other than stars to hit, but as long as you don't count large dust clouds, that's probably a fair assumption. Planets and the like are really small.  It also assumes the distribution of directions is uniform, but I can't imagine you meant otherwise."

Or another way to look at it, as /u/Dementati pointed out, would be that the number of stars at a distance scales up with the distance squared, but each one's apparent size is inversely proportional to its distance squared, so all the stars at a distance take up the same total apparent area."

The mining network - the thing that verifies a transaction and adds it to the authoritative record - is designed to generate a new block of verified transactions every 10 minutes.  The throughput is limited by the maximum size of these blocks, which is currently 1 MB.  As you add more computing power to this mining network, the difficulty of generating blocks increases to limit how fast you can generate the blocks.  Edit: So to address scalability, there are basically two ways at this time to increase the throughput.  One is to increase the size of the generated block.  The downside is that this can cause non-miners to stop verifying that the blocks are correct, because it requires more bandwidth, which means that its easier to sneak in bad transactions.  Another is to put some layer over the Bitcoin protocol and do most of the work on that, and then use Bitcoin to ""settle"" transactions after some period."

theydidthemath,3d9lyj,the_f3l1x,7,Tue Jul 14 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"The average angular momentum of the Earth is defined as L = mass x velocity x radius. For earth, mass = 5.9742 x 1024 kg, velocity = 2 x pi x radius / time = 2 x pi x 149.6 x 109 m / 31536000 seconds per year = 2.98 x 104 m/s. L = (5.9742 x 1024 kg) x (2.98 x 104 m/s) x (149.6 x 109 m) = 2.663 x 1040 kg x m2 / s.   Now, let us assume that the combined mass of the second hand, minute hand, and hour hand is 1 gram, for simplicity's sake (weight of a paper clip), or 0.001 kg. In one day, the number of rotations the second hand makes is 24 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 1440 rotations, the number of rotations the minute hand makes is 24 (1 per hour), and the hour hand makes 2 rotations. Of all the three hands, let us assume a uniform radius of 1 cm or 0.01 m for each. The distance traveled by the second hand is 1440 rotations x 2 x pi x 0.01 m = 90.4 m; likewise: 1.5 meters for the minute hand, and 0.1 meters for the hour hand. Therefore, the speed of the second hand is 90.4 m / 86400 seconds per day = 0.001 m/s. Likewise, the speed of the minute hand is 1.74 x 10-5 m/s, and the speed of the hour hand is 1.16 x 10-6 m/s. The average of these three speeds is calculated to be 0.00034 m/s.   The angular momentum then of one watch is L = (0.001 kg) x (0.00034 m/s) x (0.01 m) = 3.4 x 10-9 kg x m2 / s. Let's assume that the number of watches in existence is one for each human (say 7 billion). The total angular momentum of the 7 billion watches is then 23.8 kg x m2 / s. If we divide this by the angular momentum of the Earth, we find that watches comprise of approximately 8.9 x 10-38 % of Earth's angular momentum. Multiplying this by the number of seconds in Earth's ordinary day, we finally calculate an extension in time of 7.7 x 10-33 seconds. For comparison, according to Wikipedia, the effect of the tidal torque from the moon only shortens Earth's day by 65.7 nanoseconds per day (65.7 x 10-9). The Earth's natural fluctuations in rotational speed are far greater than any effect of all the watches on Earth.  Edit: deleted a redundancy."

So it may not be the case that clocks have a net clockwise spin at all... I think it we'd have to bust open a watch or two to be certain. In any case I presume that the clockwise spin would certainly be reduced by the counterclockwise spin on the mechanisms inside.  I imagine we might get more of an effect from something like wind farms, where there's more weight spinning and fewer gears involved. An interesting thought experiment might be ""how many wind turbines would it take to shorten the day by one second (and where would they have to be located to achieve this effect)"""

theydidthemath,3dbrwi,wheep,5,Wed Jul 15 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"The recommendations for fluid intake are 6-8 8-oz glasses of water a day. I'll use the low end of this, and round 8 oz to 250 mL for sake of calculations. This means you need 1.5 L of water from liquids per day.  Based on assumptions I've made so far: The total amount of water for 25 years is 13,687.5 L. Some people drink more or less, and I would think 12-year-olds onward drink a consistent amount of water.  As far as infants and children, 100-150 ml/kg is an appropriate amount for infants and toddlers, putting their needs in the 1L range. That source doesn't say anything about older children, so I will draw the line at 7 years old. This accounts for an overestimation of my original estimate of 1278 L.  So I would say the amount of liquid people drink by age 25 is about 12,500 L (which is, coincidentally, 500 L a year).  I equated water with any kind of liquid because liquids we drink are mostly water, and contribute to overall hydration (even diuretics like coffee)."
theydidthemath,3dbrwi,jt4,3,Wed Jul 15 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm going to start by assuming that I drink 1.5l/day, which seems fairly reasonable given some counting and multiplying that I've just done in my head.   Let's also assume that the amount of liquid you drink is proportional to your size. Graphing a person's weight over time looks sort of like a square root graph, at least through 25 yrs.   Set p to fraction of mass at 25 yrs, so p(25)=1. This means that p(t)=0.2*t0.5 . Multiply that by 1.5 to get the amount of water per day for w(t)=0.3*t0.5 .  The integral of w(t) from 0 to 25 is 25, which means I've done this wrong and need some sleep."

theydidthemath,3d9tpt,JustM3AQN,5,Tue Jul 14 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"this is rather relevant https://what-if.xkcd.com/13/  practically speaking, if you are using magic laser to vaporize regolith in some [presumably] circular area, the stuff doesn't disappear - it is becoming plasma. Said Plasma will shield the hole from the laser, leading to problems. depending on the specifics, the end scenario in the relevant XKCD happens - you end up just (literally) rocketing the moon away.  On the other hand, you can consider the theoretical energy to lift a cylinder through the sphere of the moon of material to escape velocity..."
theydidthemath,3d9tpt,ABZB,5,Tue Jul 14 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"This is a hard one because of all the assumptions.   So lets say that by burning a hole through the moon you mean to melt a hole through it. The melting point of minerals such as quartz, olivine etc. range from 600 and 1200 °C (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/meltrock.html). So lets say moon rocks melt at 1200 °C.  Now the heat capacity of basalt (a rock similar to moon rock) is 0.84 J kg-1 K-1 (http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html). The temperature of the moon is varies from 100 °C and -173 °C depending on time of day (http://www.space.com/14725-moon-temperature-lunar-days-night.html). Lets take the average so dT = 1200 - -37.5 = 1237.5 °C and so the amount of energy per unit mass to melt the rock is 0.84 * 1237.5 = 1040 J kg-1 .  Lets assume we want to melt a cylinder right through the centre of the moon with a radius of 1m. The density of the moon is 3340 kg m-3 and the radius is 1740 km (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon). So the mass of this cylinder is,   3340 kg m-3 * [; \pi  ;] m2 * 2 * 1.74*106 m = 3.65 * 1010 kg  So now we know the energy we must deliver to melt the cylinder,   3.65 * 1010 kg* 1040 J kg-1 = 3.8 * 1013 J  Ok so the amount of energy we get from the sun per unit area is L/(4 [; \pi  ;] d2 ), where L is the luminosity of the Sun, 3.86 * 1026 W (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) , and d is the distance between the Sun and the Earth, 1.5 * 1011 m (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit). So we receive,  3.86 * 1026 W / (4 * [; \pi  ;] * (1.5 * 1011 m)2 ) =1365 W m-2 .  So dividing the two numbers we discover the area of perfect mirrors we would need times by the time we wish to take, assuming perfect transmission to all the material,  3.8 * 1013 J / 1365 W m-2 = 2.8 * 1010 m2 s.  This means that we would require 2.8 * 1010 m2 of mirrors if we wish to melt a hole in the Moon in one second. Which isn't that big really, the area of the Albania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania) which is 28,748 km2 . If however we have a 1m2 mirror it would take 2.8 * 1010 seconds to melt the hole through the Moon, which is 887 years.  TL;DR It would take just less than a millennium for a 1 m2 mirror to melt a cylinder with a radius of 1m through the centre of the Moon. Or it would take 1 second for an entirely mirror covered Albania."

I don't know the exact amount of millionares but think of it this way. 1826 people were billionaires in 2015 according to forbes. Billionaires alone cover the last 9 Olympics or 18 years.  CNBC reported on 6/24/15 that there are 35 million millionares globally. That covers the last 175,000 Olympics or the last 350,000 years.

Not to mention the fact you have to be born with specific genes that allow you to have that talent in the first place.  4% of the American population (12 million) have a salary of $100,000 or more. If you were able to put away 50% of this (in a 2-income household, this is doable), you would be a millionaire in 20 years. Granted, that doesn't take into account loans (which, if you buy something like a house, doesn't lower your net worth, but would if it's a student loan).

theydidthemath,3d9g8k,elephantmath,3,Tue Jul 14 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"If your elephant is truly using a monstrous marshmallow as a flotation device, the problem isn't going to be balance; it will be buoyancy.  We need a marshmallow that can provide enough buoyant force to offset the weight of the elephant – essentially, a marshmallow raft. For the sake of this argument, I'm going to make a number of (potentially asinine) assumptions: I'll assume that marshmallows retain their maximum buoyancy indefinitely; I'll assume the elephant does not crush a hole through the middle; I'll assume sogginess is a non-factor (maybe we sealed them with something super hydrophobic?); and I'll assume we cannot actually create a water-tight, ""hollow"" vessel out of marshmallow, and therefore the elephants feet can never be below the waterline – this simplifies the math by making the necessary buoyant force exactly equal to the mass of the marshmallow plus the mass of the elephant.   At this level, the bottommost molecule of the elephant's foot will just abut the topmost molecule of water...because pure math allows for this level of precision. And while reality may not, it also doesn't really allow for marshmallow elephant rafts. Moral is: reality's the bad guy here. As I was saying, this occurs when the marshmallow displaces water equal to the expression we just listed: m(Water displaced) = m(Marshmallow) + m(Elephant).  Water (and hot chocolate, for all intents and purposes) has a density of 1 g/cm3. Marshmallow has a density of 0.21 g/cm3. (I was impressed how well documented this density is.) An elephant has a mass of about 15,400lb (about 7x106 grams) – or at least that's the first thing that pops up on Google.  Let's get to mathing.  The amount of water that's displaced is equal to the volume of submerged marshmallow – which in our case will be all of the marshmallow. This means that the volume of water and the volume of marshmallow are equal. We'll set these equal in a minute, but we can't forget about our elephant friend. We need to add the mass of the elephant to the side of the equation with the marshmallow; we'll call this F(Down).  F(Down): V*(.21g/cm3)+(7x106g)  On the other side we have the buoyant force of the water; because the volume of the marshmallow and the water is equal, we'll keep the same variable.  F(Up): V*(1g/cm3)  We can set them equal, tap our friend Wolfram on the back, and ask for some simplification, and we get: V=8.86x106cm3.   This is just about 9,000 liters of marshmallow – or something like 4,100 one-pound bags of marshmallows. FWIW, it would be trivial to distribute these such that an elephant would have no trouble balancing; e.g., a 10' x 6' x 6"" slab.  To be honest, this seems like a surprisingly small number of marshmallows, which belies the erroneousness of earlier assumptions. However, given the dry mass and density of a marshmallow, this does seem to be the way things shake out. Or I f'ed something up royally, which has been known to happen to the best of us.  Happy roasting!"

Ratio of Earth to a Softball is 169,893,333:1 (Earth Diameter is 12,742km or ~12742000000mm, a softball has a diameter of ~75mm)  Peak of everest + depth of Marina Trench = 8848m + 10971m = 19,819m / 19,819,000mm.  19,819,000mm / 169,893,333 = .11mm difference between the peak and trough on our softball.  According to the ever reliable source of wikipedia, apparently ""the smallest distances the human eye can resolve is around 0.02 to 0.04 mm, approximately the width of a human hair"". While we are just within the realms of visibility at these numbers, I'm going to assume we are talking about a spherical object that is a single color (Crayola Color #173 - Softball White). To some extent there is going to be a gradient, rather than it being a sharp edge. I'm going to say it is just outside the edge of visibility. While it doesn't seem the most reliable of sources, this suggests that we are talking sizes smaller than your fingerprints.  From a touch standpoint, I'm going to run with an answer of maybe. According to this, our sense of touch is incredibly sensitive, and we can feel ""the human finger can discriminate between surfaces patterned with ridges as small as 13 nanometres in amplitude and non-patterned surfaces."" We are well and truly in the realms of being able to feel something this size, although whether feeling a one off lump is any different to feeling a pattern - I'm going to leave it to somebody else if they want to research the point further.  For what it's worth, also might point at this wonderfully formatted page, but it is on the NASA website so it must be right. Apparently the earth is 21.5km flatter at the poles than the equator - Again, probably impossible to notice given it would be a gradual change rather than a sharp spike, but this difference is bigger our peak and trough."

If an orange's radius is 10cm, this implies a pressure of 63 kilopascals is sufficient to juice an orange on contact, or  ( 1 ) 63 kiloPa = 20 kg x 10 N/kg/ (pi*0.01m2 )  To find the required height of oranges requires some algebra, but lets put down what we know first.  ( 2 ) Volume = Area x Height  ( 3 ) Volume = mass of oranges / density of oranges  ( 4 ) Pressure at bottom = 63 kPa = density x height x gravity  equating 1 and 2 I can see that   ( 5 ) Area x height = mass / density  Solving 4 and 5 for h and equating them I find that  ( 6 ) height = 63kPa / (density x gravity) = mass / (density x area)  cancelling the common 1/density, solving for mass gives  mass = 63kPa x area / gravity  So, without knowing anything at all, for any container of any size or shape the mass we need  for an object to crush itself is simply Crushing Pressure x Area / gravity. For oranges in this tube, we'd need an even 200kg of mass.   Based on this science website for kids it appears that if an orange is peeled, it has a density just above water, while if unpeeled it has a density lower than water. Either way, this tells me its in the ballpark of 900 kg / m3. As seen on this wikipedia article (with relevant photo), stacking equally sized spheres reaches a maximum efficiency of 0.74 cubic meters of oranges per cubic meter of space (Proved by Gauss in 1831). In effect, our density will be 0.74 x 900 = 666 kg /m3  since mass = ""effective density"" x volume, and volume = height x area,   height = mass / (effective density x area)  In this case, its 955 meters.   This number is sensitive to my guess of crushing pressure, which might be too high."
theydidthemath,3d812n,zaputo,2,Tue Jul 14 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"A couple things:   Do you mean 10 cm ""diameter"" instead of ""radius""? 10 cm radius would be 20 cm diameter, which is approximately the size of a small cantaloupe.  In your calculation, you used 0.01 m for the radius, but 10 cm is actually 0.1 m. Furthermore, a 10 cm ""diameter"" would be a 0.05 m radius. I will use this for the calculation below.    The actual crushing pressure would be (20 kg x 10 N/kg) / (pi x (0.05m)2) = 25 kPa. The force necessary to achieve this pressure over the area of the bottom of the cylinder would be F = 25 kPa x (pi x (0.5m)2) = 19625 N, or about 2000 kg.   Since we know the ""effective density"" of oranges is approximately 666 kg/m3, we can calculate the volume of oranges necessary to achieve the crushing force of 19625 N (2000 kg): 2000 kg / 666 kg/m3 = 3 m3.

theydidthemath,3d7yrh,tehzerd,3,Tue Jul 14 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding your process correctly, the only time it is possible for the random ID to be the same is if the two transactions happened at the same time down to the millisecond. If that condition is met, then there is a 1 in 10,000 chance of them being assigned the same random number and therefore being assigned the same ID.  I'd imagine the odds of this happening are pretty small, but they are nonzero. Given the number of transactions you take in a given time period, it would be possible to calculate the actual odds of such an event occurring."

theydidthemath,3d7yrh,randomharun,2,Tue Jul 14 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"Let's suppose that your time function starts at x, and when retrieved is multiplied by random number r. The higher the r, the more likely the next rx is at less than the previous rx for r = 1.  Suppose you grab a new ID every millisecond. if x = 1, then rx = r. If r = 1, then the next ID has no chance of being equal to the previous.  We would then have to analyze the 10,000 multiples of each number. If we scanned 10,000 IDs, that would be 100 million possible multiples. So we would have to count all of the common multiples from 1 to 108, then divide that number by 108.  The probability of a match would be continuously declining as the ID generator produced random IDs. A system like this is unfortunately subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  What's the application for? I'm working on a similar engine using generating functions rather than random numbers, so the IDs are always be unique but not random."

theydidthemath,3d238w,Boob_Sweat,110,Mon Jul 13 12:38:05 2015 UTC,Odds are 0. You can pretty much figure this out by going through your list of subreddits and find the ones with the least subscribers. I'm part of subreddits with as low at 800 members. I can pretty much guarantee that none of the 800 people have the same subreddits as I do.  It's going to vastly depend on if you're basic or not though. A lot of people have very niche interests on Reddit. I have multiple niche subreddits that I follow with less than 25K users. I've had friends mention subreddits they follow that I'd never follow and these are people I share a lot of interests with.

In other words, real people do not subscribe to a random 25 of the 853,824 subs, but a build a list based on interests and those interests may be shared with other users. Not to mention that many of those 853,824 subs are ridiculously obscure and can be ignored for the majority of redditors.

theydidthemath,3d238w,RyanGaussling,15,Tue Jul 14 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"It depends how you assume subscriptions are distributed.  For the most extreme case, let's assume that all of those subreddits are public and that each account has a 50% chance of being subscribed to any particular subreddit. In that case, there are 2853824 possible combinations, all equally likely. This is roughly 4.3*10257026, a very large number. Divide that by 36 million and it makes essentially no difference, you end up with about 1.2*10257019. So the chances are on the order of 1 in 1.2*10257019 (actually slightly less, but it doesn't account for much) that anyone has exactly the same set of subscriptions as you.  Of course, the real case isn't nearly so hopeless. Most accounts aren't subscribed to anywhere near 426912 subreddits. More likely just a few dozen. Also, there are probably correlations between accounts, that is to say, two people who are both subscribed to one subreddit are much more likely to both be subscribed to certain other related subreddits. Both of these facts improve the chances enormously. However, it's prohibitively difficult to account for all the variables and come up with a firm figure. Moreover, the chances would drop very quickly with the number of subreddits you're subscribed to, so whether you're subscribed to 10 or 50 could make the difference between 'well within the realm of possibility' and 'ridiculously unlikely'."

As people nowadays do eat more, but probably not as much as the typical American male adult,nooffense I will use the figure of 135 grams.

The biggest issue I ran into was she doesn't wear any rings so I had nothing to work from. Working with a specific timetable I had to get the ring size that night.  The Mission - Size her ring finger while she sleeps.  10pm. Target has been in bed for roughly 25min. Need to wait until she's deep asleep. Too soon.  10:30pm. Target is now deep asleep. First problem - dog is in the room. Dog posses risk. Get dog out.  10:35pm. Dog is out. Risk level low.  10:45pm. Fashioned a ring-like device from a twist tie to measure estimated size.  10:50pm. Breached bedroom entrance. Belly-crawled up to bed. Shit. Hand is tucked in. Lightly irritated target's arm. Hand is free. Wait patiently.  10:53pm. No sign of target waking up. Re-positioned fingers to single out ring finger. Slipped twist tie thingermabob around finger, gently closed, estimated ring size captured.  11:10pm. Extraction occurs. Silent. Slow. One with the shadows. Mission successful.  I took the twist tie loop and compared it against an online measurement guide provided by the website where I did the ring (gemvara) and after adjusting for image size errors and slightly inaccurate measuring methods on my behalf, I was able to pick a size that worked out amazingly.  I told her this story after I proposed and she loves retelling it."

I've looked at the pictures and I can't find anything that would help as a starting point - the costa cup is the closest, but I don't know the dimensions. I can say though her finger is roughly 3/4 the size of the inner handle.  Do you live together? If not, do you have a key to her place? Is there anything she owns that could give a hint at the size? Maybe she has a pair of small scissors or even better...cuticle scissors. Measure that and take off a full ring size."

I know her fingers must be smaller than my own so at the very least a size down from my fingers should be fine assuming they can be re-sized. That's why I thought using a flat image working out a ratio and then using the costa coffee dimensions as a starting point in conjunction with a ratio from one of the image to how parts of her finger sizes scale up and then just convert that to the costa coffee cup would be a good bet. I'll look through her stuff to see if there is anything useful, but I don't think there is anything reliable other than the phone here. What else might I be able to look for?"

Best strategy I could think of would be to take this picture (uncensored of course), and import it into some CAD program with some universal measuring check system. (I'd use AutoCAD)  I choose this picture because of what you said, it'd be the image that is the best candidate for determining her finger ratio. The camera seems to have taken a good picture of the two of you where your features aren't at some angle (you're flat-out just facing the camera straight on).  So, measure a feature of yourself (say your nose, or length across eye,  or a finger of yours), so that you know this exact, certain dimension. Import this image into AutoCAD and use the SCALE command after selecting the image. You'd be able to select two points (your chosen feature like your eye) and input the actual measurement. Your chosen image will now be scaled to real life units and you could use the MEASURE command to measure the diameter of your girlfriend's finger.  From there, you may use simple math to figure out her ring size!    SUPER SHITTY EXAMPLE  I chose a shittier image as an example, but I chose to write this example so you could get my gist, feel free to uncensor your fingers so I could use the other image I was referring to.  1) I assumed your dog's nose was 2.5 units in length across. I chose the nose because of the angle it had in the image.  2) I told AutoCAD my assumption.  3) I measured each of her fingers based on these lines.    Pinky: 1.45 units Ring:  1.70 units Middle: 1.80 units Index: 1.60 units   So, from this angle, of this terrible image I chose, your girlfriend's fingers are (relative to the length of your dog's nose):   Pinky: 58% Ring:  68% Middle: 72% Index: 64%"

Have you gotten to the point in your life where 2-3 summers are non-stop weddings?  Its less about getting down on one knee and proposing but rather giving her something that should have been a proposal to her because she may have wanted it to happen. That thought may occur before she ever opens the box or you have a chance to speak and if she is pro-proposal she will be disappointed with whatever you give her.  In my experience with others who made the same mistake, the vast majority of SO's through the ring box was a proposal and felt disappointed. Generally these confessions only come up years afterwards and/or after they were married.  It may even cast doubts on your ability to commit to her which depending on your age is a relationship death sentence. One of my good friends broke it off with her boyfriend because it lead to a line of questioning where he never saw himself marring her and she just ended up.

The left ring finger is slightly cut of, and the right one's at a bad angle, so then I measured her middle fingers. Both middle fingers came to 55 pixels, measured in the middle of the first joint, where you'd wear a ring.  What is the diameter of the phone camera at its widest point? It's obscured a bit in the picture that has the measuring tape on that side, so I can't tell for sure.  If you have the measurement of the phone camera, it looks like her middle finger would be that diameter * (55/49), or about 12% larger.  I just tried on some rings, and my middle finger is about 1/2 size larger than my ring finger. This seems to be pretty standard. So if you can work out the size for her middle finger, then size down half a size, that should get you in the ballpark.  Good luck!"

theydidthemath,3d4ltt,jewjitsu121,4,Mon Jul 13 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'll use SI units for the calculation, because of course one should. The speed of Earth's rotation is 465 m/s on the equator. Simple trigonometry suggests it will be 465*cos(x) m/s at x degrees N/S latitude. Centrifugal acceleration is v2/r = 0.03396 cos2(x) m/s2 (Calculation).  Since gravity is towards the center and centrifugal force normal to the axis of rotation, the acceleration component against gravity will be 0.03396 cos3(x) m/s2. 150 lb is 68.0 kg, which yields a maximum force of 68.0*0.03396 = 2.31N on the equator. This corresponds to about 235g (0.518 lb) mass. So a person whose weight shows up as 150 lb on a weighing scale at the equator would weigh roughly 150.52 lb. This difference would be lesser away from the equator by a factor cos3(latitude in degrees) (for example, about 0.234 lb in NYC).  For technicality, weight is defined as the gravitational pull of Earth (or some other astronomical entity). This figure shows how different a measuring scale's reading would be."

theydidthemath,3cyf91,Zigthel,2,Sun Jul 12 02:23:58 2015 UTC,"Your friend did the calculation wrong.   In 162 game season, the average team pitches 1454 innings with 6131 plate appearances; so the average inning has 4.2 plate appearances (using 2014 numbers).  Your friend assumed 3 plate appearances per inning.  Your leadoff hitter will have 50 plate appearances, when there have been 9*49+1=442 plate appearances.  442 plate appearances should happen in about 442 PA/(4.2 PA/inning) ~ 105 innings.  Granted, no MLB game has gone longer than 26 innings, and we are still assuming a home run in every plate appearance (which is ridiculous -- even if a player had the ability, he would be intentionally walked before he got past 5 consecutive homeruns)."
theydidthemath,3cyf91,SnakeFarmer,2,Sun Jul 12 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"The assumption in blue is that every PA is an AB and applies the HR/AB rate, then figures out how many innings (roughly) it takes to get enough ABs to get 50HRs. Even still you're absolutely right in that eventually that batter would be getting walked, but we're also ignoring that both teams would run out of pitchers, assuming this game continued until the 50HR in a game mark was reached.  Also, you're totally right in that I assumed that there would only be 3 batters per inning, so we'd have to adjust the amount of innings to account for an offset of one batter forward every 30 innings or so.

But it seemed weird to assume one guy bats 1.000 with all homers, but also had mixed in walks and hit by pitch at normal rates.  I'd think if you hit 5 HRs in a row, you are only getting IBB or HBP unless we exclude IBB and HBP for this special player in our crazy initial assumption.  That said, I didn't correct for the fact that our scenario has 8 regular players (who average 4.2 PA/inning), and one superstar who only hits HRs and never creates an out during this game.  If I factored that in, then the average batter creates (3 outs/inning)/(4.2 PA/inning) ~ 0.71 outs/PA, but our special guy creates 0 outs.  Therefore going through the order once, creates just 8*0.71 ~ 5.68 outs, which would take 1.893 innings.  Hence 9 PAs/1.893 innings ~ 4.75 PAs/inning, which means it really only takes ~93 innings for one player to get 50 plate appearances if that one player never creates outs.

This link,   http://talkingpointsmemo.com/idealab/satellites-earth-orbit  Offers us a combined number of 3700 satellites in orbit, both functional and non-functional. To account for satellites man-made but not in orbit (as well as space junk), let's bump this number to a  nice round 4000 satellites. (It won't have that much effect on our percentage.). Also from this site we get a rough estimate on the size of each satellite. It says here that most satellites are between roughly the size of a school bus to the size of a rubik's cube.   For the sake of argument let's assume every man-made satellite in orbit around earth is schoolbus sized. Most school buses are around 8 feet tall, 8 feet wide, and 40 feet long. This gives us a volume per satellite of 2560ft3, or 72.5m3. Multiplying by the number of satellites, we get 289,960m3 of the total space taken up by man-made satellites.   Given that the end of the Oort cloud is way out there at 100000AU away from the sun, and is so in all directions, we get a radius of 1.496x1016m, roughly two light years. With this number we get a volume of space equal to 1.4x1049m3.   If we divide the total volume of satellites by this number then we will get the desired fraction.   This number is so small I had to go to wolframalpha to get it.  volume by percent = 2.0675*10-42  or without notation.   .00000000000000000000000000000000000000000020675% of that volume."

In nearly all depcitions, particularly the 1933 film and the 2005 film, King Kong is 40 to 50 feet tall, or about 14 meters. The tallest gorillas are about 1.7 meters tall and weigh in around 160 kg. Assuming that the cube-square law holds and King Kong has features proportional to a wild gorilla, then a ~ 8.25x increase in height would correspond to a ~560x increase in weight. Here is a picture of Batman kicking a gorilla. So, King Kong probably weighs about 89 tons. This number seems high to me, but it serves as a nice upper bound.  This is about the weight of 1100 humans. The advised occupancy level for the Empire State Building is about 13,500 humans, so the weight that King Kong adds is easily lower than that bound.  Another way to think about this is that King Kong is about the size of the biplanes he fights. In 1945 a B-25 crashed into the Empire State Building, which did not compromise the building's structural integrity. These forces would likely be much higher than anything King Kong did to the building.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  TLDR: The Empire State Building could almost certainly handle King Kong. It can take the weight of 13,500 humans easily, and King Kong only weighs the same as about 1,100. King Kong wouldn't even be the worst thing that ever happened to that building."

theydidthemath,3cww2c,Awilen,2,Sun Jul 12 07:56:44 2015 UTC,"By converting to pressure, the energy transfer is already normalized to area.   The energy transfer is faster, but no greater in magnitude  The only difference it could make that would be of any consequence is that it could cause part of your own body to accelerate, and rapid acceleration of certain body parts, notably the head, can cause death. This has nothing to do with energy transfer though.  But let's consider 1083 N applied directly to the head, which is about 5 kg in mass for an average adult. Assuming that at the moment of impact the head acts like a free body which can move independantly of the rest of the body, and that a person has a tennis ball pressed lightly against their head when it is struck by Serena while serving, this would produce an acceleration for the head of 22g. G tolerance decreases with duration, so the longer an acceleration is maintained, the lower the threshold to cause damage, or inversely, the shorter time the acceleration is applied over, the more gs someone can withstand. Based on what wikipedia says, an average person should be able to survive somewhere between 30 and 40 g along the horizontal axis for periods on the order of .01 s without impairment. There may be some particular axis along which human tolerance for acceleration is greatly reduced (for example it looks like an impact from the side might be over the threshold), or it's possible an off center impact could induce a torque which opens up its own can of worms, but this implies that a tennis ball hitting someone squarely on the forehead at point blank range would not cause loss of consciousness, nonetheless death for an average person. Obviously when we take into account the fact that our heads are attached to our much more massive bodies and tennis balls lose energy as they fly through the air and as such require much less force to decelerate than initially accelerate, it seems safe to say an impact would be survivable."

I'm on mobile and I'm not even sure precisely what math I'd need to do, but I'm fairly confident that in some scenarios 1083N of force (from the post by /u/diamondisjustcarbon) must be enough to kill someone. For example, if you held a knife horizontally with the point at your jugular and the hilt pointed at Serena and her serve hit the hilt dead on.   Probably a bit of a cop out answer though - you could just as well say ""she could hit someone who was teetering on the edge of a cliff and knock them off""."

Good comment though."
theydidthemath,3cww2c,tilled,3,Sat Jul 11 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know about Serena, but her brother killed a line umpire.  In all seriousness, a tennis ball is supposed to have a mass of 56 grams. Google says Sam Groth can serve one at 263 km/hr = 73 m/s. That is a kinetic energy of 1/2(0.056 kg)(73)2 J = 150 J. This ignores the fact the tennis ball slows down after it is hit. If we assume that all that energy goes into trying to kill a person over an area one-tenth the cross-sectional area of the 7 cm diameter tennis ball (because it's round and elastic and this is a guess), (0.00385 m2)/10, we find 390 kJ/m2 is the density of the energy at impact.  That's 39 J/cm2. This paper would suggest that a 50% risk of penetration requires between 24 and 53 J/cm2, depending on where the object strikes (assuming it hit the chest). These results are for a rubber bullet.  In this paper, it says that it would take over 10 J /cm2 to "" penetrate and cause internal injuries"". Like the other paper, this paper refers to so-called reduced energy projectiles, rubber bullets, and cites a case where one ended up in the lung. It is worth noting the patient they talk about lived.  Now a tennis ball isn't a rubber bullet, so the chances of it penetrating are far less: there's no way a hollow tennis ball would fit into a region penetrated by the front part of the ball as it hits you. If we changed our assumptions a little bit and assumed this energy of the ball is distributed across its entire cross-sectional area, then it would have no where near enough energy/unit area to penetrate into you and injure you, let alone kill you.  As far as I can find, the only case reported regarding ""death by tennis ball"" was mentioned by Xanados: Dick Wertheim. And that was confounded by the poor fellow hitting his head on the hard ground.  TL/DR: if you were standing right in front of the tennis ball as Sam Groth hit it at you at a record speed, you'd definitely feel it and it'd hurt, leaving a nasty welt, and you'd live through the experience."

theydidthemath,3cyjqd,sillybammy,10,Sat Jul 11 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"The sun would have to be almost exactly at the other side of the hole, because at even a small angle the light would have to bounce an incredible amount of times off of the material in the center of the earth before it would reach you.   But I would think it's possible, as I cannot think of anything stopping the light of the sun coming through. Perhaps the light emitted by the center of the earth is overwhelming, but I have no idea and googling light emitted by center of the earth yield no results."
theydidthemath,3cyjqd,ADdV,4,Sat Jul 11 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: NOT A PHYSICIST  Assuming the ""sun directly on the other side"" scenario, I would think a major problem would be air density. Earth is apparently 12,742 km in diameter, on average. I think I have read that for fluids (like liquids and gases) in a gravity well, the pressure of the fluid at any point depends on the height of the column of fluid above that point as well as the force of gravity at that point and the characteristic(s?) of the fluid itself. So the column of air gets really really big if you have that tunnel through the earth.  This person says the air would eventually become solid because of crazy air pressure. However, maybe it would still be translucent or something?  Anyway, now we're looking at a cylinder of air, only as dense as the air we breathe now at either end, but gradually becoming more and more dense until it's solid (!) in the middle. Assuming it has any translucency, then maybe the key to this problem is figuring out how much light could be expected to penetrate that very calculus-seeming gradation of air density/refraction/whatever, and if any is left after 12,000+km, would it be in a quantity (photons per second?) that a human eye could detect.  Perhaps this helped; perhaps not. It's certainly easier to imagine that the tube is a vacuum; but then it's not interesting if the sun is right on the other side; of course we can see the sun through 12,000 km of vacuum--we can see it through 150 million km of vacuum all the time.  If the tube does not look directly at the sun, then even the vacuum might not help, because now (maybe?) it's a matter of calculating the angle of the light entering the tunnel at the other end, maybe the shape of the tunnel, and the reflectivity of the tunnel at all its various depths. How much would magma reflect light? No idea. Granite might reflect more, if it had a lot of quartz in it or something, and especially if the tunnel was smooth and polished--is it? Or is it rough? And the crust is only a tiny portion of the tunnel's length...  Final thing I can think of: I have no idea whether there are any two points exactly opposite each other on earth that are both on dry land and would make a 10-foot-diameter tunnel pointing directly at the sun at any point during the year. That might have to be worked out, too."

Or more like solid lead? I have no idea. And there will be more and less dense regions, as well, which might make a difference for translucence."
theydidthemath,3cyjqd,bobbyfiend,5,Tue Jul 14 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"Even if we assume the hole is re-enforced to stop the magma from getting in and has all the air sucked out of it to stop any sort of dense air effects due to the immense pressure at the core, only some of the light will get through because the earth is rotating so fast.   The earth is a sphere of approximated radius 6378km meaning at the equator (where the hole would have to be in-order for the sun to be shinning straight enough to go directly into the hole and only on the fall and spring equinoxes) the surface of the earth is rotating with speed (2pi6378km)/1 day which is ~464 m/s. Since the hole is only 10 feet wide this means that a photon of light needs to enter the beginning of the hole on the day side and go out the bottom of the hole before that end has rotated more than the width of the opening.  The speed of light is 3x108 m/s so the time for light to travel through earth is 4.25 milliseconds. In this time the bottom will have rotated 1.97 meters or 6.46 feet so only light that has started 6.46 feet away from the edge will make it through in time. So the question is what percentage of light is that? Assuming a square hole with 10 feet sides  an area of 100 square feet of light is 100% of the light. Only the light started 6.46 feet away form the side makes it through so this is (10-6.46)x10 feet or 35.4 square feet of light or 35.4% of it at maximum alignment. Also remember that light can only pass through when the sun is directly over head, since it takes 6.57 milliseconds for the holes to completely miss align and 4.25 milliseconds for light to travel through, this effect will only happens for 6.57-4.25=2.32 milliseconds a day.

This infographic is bad and the makers of the infographic should feel bad.  EDIT 2: Missed a line from my original calculations (Medical school loan debt) and mis-cited Undergraduate Loan Debt (added the correct citation as footnote 3.5). Not changing any calculations, but another reason why the # hours for a med school degree are overestimated: M1s get the summer off and M2s get half the summer off. This means that the 320 hours/month that I estimated would technically be about 425 hours/month, which would be absurd assuming that med students use ~425 of their 480 waking hours per month on studying. Also,   [1] Source - 8 semesters * 15 credit hours/semester * 3 actual hours per week/credit hours * 16 weeks/semester  [2] Couldn't find a reliable source on this. Only consistent reported thing was that M1/M2 was more burdensome than M3/M4. The infographic's numbers state ~320 hours/month, which seems really high, so I kept that for M1/M2 and reduced it by ~40 hours/month for M3/M4.  [3] Source - made a weighted average (total residents/mth * hours/week / total residents/month) to get 53.6 hours/week, * 50 weeks (assuming 2 vacation weeks) * 4 years  [3.5] Source  [4] Source  [5] Used google's interest calculator to get total cost of $196750 at 7.5% interest at 20 years as $380401. The link lists a different number because it's calculating just the medical school debt over 30 years.  [6] 35 total years (65 - (22 + 4 + 4) * Salary(avg) * (1-.28 (tax burden))  [7] Source - 4 total years * Salary(avg) (derived from source) * (1-.28 (tax burden))  [8] 35 total years * 52 hours/week * 50 weeks/year (assuming 2 weeks vacation)  [9] Interestingly enough, this value isn't rows 2-4 added.

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,SkiDude,26,Sat Jul 11 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"Most teachers still work over the summer, though not as much, average work per weak for a teacher likely approaches 50 hours including summer."

Three of my closest friends, my wife, and both in-laws are teachers, and they stop doing all teaching-related activities the day after the last day of school, and they will resume one week before the school starts.   I know this because my wife is right here, not working, and my friends are exploring this nation's campsites in their van.   A teacher couple with some basic financial literacy in a decent market can outdo high earners in terms of quality of life. Example, if they bought a small house in a good area, the equity and appreciation they build can provide long-term financial cushioning, and the 8+ weeks of vacation they get all at once is a luxury even doctors and engineers can't have."

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Martenz05,3,Sat Jul 11 15:51:44 2015 UTC,~1/3 of the year not working?  You made that up.  You also just described working for pay.  Not pay for no work.    Also it's atypical for teachers to get sent across the country for conferences with any regularity.  And certainly not as often as doctors.  My wife has attended a couple conferences herself.  This was work and the pay was baked into her salary.    So... yes.  What you said was false.
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,lynxloco,145,Sat Jul 11 18:18:40 2015 UTC,The graphic significantly under-estimates the number of hours a teacher works in their professional life.  It also calculates total lifetime earnings while ignoring inflation and present vs future value issues.
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,bobbyfiend,51,Sat Jul 11 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"Not only is it under-estimating the number of hours a teacher works, it neglects to take into account that many of those hours are effectively unpaid work. The majority of teachers I know have regularly had to prepare and grade tests in their off-hours, to get everything done on time."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Hamilton950B,11,Sat Jul 11 06:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, can confirm. My mom (a biology teacher) often spends more than 3 hours on preparing the next day."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,mutatron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:13:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. Yes. Yes. Every teacher I've ever known, at any level, (a) works more than 8 hours per day (usually around 50+ hours per week) and (b) works a good portion of their summer.   Teachers (especially K-12) also tend to drop a significant chunk of their own earnings back into buying materials and paying for travel and services directly necessary to do their jobs (though I don't know how much MDs do of that, too).  Finally: Are all of these assuming only a BA/BS for teachers? Many states require a Master's degree for K-12 teachers, and in many other cases it's not technically required, but there are very strong pressures (of the ""or you're not getting a job"" variety) to have one.  And I hope the calculations are factoring in required student teaching and other experiences that pay zero or minimal amounts.  I, too, think that infographic is quantifiably full of crap."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,ninerdawg,7,Sun Jul 12 01:08:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't just ignore present vs future value, it uses the concept in favor of doctors. Adding in the interest on the student loan means they are using the future value of the cost of education; but they are using the present value of salary. Since the doctor's costs are heavily front loaded, this favors the doctor."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,dapt,29,Sat Jul 11 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"You can't really take averages for doctors, though. My daughter's a resident, so she's making $60k, and working probably 80 hours a week at the hospital. She also studies at home, but that's on her, because not everybody does that.  After three years of residency she could start at $190k, then go up to around $250k after 5 years, or she could do a three year fellowship to go into pulmonary critical care. In the second option, she would make 65-70k for three more years, and then start at $275k, and then be at $350k after about 5 years.  So that's more like 11-14 million dollars in her lifetime, assuming she works until she's 70, as many doctors who love their profession do. She's also paying off all her undergrad loans as fast as she can, paying med school loans with Income Based Repayment, and she plans to work in public hospitals so whatever's left after 10 years will be forgiven. If that law changes, she'll just pay off her loan more quickly with the larger salary she'll be making by then. Her med school debt is about $160,000, so it's not going to be that hard to pay down fast by that point if she has to, and the interest at this point is only around $10,000/year.  Once she gets out of residency, she won't be doing 80 hour weeks anymore either, unless it's two weeks on and two weeks off. She might still study a lot, because she likes to study and teach, but that's her thing, not all doctors do that, so it doesn't really count against work hours for these purposes.  So this infographic underestimates lifetime earnings, and overestimates lifetime hours worked by quite a lot for quite a few doctors.  Not only that, but because she's good with money, she'll have tons more disposable income than teachers can usually manage, which she will be able to sock away into a retirement fund, and still have plenty left for riskier but higher gaining investments. This is a big advantage to having a large income if you don't spend it all.  Finally, the one big advantage that being a doctor has over any other profession, is that it's the only profession where you get to be a doctor."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Tony_Chu,75,Sat Jul 11 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, its bullshit. First, its not even self-consistent. They show the teacher getting a pension, but not the doctor. Doctors get pensions, or at least 403(b) plans. Second, they assume debt related to getting an undergrad for the doctor, but not the teacher. (And average undergrad debt in the us is about $24k, not the 100k they assume.) Third, medical school is not 2.5 times longer than undergrad school as depicted in the infographic - its also a 4 year degree. Fourth, they say that training to be a doctor is equivalent to working full time for 20 years after high school. But then they assume the doctor is starting to earn money at age 29.   So, yes, its bullshit."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,dapt,10,Sat Jul 11 03:10:59 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like it includes residency correctly either. While technically ""training"", doctors earn an income during this period, another poster below cites that as $60k per year."

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,cmubigguy,11,Mon Jul 13 00:31:46 2015 UTC,Actually the pension a doctor receives is highly dependent on their employer since they can be employed privately or by the government.  Source: related to a doctor.
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Martenz05,14,Sat Jul 11 03:30:46 2015 UTC,"But so can teachers. Many work for private schools, which probably further skews the teacher salary."

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,grandstaff,11,Sat Jul 11 03:39:25 2015 UTC,So? Doesn't the average doctor get some kind of retirement plan from their employer?
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,mithoron,5,Sat Jul 11 06:34:20 2015 UTC,"No.  Most doctors are employed via PSCs.  Effectively, they form their own company to manage their own practice (even when their company is employed by a hospital)."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,ProblyAThrowawayAcct,4,Sat Jul 11 11:19:55 2015 UTC,"Even then, they're going to get some sort of additional monetary value beyond salary, whether it's matching contributions to retirement savings or a pension.  Plus doctors get really good health insurance. Teachers less so."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,MaskedSociopath,2,Sat Jul 11 13:24:09 2015 UTC,"Teachers were dependent on the size of the district that employed them (my info is pre-ACA so insert grain of salt here, this might have changed).  Having only worked in small to tiny districts my health insurance was always crap."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,ninerdawg,2,Sat Jul 11 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"Difference is, a teacher at a private school gets a lower-than-average salary, on average, while a doctor in private practice tends to see an increased value, between salary and equity.  Private schools come in a range of types, but the dominant (religious) ones tend to rely on the post-mortem benefits package."

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,jt4,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:38:39 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt about it, there can be huge variation in the type and quality of retirement plan a doctor can have.

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Tony_Chu,-3,Sat Jul 11 09:51:44 2015 UTC,They also assume that doctors will all be taking loans for the entirety of their schooling. In my experience pre-med kids come from parents who are already doctors (aka wealthy enough to pay for their college)  or are just outright smart and have some sort of scholarship or aid.

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Sagarmatra,13,Sat Jul 11 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"My wife is a high school English teacher.    She is required to have a masters, as are most high school teachers.  The cost of this is not present in the infographic, though all of the scholastic costs of becoming a doctor are.  Also the time of this is not part of the infographic, though all of the scholastic time required to become a doctor is.  She also, like most teachers, has to spend her personal money in order to provide a lot of the supplies to the classroom.  She gets a budget for her classroom, but it is ridiculously small compared to need.  Remember borrowing a pencil from your teacher when you forgot yours?  Remember the box of markers you could use?  The books on the shelf in the back of the room you could borrow?  The decorations around the room?  Various materials brought for various lessons?  Your teacher probably payed for most/all of that out of pocket.  Therefore, the cost of becoming a teacher is higher, and the time spent preparing to be a teacher is higher.  The numerator will be lower for the final division for teaching, and the denominator will be higher.    Additionally, the infographic makes no attempt to justify its claim about the number of hours worked being a teacher.  My wife gets to work early in order to prep for the day's lessons.  She stays late to work with kids and to make her requisite contributions to after school functions (attend childrens' recitals, award ceremonies, run the speech and debate club, after school tutoring, parent teacher conferences, ongoing training, etc).  When she gets home she begins working on lesson plans which is extensive work.  She also has a lot of grading.  When I see the stack of essays she brings home it makes my heart sink.  Reading a bunch of mediocre essays written by bored children which are all about the same thing seems like an exquisite hell to me, but she is invested in the children's success so it is easier for her, I suppose.    Bottom line:  The cost of becoming a teacher is higher than this infographic suggests.    The time spent becoming a licensed teacher is higher than this infographic suggests.    The time spent working as a teacher is higher than this infographic suggests.    My wife currently makes ~20 dollars an hour and we will be paying on student loans for a long time.    The infographic is total nonsense.  You have only to look at the houses and cars that doctors have compared to those of teachers to realize that any claims regarding economic parity are bullshit.    I don't resent doctors for making a lot of money.  They do difficult and important work.  They also make WAY more than teachers, and this graphic is ridiculous."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,eweidenbener,22,Sat Jul 11 14:45:16 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem here is that they break down the doctor information but leave the teacher information hidden. Who knows how they are manipulating the statistics. The hours teachers work seems minimized and so does the average loan debt to beef up the hourly wage of a teacher, so that for their stats, doctors work for cheaper. No thank you, I am not wasting my time on this math."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Lantro,6,Sat Jul 11 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"Similarly, the doctors seem to pay their student loan twice."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,eweidenbener,4,Sat Jul 11 08:08:15 2015 UTC,"As someone starting med school next year I can tell you the interest rate is horribly inaccurate. Yes, it builds up, but in residency you make money, about 40k a year. Seeing as you're in the hospital 12 hours every day, you don't spend much of it and can afford to make payments."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,FIERY_URETHRA,2,Sat Jul 11 10:57:27 2015 UTC,"You're in luck: most residencies offer about $50,000-$55,000 for starting out and generally give modest bumps each year (should finish around $60,000 or so). Not that that makes loan payments a whole lot easier to swallow, but it doesn't hurt.   On another note, this infographic is complete garbage. It way overestimates (in my opinion) average time spent ""working"" during undergrad and med school. I'm not trying to say it's easy, but I certainly didn't spend those kinds of hours studying in college and my wife didn't put in nearly those hours for med school. Not even close."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Chaokoh,3,Sat Jul 11 17:18:34 2015 UTC,I agree. I dismissed the graphic in about 5 seconds.
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,ethertrace,17,Sat Jul 11 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"33.03 per hour still doesn't account for the fact that doctors work a lot more than teachers. I'm not ""doing the math"" per se, but if you account for that fact, the doctor still doesn't need a higher wage. Teachers go unpaid for the hours they spend on school-related things (such as correcting papers), which from my experience takes a lot of time."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Chaokoh,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"True but I'd argue that the school-related things are balanced out by doctors needing to stay up to date on new treatments, diagnostic criteria and protocols, which is readings outside of work."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,ethertrace,10,Sat Jul 11 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"That's true for teachers as well. There's plenty of research being done these days on educational methods, multicultural approaches, assessment practices, developmental psychology, disciplinary models, behavior intervention, accommodations for special needs students, etc., etc. Some teachers are more on top of this than others, but I imagine that that's also true for doctors."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Chaokoh,-2,Sat Jul 11 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"Then lets let them cancel out, or if you'd like a more literal example, paperwork, doctors have a great deal of paperwork. Essentially every patient they see must have a summary written on them as well as reasoning for their current treatments, and detailed information on physical exam. On that point you could argue that doctors do it while they work. But I'd say most doctors stay at work after hours to finish up though time varies.  As a side note do you know much about teacher licencing exam and renewals, that might be something we should include depending on how different the two are."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Halodule,4,Sat Jul 11 05:48:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'm not trying to say that teachers have it worse off than doctors in terms of workload. Just that they're both professions who have a lot of comparable unpaid behind-the-scenes work. I don't know a single teacher who manages to do all their grading and lesson planning during actual school hours, either.   As a side note do you know much about teacher licencing exam and renewals, that might be something we should include depending on how different the two are.   At least in California, initial licensing itself is fairly cheap. I think the tests I had to take for the whole thing amounted to less than/around $1000 (CBEST, fingerprinting and background checks, constitution exam, technology competency test, etc. Lot of individual hoops).  That's not including the costs of the credentialing program itself, of course, which culminates with the state performance assessment: PACT.  That's not something that the teachers have to pay out of pocket for, though.  I think there was just a $70 charge when submitting the paperwork to get the actual preliminary credential.  But then you have to go through BTSA to clear your preliminary credential, but the costs for that can vary quite a bit depending on the district (private school teachers had to pay the most I've seen at around $5000)."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Chaokoh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:32:31 2015 UTC,"Well then were agreeing my original point was just meant to be ignore the out of school work teachers do since doctors do a comparable amount  THanks for the additional information, your tests sound similar to what I am taking, initial board exams amounts to 4k. Any idea how often you will have to retake/renew your exams to stay licences?"
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,mutatron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:27:43 2015 UTC,Teachers also have alot of paperwork. Literally pages of information for every student in class on different assignments throughout the year. They also have to create lesson plans and worked based on whatever the curriculum had changed to that school year and then fill out more paperwork describing how their lesson plans adhere to the curriculum. My mom has been a teacher for 25 years and every year they just get more and more paperwork to fill out
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,Chaokoh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:11:20 2015 UTC,"So it sounds similar on both fronts. My argument isnt doctors have more paperwork or anything just that the outside of work, work the two do is comparable enough to cancel each other out."
theydidthemath,3cv6ls,chewbacaca,2,Sat Jul 11 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's like saying Stephen Hawking is burdened with long work hours because he's always working on equations and reading papers from other scientists.

First for the 20 years worth of work worked in a period of 11 years (18-29).  4 years undergrad, assuming 45 hours per week (I am using my schedule of 20 hours of research per week, plus 3 hours of lecture per class [3 other classes makes 9], plus 6 hours of lab per week, plus 1 hour of discussion per class [makes 3] plus 10 hours of studying outside of class total (which changes depending on the week but average it) 20+9+6+3+10=48 but I'll be nice with 45 hours per week. Undergraduate studies are usually in session about 32 weeks out of the year that gives 45X32=1440 hours per year compared to 40X50=2000 hours per year (40 being the average hour per week and 48 being the average number of weeks worked, taking 2 off for vacation and 2 off for holidays, sick days, and the like). That's a difference of -560 hours per year.  Now for med school, you have about 6 hours of class per day with about 4 hours of studying per night. That comes out to 50 hours per week. Except now you study 4 semesters per year, bringing you up to almost 45 weeks per year 50X45=2250 (32 week norm plus two summer semesters of 6 weeks a piece, rounding out weeks of extra study [especially for accreditation tests], work, etc.). This gives us a surplus of 250 hours per year. But wait, that's only for the first two years. Your third and fourth years are spent in clinical which is 80 hours per week with the number of weeks per year depending on your medical school (from the UW-Madison site, 8 weeks at internal med, 4 neuro, 6 gynecology, 6 pediatrics, 8 primary, 4 psychiatric, 8 surgery, 2 anesthesiology, 2 radiology, 4 internship, 4 pediatrics, 6 preceptorship, 4 surgery selective, 16 elective). [8+4+6+6+8+4+8+2+2+4+4+6+4+16]/2=41 weeks per year. PLUS studying of course (we'll give that a mild 10 hours per week for 41 weeks per year as well). 41X80+41X10=a whopping 3690. Adding that time of surpluses and deficits up (1690X2+250X2-560X4) and you get 1640.   This means that the average medical graduate has worked 1640 more hours than the average American worker over a period of 8 years of school.  Now we can finally make some money (sort of). The norm for medical internships is also 80 hours per week for approximately 48 weeks (it lasts a year and I am unsure about vacation time and off time, etc). 80X48=3480 hours per year. Then you have at least two years of residency which is also 80 hours per week (surprise!) and lasts two years for about 48 weeks a year again. 80X48X2=7680. This gives us a surplus of 3480+7680-2000X3=5160 hours over 3 years. Now our surplus is 5160+1640=6800 hours over the course of 11 years. In normal worker time, that's 3.4 years. Combining that with 11 years means they have worked approximately 14.4 years over the course of 11 years, with the vast majority being after their undergraduate careers.  But lets be fair to the teachers, because everyone on this thread is complaining about the comparison to teachers and not normal people. Assuming that teachers work the same number of hours at the undergraduate level as pre-med students (which in my opinion would be total BS, as I have a friend who is becoming a teacher and his schedule couldn't touch mine with a 10 foot pole, but enough about me) lets just knock off the first 4 years and compare the next 7. Additionally, lets assume teachers work a comfy 60 hours per week, 50 weeks a year (which again, personally, I think that's BS, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here). That would come out to 60X50X7=21000 hours. Compare that to the average medical student+intern+resident 2250X2+3690X2+3480+7680=23040. Looks like doctors win by 2040 hours over 7 years (with a grand total of 10.5 years of work for teachers compared to the 40 hour work week versus 11.52 years of work for doctors.  Now lets be unfair to the teachers, because there are people out there who believe that despite the 60 hours of work a week that some teachers may put into their classes, they only work 9 months out of the year (about 36 weeks). Rearranging for the 36 weeks per year, our gap has increase to 23040-(60X36X7)=7920 or 4 years of extra work over the course of 7 years.  Now lets be SUPER unfair to the teachers, now I'm gonna take away all of their ""prep"" time and assume they only work 40 hours per week. Now the gap is 23040-40X36X7=12960 or 6.48 extra years of work over 7 years. That's nearly double the work in the same amount of time!  Now lets be SUPER DUPER unfair to the teachers by readjusting their undergraduate schedule. Assume 4 classes per semester, 7 semesters total with the final semester being a student teacher (lets call that 16 weeks at 40 hours per week). Additionally, lets assume that they spend 3 hours in lecture per class and 1 hour in discussion per class with 3 hours of studying per class per week. (3X4+1X4+3X4)X7X16+16X40=4896 hours over 4 years compared to 5760 hours over 4 years for the pre-med. (the 16 represents the number of weeks in school per semester). That's a surplus of 864 hours or 0.432 work years for the average 40 hour per week worker. This brings the surplus for doctors up to 13824 or 6.912 extra years of work over 7 years.   Just to recap, the average doctor has worked 14.4 years worth of 40 hours per week 50 weeks per year work in 11 years. Most of this has happened in the span of just 7 years (1440X4+2250X2+3690X2+3480+7680=28800 hours total, 1-[1440X4/28800]=80% has happened in just 7 years). Regarding how much work you think teachers actually do, the calculation of time worked changes, but doctors always end up working more (at least during the beginning of their careers).   Personally I think this whole argument is stupid, but for all intents and purposes, this infograph's stats are skewed. Personally, I think medical school is the closest to hell that you can get on earth, barring North Korea or Somalia. Personally, I think that medical students work a hell of a lot harder than teachers.  With all being said, it is statistically possible that the infograph's information is at least partially accurate. Almost everyone on this thread has assumed something about the way that they went about accruing their data (including that they are not counting teacher's loans - which for a large part are forgiven when you become a teacher - as long as they are FEDERAL loans - though if you take out private loans to become a teacher you are a moron). Yet they are not calculating the amount of money that doctors must pay in malpractice insurance. It is difficult to calculate these kinds of statistics without bias, and almost any answer to these questions will be wrong.  That being said I have never seen a poor doctor in America.  Also, I am not going to calculate anything else because it took me a long time to do this without a TI-84.  If there are any mistakes in my calculations, feel free to correct me, but that doesn't mean I'll necessarily change anything."

theydidthemath,3cv6ls,KingGumboot,3,Sat Jul 11 03:37:29 2015 UTC,"Before too many people take a crack at it, I reverse image searched to find the actual source.  They do show all of their assumptions and math there.  I'm not saying it's correct, but they at least write out all the info:  http://www.bestmedicaldegrees.com/salary-of-doctors/  Feel free to debate it here though.  Here's some math from their page.  The numbers are theirs, the emphasis is mine (to go over below):   Doctors do 4 years bachelors @ 40/hr/week, 4 years medical school @ 80/hrs/week, 3-7 years residency @ 80/hrs/week. Doctors start at $300k loan debt over 20 years = their estimate of $687,360. Assumes teacher's loan debt at $186,072 (no math shown) Doctor's salary of $202,948, but net income after 28% federal tax rate: $146,123.  They include $50k/year of residency income in the lifetime totals. Teacher's average net income is $47,113 while working, $35,507 while on pension. Both assumed college starts at 18 years old, once out of college (29 year old doctor, 22 year old teacher) work until 65, teachers collect additional pension for 15 years. Doctor's average work hours was 59.6 hrs/week, 48 weeks/year.  Teachers was 40 hrs/week, 38 weeks/year.   So I think the numbers are dramatic because they emphasize:   Many more years of school for doctors at double the normal work week A large debt assumed to be paid off over 20 years. If you're making that much more a year, I would assume you'd pay it off before then. However, same goes for the teachers, but paying off debt early would drastically reduce the debt of the doctor more than the teacher. They work with net income, not yearly salary.  Since doctors will definitely be in a higher tax bracket, this reduces the lifetime earnings numbers. They assume 15 years pension for teachers.  I'm not sure how to treat this one.  I know that putting money into the pension is a line item on my wife's paycheck (about 8%) but I don't know if that was already removed from the teacher's income by saying ""net income"".  In other words, what does the doctor's retirement income look like taking into account how much they paid into say 401k during their years of service? 40/hrs/week is the required hours, but I think we can agree most teachers do far more than that - but then same could be true for the doctors, I don't know. No mention of medical benefits, but this is probably tough to average out.  In my wife's case, she's paying out of pocket for medical benefits, but they may also be covered in ""net income"".   Final, personal note: My wife's a teacher and being a teacher is hard, you need those two months off to recover from being always on.  There's no breaks, there's no personal phone calls, no munching on a bag of chips, no surfing reddit at work - and the moment you can catch your breathe during recess, you've gotta do all the things us regular working folks take for granted.  Cram a snack in your face, plan out after-school errands, respond to parent emails, schedule that doctor's appointment because the office isn't open until 8:30 which is when your students come in so you call the dr. at 8:00 to leave them a message but then they call back during circle time so you can't answer and you call them back and spend 5 minutes saying ""NO, I CAN'T TAKE AN 11:00 APPOINTMENT BECAUSE REMEMBER I TOLD YOU I'M A TEACHER"" and you ask when the next appointment after 3:30 is and they tell you they have no openings for the next 2 months but they have one at 2:30 so you coordinate with your principal to have her take over your class for 30 minutes while you go to do something any normal person would have dealt with by turning on their out-of-office responder for 1 hour.  And then the recess bell rings and you didn't have time to pee so you hold it for the next hour while little bobby drags muddy shoes into the classroom, Ginny bit Margret but apparently Margret started it, Sophie is still scratching her head (is it lice?!), and Johnny is - wait is that blood? Go to the nurse!  TL;DR: Yes, the math in the infographic is probably technically correct, but it does not paint the full picture - just the picture the website has in mind."

Probably the biggest issue, other than inconsistencies like putting so much effort into calculating everything for doctors and then not giving teachers the same attention, is the use of averages.

To me, it makes no sense to start talking about how much a person makes when you take into account the various life costs of becoming that profession. When you start to consider the innumerable possible number of possible scenarios, speaking of average opportunity costs etc, it all becomes an attempt at averaging randomness. If you made 200 k last year, you made more money than someone who made 65k.

The best I could find was this analysis. It is based on a ""time use survey"" so it is all the time teachers themselves report working on their job including off hours and weekends. The relevant finding is graph 5. It finds that they work something like 38.5 hrs total, slightly less than other professionals. This does NOT take in to account any down time for holidays, the survey is done on a weekly basis, so if the teacher didn't do any work in that week, they weren't counted. So if summer hours were included the average would likely be somewhat lower.

Using the sine rule, we have sin(30)/0.3 = sin(75)/r, where the angles are in degrees and r in meters. Since the diameter is twice the radius, it will equal 2*0.3m*sin(75)/sin(30) = 1.16 m (3.8 ft).

Both of these values will have to be estimated.  Since the video is in slow motion and I don't know how much it is slowed down by, I can't really figure out the speed of the balloon by measuring it based on other objects in the gif. Instead, I'll figure out how fast the balloon should theoretically be travelling if it were dropped from the second floor of a building (~3m) and it's initial velocity is zero (ie it's dropped rather than thrown) Using this equation:  (final velcoty)^2 = (initial velocity)^2 + 2(acceleration)(distance)   the final velocity of the ballon is around 7.7m/s.  Now for the mass of the balloon, I'll be estimating the size of the balloon basically by holding up my hands and guessing how big it is :P. I'm guessing it's around 10cm in diameter, which results in a volume of ~524cm3 or ~524mL. Since water masses 1 gram for every mL, the ballon has a mass of around 524 grams.  Putting these two values together, the momentum of the balloon is approximately 4kgm/s. I'll edit in some comparison later hopefully. This is about as much momentum of a regulation MLB baseball travelling at ~60mph.    As for the force imparted by the balloon to the guy's gonads, once again I can't really tell since force is equal to the change in momentum * time and I don't know how long the impact took. It would hurt less than a baseball travelling at 60mph since the force is spread over a larger area and the collision takes a longer time (imagine how long a water balloon takes to go from travelling downwards to travelling upwards when it bounces compared to a baseball) thus reducing the force imparted."

However, if a batter who already has two strikes hits a foul ball, the foul strike doesn't ""count"" and the batter remains alive with two strikes. By your same reference, fouls account for 16.9% of all pitches, so with two strikes, there is only a .624-.169=.455 probability of a strikeout after 1 more pitch (in reality, it is less than that as batters with two strikes often try to ""stay alive"" by fouling off anything close to the zone).

Assume the energy for vaporization calculated in atmospheric pressure is roughly the same for space and large temperature range (reasonable assumption for heat capacities of metals).  Temperature is ill-defined in space, but the 3K cosmic background is a rough approximation. Calculate heat capacity*(boiling point - 3) + heat of fusion + heat of vaporization times the respective masses of Zinc and Copper in the coin. This gives the energy required to vaporize a penny. This calculation shows is comes to 1.183x106 Joules.  Not all kinetic energy from the moving pennies will be used to vaporize the pennies. Some will be lost to friction between the coins and possibly light emission. Zinc's physical properties and comparison with other collision data, only about 5-10% of collision energy will have to suffice. To ensure vaporization (we got a lower bound on energy), go with 5%, for a kinetic energy requirement of 2.366x107 J per coin.  Turns out this doesn't need a relativistic velocity. That kinetic energy corresponds to a velocity of 137.6 km/s. I'm surprised, honestly, but that's pretty fast. About 20 times the speed of ISS, and it is quite prone to damage from space debris.  I'll answer the (simpler) question on antimatter in a while.  EDIT - Now the antimatter question. Mass m of antimatter annihilates mass m of matter to release 2mc2 of energy. For a penny and antipenny, this comes to 4.494x1014 J, which is 1.074x105 kilotons (or 107.4 megatons) of TNT equivalent. There is no finite blast radius in space, but you can approximate its effects on earth using this website or this one. They suggest a fireball radius of 8 km and 20psi air blast radius of over 10km."

I'd guess the chances for each individual shape on their own could be (beyond my math skills though), but for a complex dynamic system like you suggested you'd be getting into some pretty high concept math, if it were possible at all with just math.  You'd need to be able to model the initial state, subsequent positions/rotation/momentum of shapes (in relation to the sphere and each other), position of the holes, rotation of the sphere, etc. Pretty sure that's getting into the realm of chaos theory and phase space. Though I don't even know that even these would work, since you'd want a deterministic system but the rotation of the sphere would introduce lots of randomness.  Of course, that's just for the math itself - you mentioned experimentation, and it seems like it'd be possible to do with computer modelling and lots of simulations. Probably get you a pretty good average.  I could be 100% wrong though! Would love to see an actual way, since it's an interesting question."
theydidthemath,3cs86m,Polycystic,2,Fri Jul 10 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"I’m going to give it a try, using some really rough figures and simplified model.  Let’s assume that as you rotate the shapes rearrange themselves randomly.  As you rotate the ball, the shapes will naturally find their way to the bottom. So I’m going to assume that every time a hole is at the bottom, there’s a shape there. Then we have to answer 3 questions:   Is it the right shape? Does the position align? Does the orientation align?   Question 1. There are 10 shapes and I’ll assume (which I think is right) that each shape can only fit through its associated hole. There are obviously also 10 holes. But really it’s a matter of: given the shape at the bottom, does the hole match? There are always 10 holes, and always 1 shape of some sort at the bottom, so the probability is always 10%.  Question 2. We only need to consider one dimension for position – left/right. A shape is already at the bottom so there’s no up/down. Forward/back I’ll assume is taken care of by the rotation of the ball. So, for argument’s sake, let’s say the shape needs to be within 2 mm of the bottom for it to fall through. Given the shapes are about 40 mm across, there’s a 1 in 20 chance – 5% - that it’ll be in the right position.  Question 3. We need to consider each shape individually. It has to orient so that it’s face up or down (as they’re all prisms, geometrically), let’s say plus or minus 2 degrees of rotation in 2 of the 3 dimensions (that is, within a 5 degree arc), and also around its symmetry axis, but this changes for each depending on the symmetry of the shape.  Circle: 360/360 (always aligned)   Hexagon: 6 axes  x  5 degrees = 30/360  Pentagon: 5 x 5=25/360  Star: 5 x 5=25/360  Square: 4 x 5 = 20/360  Cross: 4 x 5 = 20/360  Triangle: 3 x 5 = 15/360  Oval: 2 x 5 = 10/360  Trapezium:  1 x 5 = 5/360  Segment:  1 x 5 = 5/360  So the probability of a shape falling through on the first try is the sum of the probability of any individual shape falling through, so when there’s 10 of them:  10% x 5% x 360/360 + 10% x 5% x 30/360 + …. + 10% x 5% x 5/360  =0.2153%  So how long do you need to rotate before the first one runs out? Let’s ask to be 99.5% sure, because I want to end up with a 95% certainty at the end that all the pieces have fallen out (99.5%10=95%, roughly)  I needed the Real Statistics add-on for Excel to use an inverse negative binomial distribution.   =NEGBINOM_INV(99.5%,1,0.2153%) I get 2,447 trials before there’s a 99.5% chance of the first one falling out. So far so good!  What about the second one?  Oh, dear lord. We don’t know which ones to work out the probability for.  Which one was the first to go? Which was the second? There are 10! = 3,628,800 possibilities for how this could pan out. Phew.  Anyone want to take over from here? I was going to assume a 'trial rate' of say one trial every 2 seconds.  edit: If we went for a ballpark figure, just multiply 2,447 trials by 2 seconds by 10 shapes = 48,940 seconds or about 13.6 hours. That seems too low to me.  edit 2: I forgot to account for the orientation completely. Maybe another time..."

Pretty amazing how such a ""simple"" thing  (a child's toy) can have such complicated math behind it. How would you even begin to model something like an otherwise successful drop through a hole being ""thwarted"" by another piece? Honestly curious; the answers I gave in the above posts were just educated guesses from reading a few books on Chaos theory.  Also, another thing to consider: are there certain shapes that, when rotated at a specific angle, can fit through the hole meant for another shape? Seems like that could actually be applied to your model, assuming you knew the dimensions of both the shapes and holes. Would probably make it quite a bit more complicated though, since now question 1 isn't just a simple T/F, but also depends on the answers to 2/3.  Not saying you should, just that it could haha"

This isn't, ""let's give everyone money no matter what"" it's ""how much would everyone earn in salary if we had true income equality?""  So if you didn't work or do something you wouldn't be making that perfectly-equalized salary.  Of course, this introduces some really strange incentives into the economy.  For example, the less people work the more the workers will earn.  So you might end up with workers trying to 'off' each other or otherwise make as many people incapable of work as possible.  Maybe even Jim Crow style disincentives for work to ensure that only the bare minimum of people are actually producing goods (a different kind of efficiency).  Also, every major automation advancement would be celebrated like it's the greatest thing ever:  ""Self-driving trucks are taking away jobs from hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Woohoo!""

However if we go by a different meaning, my question to you would be, what is income equality? Is it between nations? Only in the U.S.? Do you mean across all per capita GDPs (assuming it is directly correlated to wages)?  It's too broad to assume everything. And of course if you pick one of those then the answer could be things I wouldn't even know how to properly answer because at that moment you would need economic models to prove certain reactions to the market.

Tribal mentality only allowed our discoveries of all types of sciences to get so far...  We discovered language, farming, among other things by those are just tools to maintain a tribal society. As far as engineering feats and R&D, those would slow down to an incomprehensibly low level of production. And the production of a TV remote that in our society could take 2 minutes in that type of localized tribal society could take months or years to produce the single unit, because of a lack of communication, or formalized trade between nations.  This went off track, but the point is, the everyday economy is a very delicate thing. Think about it this way, if income equality actually worked, and did not off-set the production and maintenance of our society, a lot more governments would have adopted that policy.

Could you expand on this a bit? What value are they removing from the system? They're playing games with each others' money as far as I can tell.   Here is one way to look at this: All of us who are doing productive work are creating things of value, goods, services, innovations, improvements, etc. These things of value can be seen as going into a pool from which we can withdraw things we need and desire, in exchange for the money we are paid for our work. The so-called 1% can also draw heavily from this pool even though they have not contributed to it. This means that to make up for that difference the rest of us must contribute considerably more than we can withdraw. This is a simplified, black & white analysis; in life there are fuzzy interpretations of value and contribution that some grey shades, but the basic concept stands.  Besides devaluing your work, these zero sum games have a real influence on things like prices, legitimate stock market performance, pension fund performance, economic stability, government policy...

True, I'm creating things of value, but my real contribution to ""society"", the part that I'm drawing from, comes in the form of the taxes I pay.  And, shady loopholes aside, the 1% are paying taxes, too.  A lot more of them than I am.  So I don't think it's really accurate to say that they're just mooching off of the country without contributing anything.  Their earnings, which are still taxed, are just coming from playing with money instead of actually creating things.

theydidthemath,3cpber,the_peanut_gallery,15,Thu Jul 9 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"You gave us a lot of info but the i really need one more thing how low you run your car, i.e at what level do you stop for gas?  EDIT: For experiment's sake i'm going to say 1/4 of a tank. you burn 9 gallon per fill up, which is 243 miles per fill up, so you've filled you tank around 105 times. every fill up quaters your percent on original gas so .25105 is 6.08 x 10-64. Your tank of gas holds 5.4x1027 atoms, so it is HIGHLY unlikely even a single atom of original gas remains."
theydidthemath,3cpber,djsanluis,4,Fri Jul 10 04:40:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on the amount the tank is depleted each time. But! Let's find the general solution, maximize it, and see what conclusions we can draw :)   Let's call the percentage of tank left over after each fill up as x. So the percentage used will be 1-x. The total number of fill ups will be the distance divided by the tank size * (1 - x) * mpg  In this case,  number of tanks = 25,500 / (12 * 27 * (1 - x)   The amount of gasoline left after all those tanks will be tank size * x numberOfTanks. In this case,   Original fuel = 12x25,500/(324*(1-x))  Now, we are lucky because this is a straightforward function, meaning we can find the maximum value given the constraints that x>0 and x<1 (because the tank always has some fuel and never goes empty). You can also see that bigger values of x make the exponent bigger, but smaller values of x make the base smaller. At some point these two competing forces balance out, which will be at a minimum or maximum for the amount of fuel left.   The derivative is ugly here and I won't type it out, but it can be shown that with 0<x<1 the leftover fuel is maximized at   2.64074 * 10-43 gallons when x=0.5948, And maximized much better when  X=0.899992 with 1.16462 * 10-35  For comparison, that increase in original gas is comparable to the difference between a kilometre and the diameter of an atom. Speaking of atoms, how big would the fuel tank need to be after that many fillups, to have at least one molecule left of original gas, assuming we always left it 0.899992 percent full?   First we convert the gallons of gasoline to grams, since one gallon of gasoline is 2650 grams we have 3.0853 * 10-32 grams. Now, we convert this to moles, then molecules. There are 114 grams to a mole of gasoline, and 6.022 * 1023 molecules per mole. This leaves us with  1.629 * 10-10 molecules. Not even a billionth of a molecule. We scale the original tank size by one divided by this to find the required volume of a tank to have at least one original gas molecule left, and we find it to be 7.403 * 108 m3  Which just so happens to be the volume of Sydney Harbour."

T = D / V  where:  T is the time the passing lane is obstructed  D is the distance Truck 2 must travel relative to Truck 1   V is the speed of Truck 2 relative to Truck 1  T = (0.5 * tl + tl + tl + 0.5 * tl) / (V2 - V1)  T = (  ( 3 * 50 [ft] / (5280 [ft/mile]) ) / (5 [miles/hr])  ) * 3600 [s/hr]  T = 20.45 [s]  During this time Truck 2 will have traveled   D = T * V  Where:  D = (20.45 [s] / (3600 [s/hr])) * 60 [miles/hr]  D = 0.34 [miles]  Scenario 2: If the trucks  are 80 feet long, and there is only a 2 MPH difference in speed.

So I believe it would be safe to say although possible the downfall of vault 68 would probably be inevitable.

theydidthemath,3cnuak,Dynamite86,-19,Thu Jul 9 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say vault 68 has a better chance of survival. You can make a woman pregnant once a year (roughly). After at least 16 times her oldest daughter can get kids herself, also impregnate her once a year. Then the grand kids and so on and so on. Children are all still related but not always directly anymore.

theydidthemath,3cnuak,tylerthehun,13,Thu Jul 9 15:54:09 2015 UTC,"Not really. As I argued further down in this thread, in order to avoid inbreeding (which would undoubtedly lead to the collapse of the Vault's society), the minority gender must be partnered with unrelated members from the generation above theirs. For example, Vault 68 must have the female offspring partner with males from the generation above theirs and Vault 69 must have male offspring partner with the females from the generation above. The issue with Vault 69 is that women's fertility typically drastically drops after 35 whereas men remain potent longer into their lives. While the population of Vault 69 would likely boom in the beginning, by the time the male offspring come of age, the suitable females for avoiding inbreeding would likely be too old to bear children. Even if they could, there are a number of serious health risks the subsequent offspring would face simply due to being born so ""late"" into the mother's life. This is an issue that would plague every generation (so long as the goal is to avoid inbreeding), but with enough luck or even advanced medical procedures (egg donations), it might be sustainable.  Vault 68; however, would grow much more slowly, but it would be more sustainable if only for the fact that the men can realistically wait longer for the female offspring to grow without jeopardizing the health of subsequent generations.  Either way, none of these societies would realistically last as the people would be reduced to cattle due to the required breeding practices. Still, if the goal is to maintain a society without inbreeding, short of medical intervention or dumb luck, Vault 68 would have a smaller population but it stands a better chance than Vault 69."

theydidthemath,3cnuak,ItsSansom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"In Vault 69, the son of the male and a female can have children with one of the other original 998 females which has no blood relation to him, wheras in vault 68 there is no posibility for a 2nd generation where both parents are not linked by blood to the mother, so vault 69 would have a better chance of diluting the effect of a single male. So the male could have a son with female A and female B, who in turn have children with C and D, so the children of C&D are grand children of the male, however by that time it would likely not be possible for the original females to have more children as they would be past childbearing age, so even if those children marry and have children they would only be cousins, and would only have a quarter in common being their grand father, so if planned correctly the different genes from all 999 women can offset the same father to a extent, then again I don't know much about genetics and this is just speculation."
theydidthemath,3cnuak,pocketposter,7,Thu Jul 9 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  In 68, the original female can have a daughter, who upon reaching sexual maturity has sex with one of the completely unrelated other males."

theydidthemath,3cnuak,canadeken,4,Thu Jul 9 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"Or every 2nd generation son could impregnate another non-related woman of the 999, but yes the original 999 men would longer be able to help provide additional genes to children than the 999 woman as they can still father children late in life.  However in the 69 you are able to take advantage of the diversity quicker, in vault 68 after 15 years you will have around 20 children (1 a year assumption as every 9 months would be unlikely consistently) from the single female, around 9-11 girls along with maybe another dozen children from the first few girls who are reaching child bearing age or twin births.   However in Vault 69 you can have far more, say 18 children from each 999 woman, so about 9,000 sons some of whom are now the age to provide sperm for children depending on how your you consider acceptable to a 999 woman not their mother. So these 2nd generation children are only related by their grandfather (they have unrelated mothers), and in many place in the world cousins marry, their children could then marry the children of another cousin couple (as the original 999 would likely not be able to still bear children), however these two 3rd gens need not have the same 1st gen mother or 2nd gen mother and they could now only have a great grand father in common (, so their children have the genes of only 4 original women, (the 2 2nd gen's mother who the male impregnated and the 2 mothers (of the original 999) who the 2nd gen male impregnated), you still have 993 womens offspring who your only blood connection to is the male who by now is great- great grand father and will get less chance of inbreeding the more generations you go along, if you follow this pattern the number of genes from the original 999 would double each time so you could go for another 7 generation by my calc before you have the genes of 512 of the 999 women. By that time inbreeding should become less of a problem as long as the family lines are carefully planned.  Vault 68 could also work with the change that you could use the original 999 men to provide new genes up to the 3-4th gen??? so by that point you have only 3/4 of the 999 vs 4/8 women at that point  So both vaults could the risk of inbreeding be limited, however the 69 would be less risk as the loss of 1 son in the 2nd gen around year 20 would be less than the loss of a daugher at that time."

According to this article, a population of 160 adults would be sustainable for 200 years, or as few as 80 people for a shorter duration with good ""social engineering"".   In vault 69 with 999 (it was 999, right?) women, it would be relatively reasonable for 160 children to be born. That is something more like 16% of the women giving birth to children - assuming no twins are born - but I believe that would still be a reasonable amount. From that standpoint it would be viable to sustain a population within vault 69 for a couple hundred of years, but the real problem arises with genetics. As /u/Dolphin_Titties has pointed out historical cases of inbreeding have generally not gone well.  Vault 68 on the other hand is not viable in either regard. Even if that one woman were to have children every nine months, she would still only give birth about 50 times by the time she was 60. The world record for most children born to a single women is 62, which wouldn't be viable in terms of population.   Ultimately, if left on their own for centuries neither vault would be be able to sustain a viable population. The inhabitants of vault 69, if the vault is opened quickly enough, may be able to pass on the genes of their great-great-great...great grandfather if they found some outside population to breed (that word sounds really weird in context of humans) with, but if left on their own would certainly succumb to genetic malformalities."

theydidthemath,3cnuak,DONTuseGoogle,7,Thu Jul 9 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, they'd still run into the genetic problem as well as social problems.  Suppose everyone enters the vault at 18.  Male 1 and Female mate, 9 months later Female pops out 2 daughters.  Suppose that, somehow, this continues for the next 18 years with each year a new Male hits up the Female.  Now we have 3 females of birthing age: the original Female (36yo) and her 2 daughters (which share 50% genetic information with the mother).  We can assume that New Males will make with the older Female but who's mating with the daughters?     The daughters would have to mate with males who had not yet mated with their mother or planned to mate with their mother to avoid genetic contamination resulting.   Meanwhile the entire original population is getting older and some of them are probably going to get upset at how unfair the system is, cue testosterone related violence (more common in younger populations).  This would likely lead to a removal of members of the older population   If older males are removed then it limits the gene pool unless they've already mated (but if they're being violent then it's probably because they haven't mated). If any of the females are removed then it potentially cripples/destroys the gene pool as they are the limiting resource of the vault.   But suppose there's no violence at all, everyone is happy to wait their turn.  Each year the original population gets older (and less viable in terms of sperm viability and childbearing potential) and each of the first 18 years only has 1-2 children being born into it leading to a potentially negative growth rate (depends on how well the others survive things like work accidents, disease, etc).    By the time you have the potential for 11 birthing females at least 23 years have passed (assuming twin females born every year) but it could be as many as 30 depending on things like the sex of the child and whether or not the child survives to a viable age.  Now the original population is between 30 and 40 years old and getting ready to hit menopause/erectile dysfunction; over the next 10 years the older population will be progressively less viable as potential mates.  So what about the younger population?  Well, they all had the same mother so even accounting for genetic recombination/mutation they're still going to run into issues of mating with their various half siblings or related uncles.  How is that different from Vault 69?  The numbers!  Assuming the possibility of twins vault 68 has the potential for 0-2 births each year while vault 69 has the potential for 0-1998 births each year. That's 1998 possibilities for genetic mutation/recombination to occur each year instead of the 2 in vault 68.  So while both vaults run into problems of ""all the offspring are related to each other"" the population in Vault 69 has a higher likelihood of producing offspring whose genes are altered through mismatch mutations in the genetic structure during replication.  With so many potential candidates for natural mutation it's more likely to have a viable colony for a prolonged period of time.  Or, to put it in a real world perspective, genetics labs (teaching labs) tend to use Fruit Flies colonies because of the large amount of offspring they produce which allows for greater potential for genetic variation within an environment with a set number of starting genes."

Would he be imprisoned and essentially ""milked"", and the women creating a kind of sperm bank?  Would the groups split? Say 1/3rd of the women mate with the man in the first generation. The second 1/3rd mate with his offspring... something like that, in an attempt to avoid incest and spread out the genes as best as possible.   Would the entire vault try their best to hide the fact that they're all related from the children, out of shame or a sense of protection? If you (as a female child of the group) discovered that EVERY suitable mate was a half-brother at best, would you despair, revolt, try to leave the vault...?

So 999 women in the vault are already pregnant with 28 babies.  Now, the ""assuming they were all 20"" ... I don't know much about the Fallout universe, but I don't know if that's a good assumption. Were there old and young put into the vault, or just adults? Without additional info it might be better to assume a generational cross-section.  But those 28 babies will be born in year 1, and let's say that impregnating 10 women a year, 10 more are born in years 2-16. That gives an age breakdown like this at year 16:   150 ""kids"" age 0 - 15, descended from Man 1 28 16-year-olds, no relation to Man 1 999 36-year-old women, no relation to Man 1 (150 are related to the ""kids"", 28 are related to the 16-year-olds, and 821 are unrelated)   So at this point we have 821 completely unrelated 36 year old females, say 14 16-year-old males and 14 16-year-old females, and 150 ""kids"".  I think from here if the 14 16-year-old guys get with the 821 36-year-old women (kind of gross but it's for the survival of the species) you can, in very short order, have hundreds of babies who are unrelated to Man 1's 150 descendants.

theydidthemath,3cnuak,Dolphin_Titties,20,Thu Jul 9 13:08:50 2015 UTC,"There is the possibility of avoiding inbreeding.  It's an equally fucked up society, and it would require a lot of luck (if you could call it that) to have nothing but children of the minority gender. However, if we take a look at Vault 68 (99 men; 1 woman) and assume all participants enter at the age of 20, if the woman bears a new child every year for 15 years (before fertility drops) from 15 different partners, even if we assume only 7 of those children turned out to be female, that would leave 92 eligible partners to choose from without resorting to incest. This trend of the new females having the children of the males with no relation from the generation up would be sustainable for 200 years. The age gap is super messed up, but it would be doable by being extremely mindful of who partnered with whom, forcing an annual birth (really unhealthy, I'd imagine), and primarily repopulating the minority gender.  Vault 69 (1 man; 99 women); however, would have a much harder time avoiding inbreeding. While the first man could bear more children originally, to avoid inbreeding, the male offspring would have to have children with the women from the generation above of no relation. However, if we assume that they all enter the Vault at 20 (like we did previously) and considering that women's fertility drops noticeably after age 35, it becomes more of a gamble of the offspring successfully bearing children when they finally come of age. Even if they do manage to successfully bear children, this issue persists as the male offspring must continue to bear children with the previously unpartnered women from the previous generation. Assuming the first male bears 50 children from 50 different women at the same time (what a nightmare) as soon as they get into the Vault and assuming that 25 children turn out to be males and assuming the women stay healthy and fertile until 40 in the Fallout-verse, there would be plenty of available partners and the population would grow faster than its sister Vault. However, these events are unlikely to happen without serious complications which makes Vault 68 more ""sustainable"".  Ultimately, the society that overtakes these Vaults would be terrible with humans being treated as logistical cattle simply trying to avoid inbreeding. It would be possible to avoid inbreeding (at least in Vault 68), but the constant need to continually bear children until the population's gender balances out (and the methods required to do so) would be devastating and dehumanizing. While logistically possible, both societies would undoubtedly collapse long before they are freed from their Vaults."

Genetic mutation I can't answer since I'm at work, but, figure a woman can have a baby once every year maybe 14 months, that's could very much be able to sustain a population assuming the woman doesn't die.  And as long as she has women they could go on forever.  The trick is to make sure each man only has one child until the cycle has to repeat it self, and also the men need to have kids when the woman's male kids can not reproduce with their sisters.  for 69.  The man gets every woman pregnant in a cycle and then once again have children with the girls and not let the male children have kids until the original man is dead/about to die.

theydidthemath,3cpz2a,richardsonr43,5,Fri Jul 10 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, let's get down to it. Let's cite as much information as we can from that video. The ride is 230 feet tall, and it looks to be 3 times as tall as it is wide. Because the cage sits in the middle of the two poles this means that the ground, the rope, and the pole create a triangle with one side that is six times the length of the other. This means that the hypotenuse (the rope) is sqrt(37)/6 times longer than the tower. This means the rope is 233 feet long.  Now we get into physics. We'll calculate the killing power of that rope using energy methods. Let's say that the rope is entirely charged up when it is stretched to twice its length by the winch (when I rode this ride, it looked like the end of the rope that starts at the top of the tower was pulled all the way to the ground before my fellow rider and I were released). That means it is stretched a total of 233 feet, or about 71 meters. the equation for elastic force is F=kΔx, where k is the spring constant. This is Hooke's Law. The video says that the maximum force output of the ropes is 40 tons. That's 355,857 Newtons. Since it is only one rope, let's halve that: 177928.5 N. Divide that by 71 meters, we get a spring constant of 2506.035 N/m. We're halfway there; the amount of potential energy store in that rope (Uel) equals 0.5kx2. So 0.5 times 2506.035 N/m times 71 meters squared...that's 6316461.75 Joules of elastic potential energy. Therefore, that rope snapping in your face is the equivalent of someone hitting you in the head with a 10 kg sledgehammer... at 794 mph. (That's 355 m/s.) If even a portion of that elastic energy actually is transferred into your body, especially your head or face...yes, you are, most definitely, dead.  tl;dr: that kid on the left is pretty lucky to be alive."

theydidthemath,3cpz2a,RUST_LIFE,3,Fri Jul 10 07:15:21 2015 UTC,"It's actually not that hard to calculate - half the number of elastic bands would equal half the force, and half force + same mass = half acceleration.  if the ride is 230ft tall and normally imparts 6 Gs of acceleration, then the tetherball of near-certain-death will accelerate at 3 Gs.  x = v0t + 0.5at2  230ft = 0 + 0.5(3*32 ft/s2 )t2  t = 2.189 seconds of accelerate  v_final = 2.189 seconds * 3*32 ft/s2 = 143.3 mph  143mph is not a speed that the human body is meant to travel at. My guess actually says that the riders WILL SURVIVE the initial push up since they will only clip the side of the arm at worst. Slingshots have an odd effect of ""throwing"" their payload over the lever arm, so I'm really not too worried about that part. The bit that comes next... that's where the tetherball (of deathTM ) is now pulling on the support arm in the opposite direction the arm is supposed to be braced against. A 230ft lever arm means that the Tetherball of DeathTM is going to exert a positively ludicrous amount of torque on the structure, and its doing so in a way that aforementioned structure is just not going to be capable of handling."

theydidthemath,3cpyhb,YEStoISS,3,Thu Jul 9 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"Here's how i'm formulating this problem:  The goal is to pay off the cards while generating the least amount of overall interest.   Now, if this is the problem, then the solution can be found as follows:  For each month, the optimal (minimum) solution = the optimal (minimum) interest generated in the current month + the optimal (minumum) interest genereated in all following months until the card is paid off.  So we can work backwards to solve this problem!  for example: The solution from the final month (month n) is just the remaining balance, because in the final month your balance will be <= $750 so no interest is generated. The solution from the previous month (month n-1) = the minimum possible interest generated in month (n -1) + the solution from month (n) which we just found. The solution from month (n-2) = the min possible interest generated in month (n-2) + the solution from (n-1) and so on.  So, to solve this we just need to repeatedly calculate the best payments for the current month and save our solutions, perhaps in a table.  Well, how do we calculated the best payments for the current month?  let b_i be the remaining balance on card i. let p_i be the amount you pay on card i's balance for the current month. let m be the number of the current month.  then the current month's interest when m <= 18 is = .2(b_1 - p_1) + .05(b_2 + p_2)  when m > 18 the current month's interest is = .2(b_1 - p_1) + .05(b_2 + p_2) + .3*(b_3 + p_3)  You need to solve for the p_i's every month by minimizing the corresponding equation of interest that you are using.  This can be done easily using lagrange multipliers.   As you do these calculations from month (n) to month (1) you will find the optimal payments for each month"

I've assumed the following about the timing: we're currently at the beginning of month 0. Also the minimum payments you have to make are $20.   Initially we only need to take into account cards 1 and 2. So pay $20 on card 2, and put $730 towards card 1, clearing it at the start of month 4 with a final payment of $154.50 (rounding up to the nearest cent) From months 5-14, pay off card 2. In months 15-18, pay off card 3 as late as possible: $310, $730, $730, $730, so that it is paid off just before the interest cuts in at the start of month 18. Put the rest towards card 2. Then clear card 2. This will happen at the start of month 21 with a payment of $306.55.   Step 3 is optimal between cards 2 and 3 because paying even one month's interest on card 3 (2.21%) is better than paying four month's interest on card 2 (2.05%). Step 1 is optimal between cards 1 and 2 as 1 has the higher rate.     In total, you have paid $3074.50 on card 1, $10462.05 on card 2, $2500 on card 3, for a total interest payment of $536.55"

The change in angular momentum to add or subtract a second would be 3.16881*10-8*7.07*1033 , or about 2.24*1026.

Pulling in another few orders of magnitude to 1 millisecond/year change in rotation gives 0.99961 times the speed of light as his running speed.  If instead of merely going for less speed we give The Flash some help (say he's racing Superman, and they're carrying Batman and Wonder Woman on their shoulders)- if we say their collective mass is 400kg (being generous and saying Batman is carrying a lot of gadgets) then they would all need to be traveling at 0.999887 times the speed of light to change the length of a year by 1 millisecond.  Hmm. Taking this to some silly directions, what about Superman flying around the earth at high altitude like in the 1978 movie? If he can fly higher that gives more angular momentum for a given speed. 35,786km is geosynchronous orbit. This is probably unreasonably high to be influencing Earth's rotation, but let's see what speed would be involved:  Assuming a 100kg Superman, we get 0.999858 times the speed of light as his angular speed to obtain a 1ms change over a year."

If you're interested in the actual weight, i.e., the force that pulls an object towards the center of gravity of the closest celestial body, then the question is kind of nonsensical, because the Earth is that celestial body itself, and there is no meaningful way of defining its weight within this context.  If, however, you are referring to is mass, then the procedure is quite clear. Mass cannot be measured directly, so what we do is we take one object of known mass, and the object we want to measure, put a known distance between the two, and measure the gravity acting upon them. In daily life, the reference object is the Earth, and our bathroom scales are adjusted to take its mass into account to give a somewhat useful approximation of the mass to measure. So in order to measure the mass of the Earth, we'd do exactly the same thing: take a reference object, and measure the gravitational force between it and the Earth using an ordinary scale. Of course, at some point we have to decide on an ultimate reference object to get our very first definition of a unit of mass, and that's pretty much exactly what happened.

If x proportion of kernels don't pop every time, then you need 1/x popped bags to get enough unpopped kernels. I would guess that it's somewhere around 1/10, so you would need 10 bags. However, some of those kernels probably will never pop because they're either not sealed or not fully formed or something, so it's hard to be sure."

With a ballute there's no reason that the ISS couldn't do some aerobreaking, so we could drop the dV to 4270 which reduces M_f to 1922. But lets arbitrarily add 100 tonnes of rocket engine, fuel tank shells, and structural support, so we'll call it 2350 M_f for a fuel mass of 1800 tonnes. This is 34 Falcon Heavy trips just shuttling fuel.  Suppose instead you use a 200 tonne NERVA setup. Then it becomes:  650 * 2.718 ^ (4270 / 800 / 9.8) = M_f M_f = 1120, 470 of which is fuel, for only 9 Falcon Heavy trips to fuel it.  Suppose instead you used a 10 ton 19000 Isp ion engine setup (with 20 tonnes for aerobreaking gear, more than generous) that would take a full month to perform the acceleration. Then you'll need... 11 tonnes of propellant, which is 1 trip on the Falcon 9."

So then, the new Beetle has an interior volume of 100.5 cu.ft.  Since this is a physics question the Beetle is obviously a sphere, with a radius 2.88ft. This is the Schwarzchild radius of our black hole.  R = 2MG/c2  M = Rc2 /2G  M = 0.878m (8.99x1016 m2 / s2 )/2(6.67x10-11 m3 /kgs2 )  M = 5.1x 1026 kg  Which is 85x more than the mass of the Earth.

theydidthemath,3cjynh,I3eastmode,3,Wed Jul 8 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"In general, you wont make a profit on a lottery and the more you spend the more likely you are to lose.  Because, like most gambling, there is generally less than a 50% chance of winning.  Take black jack for example, I believe there is a 47.9%(at work can't check sites blocked) chance you win and a 52.1% chance the house wins. This means that if you play 100 times you'll only make back 95.8 dollars (saying you get 1 for winning and lose 1 for losing) thus losing 4.2 dollars. Now for blackjack this is different because you can change your bets when you think the deck is in your favor, creating the chance to beat the odds.  But for scratch offs, you'll all have the same odds of winning or losing and the odds will most likely be under 50% win/lose.  Or, like a lot of lotteries now, if it's a $10 dollar ticket, they'll have a lot of $5 winners, but you still only get 50% back.  But still the odds of getting an amount back greater than you spend would be rather low. (once again, can't check the actually site because I'm at work).  Edit 1: It looks as though 1 in 3.21 are the OVER ALL odds.(including breaking even) so if we go up to 1 in 3.22 that would be the odds of making a profit.  Which is 31.05% chance of making a profit.  That's a slight profit, the % goes down the more profit you want to make. 72,000/10= 7,200 tickets would be a lot, but not the best odds, you're better go follow the stats of black jack and that the 47%."

Ignoring the primary where Sanders is most likely to lose if he does, because reddit cannot secure Sanders the nomination, we're left with the national election.  In the US, candidates are pretty much guaranteed about ~45%. This is about the number of people who will vote for a candidate regardless of any other factor other than party affiliation. Anything outside if this is generally considered a landslide.  Reddit isn't really a fair sample of the US population, and falls mainly under a few demographics, which explains Sanders' widespread popularity. There aren't really any numbers on this, but I'm willing to bet that most Reddit users fall under the ""vote against republicans anyway"" party.   So if Hilary wins the nomination, few redditors are likely to vote for Bush as a result, if they even vote at all.  What that means is that there aren't many swing voters on Reddit, which would reduce the odds of Reddit winning Sanders the presidency.  But it's hard to pinpoint how many people that is.

theydidthemath,3cfagi,gcanyon,2,Wed Jul 8 00:10:07 2015 UTC,I already accounted for non-voting-age and non-American Redditors in the beginning.
theydidthemath,3cfagi,Speciou5,21,Tue Jul 7 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"If reddit has:  20 million people monthly uniques * 68% from the U.S. = 13.8 million U.S. redditors * 80% estimate (guess) of voting age = 11 million U.S. voting age * 35% not registered to vote - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/page-gardner/the-real-crisis-35--of-am_b_1615318.html = 4 million new voter candidates  * 65% registered to vote = 7 million already registered * 57% turnout in the last non-incumbent presidential election - https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=2008+voter+turnout&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 = 4 million likely voters in 2016 * 43% likely Democrat voters - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_U.S._states#Current_party_strength = 1.7 million likely Democrat voters on reddit   Now, the question you're asking needs clarification. If you're saying, what if we convince everyone on reddit who can vote to vote for Bernie Sanders. Then you're saying let's get 11 - 1.7 = 9.3 million people who would not already likely have voted for Bernie Sanders to do so. That would likely tip the scales even if Sanders were otherwise on the losing end (unless he were getting blown out somehow).  If you're saying, let's rally those who would not otherwise have voted, but who would likely vote for Bernie Sanders if they voted, to get out and vote, then you're doing something like:  4 million new voter candidates * 43% likely Democrat supporters = 1.7 million likely Sanders supporters who are not registered * 10% (guesstimate of the number you could get to register) = 170,000 new registered likely Sanders supporters   Then take:  7 million already registered * 43% non-voters in the last non-incumbent presidential election = 3 million registered non-voters * 43% likely Democrat supporters = 1.3 million registered likely Sanders supporters who did not vote + 170,000 new registered likely Sanders supporters ~= 1.5 million registered likely Sanders supporters   If you convince 1/3 of those to actually get out and vote, you get 500,000 new, wouldn't-have-voted Sanders supporters. Depending on what states they're in, you could definitely make a difference, but important to consider that a lot of reddit's users come from urban areas, and specifically from California and New York. Those are likely/almost certain to go Democrat anyway, so anything you do there has zero effect. It's more important to identify the battleground states, and focus your efforts there -- a few hundred votes in the right state can change the outcome."

The average at this point is:  A = S/n  Now, if you get a new number, simply add the number to S, and add 1 to n:  S = S + [new number]  n = n + 1  With these new S and n values you can recalculate the average."

Repeatedly multiplying and dividing will cause a cumulative error, due to the round-off involved with floating point multiplication and division operations.  Basically, if you store the result of a floating-point multiply or divide operation, and use that as the basis for subsequent calculations, you'll going to be carrying forward some error amount which will increasingly pollute your results as you go on.  But by only doing one division operation when you need to know the average--and then throwing that average away when you're done with it--any error amount is kept small and never propagates to subsequent calculations.  Symbolically, the two methods may look exactly the same on paper. But when implementing stream-based algorithms on real hardware, you have to take numerical stability into account."

If the average is the sum of things divided by the number of things, and you add another one, then you just need to get rid of the previous division first. Each new step removes the last part of the previous step then continues as normal.   Example.  Your list is 2, 4, 3, 6, 2, 7  Average of the first two:     (2+4)/2=3  Average of the first three: Multiply the previous average (3) by the previous number of things (2) to get rid of the previous division and find your running total (which was 6), then add 3 (the new number of things) and divide the lot by 3 (the third number in the list) So     ((3x2)+3)/3=3 Which makes sense because (2+4+3)/3=3 Notice that when you do the first multiplication you end up with the previous total: 3x2 = 2+4  First four:     ((3x3)+6)/4=3.75 Noticing again 3x3 = 2 + 4 + 3  First five:     ((3.75x4)+2)/5=3.4 See how your running total keeps coming back? 3.75x4 = 2 + 4 + 3 + 6  All six:     ((3.4x5)+7)/6=4  And the average of 2,4,3,6,2, and 7 is...?

theydidthemath,3cidko,Semyonov,2,Wed Jul 8 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"So there's a couple things at work here.  First, if you hold the can vertically, the force vector from Gravity acting on the liquid is the greatest. But, as the mouth of the ice tea can is not only the exit for the liquid, but the intake for the air that replaces it, holding the can straight up and down is no good.  What actually happens is there is a small vacuum inside the can as the iced tea comes out, but no air gets in to replace it. That vacuum inside the can reduces the flow rate until the air (being pushed into the upside down can by atmospheric pressure) has enough force that it will push the fluid out of the way and enter the can. That's when the vacuum ends and the fluid flows again, only to be choked off again and the process repeats. That's why you drink goes bluuulbp....bluuuuulbp as you pour.  So it's not really a problem of which angle allows sufficient airflow, but a mechanical problem of how to organize the ice tea flow and air intake.  So spin the fluid. Holding the can vertical and having the fluid spinning as it comes out results in the greatest flow rate. The iced tea/air exchange is then organized at the mouth of the can, with the iced tea having the greatest possible velocity due to gravity. Or you could poke a hole in the can (like shot gunning a beer) or you could insert a straw, a bendy straw works great (like snorkelling a beer) or you could find a way to pressurize the can (would reduce the vacuum effect)  Tl;Dr swirl the iced tea around before you start to pour, and hold it straight up and down"
theydidthemath,3cidko,YEStoISS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:22:25 2015 UTC,The speed at which the liquid comes out is based on the amount of air coming in to replace the space the liquid used to be in.  Holding the can upside down blocks more air from replacing the liquid which is why it is not the most efficient way.  Poking a hole in the top of the can next to the regular spout gives air a place to move in to help the liquid come out faster.  I don't know the formula though.
theydidthemath,3cidko,SpaceJockey1979,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:43:41 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense!
theydidthemath,3cidko,ace10301,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:48:49 2015 UTC,And it has to do with density/heaviness of liquid as a it would be harder for air to push through.
theydidthemath,3cidko,7yl4r,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of one. This might depend on the viscosity of the air, but I think those effects might be small enough that it's only going to depend on the size/shape of the hole."
theydidthemath,3ch6a0,wutangforthekids,5,Tue Jul 7 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"Man, this is a textbook example of how statistics can be manipulated to push a narrative. To be fair, here's the original article, which I also think is misleading.   In absolute terms, the men earned 3800% more, but as proportion of revenue, women earned 44% more – this is the main argument. With this in mind, calling the women ""overpaid"" is just silly and inflammatory. Ask anyone ""would you rather have a greater share of your company’s profits and earn the same or make 38 times more money?"" It's ridiculous. The article is trying to make it out like women are getting an unfair advantage over the men, which really only makes sense from a conservative libertarian perspective (oh, and hey, it’s a conservative libertarian paper! what are the odds?!).  Likewise, the Politico article pulls out all sorts of numbers but suspiciously never once mentions revenue, popularity, or anything to do with the business side of it, except to blame television execs. I completely get the notion that the women are doing the same job as the men and should get paid equally, but at the end of the day they don't create the same product, and there's a huge difference in demand between the two. I reject the idea that exec's just aren’t giving women's sports a fair shake. On the contrary, I feel like there's been a tremendous push for women's sports over the last 20 years as part of the gender equality movement because it's an easy battleground, but it has been shown over and over that there just isn't the same level of interest.

I've seen conversion facters of 114kg/bbl, 133kg/bbl, and 159 kg/bbl, but honestly we're really throwing around way too many significant digits as it is anyway to care too much, so I'll just pick the middle one, to get 444 million barrels of oil.  For some context, world oil production is about 75,000 barrels 85 million barrels per day, so you'd get about 6,000 years 5 days of current energy production (hey, back to one significant digit!) stored up for the robots if you converted everyone out to oil at once in tidy little energon cubes, at which point they had better have figured out renewable energy.

Before anything, you have to choose an angular diameter (there may be a way to avoid this).  I'm going to estimate using this site, since I have 2 unknown variables so a reasonable estimate of one needs to be found (also, I'm going to assume that we are.  Anyways, I'm going to assume that the camera on the selfie stick has the same FOV of a person, which is 114 degrees, which is the angular diameter I'm going to use.  Using those numbers I get that the distance must be 32,470 light years away from the center of the milky way, so we need to find out how far it needs to be from our own solar system.  Using some simple geometry and the fact that the distance from the sun to the center of the milky way is 27,000ly, I get a stick length of 42,229ly(?).  Of course, it would be pretty hard to position it properly due to the Earth's rotation, even though it's negligible once you have it in position.  Also, that distance only works if you tilt your selfie stick at a certain position (you would need to angle it .021 degrees towards the center of the milky way, and you would need to do some other funky things like ensuring you lift it perpendicular to the plane of the milky way).  Anyways, I can give a little insight to what will happen within the first 24 hours with the camera in position, it won't move at all.  Mainly because friction inside the stick when the molecules bump in to one another(which causes the stick to move the way you want it to) would eventually dissipate all the energy you put in to moving the stick, thus resulting in only moving a certain amount of the stick and curving it in a certain direction.  However, even if there was no friction it would still take at least 42,229 years for any movement of the camera to begin, so the velocity would be unimaginably small."

If we set it to the size of the universe then the spiral will be bigger than the universe. Since the 'width' of a spiral is essentially 2 quarter-rotations, so a rotation of π radians, then the ratio will be φ2 . In short, we only need an r = spiral * φ2 distance.

All the gear is rented and the only cost would be the guitar necks , the seat, and the logo/back which was probably done by a hired artist and is worth anywhere from 10k-20k. All in all renting those lights for a tour, around 2 months, would run you around 1500 a week at a total of probably 10k ( ita cheaper to do it monthly than weekly) after all is said and done 20,000-30,0000$.

theydidthemath,3cetoy,marquisalex,2,Tue Jul 7 10:34:37 2015 UTC,"Ok. This is my first one on this subreddit, so here it goes. I assume you want to know how much it would cost if everyone all over the world observed a minute's silence. I used Wikipedia for my source of numbers.   The world economy was estimated to be $77.609 trillion in 2014. This is $212.63 billion per day assuming value is created uniformly across the year. Let's go with this assumption. This is spread out over several sectors and each could be impacted in a different way:  Agriculture: No impact. Plants will keep growing and farmers will finish sowing the seeds for a field after the minute of silence is over.  Service sector: Very little impact to no impact. People will probably finish shopping for whatever they were shopping for and hairdressers finish doing people's hair, etc. I think we can assume there is no value lost here either.  Industrial sector: Here it has a major impact. I'm guessing production lines, mining equipment, etc. will need to be shut down for safety reasons and restarted later which causes extra time loss. This can be different for different subsectors and I think is the toughest to estimate. For now let's assume a 10 minute outage.  So we only have to calculate how much it would cost if all industrial production shut down for 10 minutes everywhere in the world.  Since industrial production accounts for 30.5% of the world economy, that's 74.42 billion per day. Let's assume a 10 hour production day, that's 7.44 billion per hour, and taking it further, 1.24 billion for the 10 minutes.  I used a lot of unknowns and assumptions, but my guess is that if all of the world observed a minute of silence, it would probably cost the world economy around a billion dollars."
theydidthemath,3cetoy,Kr1tya3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:33:56 2015 UTC,"""The world economy was estimated to be $77.609 in 2014."" So that's 77,609 billion, there are 525,949 minutes in a year.  Just off the bat, it could be $147,559,934.518 lost for a minute of silence.  That's saying every minute of the day is just as valuable.  As /u/kr1tya3 mentioned agroculture isn't really affected THAT MUCH by taking a minute off, and this sourcesays that 40% of the world works in agriculture. HOWEVER THIS SOURCE says that 3% of the economy is agriculture, so after removing 3% from the 77.609 trillion we have 75.280 trillion.  It seems that 2% of people work third shift white collar wise, and 10% blue collar. It's hard to determine the statistics on how many people are in each category, but I'd say there are more blue collar.  This means, probably 7% of people aren't working during the day when the normal moment of silence would be taken.  Lets say that has a DIRECT correlation with the economy, and so 3% agro 7% off at the time, it's down to $69.848.1 Trillion.  So then we have 70(rounded for my typing purposes but not the math) BILLION dollars that are during the 8 hours work day. If every person works the 2080 hours that are in a working year(no more than 40 a week or less) then we have 2080*60 which is 124,800 and then we do 69,848,100,000,000/124,800 and that would be $559,680,288.462 lost by having a moment of silence.  This would of course depend also on if everyone took a moment of silence at respective a certain time during the day, or if we all did it at 10am CST then china would be asleep and less working there. And so on.  ALSO if people were doing job that did not require talking/wouldn't need to stop.  And so on.  But, it's probably something around $559,680,288.462 if everywhere did it at ""median"" production hours."
theydidthemath,3ce9hq,CaptainFartdick,2,Tue Jul 7 06:00:36 2015 UTC,"Managed to dig out this paper in the Journal of Surgery where researchers were testing the effectiveness of bicycle helmets during head compression tests.   As part of the test they had to test a skull without a helmet on, even noting the point of ""catastrophic structural failure"" which is exactly the data we need. The relevant extract from the article:   The unhelmeted skull underwent catastrophic failure during testing, experiencing a maximum load of 520 lbf.   520 pounds-force is the same amount of force as 2313 N. This study by NASA seems to suggest that the maximum force that can be applied by the average male human is about 1000N if they brace against a wall. The average American male can deadlift about 300lb with a little bit of basic training. If we assume this strength translates linearly (I dunno if it does but I think they use similar muscle groups) then we can work out how much you'd have to be able to deadlift to do this.   2313 / 1000 = 2.313 more than the average human needed 2.313 * 300lb = 693.9 lb deadlift needed   While that's still a lot more than the deadlift strength of the average elite lifter, it's still less than the world record for an unassisted lift which is 1015lb. I'd wager not impossible, but it's definitely not something just anyone can train to do."
theydidthemath,3cdakf,Atlatna_Barves,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:43:01 2015 UTC,"To answer this question, we would have to first assume that chick-fil-a would make the same amount of money on Sundays as they do every other day of the week.  I will deal purely with profit and not on net gain due to the unavailability of those numbers. According to their website, their sales in 2014 were nearly $6 billion dollars. Their sales in 2013 were only $5.1 billion according to wikipedia, so we can assume they are a growing business and have at least reached 6 billion in sales this year.  6 billion/364 days - 52 days taken off = $16,483,516. Each day chick-fil-a makes 16 million dollars!  $16,483,516 times 52 weeks = $857,142,832. If we multiply their daily sales by 52 to account for a year of sales on Sundays, we find that they would lose approximately $857,142,832 a year because of them shutting down on Sundays.   The second answer would be much more difficult to calculate because of the widely differing variables, so I'll let someone else take a jab at that."

The waist down is 2 ft. 8 inches so total from the waist to the top of the head is 3 ft 1 inch (37 inches total). I'm going to assume a ""head shot"" is roughly in the center of the head, so that puts it at 2ft and 9 inches above the waist (33 inches total). The third diagram shows that the breast is nearly exactly halfway between the midpoint of the head and the waist.  The people over at SafeGuard Armor suggest a 1 inch gap between the waist and vest, so in total from the bottom of the armor to the position for a head shot is 2 ft. 8 inches (32 inches total).  If the total distance for that officer was 4 inches (2 inches high and 2 inches low), that means he is one-eighth the size of our model human.   5 ft 9 inches = 69 inches total * 0.125 = 8.625 inches tall (8 and 5/8 inches tall)  That would make Officer Wilson 2 inches taller than a King Size Snickers.

Black holes eat matter and energy, so firing anything into it should make it grow, not disable it. I say ""as far as we know"" because we know literally nothing about what happens inside a black hole.  The best theory we currently have that could make black holes disappear is Hawking radiation which states (very simplified) that quantum mechanics means that some particles will randomly jump across the event horizon (Edit: too simplified, this picture is a better illustration). This is something that occurs naturally, and we have no reason to believe we could speed up the process or manipulate it in anyway."

theydidthemath,3ccs56,ninjastar3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"I'll take a crack at this. Helpfully there's a nice still[1] at the start of the video which more or less shows the entire setup. I'm gonna work this out in £ but I'll translate to $ & € at the end.  The set is built with LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 which costs around £300 per kit. You can buy all the components separately though which is what I'm guessing the creator has had to do for this build since lots of duplicate parts are needed. The parts we'll be using are:   EV3 Intelligent Brick (MSIB)- £200 EV3 Large Servo Motor (LSM) - £25 EV3 Medium Servo Motor (MSM) - £20 EV3 Infrared Sensor (IRS) - £25 Power Cable (PC) - £20 EV3 Rechargeable Batter (RB) - £70 EV3 Touch Sensor (TS) - £15 7 Pack of EV3 Cables - £15   We can see in [1] that the components of the production line are broke into 4 distinct parts. Supply units (11 on the first leg, 10 on the second), the turning point, the packaging unit, and the massive tabletop. Each part also include a section of container path. The video is high enough quality that we can look at each bit of the build and work out what's used.  Within all those parts there's a lot of miscellaneous LEGO used and there's no way to work out for sure what the part list actually is. I know however that LEGO Stores sell pick-a-brick tubs about £7 each. These subs weigh about 210g full and [55g empty meaning they hold ~155g of LEGO. This works out at about 4.5p per gram. I also know that a 31cm3 block of LEGO weighs about 13g, or 1cm3 = 0.42g. That means LEGO costs about 1.89p per cm3 - it's a very rough estimate but it should be fine for what we're doing.   Lets start with the supply units, each of the 21 being identical. This photo gives us a nice view of the back this photo gives a good one of the front. Each unit has one MSIB/RB/PC combo associated with it which then seems to have about 7 cables coming out. One of these is connected to an IRS, one to a LSM in the nearest container path, and the other five to LSM powering various components within the units. This totals in £480 in mindstorms parts. I then know that this piece is 11cm long so if I find and trace it in a photo of the unit I know that the unit is approximately 21296cm3 in size. Using our cost per cm2 we can estimate that each supply unit then has £402 of miscellaneous bricks. It's a very rough guess but it's decent enough once you account for the gaps within the structure but also adding in the additional container path parts. This means the total cost per supply unit is ~ £880 or £18,480 overall  Now onto the turning point. It has a single MSIB/RB/PC combo, 7 cables, an IRs sensor,  and for LSM. That's £430 in MS parts. Using the same comparison as before, once all the bits are mushed together, it looks like it contains 2662cm3 of bricks or £50. That means £480 for the turning point.  The tabletop is an easy one - each white tile looks to be about 1 13 hole girder by half a 13 hold girder and 1 deep. The table is 23 tiles wide and I'll estimate about 100 long (never completely visible). That means the tabletop has a volume of 1530650cm3 or £29,000.  Finally the packaging unit. This is complicated. It includes an entire EV3 model just as a counterbalance so that's £300 right off the bat. There then seems to be at least three MSIB/RB/PC combos each connected to one LSM and one IRS, with just one of them also connected to a TS which I assume functions as an emergency stop button of some kind. That's another £1500. It then contains one MSIB/RB/PC combo in the weight mechanism, one in the crane mechanism, and I think the dispenser is mechanical (which would make sense since it's the only bit that requires a human). I can't really see which components are connected to which MSIB but I can see 2 IRS, 8 MSM and 2 LSM. This works out at another £870. Helpfully the unit is also plated the same as the table so even though it's very rought we can estimate somewhere in the region of 100,000cm3 or £1900. This brings the total for the packager at £4570.  Add this all together: £18,480 for the supply units + £480 for the turning point + £29,000 for the table top + £4570 for the packager = £52,530. That means the total cost for the factory is approximately £52,000 ($77,000 or €70,000)."
theydidthemath,3caus5,autotom,32,Mon Jul 6 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"If a piece of payload broke free, it would be moving at the same speed as the vehicle when it broke free. It would stay at that speed, and hit the back at the speed of the change in velocity of the vehicle that took place as it 'fell'.   So, let's say it a piece of the payload has 1 meter to fall (very generous; these things are packed tight, and are loaded from the bottom up for obvious reasons), and that the rocket is accelerating at the maximum axial load of 6 g's (taken from the Payload User's Guide, p.32), we can calculate the speed fairly easily. Note that acceleration due to gravity shouldn't be needed in this calculation, because it should be taken care of by the enveloping loads in the vehicle reference frame.  So, after some simple kinematics math,  v = sqrt(2 * a * d), giving a final velocity around 10 m/s. Since you asked for energy, that's about 26 kJ. But since the dynamics of how the payload adapter and IDA would flex and possibly buckle under shock loading are incredibly difficult to predict, the final load seen by the LOX tank could in fact be comparatively quite low.  This would be a bad thing, but I don't think it's enough to destroy the LOX tank by an obvious amount. The structures are designed to handle shocks of some size, and a transient load in this range might cause structural failure in the payload adapter, but I would not say this is an obvious failure candidate.  I would consider it very unlikely that loose payload would induce such a dramatic failure; it is very simple to secure payloads against the loads they observed during flight. I would expect the cause to be something that seems far more benign, as is often the case with such failures."

theydidthemath,3caus5,freddo411,2,Tue Jul 7 06:24:29 2015 UTC,"There's no reason why the control software couldn't have multiple flight setting to handle different mission profiles and payloads (expendable vs. recoverable, people vs. full payload). GTO missions will presumably be more extreme to lower the gravity losses. OTOH, intentionally decreasing acceleration also increases downrange distance at stage separation, making recovery more difficult, which is not something SpaceX wants, so only an expendable mission with crew could take advantage of that, and those are not all that likely."

Having said that, F9's second stage is rather heavy, so that doesn't apply completely to it. But it also means that it's limited to 35-50 m/s2 of acceleration, assuming the MECO burnout mass of the stack at 130 mt and the total 9xMerlin 1D thrust in the throttleable range in vacuum of 4500-6400 kN."
theydidthemath,3caus5,Another_Penguin,6,Tue Jul 7 11:43:30 2015 UTC,Max acceleration can occur at first stage burnout as well as second stage burnout. I've done some rough simulations and it ends up being around 2-3gs at MECO. SECO is probably where the 6g figure comes from

theydidthemath,3caus5,larlin289,2,Tue Jul 7 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"First point, at LOX temperatures the Aluminum-Lithium alloy is going to be a bit more brittle than at room temperature.  Second point: The velocity and mass listed sounds a good deal like a  low speed car crash, and event well known to dent metal.  Even ~1/4"" thick Aluminum is likely to be dented.  Third, I tried translating 56 K Joules into a sledgehammer blow. How fast would a sledgehammer be traveling if it were accelerated by 56 KJ ? Let's start with a 2Kg single handed sledgehammer.  E = 1/2 mV2   becomes  56250 Joules = 1/2 x 2 kg x V2  Solve for V.  V = ( 56250 Joules )1/2  V = 237 m/s ~= 778 ft/sec, which is about the speed of a 0.45"" cailber bullet out of a .45 automatic. A 2 kg piece of iron traveling at 237 m/s would not just dent a tank made of high strength aluminum alloy a cm thick, it would punch a hole right through it.  There is more than enough energy here to crack the tank. The question now becomes, how much of that energy would be absorbed deforming the IDA? The IDA is not a solid piece of steel. It is made of pieces of sheet metal and machined metal, much like the tank itself, so assuming 50% of the energy goes into deforming the IDA might be reasonable.  But there is another energy absorbing deformation to consider. It is very unlikely the payload mounts in the Dragon's trunk just released, as if they were given a faulty command. It is more likely that one was not closed properly and let go, and then the unexpected torque caused the other two to tear free. Tearing metal requires energy. An acceptable first guess might be that 1/3 of the energy went to tearing free from the payload mounts, 1/3 went to deforming the IDA, and 1/3 went to deforming the LOX tank. That makes the energy available to harm the LOX tank = 56250 J / 3 = 18750 J.  Let's turn 18750 J into sledgehammer equivalents.  E = 1/2 m V2  becomes  18750 J = 1/2 x 2 kg x V2  Solve for V  V = ( 18750 )1/2 = 137 m/s = 449 ft/s  Getting hit by a sledgehammer traveling at 449 ft/s is still likely to punch a hole in a 1 cm thick tank of Aluminum, at LOX temperatures. Depending on the alloy, it might just leave a massive dent at room temperature, but for some of the more brittle alloys, a crack is pretty likely.  I was not expecting this result when I started calculating."
theydidthemath,3caus5,John_Hasler,2,Tue Jul 7 23:03:12 2015 UTC,As the IDA is bolted to the top of the trunk (as viewed when launched) and there is no other cargo in the trunk your fall height is about 2.5 meters. Based on your other numbers Otherwise good answer. I get it to be 17 m/s with the longer fall height.
