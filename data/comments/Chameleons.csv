Chameleons,3e1lqn,babyfister6969,3,Tue Jul 21 06:48:04 2015 UTC,This isn't a picture of my chameleon but mine has a bump that looks very similar. ( It's at my friends we co-own him.) Read it could be a fungal infection. I read f10 anti fungal cream is safe to use on reptiles wanted your opinions on what I should use. Making a vet appointment tomorrow.
Chameleons,3e1lqn,flip69,4,Tue Jul 21 06:53:50 2015 UTC,"How long have you had him? Where did you get him from?  Is the dead skin raised Hard underneath or soft?  Is the skin on the top hard and dry or ... wet?  These are the things that will help us determine what it is.  Also the conditions of your habitat? is it high humidity and do you spray water (mist) it ... for hydration?  Is it a ""cone"" that constantly raises or a rounded bump or just a raised area.  I'm looking at a point of infection and a circular spreading of damaged tissue.   It helps to determine the causes, basic ID of the problem and the solution."
Chameleons,3e1lqn,PatMcCrotch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"Hey flip, what causes fungal infections in chameleons?"
Chameleons,3e1lqn,flip69,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:51:50 2015 UTC,Physical damage can provide an opening for infection..  Their skin is oily and repels water so usually there's not much of a problem  But lets say that there was an owner that had something like an athletes food issue and they misted their animal after touching him.   That could provide a site for infection  But we really don't know anything about this.  It's possible that a regular OTC anti fungal will work. Fungus is common on reptile eggs and I've used foot powder on them to stop a fungal colony from killing my eggs.

Chameleons,3dzdao,garythecoconut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, growth is just slow while they are on the fruit flies stage. it really picks up once you can start feeding them bigger feeders. If you can get started on crickets with the size larger than pin head it starts to increase the growth rate. You will have to decide when he is ready for that since I can't tell from the pic. Bean beetles are just a tiny step bigger than fruit flies.  are you dusting the fruit flies with anything?"

That is why you want a trusted breeder.   You can specify the size you want beforehand via email. Then if they don't send you what you agreed to, then you have it in writing and get a refund."
Chameleons,3e06l0,garythecoconut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"A good question. the thought of a /r/Chameleons AMA is running through my head right now. I'd call but it's too late his local time for that.   I haven't delved too much into how they actually operate specifically.  That's personal stuff and it's rude for me to probe.  So this is going to be a mix of guesswork and assumptions based on what I've seen and spoken about with them.  It'll also include my experience and how the business is run (from my perspective)    In general, the ones that go to shows, every breeder will take some of the nicer animals.. Ideally, you want them all to be nice.   At such a small size and age the ready clutches are hard to predict what is going to end up as what... There's always going to be a ""ugly duckling"" issue (that has CERTAINLY happened to many people!)  And for the hour it's going to take just to make the most rough of determinations (guesses) for just a dozen individuals -  time is better spent doing something else (like packing).  I'm going to assume that he's just going for early size and health.  Usually the policy is to go though and select the top 10% as holdbacks for the next generation of breeders.  (that is standard - keeping more females)  The rest (minus any runts) that are all showing good health are going to get pulled and taken to the show.... estimating how much you'll move so as to not be overstocked and risking health and accidents with shipping them across the country.  So what happens to that 10%?  Those holdbacks are all expensive in terms of space, effort, and potential revenue, you can't keep them all.... some will develop into duds (not so special/average for the clutch), others will not, those will be given a name and pictures will be taken.    That's the sub adults.... the ones that don't make the cut, are cycled into the sales loop,  mixed in with those that haven't sold from the non selected clutches.   Occasionally a ugly ducking will get pulled and promoted to the holdback / breeders.   I don't want leftovers   You're assuming that people are able to actually select a ""good cham"" ... these things change color all the time and most people at the shows don't have enough of an eye to tell gender much less how a 3 month old might develop later on.  So a clutch isn't going to be as ""picked through"" as much as you might think when it gets older....  that pool is going to be mixed with the holdbacks and the unsold with the late developers tossed in.  There's been many a story of the ugly ducking blossoming that simply didn't show well at an early age.   The whole system works against those kinds of genetics... which is kinda sad.  TL;DR: Unless you can make your own pick of the litter AND you know what to look for in what MIGHT develop into something nice, there's a good chance that it's all random in what people get.   The older animals are a mix of the holdbacks that didn't get moved up to the breeder slots and those that remain from the shows.  The best thing to do is to ask what they have.  personally, I'd go for the younger ones (3 month) if you know you can take care of them That way you can handle it and get it used to you... so when the hormone trigger instincts kick in you won't be dealing with a creature that's never been handled and is deathly afraid of you.  If you're not quite so comfortable with a 3 month old then roll the dice and hope for a holdback Then invest a good deal of time handling it so it will unlearn it's defensiveness.   Sorry for this being long... lots of details and thoughts running around in my head."
Chameleons,3dv5qo,iFartWhenILaughh,4,Sun Jul 19 19:54:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for being responsive to the changes.  I would have a greater amount of perches in the top 1/3 of the cage. Also veileds are ""large chameleons"" so the ""deep dome"" lights are actually too small a cone of light for them.  Since this is all new, I'd return that housing and do two things.  # 1 Get a wide reflective shop light (with a clip) they run about $10 at home depot.  the 10"" metal reflective dome shop lights at home depot work well and they provide a wide gradient of light over much much more of the cage than those dinky things.   That can be used for either the heat source or the UVb source.  # 2  The compact UVb lights (5.0 strength / 100 rating depending on brand)  Are ""alright"".   But it's better to get a long tube light that'll give greater UVb coverage over a wide area of the cage.  You can get a 18"" reptisun 5.0 at most pet stores and a T8 housing for it at Homedepot.  Whatever you get, make sure that there's no plastic covering shielding the tube and in between the animal.   I've seen some under the shelf housings that will work well if a crafty reflective hood can be devised... some petstores will carry a good housing in the aquatics department.   I use a dual housing that will hold both a UVb 5.0 and a second light that is either ""white light"" or a plant light.   That will pour down onto the cages and not only keep the animals happier and more active, but you'll be able to best see their colors and keep the interior plants alive.   Both should be placed on the top of the screen cage and that should pour light down on the animal."
Chameleons,3dv5qo,flip69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you SO much for this info!   My concern with perches up high was the burns that I saw in some of the info in the sidebar. I will definitely add some more though!   The lights were one of the things I still wasn't feeling confident about. Your info is very helpful and specific. Since the weekend is ending I most likely won't be able to fix it right away, but I will definitely replace the lights ASAP   EDIT: two more questions.   1) is there any reason not to use those silicone ""vines"" that we put in the cage? We washed them. It just seemed like a good option because it holds its shape and was only $5 for two.   2) we also purchased a pothos plant from Home Depot to use but when we got home we saw that it has ""treated with neonicotinoids"" written on the label. we haven't put it in because we don't want to risk it. Do you know anything about this?"
Chameleons,3dv5qo,flip69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:57:28 2015 UTC,"If you do not put the lights directly above the perches but at a 45º angle to the heat source to the perch so the animal gets broadsided with the max area of warmth then they'll be able to warm up their core organs efficiently.   That and if you do it correctly, they'll be able to walk into a gradient of intensity and find their ""not to hot, not too cold"" =Goldilocks zone  Those are fine for the meantime  but you'll want to change them for thicker fake vines. You really don't want pressure sores to develop by having your animal walk on the same thickness support 24/7.. it helps to give them some variability in the perches and travel pathways so they're always to change and not have to have a static body position when resting.   # 2   Yes, the problem with the insecticides is that they do get transferred to the animals.  Hatchlings are very sensitive and there's been quite a few people that have purchased some ""edible"" plants at home depot and even for leaf licking water on the leaves.... entire clutches got poisoned and died.  So, with a nibbler like a veiled... you should wait a few weeks - a month for the poison to break down. Give it some light outside (scattered and not direct light) take care of it and let it grow out a bit.  With some luck the old leaves will die and fall off, followed by new growth as an adaption to the change in environment.  The fall back is to use some of the plastic fake plants and not the silk flowers."

Crickets shouldn't be longer than the space between his/her eyes.

I use flukers orange cubes cricket feeder to gutload my guys, but you can use fresh fruits and veggies as well (just make sure they're chameleon safe!). There are lots of websites out there with safe plant lists for chameleons. You can also try giving fresh fruits and veggies to your guy, but the chances of them eating them depend on the chameleon. Some love fruits and veggies, mine doesn't touch them. As for giving crickets to your guy, when they're young it's best to put the crickets in a small tub that are too tall for them to jump out of so none get lost and uneaten in the cage. I have a small calcium/d3 tub and a separate multivitamin tub, so I'll grab a piece of egg carton and shake them off in to the tub (by tub I mean something you'd put leftovers in), swish them around, show my guy that there are crickets, wait for him to come over, then place the tub down so he can eat. I really hope this helps! Good luck with your little guy!"

Chameleons,3dl3qx,bananaloaf142,3,Fri Jul 17 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"Lol. It is fine.   Personally, I wouldn't be worried about parasites."

Chameleons,3dl3qx,chasingcars825,3,Fri Jul 17 06:03:10 2015 UTC,"it depends, was the lizard wild... as in wild caught from africa or locally?  There are a few parasites that can get into your cham this way.. but generally here in the west we've done a pretty good job of keeping them under control.   Either way it's too late now.   Just keep an eye out for anything in the stools or moving around under the skin.  Some of the local stuff will not make it and be able to set up shop, others will do quite nicely in your pet and then have to be physically removed (the worm that is)."
Chameleons,3dl3qx,flip69,2,Fri Jul 17 14:08:03 2015 UTC,"I live in Florida we have all kinds of lizards. it seemed to be just a very small geco maybe a couple days old. He's been good so far nothing strange in his poop.  and we don't use pesticides in or around our house so if anything it was an ""organic"" lizard. I'll keep an eye on his poop for the next couple of days"
Chameleons,3dl3qx,flip69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's possible that the gecko ate a insect that had some hitchhiker in it.   no real way for us to determine anything on this end except that you just keep an eye on it for some future abnormal fecal or issue.   Since it was a young gecko the chances are low and it's unlikely to have picked up something in it's short life.   That's good."
Chameleons,3dl3qx,johnnyfatsac,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"He'll be fine. They eat anything they can fit in their mouth in the wild, including small lizards."
Chameleons,3dl3qx,chasingcars825,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:28:57 2015 UTC,"The primary concern is parasites. Do you know what kind of lizard it was? Where abouts do you live? Taking a fecal sample to the vet is a good idea, just to be extra cautious. Tho if the lizard had parasites I dont know if it would show up right away in your chams poop, not sure on the advisable waiting period.   Keep us posted!"

When I move him up to his adult cage I'm going to put in a Hibiscus tree since he also loves eating the flowers :) Here's a list of safe live plants for chameleons: http://www.chameleonparadise.net/information/live-plants/"
