If this extension does shit with IP and stuff it probably is that. If they aren't complete fucks they'll unban.   Also assuming you aren't already banned for something else  Ninja edit: yea browsec is VPN stuff. Tell them that and don't use again, or just try turning off and see"

BannedFrom4chan,38mbc6,ThatsWhy_SoFly,9,Fri Jun 5 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be surprised. The mods are just out of control lately, and this isn't the worst of it. They're even banning people for posting dubs threads on /b/ (even though the rules say ""no dubs threads OUTSIDE of /b/"") and for asking for anime suggestions on /a/ (using the ""no requests outside of /r/"" rule). Yet they're too busy to do anything about the real spammers. And anyone who points this out is going to get b& as well.   they do it for free"

BannedFrom4chan,37x0hn,Atamis,9,Sun May 31 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"the ""ban evasion"" ban is used in two situations:   the mods think you're someone who is currently banned and is ban evading (using the same nick; using images with the same, easily identifiable file names or naming formats as someone who they banned; outright saying you're ban evading or outright saying you were just banned; or if the mods just think you're someone they just banned because you act a little similarly, which is purely conjecture and shitty moderating) OR they have no reason, they're a terrible mod and they want to ban you for the lulz   The second scenario is more common on some boards, less common on others. I've heard of mods abusing the ""ban evasion"" reason on /b/, /pol/ and /mu/ in particular. I've never heard of it happening on /vr/ or /co/, for example. It's possible on /vg/ a mod might have been lurking (or participating in, just without the mod flag) in the same general as you and just didn't like you. Mods have very little accountability so basically what they say goes.  RIP bro"
