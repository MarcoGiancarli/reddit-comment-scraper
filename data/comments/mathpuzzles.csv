Therefore x/2 - 1/2 = 0 --> x = 1 --> before Person C came in there was one muffin in the basket.  Person B bought half the muffins plus half a muffin, and we now know that 1 muffin was left over. y/2 - 1/2 = 1 --> y/2 = 3/2 --> y= 3, so before Person B bought any muffins, there were 3 muffins in the basket.

Solving for x is impossible as it ends up being 50 mph / x mph = 0. This implies that x mph is infinitely large. A more intuitive answer substituting the distance as 100 miles is this. The total time taken to drive there and back is simply total distance/average speed = 100 miles / 50mph = 2 hours.  We know it took 25 mph to get to the place so time taken for the first half  of the journey is = total distance/average speed = 50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours.

Let's assume that it's like a a straight road with San Francisco at the start, los Angeles in the middle, and San Francisco at the end. So say the journey from start to finish is 400km. So in order to average 50 km/h he must get to the end in 8 hours (assuming no stops) as 400/50 = 8.  So if for the first half he travels 25km/h. Then he travels 200km in 25 km/h. This means it took him 200/25 = 8 hours to get to the middle. In order to average 50km/h he has to travel the remaining 200km in exactly 0 seconds. Meaning it is impossible no matter how fast he travels.  Your formula was correct except you need to change ""distance between x and x"" to ""time between x and x"""

Your strategy is to flip the coin that makes the bitwise xor of all the heads equal to the label of the magic coin. It is easy to show such a coin always exists.

mathpuzzles,3bfj59,John_Q_Nippleton_III,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's not really a CS answer - it's rigorous and I only used binary numbers for convenience. I've fleshed out the solution more:  Label the coins as 6 digit binary numbers from 000000 to 111111. Let {h_1, h_2, .. h_k} be the set of binary numbers representing the coins which are heads. Let H = h_1 xor h_2 xor .. h_k. The xor operation is commutative and associative so this is well defined.  Let m be the binary number representing the magic coin. Then flip the coin represented by: H xor m. After flipping the coin, the xor of the heads becomes: H xor H xor m, which is equal to m. The friend can therefore calculate which coin is magic by evaluating the xor of all the heads."

mathpuzzles,3bfj59,Desperoth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"Not a solution, but some thoughts. Heads/Tails is effectively binary. There are 64 squares which is 26 meaning a row of 6 coins (e.g. the top row) could tell your partner which square to look at (e.g. H =1, T = 0). However, you can only turn one coin - this would require up to 6 to be turned over. Can someone use this/improve on this? Am I on the right lines?"

You make it so each combination corresponds to a space on the board. All 64 spaces have an equal amount of combinations. No matter what your board looked like and where the magic coin was you would be able to flip a coin to one of the 18446744073709551616 combinations to show which space the magic coin was on to your partner.

It's a little pedantic but, if you wanted to show this to some low-level students, that's how I'd approach it."
mathpuzzles,3bexty,lockedinaroom,2,Sun Jun 28 20:59:19 2015 UTC,I did it the even longer way. I multiplied 60x60x24x42 out in my head and then multiplied 1x2x3x4... until I reached the same number.

mathpuzzles,3bexty,CogitoErg0Sum,3,Sun Jun 28 17:10:20 2015 UTC,6*7*24*60*60 = 6*7 * 3*8 * 1*2*5*6* * 4*15 = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8 * 6*15 = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8 * 10*9 so n=10. However I definitely prefer /u/845561's solution.

I just know that a million seconds is about a week and a half, so six weeks has to be about 4 million seconds. Then I just started evaluating factorials in my head, 6!=720 7!=~5000 8!=~40000, 9!=~360,000, 10! =~ 3.6 million. So that has to be the answer"
mathpuzzles,3bexty,theobromus,2,Mon Jun 29 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"I recall Knuth once saying you should memorize that 10! about equals 3.5 million, and 86,400 rounds to 100k, so the number of seconds is roughly 100k * 7 * 6 = 4.2 million, which is closest to 10!"

mathpuzzles,3bexty,nitsbgp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:35 2015 UTC,"I did this without writing anything down, so I had to minimize the amount of factoring I did. (Otherwise it was way too hard to keep track of.)  The number of seconds in 6 weeks is 60*60*24*6*7.  24 = 2*3*4, and we have a 6 and a 7. Now we just break down the 60*60 part.  60*60=3600=5*720=5*8*90=5*8*9*10, therefore the answer is 10."

mathpuzzles,3bay98,Linearts,3,Sun Jun 28 18:35:23 2015 UTC,You can use the equation of the circle which is x2 + y2 = 102 and sub in the x-value of 5 to work out the y-value of B which equals the length BC.
mathpuzzles,3bay98,JimmyWhiffler,2,Sun Jun 28 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"Well, the arc is described by y = √(r²−x²), so BC = √(100−25). Pythagorean theorem reduces that to √100 for AC."

mathpuzzles,3bbta7,sjb-2812,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"Here's how I did it:  For the radius of the whole ring I divide the ring into 4 parts so that each of them are a triangle with lengths R, R and the given 10 cm plus the area seperated by the 10cm-line. Using the pythagorean theorem I solve   '10² = 2 * R²'   for R, getting the squareroot of 50 for R, the radius of the whole ring.  For the radius r of the smaller ring I bisect the triangle from before, thereby getting a triangle with lengths R, r and half the given length (=5cm). And again, using the pythagorean theorem, I solve   'R² = r² + 5²'   or   '50 = r² + 5²'   giving me the squareroot of 25 for r.  Since the area of a circle is   'PIr²'  , I have   'PIR² - PI*r²'   or   'PI * (R² - r²)'   as the area of our ring. Inserting our values for r and R from earlier, we get   'PI * (50 - 25)'  or simply A = PI * 25"

mathpuzzles,3bbta7,Drop_the_gun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"I drew a right triangle with the line tangential to the chord as the hypotenuse. I then used the pythygorean theorem to solve for the sides. a2 + b2 = 102. Since a == b, I found out a = sqrt(50).   Now that I knew the area of the entire circle, I knew right away to look for the area of the inner circle so I could subtract outer area - inner area to obtain the ring's area.   I divided the 10cm side of the triangle into two equal triangles and used the pythgorean theorem to solve for the height x. 52 + x2 = 50. x = 5. Using the area of a circle formula, I found the inner circle's area to be 25*pi. outer - inner = 50pi - 25pi = 25 pi.    I relied on intuition since I don't really know any of these properties or in fact ever proved them before..."
