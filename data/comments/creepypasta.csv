creepypasta,3djbv7,mittent5613,3,Thu Jul 16 19:02:03 2015 UTC,"Decent story.  There are two things that I would like to give constructive criticism on.  These are my opinion, so take them with a grain of salt.    At the very first you said:    ""i remember this perfectly. I can still picture even the smallest details in my head.""    and then immediately after you say:    ""I was around 5 to 8 years old at the time""   It seems as if you remember it perfectly, every detail, you'd remember exactly how old you are and not just a guess.   Secondly, if your older brother was 2 years older than you that would make him from 7 to 10.  And if he had a teenage friend who was 6 years older than him, that would make him 13 to 16.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't see a 13-16 year old hanging out with a 7-10 year old.  I'm nitpicking a little bit, but there you go."

It was 3:30am when he was getting ready to go, 15 minutes would have gotten him there before 4, perhaps an hour or so for the briefing and interview, then leaving for home. Getting a call and seeing a realtor on the way home (forgive me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure if inspections and openings happen in the early hours of the day before say 8 or 9am) Unless the realtor was actually SHADOW taken a human form... luring the detective into the horror himself.

creepypasta,3dbalr,Furious_Power,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS CREEPYPASTA. THIS WAS WRITTEN BY MY FRIEND, PYRO MARX. THESE ARE HIS ORIGINAL IDEAS.           BLOODMOON.                               I have always been a Kirby fan.     My first game I ever played was Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. I had played the game, forward to back all the way to 02.  But every time I fought 02, I always felt unsettled; his theme always rung in my ears and the arena was hypnotizing, like a psychedelic experience.  But I would have these nightmares…I would be alone in the dark void of 02's arena and I would look up to see 02 with a bleeding eye along with a black figure. It looked like Kirby but with wings and longer arms and what may have been armor. It had these orange eyes that would just stare, never blinking, never moving.  02 was much more realistic in the dream. He would have the shards of the crystals that had been shot at him in the countless battles dug into his flesh and eye...and his halo was always much brighter. I would usually notice his tail was in its thorn form, but it would be painted with blood.     Then it would just be nothing. Nothing but hours of me in the void with the two watching me. Then, the bodies of Kirby and his friends would appear, impaled on the thorns of 02's thorny tail…dead. I would smell the blood coming off their body's…then Kirby would wake up and say to me in a clear as day voice, ""She never gives in, she will never die, and you will never escape. BEWARE THE BLOOD MOON!"" I never knew what it meant but I would be in my bed. Alone, with nothing but the Moon to fend off the darkness. A few years later after the nightmares had long stopped, my friends told me about the game, Superstar Ultra. It was a remake of one of the best Kirby games, so they said, so I tried it out, I had really stayed out of the other games as I liked 64 the most with its cute characters and fun story. I hadn't even looked at the other games until then as I was oblivious of how many games they had made.     Once I started the game, the music was awesome! I loved every minute of it. The music was great and the graphics were very well put together. I blew through Spring Breeze and Dyanablade, even getting all the way through The Great Cave Offensive! But then The Revenge of Meta Knight was unlocked.  I instantly recognized his wings and posture. Strangely, his eyes were a lot less detailed and yellow instead of the orange, high detail version that the figure had had in the dreams. I just figured it was a coincidence. Though I was ungodly iffy when the music played.  I played through it very fast once I saw the timer and I loved the style of the Halberd, along with its crew, but when I destroyed the generator with its reflecting laser, the Wheelie (my favorite helper by far) came from off screen, slowly drove over to Kirby and flopped on its side. It just lied there. I just figured maybe it was a glitch and just kept moving, again, very iffy.  When Meta Knight’s crew claimed they would fight to the end I felt really bad for them. They wanted to do everything in their power to help Meta Knight and keep the mission alive, even when they knew they likely will die like the rest.  Meta Knight then said, ""I’m sorry.”  I then was forced to fight them all, one by one, then when the battle ended, the text popped up but with the crew beaten with destroyed armor and helmets saying, ""You’re cruel…just like her.""  They then said nothing else and Meta Knight’s battle began…  Meta Knight was just sitting on top his perch in the control room. Just sitting…he held the body of the Axe Knight in his hands.  He then said without turning, ""I will never forgive you for this. I simply wanted to make Dreamland a better place, you are selfish, greedy and you are so detached from the reality of what is…you will die by my blade.""  He then set down the bloody, lifeless body of the Axe Knight and instantly summoned a Mach Tornado without warning. It brought me down to half health instantly. I fought him with all my might but whenever I struck him with my sword a small bit of blood would fall onto the floor. As the fight moved on his mask would be scratched and slightly break.  When the battle ended he lied on the ground without his mask and said, ""You will be no match... when she comes for you. She lets no one leave her sight. I HOPE YOU FEEL THE BLOOD MOON!"" then he flew through the window of the control room, breaking it, and out of sight.  Kirby just stood there. He looked almost as confused and startled as I was..."

creepypasta,3d6kpb,Potatoes_inc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:04 2015 UTC,"As noted, the metaphor is good, but the delivery is iffy. You throw way too many details out way to suddenly.  The True Story element probably shouldn't be applied in a story like this either. It's sort of like... In jokes about stories where the person talks about something that happened in the past ""How did you know about the parts you weren't there for?""  Stories can't really end with ""And then they died."" unless the narrator is an observer.   If it's a true story and the woman was stabbed to death, who exactly is telling the story? One of the slaves? How do they know about her dream?"

creepypasta,3co4g5,TheSanguineFox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"Very interesting concept for a story. Maybe include some brief description of what 'it"" is though."
creepypasta,3co4g5,TheSanguineFox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be obvious 'It"" is a monster"
creepypasta,3co4g5,gregbrahe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yes of course, but without any description it's difficult to imagine what exactly scarred the kids so much. The creature could be literally anything. While there is something to be said for leaving scary details up to the imagination, it does help to have some initial ideas on what your monster looks like."
creepypasta,3co4g5,Jacob_wallace,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"What did ""it"" use to grab and choke Jack? A tentacle? a clawed hand? a tongue? Can you describe the appendage a bit using illustrative language to help us get an image of what the narrator saw? What did the monster sound like? Did it smell?   The more imagery and sensory language you use, the more l get immersed in the story. This story has potential, but it feels more like an outline of a complete story than a finished product."
creepypasta,3co4g5,tcthetopcat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:55:10 2015 UTC,I personally liked that you made the monster ambiguous and that it's whatever my imagination wants it to be.
creepypasta,3co4g5,TPFG,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"I like it. You leave a lot up to the imagination, and that's when things get scary"

creepypasta,3cl1nl,_crimsoneyes,0,Wed Jul 8 19:07:05 2015 UTC,Thats very interesting you should tell them you not look for any trouble have you every made them angry at you like have you ever done the ouija board or anything to talk to any sort or spirit it could have followed you and it will be worse if you did not say Goodbye but i cant really help you have to choose what you need to do but did never say goodbye or you just left without telling them they will come back and if you can i would talk to them again and say goodbye you have to very nice they are very picky sometimes but i hope this helped i cant really give you much advice sorry but that is all i have i look more into it.

creepypasta,3cjqvx,I_FIGHT_BEAR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"Don't 'not try'. That was honest feedback, if not a little blunt and unconstructive. Keep writing and get better. Or write horror style poetry. That shit can be chilling. I almost didn't click this story because I'm about to go to sleep but reading that made me keep my light on for another hour or so. Keep writing"

creepypasta,3cjqvx,rbsanford,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:05:34 2015 UTC,the story has a good premise Demon_Marionette. you just need to edit it around a little to create an actual narrative
creepypasta,3cjqvx,slk6400,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"I think a narrative is present, the story is just a little incomplete. It's a great start though, quite chilling and relatable. Please continue, Demon."
creepypasta,3cjqvx,SZ-MrAnomaly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:41:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, i'm unsure of the structure of writing a creepypasta or writing short stories in general since writing stories is not my forte.  I usually write poetry, but it's not for everyone and it's probably not the greatness poetry ever written either, but i'm trying to improve..  Is there a writing creepypasta story prompt anywhere I could use?  I appreciate feedback, but I hate it when someone just says something i've posted is shit and that's their opinion and that's the end of it.. At least explain what I do to improve it, my spelling, grammar and punctuation aren't great and I need to improve my vocabulary but i'm working on it and I always obsessively check for errors before posting anything..."
