Illustration,3dpef9,venomousmushroom,14,Sat Jul 18 04:17:51 2015 UTC,"Openly saying that you're going to underpay a professional artist is the best way to offend them and get made fun of. Sorry if that's harsh, but it's true. It takes countless hours to illustrate a book and no one wants to work on a McDonald's salary."
Illustration,3dpef9,whodidisnipe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"Not harsh, I completely understand and edited my post to clarify. I would never expect anyone to put in millions of hours illustrating for nothing."
Illustration,3dpef9,justjokingnotreally,15,Sat Jul 18 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"/u/whodidisnipe is right about underpaying. If what you have to offer is ""very, very little"" money, then I might suggest saving a bit more money to go toward the project, so you can pay a proper amount. This is your pet project and your labor of love. As fun as the project seems to you, don't expect anyone you hire to be approaching this a anything other than a rent-paying project and a labor for pay.  OP, I would suggest that, if you don't have much to pay an artist, then put the money you have for this project toward paying the artist for concept work to be used for your crowd funding pitch. And make extra sure that a good portion of that funding is earmarked to pay the artist properly.   For what it's worth, it does sound like an intriguing idea you have."
Illustration,3dpef9,dbx99,2,Sat Jul 18 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"So if you crowdfund and raise a very healthy amount of money, do you intend to allocate a tiny portion of that for the MEAT OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS ILLUSTRATING A GRAPHIC NOVEL???  oooh i'm going to go to the moon but I want to pay the engineers very little but they can put the experience down on their portfolio and get exposure...  you fucktard."
Illustration,3dpef9,Otto_Lidenbrock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:53:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe you just have no idea how to budget for an illustrator. It takes A LOT of time, or an intense amount of time when under a deadline. It's not only drawing figures, but laying out panels to convey your story where the words are absent. Literally the most important part of the book.  A typical press or producer might budget to pay an illustrator per page, a typical comic BOOK runs 22 pages - not including cover art. A graphic novel is obviously a lot more pages.   The actual amount will vary by illustrator, but for a comic BOOK PENCILLER on the mid-low range, you are looking at around $3300. This price doesn't include edits you may have. Then you'll need to pay an INKER and a COLORIST, or consider paying more to one artist who can do all three parts of the job. The cover art could vary from $250-1500, also depending on your professional illustrator, and your requested aesthetic.  I hope this helps you come up with something more specific than ""very, very, little."""
Illustration,3dpef9,justjokingnotreally,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:36 2015 UTC,That's not how DIY publishing works. This isn't Marvel.
Illustration,3dpef9,Otto_Lidenbrock,0,Sat Jul 18 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"It's just a start for the guy in terms of ""how it works."""
Illustration,3dpef9,justjokingnotreally,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:08 2015 UTC,"But not really. The operation you've lined out is a standard for Big Two-style factory publication, where heaps of content need to be shoveled out with very little turnaround time. That's why it takes half a dozen people to put out 22 pages. A DIY publishing project is a completely different animal. There is a ton less overhead, and the deadlines -- if there even are any -- are far less stringent. Most self-published affairs are one or two people, which is exactly what OP is proposing.  And the page rates you're proposing are fine for an internationally-published work-for-hire affair, but again, that's not this. This sounds like a collaboration, which means that rights to the work stay with creators (which is value added, or rather, value not taken away and replaced by higher per-page pay rates.) On a project like this, I certainly wouldn't agree to a for-hire arrangement. We would share rights as collaborators.   At any rate, what we have here is small press. A limited print run, self-distributed, and probably largely unsolicited. $150 per page is probably fair at the top end, but the artist would be doing the layouts, penciling, inking, coloring, and lettering, likely along with the design and prepress, as well. But would the project be able to support that rate? Say it's a 160 page graphic novel. That's $25,000 just going to the artist. How many small press projects have you seen on Kickstarter asking for that amount of money? In theory, it's fair. In reality, as a two-person operation with a limited run, it's untenable.   The solution to this tends to be to split it up. Try to get enough money in the operation to keep the lights on and see the project through, and then rely on sales to actually pay out. It's piecemeal, and this is why small press rarely makes it into the black. On projects like this, everyone involved is gambling. The artist OP is looking for should already know this, and is willing to bet on black."
Illustration,3dpef9,Otto_Lidenbrock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Then give him a better number to negotiate toward, this is just where we start that process."
Illustration,3dpef9,justjokingnotreally,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"Well, at this point, we're really only talking about funding a pitch. What would that take? Some character sheets, and a few polished concept illustrations to establish a flavor? Low end, what would that run?   From there, she and the artist could establish an amount that they'd be willing to ask for on Kickstarter or wherever."
Illustration,3dpef9,Otto_Lidenbrock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"In my circles, minimum $50 per character sheet (not counting edits), probably more for expression sheets, and between $50-300 for digital concept art depending on level of finish or detail requested.  Also, a lot of illustrators, myself included on this, are reticent to start a pages in a book project without the entire issue/book being written. A lot of these prospective writers looking for a partner or collaborator just can't finish the first project.  Concept art can be done whenever though, since the purpose of it is to aid the feel and development. Environmental concepts also usually stands alone quite well. Good concept art or storyboarding is always worth the time/expense IMO."
Illustration,3dpef9,justjokingnotreally,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"So, yeah, a polished pitch could be done reasonably for under four figures.    As far as finishing the project goes, I suppose a lot of that would be contingent upon getting it funded. That's the good thing about the crowdfunding model; if you can reach your goal, at least you'll be dealing more with a lump sum to dole out. That would at least mitigate the worry about whether the project might actually finish, since the artist would conceivably be paid for the effort, regardless. But I think it's a little early to be making assumptions about dedication. For all we know, the OP already has a full script at the ready."

Illustration,3cv7l1,meatwrist,3,Sat Jul 11 01:23:54 2015 UTC,Ink and brush. You can control line quality without switching back and forth between pens.
Illustration,3cv7l1,brianzor,2,Sat Jul 11 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"Does the larger scale version need to be hand-drawn? If not, then just blow the image up.  Rapidograph pens come in sizes that are much larger than 0.5mm. Koh-I-Noor makes one that's 1.2mm. Rapidographs are expensive, but they're refillable, and will last you forever, if you take care of them.   Otherwise, you could always use Sharpies. Or learn to use a script liner brush properly. Or you could go over your lines a few times to make them bigger with the tools you already have."
Illustration,3cv7l1,justjokingnotreally,4,Sat Jul 11 01:52:50 2015 UTC,Don't use a Sharpie! The ink loses its pigment quickly and goes purple/blue.
Illustration,3cv7l1,turkproof,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"I suppose if one is worried about archival preservation, then don't use a Sharpie. It's still an option, though."

I have an Intuos 4 and can never seem to get those kind of crisp natural looking ink outlines. Does the Cintiq really make that much of a difference?
Illustration,3co513,Elliott_0,2,Thu Jul 9 15:47:29 2015 UTC,"Look into Lazy Nezumi. I have only just heard about it recently, but I hear lots of praise."
Illustration,3co513,allan_ohr,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"Photoshop's brush-strokes just kinda suck (Illustrator's are even worse, somehow). I really like Manga Studio for this reason (it's great for digital ink as well as paint/airbrush, and super cheap at roughly $50). However I see a lot of Photoshop users recommending Lazy Nezumi or Kyle T Webster's brushes."
Illustration,3co513,izzie833,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:41 2015 UTC,I don't think the cintiq itself makes a lot of difference to be honest (al tough it does make it easier to work with lines)! My brush settings are a little bit customized but not that much! but most of the brushes I use are custom! However the standard brushes give me clean lines as well! I do however draw my lines pretty quick (I noticed that when drawing slowly it gets all bouncy)

I either feature my work or provide links to my store. I try to keep most of my activity regular (except twitter and my blog maybe).  And I've had people tell me I have too much going on with my blog, so I'm in the process of making one dedicated to my store.

Do you make posts about things that aren't just about the store? What do you do to reach out to new people who aren't already familiar with you and your work?"
Illustration,3cs8cp,PROUD_HUFFLEPUFF,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:06:50 2015 UTC,"I tend to mainly ""like"" or reblog other people's content. Sometimes I will write them a comment. I'm sort of struggling with interaction because it feels forced..  And I'm not sure if purely liking or commenting on other people's content is helping with my own exposure.   But yea I definitely make posts that aren't about selling my work. I've been very serious about that. Because I understand that nobody likes to be hounded about a bloggers sales stories. But I think that's also why my blog ended up getting too messy. There's stuff all over the place. Like travel stories, personal reflections or projects etc. I'm trying to balance my content without over dabbling in terms of topics.   Reaching out to new people is my weak point. Facebook has plateaud in terms of new likes. I try to focus on Instagram and blog for new followers but its been pretty slow. I use tags and things as well, and try to follow the general SEO rules about relevant content, titles etc.   I guess I can understand if its just something that takes time. I'm just worried about waiting too long and realising that I've been going about it the wrong way."

Illustration,3cgy4e,eepree,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"True. What bothers me here, though, is that given the circumstances (how they slightly modify each work, use unique photos in their products and aren't very popular outside their country) it is unlikely that those artists even know this is happening."

Illustration,3cdmpn,Skoobart,2,Tue Jul 7 02:23:53 2015 UTC,"Just a quick pointer- your eyes are not 'looking' where they should be. For instance, in the panel where they are face to face in profile view, she is looking... kind of off wall-eyed, like a halibut. The only way an eye looks 'round' is when it is pointed at us, so by having her iris be round, it looks like she's sort of looking at us, but the position is wrong for her to be looking to the side and I know that wasn't your intention. Try looking at a dog or cat's eyes in person from the side and see how the iris actually flattens into a kind of () shape, rather than a O shape; a thin line rather than a circle would service you better in the instance of profile drawing = )"
Illustration,3cdmpn,schmarvelthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"that makes a ton of sense and I've been trying to figure out what my profile views seem much more 'wonky' than they should...I think this is a giant part of it..drawing the eye more with a < shape than the front shape and then fixing the iris like you said. Thank you for that input, it makes a lot of sense!"
Illustration,3cdmpn,schmarvelthrowaway,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"A big break through I had was when someone explained that a 'profile eye' and a straightforward eye are shaped completely different. Profile eye's need to be shaped kind of like a >, where the iris is close to a line shape in the middle, and more circular the further back it goes. It's a small thing that a lot of us get a lightbulb moment for, so I'm glad I could be that person for someone else! Your line work is really good, you clearly have a lot of energy and enthusiasm that comes through in your work and that's really great, keep it up!!"
Illustration,3cdmpn,schmarvelthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"yeah for real, thanks! I want to make it big so any of those littles hacks or tips, I love hearing, anytime you got one, feel free to share it! Those things really help connect the dots to things I usually struggle with sometimes for years, especially for someone like me whose bank account means I'm gonna be self taught haha. Drapery, shading and hands are on my list to figure out next. Ooof."
Illustration,3cdmpn,6f00ff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:39:19 2015 UTC,"Well good news, drapery and hands are easy once they 'click'. I self taught a lot of things, the biggest tip I have is that if there's something on that self improvement list, just practice. I used to spend months just drawing pages and pages of drapery, and hands, and feet. Feet are still tricky to me. Also, if you have trouble with value, make sure you're paying attention to light sources, and you can start with hatching and slowly graduate to actual value. My fine arts professor would always remind us that true value is the absence of line; always double check and see if you're drawing a line or really just doing very dark shading, which will be more of a dark shape than a line. There are no lines in real life."
Illustration,3cdmpn,6f00ff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah hands are tough for me...I recently got the concept of 'pinch points' and looking at drapery as if there's a clothes pin at certain areas and that helped...the over mitt idea for hands helps too, I can just move the first finger and the pinky and it ends up still looking pretty good but I can't help but wonder if I'm cheating myself a bit from that...however when you gotta hit a deadline... also the thumb...that's my biggest pain of figuring out...and feet, I feel ya, especially on women, I seem to always give them man hands and man feet. The shading idea makes a lot of sense, I think I've heard that somewhere before, its a bit tricky learning comic shading versus say, pencil shading or smudging or whatever, all the lines can't be varying values alone, it has to come from hatching so I'm trying to figure out a good way to do that."
Illustration,3cdi94,ChoppinTheTarts,5,Tue Jul 7 01:47:07 2015 UTC,Never tell them it is her first job. Just ask a price.  Depending on which country and the value of your money I would not dare to ask under 300.  10 hours of work is usually 15 hours hours with all paper work and research. Count your unofficial hours to.
Illustration,3cdi94,TomDeVis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:20:02 2015 UTC,It is in the U.S. for a medium circulation but high end clientele. I was factoring in all hours with the 10. Although it's her first commission of this type she's quite skilled.   What would you suggest the upper limit to be? 300-?
Illustration,3cdi94,TomDeVis,5,Tue Jul 7 05:09:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean with an upper limit. If you think they'll pay 1000 then ask for 1000. Just research them and think of how much they are thinking.   Personally, I wouldn't go and ask over 400 if it is only a days work.  Also, after the job, you can ask them how much they would have paid. This might help you further on."
Illustration,3cdi94,TomDeVis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:38:23 2015 UTC,The editor made some indication of a continuing relationship. With that in mind it seems to me she wouldn't have any cause to reveal what she was actually willing to pay no?
Illustration,3cdi94,eepree,2,Tue Jul 7 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"No not really, also a bad idea to ask if you plan on ever working for that person again.   You lose a lot of confidence in their eyes when you ask things like that."
Illustration,3cdi94,6f00ff,0,Tue Jul 7 09:12:49 2015 UTC,I agree.

Illustration,3cdi94,6f00ff,2,Tue Jul 7 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"Full page color mixed medium possibly all water color. It's a full page for an article, 10 hours of work."
Illustration,3cdi94,eepree,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:26:56 2015 UTC,It is a one time commission for the time being I suspect she will submit a rough then final.
Illustration,3cdi94,dick_ey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"I think $200-300 is reasonable, at $20/30 an hour depending on the quality of her work and the company she's providing it to. I would say no less than $160, and make sure you get it in contract (one rough and then a final) or they may request unexpected changes or screw you in the end.  Edit: I say $20/30 an hour because I've heard you should shoot for 20% above your perceived value. If she thinks she could get $160 for it, why not try for $200."
Illustration,3cdi94,Ledanator,4,Tue Jul 7 03:44:59 2015 UTC,Yikes. The illustrator who does contract work for a friend's company -- business consulting -- charges $120/hr.
Illustration,3cdi94,WingBuffet,2,Tue Jul 7 04:28:16 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable if he's working a couple of hours. My advice is to everyone who creates content is to charge for the result, not by the hour. If OP's girlfriend finished the project in an hour or two, that's easily $100 an hour."
Illustration,3cdi94,WingBuffet,2,Tue Jul 7 04:41:19 2015 UTC,Well that's part of the problem this is her first commissioned work of this type and although that is an idea it would be preferable to know the standRd rate so that we are not underselling her work especially in consideration of regular work from this magazine.

Illustration,3c98xr,Asunai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:25:06 2015 UTC,I agree! Learning how to draw people figures and learning about light studies has really made me a better illustrator. Solid foundation is important.
Illustration,3c98xr,Neenabobeena,3,Mon Jul 6 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"Realistic. I grew up and went through all sorts of various education of the arts, all of which always included life drawing etc. I later became an illustrator. I think you need the foundations to be able to observes and document realism and movement because these are what help you develop a style. It's very easy to develop a style from reputation but if you understand movement then your illustrations will naturally come to life.. IMO"
Illustration,3c98xr,Pocochan,2,Mon Jul 6 10:12:37 2015 UTC,"Learning realistic fundamentals will help you a lot - you'll learn the ""rules"", before you learn how to break them via cartooning.

Why not have some fun and see what application you can find for your new skills?"
Illustration,3c98xr,eepree,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"While I do think it's very important to have an understanding of things like anatomy, you need to practice, and for that you need motivation. Maybe have different practice sessions? Have at least one session a week where you focus on learning fundamentals, and read up on it in the meantme so you keep it in mind when you're drawing what you enjoy since you need a good understanding of the underlying principles of whatever you're exaggerating. That said, you should still just scribble random stuff and just enjoy the process."

Illustration,3c1yy1,Another_Wierdo666,3,Sat Jul 4 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to be an animator, I recommend checking out Flash, Toonboom and AfterEffects for 2d animation; Maya, Blender, Nuke and others for 3d animation. Most of these are quite expensive, be aware.  If you want to make 2d illustrations and drawings, check out Krita, Manga Studio, Photoshop or something similar."
Illustration,3c1yy1,eepree,2,Sat Jul 4 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"So it really depends on what sort of animation you'd like to be doing in the future. First go online and find a copy of The Illusion of Life, this is your new bible. Read it and learn it. Make sure you nail and understand all 12 principles of animation.   The next step is figuring out what your focus is going to be. Do you want to be a 2d animator or 3d. Sure it's possible to flip back and forth but animation is an extremely competitive industry and you're going to want to be a rockstar at one discipline to get a job and can have the other as a hobby or backup.   If you choose 2d. Go practice your life drawing skills and continue to draw and sketch every day animations.   If your choose 3d head over to your computer and download Blender. Until you get a .edu email address this will be your life. There are plenty of rigs available for free to practice with. You're going to want to again animate everything. Once you get a .edu email drop blender and immediately switch to an autodesk product. 3dsMax is used more in games while Maya is used more in feature films.   Also no matter what discipline you picked head over to the 11second club. It's a monthly contest that's free to enter and open to any style of animation. They provide the voices or sound you provide the animation. It's quite fun.   Feel free to pm me with any other questions about it. Like are you sure you want to be an animator and not a modeler or lighter? There's a lot of aspects that people forget exist! Good luck!"

When you have a part of the story that you want to fit into several pages, it's good to start with the layout of the panels. Try to make the text work together with very rough scribbles of what's going on. Don't get too caught up in details and stay flexible to change the order and size if needed. Once you're happy with how the story flows, you can go in and refine the drawings. This could be useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0BrCv2Kz2Q"

Illustration,3bnhaw,Opouly,2,Tue Jun 30 21:03:30 2015 UTC,This is an awesome idea and really well don't. Just a  thing that I noticed (I'm not an illustrator so I can't offer real critique) is that the block with the ballet dancer seems a little wide. It kinda seems like she's taking up two blocks.
Illustration,3bnhaw,Opouly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"No i'd say that's valid.  I'm pretty confident that the frame is accurate with perspective factored in. If you think about it, on a rubiks cube the inner side of that wouldn't be stickered so it might appear wider.  I think more likely the gripe you have is because I took a lot of liberties on the dimensions of the inner compartments in the interest of play and drawing in God mode. The different perspectives were drawn with the intent to be a little jarring and contrasting in the piece to fit with the ideas/concept I had when I started, and it translates better in some than others. So the 'ballet' segment I tried to stretch it further than strictly possible to make it more dance studio-esque.  A really long-winded way of saying you're right."
Illustration,3bnhaw,robo-lobo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:28:10 2015 UTC,Haha a long winded and well thought out reply saying we're both right. I like your explanation and I think if works as it is. Good job man!
Illustration,3bnhaw,robo-lobo,2,Wed Jul 1 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah I can understand the difficulty of sharing, its very worrisome. You're work is great though, especially the potter's cube and that's not just because I am a potterokay maybe it is"
Illustration,3bnhaw,Omegamegaloman,2,Wed Jul 1 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"Are you really?  I like that room too. I only know one potter so based it on her a little. I drew the piece because I was reading some of Rubik and his architecture, a quote sparked it off but besides that I get really frustrated with how inward looking and fragmented all these creative factions are.   I've moved from the Midlands (UK) to London this month and I think it's just feeling lonely and wishing there was just some community I can have that doesn't have those rigid boundaries.  Being too scared to share is awful, because I love seeing other peoples work and I think they are incredibly brave, but the worry isn't so much about criticism or hurt feelings as such; more that horrible possibility of being told you don't fit in and you don't really belong with other illustrators. It's unreasonably fragile and selfish of me but it still gives me panic attacks.  *edit: Formatting"
Illustration,3bnhaw,designtraveler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I've been throwing (doing pottery) for like 3 years intensely and 5 years overall. I've lost access to a wheel and kiln so I don't throw anymore, more focused on drawing and so on.   I agree with what you're saying about the fragmentation of the arts. I became great friends with a music producer (something I had never done) and even though we were doing different mediums, we were still doing art and learnt so much from one another! Crucial parts of my illustration style were inspired or derived from hip-hop and music production, haha.   All arts flow into one another and you can learn from others when you put categories aside.   Yeah, I get worried about being excluded or dismissed as well, and a lot of my submissions kept dropping to 0. But it meant that people were seeing it and it got to them enough to respond.   Some people will exclude, but at the very least, we can accept others and spread that positivity around :)"

Illustration,3bbt84,imward,6,Sat Jun 27 19:10:49 2015 UTC,It's etching and I would recommend looking into Albrect D√ºrer (1471 ‚Äì1528) who was an absolute master and an important artist in that he was one of the first to develop and promote his brand and the importance of prints.   His Saint Jerome in His Study always blows me away. Make sure to check out  the high resolution image and keep in mind that this would have to had been done in day light or candle light. Amazing.
Illustration,3bbt84,onlineFace,2,Sat Jun 27 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not too well-informed on this technique or its place in history, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong or add a comment, but the style you might me looking for is cross-hatching. The reason it has connotations with older imagery is probably because cross-hatching was a very popular technique with wood cuts and engraving, amongst other printmaking styles (and pen/ink drawing plus others), which allowed artists to mass-produce images since the 1400s. Now this is more of an educated guess, but I'd have to say that starting at the 20th century where art takes on many new changes, we see tons of other styles of printmaking emerge and become popular, making cross-hatching more of a style of the past.   Here's a link with some examples of the style you might be looking for! Hope my rambling helped.   http://collation.folger.edu/2012/02/woodcut-engraving-or-what/"

Illustration,3b73w8,phonenstro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:49:15 2015 UTC,It's a reality competition show on SyFy called Face-Off for movie makeup artists.  I usually can't stand shows like that but I'm artistically inclined and there is some seriously good work done on the show.  They usually air 2 seasons a year.

I can't wait to show him this."

I'm gonna have to get one of those rat shirts. I like the idea of making rats the unofficial mascot of a place, The zine is all the imaginary Rats that hang out in Roath, Cardiff.

Illustration,3am3x5,RetroPK,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:04:16 2015 UTC,It looks pretty good and drawn well. My only gripe is that it doesn't have any noticeable. Like nothing that gets my attention first. I might just be a little picky. Actually thinking about it now as a book cover it's better to slightly have the images blend together like this. That aside if you decide to color this I think it would look good with pale creamy colors for the dream.

Illustration,3aj9nb,sam_and_that,9,Sat Jun 20 19:04:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert with gouache, but you could try laying down a transparent layer first to get the shapes right, and then slowly build up your values with thicker and thicker paint.   A lot of the old Disney artists were amazing with gouache, like Mary Blair. Studying their work can help a lot."
Illustration,3aj9nb,Ledanator,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:17:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah the reason I've been so interested in trying gouache is because I've seen so many beautiful illustrations that use it! I'll look up more of Mary's work as well! Thank you :)
Illustration,3aj9nb,El_7,6,Sun Jun 21 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Very nice first go. When it comes to Gouache just remember start dark to light, thin washes before thick paint, and always give it some time (like 30 min) to dry before adding layers. Also for color sake it helps to either start warm and work your way to cool or cool and work to warm. It keeps the colors cleaner then if you are constantly going back and forth between temperature. For getting really opaque highlights I found it better to just use acrylic at the final stage because it doesn't soak up the layer of color underneath it. Adding watercolors and acrylic layers into Gouache paintings can ad lots of depth and fun texture techniques (a really fun texture occurs when you put salt into a still wet water color wash), and compensate for the fact that Gouache colors can end up looking very chalky when they dry. Also hatching, stippling, and line variation are all your best friends for rendering form, trying to get smooth blends like watercolors is much harder in Gouache."
Illustration,3aj9nb,Turtlejone5,2,Sat Jun 20 22:25:19 2015 UTC,Ooooh I'll have to try that salt think! I love textures
Illustration,3aj9nb,SnazzyMax,3,Sun Jun 21 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/El_7 said, fixative (and or hairspray if you're on a budget) and a hair dryer can make those layers even crisper, also dry faster!   The best tip though: just keep painting! Nice job."
Illustration,3aj9nb,barkerart,2,Sun Jun 21 00:26:16 2015 UTC,wow lovely colours. dont know much about gouache but looks like a great first attempt to me.
Illustration,3aj9nb,Sup3rPant5,2,Sat Jun 20 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"Nice work! I was taught gouache the old fashioned illustrator way, and the workflow is basically:   Initial light pencil drawing Wet the paper. Stain in with broad color notes. Let it dry a bit. Start putting colors down in opaque ""tiles"". Keep going until you are nearly insane. Once it's dry, take a clean brush that's damp, and blend edges where you want.   It takes a lot of patience because it's very methodical, but the results can be amazing. And it teaches you to see and mix color accurately like nothing else.  The biggest ""gotcha"" is that when you are initially putting down your colors you can't cover up a dark with a light, or vice versa. If you make a mistake you have to actually wet it and blot it back up. Otherwise the colors will pollute each other when you blend.  I found gouache very frustrating at first, but once I got the hang of it I started loving it. It's very flexible and fast, you can work small, and it photographs really well."

Illustration,3ah885,OfCourseLuke,2,Sat Jun 20 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"It also took me a while to grasp that ""cuts"" is a verb ;) That ambiguity, plus the ambiguity of where to start reading the sentence leads to some interesting readings of the text:  ""Swords fear cuts deeper than...""  Deeper than what?! Why would a sword fear a cut anyway?!  ""Deeper than swords, fear cuts""  That's pretty deep; I should fear cuts deeply. But what about paper cuts..?

Illustration,3a7vya,agentquestions,2,Wed Jun 17 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"I've had pretty good luck through mine.  Granted, the first year I signed on, my agent didn't get me ANY work, and didn't even promote me on the site, which definitely set off radars!  However, she was very highly recommended, had a decent excuse for the website thing, and had an assembly of artists that I looked up to.  After the first year, work started trickling in, and it was definitely a punch above the clientele I'd gotten from working independently!   Through the higher profile work she's gotten me, I've felt comfortable raising my own prices MUCH higher than I would have without representation.  She hasn't been able to get me full-time work through her exclusively, but between the big jobs I get through her, and my own stuff, she's definitely getting me enough work to comfortably turn down gigs that I'm not interested in.  If I were you, I would contact other artists that your agent represents, and see what they think.  If they all have similar feelings to you, that's a good sign you should leave.  (I did that 8 months in, and a conversation with a couple of the other artists convinced me to stick with my agent)  In addition, ask your agent if there's anything you can do to help promote yourself through them.  If your agent is just using you as a ""menu item"" to have a particular style at the ready at the off chance that a client asks, you're not in a great place.  If your agent doesn't have any plans to use you for promotionals, e-mails, or even on your website, that's also a big sign you should leave.  Feel free to send me a PM!"
Illustration,3a7vya,RoyElliot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"I've signed on with agencies and staffing services in the past, with similar results I'm sad to say :/  My 2pence: Ignore your exclusivity clause and contract your own work when you source it yourself. They haven't helped you, why should you feel beholden to them?"
Illustration,3a7vya,eepree,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"Damn. That sucks to hear.  I appreciate the advice. As much as I love the idea of pursuing the work that I found myself (or work that found me) and ignoring the exclusivity clause, I'm nervous about what sort of legal action the agency might take against me if they found out. I wouldn't want to mess things up before I even had a chance to get started."
Illustration,3a7vya,eepree,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience, those clauses are difficult to enforce. But I understand wanting to preserve the relationship for as long as you can. I guess the question is: how long do you go without work from them (and possibly pass up opportunities), before you consider your relationship defunct? When does the exclusivity clause expire? And really - do you think the agency would even know you've contracted privately?"
Illustration,3a7vya,eepree,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. I've been tired of the lack of work from them for some time. Granted, I haven't been with them for that long and I'm normally a very patient person, but this is my livelihood after all. I just wasn't expecting this radio silence.  Additionally, it would seem that I've already passed up some opportunities by making people take that extra step in contacting my agency. I don't know if they just don't feel like it or what.  The exclusivity clause lasts for a really long time unless I terminate my contract. I guess I'm still hoping that things will pick up eventually. Hopefully sooner rather than later."
Illustration,3a7vya,eepree,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:38:24 2015 UTC,"I ran into the same radio silence, both times. Did they milk you for professional contacts? People you've worked with/for in the past? Agencies are notorious for this."
Illustration,3a7vya,eepree,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"They did ask for some names, but I don't think their intentions were bad with that. It didn't seem like they wanted to use them for their own gain. I don't know how or why they would anyway, since they already have the biggest names in the business under their belt. What were your experiences with this?  And when you encountered the silence twice, how long did you wait each time? Thanks for your replies."
Illustration,3a7vya,WithLinesOfInk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:28:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to say so, since it sounds discouraging (and my experiences are not everyone's), but I never heard back. The most recent instance was a year+ ago. Still no bites, no jobs. Needless to say, I had to take matters into my own hands and take on my own contracts.   The group I last signed on with is notorious for gathering lots of associated contact info from you, before they'll even put you into their database. In my case, they wanted names of producers who I'd worked for in the past. These higher-level contacts are valuable to them, as producers are always in need of creative labor - and the agency would love to be the one to source talent for them.  Again, I sincerely hope your experiences with agencies will not mirror my own. Can I ask what type of illustration work you're seeking?"

Illustration,3a5axk,OhmTheJellyBean,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:55:25 2015 UTC,I don't knw i just do them! I make circle and separate it to 4 or 8 pieces and draw circles with compass and then just do it! And one mandala takes me hour-10 hours including ''thinking time'' And if you loose patience don't draw! I draw only when I want to so some of my works may never be finished but I keep my motivation on them.

I dont know, its always a piss take when you have great work and they cant take you on for things that have nothing to do with what you would do on the course. Maybe go into free lance dude, if you self trained at maybe short courses you could have a promising future ahead. Peace"
Illustration,3a63mz,coloneljelly,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"In line with Ohdeasu's suggestion, I'd recommend taking a few community college art courses - both art and general studies. That way you can sharpen your art skills AND maybe bring your grades up."
Illustration,3a63mz,artworkbysteen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"tbh, images 9-13 are probably the only ones id consider having on my portfolio. You need more studies of rendering light and shadow as well as some semblance of being able to capture what you see well (aka still lifes and portraiture maybe. even if you don't enjoy these, at least do it for getting accepted). But if like you said, it's bc of grades, well then, i would've asked what steps you should take to eventually get into the program at one of those places. maybe you can apply to a lesser school and transfer over. ask and see if that's an option"

As far as process goes i've actually been using myself as a model for the base work of most of these (I am the most willing and accessible person I know, after all). Then I'll usually work into the shading with markers and fine pens, but the colours and how I go about the line work is pretty much mostly from imagination. Once I'm happy with how it looks i'll scan and then bring it into photoshop and tweak it with saturation and filters and whatnot to breath some new life into it (I always find scanning kind of sucks a bit of energy out of the piece). If your really interested I'd be happy to post a step by step visual of my process on [my blog](strongholdmuzinaki.blogspot.ca)"

Illustration,39fbhn,Kagrs,3,Thu Jun 11 12:47:39 2015 UTC,Will do! I completely agree
Illustration,39fbhn,angryblue,9,Thu Jun 11 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"I think she can pull it off if she works hard, makes connections and allows the opportunity to do as much freelance as possible. I could see this working well for art prints as well as editorial illustrations and of course children's books if she knows any writers or publication houses.   These are great promotional shots, by the way.  The hustle is the even harder part of working for yourself as an illustrator. About 50% of my income is from freelance design work while the remaining is from creating my own products based off of art that I've made like screenprints, books, shirts and misc other work. Some of that requires setting up at music festivals, comiccons and making whatever other opportunities happen that I can."
Illustration,39fbhn,angryblue,2,Thu Jun 11 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! Yeah, I think she can pull it off too. Most of her recent commissions are children related, like posters and prints. Making connections is definitely needed. It's hard to start I guess, and you have to be constant even when the results aren't always the same."
Illustration,39fbhn,lunarjellies,3,Thu Jun 11 12:52:02 2015 UTC,"there's a constant ebb and flow. Most of the time - completely happenstance and unrelated to the work. Be prepared for that and don't be afraid to wildly experiment and diversify.   I've been able to trick the world into letting me do this without any other job for about ten years so far.  Printmaking is worth getting into. You can only sell an original one time. If over time, you can sell a popular image 10,000 times ...  Selling herself and her unique voice and personal interests as part of the product/brand is really important too. People partially buying her as ""I saw this rad artist  on instagram the other day and she makes all of this different cute stuff... check her out"" is a really important piece of the puzzle."
Illustration,39fbhn,PencilSkirt17,3,Thu Jun 11 13:02:02 2015 UTC,"I feel that making a living off of your art is less about the style of art being created and more about treating it like a business. Keep your pen supple, practice practice practice (whatever your fav medium and subject matter is). Don't be afraid to try new things. Be selective about what is shown on websites, to the public, etc. I love this book, ""Taking the Leap"" by Cay Lang. She has some good advice in there... but of course, it always starts with the work/inventory. Make the work first, then proceed to find the market. Good luck!"
Illustration,39fbhn,WithLinesOfInk,2,Thu Jun 11 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Btw, this is her Facebook page if you want to show her some love :)  https://www.facebook.com/loredanaillustration"
Illustration,39fbhn,allan_ohr,3,Thu Jun 11 12:49:47 2015 UTC,"She should start an instagram account also. Due to the visual nature of it, it seems to attract a lot of artists and art lovers. She should use hash tags like, #watercolor #illustration, #freelance and #smallbiz.  Also,  I think her work could do really well on Etsy! Especially the nature-y ones!"
Illustration,39fbhn,brayney12,2,Thu Jun 11 13:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she has both already. Here are the links:  https://instagram.com/loreillustration/  https://www.etsy.com/shop/Loreillustration  Although we find Etsy being the most difficult one, it's hard to get any visibility or sales"
Illustration,39fbhn,white_kitty,2,Thu Jun 11 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"Visibility comes from Instagram and Tumblr. Make sure a link to her facebook and etsy account are openly visible on everything the posts. I agree that her plant-based work is quite charming, and people love plant watercolors. The children aren't bad, but they have a sort of uncanny feel to them I think because they're halfway between realism and stylized.  I love the cactus."
Illustration,39fbhn,batsofburden,2,Thu Jun 11 14:26:38 2015 UTC,"She seems really good. Tell her to consider uploading a couple of designs to web stores like redbubble. I constantly see things in her kind of style on the promoted page there. Once you've set it up, it'll just run by itself, and net you a small passive revenue stream without you having to do much at all. Worth a look."

Illustration,39f7dp,GabrielLeDu,2,Thu Jun 11 09:04:57 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on you and the work you produce. I have friends who really get the most attention through Facebook or tumblr for example, while isntagram / behance has always given me the most engagement. Just try out whatever sounds right for you. The more the better, as long as you feel you can keep the activity on your accounts constant. Might also be an idea to vary what you post on different sites, to give people incentive to follow you on multiple sites."
Illustration,39f7dp,allan_ohr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your insight. The thing is I don't want to be on too many channels since I know I won't have the time to maintain them all. I am going to get a website for sure, as for the rest I don't really know, I guess I should learn to know my target. I want to illustrate children's books; I don't know what social media would be the best for that kid of activity, in addition to a website."
Illustration,39f7dp,allan_ohr,3,Thu Jun 11 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"Instagram is wonderful for uploading progress pics and just throwing out some sketches and concepts, and if you actually use relevant tags for your stuff, you'll find you get a lot of followers eventually, even though there are a couple of bots in the mix.  Facebook might be good as well, but I'd suggest you let your page grow naturally instead of sharing it all over the place. You should also read up on how facebook reach works. If you're really good at engaging your followers, with maybe discussion topics or something or other when you post, you'll find you get a lot of reach. You need followers who actually engage with your page. It can be more of a hassle than it's worth though.  Behance is really great for connecting with other professionals, and for showcasing entire projects. I'm not too familiar with tumblr. Never seemed right for me, but I know a lot of people get great exposure through it.  I'd suggest you try instagram and bechance, and take it from there."

Illustration,39c7lu,MaximalGFX,2,Wed Jun 10 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"You could definitely make a brush that mimics the texture you want, but I think there is an easier solution. Have your grunge texture in a layer above your image, fiddle with the layer style and opacity until it looks how you want it. If you can't find a decent paper texture and want a more consistent grain, you can also experiment with the noise filter on a white layer.   So now that you've got the texture covering the whole image, add a layer mask to the texture layer. Select the layer mask, then invert it. (CTRL/CMD + I) Grab a soft brush, marquee, or whatever have you and start erasing that layer mask. Using a layer mask will preserve the texture in case you make a mistake, and it also gives you the opportunity to apply the texture with whatever brush,  marquee shape, or gradient you think will achieve your desired results."
Illustration,39c7lu,carlypanda,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"My best guess is to use a gritty texture overlay set to multiply or one of those adjustment layers and gently erased with a soft, low-opacity brushes where it ""blends"" off."

Illustration,38zux7,professor_doom,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:00:09 2015 UTC,"Painted ladies:       ""Painted ladies"" is a term in American architecture used for Victorian and Edwardian houses and buildings painted in three or more colors that embellish or enhance their architectural details. The term was first used for San Francisco Victorian houses by writers Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in their 1978 book Painted Ladies - San Francisco's Resplendent Victorians.   Since then the term has also been used to describe groups of colorful Victorian houses in other American cities, such as the Charles Village neighborhood in Baltimore, Lafayette Square in St. Louis, the greater San Francisco and New Orleans areas, Columbia-Tusculum in Cincinnati, the Old West End in Toledo, Ohio, and the city of Cape May, New Jersey.
