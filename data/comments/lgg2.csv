But the tool that it uses is broken. Some people say they have a fixed version but it's private. It's really just they 'claim' to connect to LG's servers to use the tool (an error shows up without it being connected) and pay you a fine for someone to use TeamViewer to try to fix it.

Also I just bootlooped my launch 32 gig D801 irreparably, and needed a new phone quick. I basically looked at all the late 2014 phones and landed on the G2 again. best bang for your buck at this point IMO. I had been using an Xperia Z3 as my daily and had to switch back to my G2 temporarily and i actually kinda prefer the G2 aside from the Z3's slimness and light weight."

lgg2,3dxre7,Blackspade50,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:40 2015 UTC,Ebay is pretty good - just don't buy any from low point sellers and from China and Hong Kong. Also check their reviews. That's the standard for pretty much all of ebay.  bidallies and qualitycellz are pretty good sellers. I got mines from bidallies when they where selling the D800 for $129.99 Refurb and I got it almost brand new. No scams or whatever. Even came in the OEM Box.

The sellers name is quality cellz. You will see the seller drop prices once in 2 weeks for 2-3 days. That is the cycle that I have observed.   If you are buying cheap accessories from ebay, you'll get what you pay for (Cables, phone cases, chargers). Branded electronics are different. You need to know what you are buying. I bought a couple of laptops in the past and all have been perfect. If it is new, it should be fine. Avoid ebay used/refurb stuff."

lgg2,3dx7bb,temporary_login,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:58 2015 UTC,"i had the same issue on my d801 mate, it is very easy to fix, when you plug your device into download mode to your pc, windows told you that you need to format the disk and appear a lot of partitions? if so, you need to download the SRK Tool found here http://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g2/development/tools-srk-tool-useful-toos-lg-root-twrp-t3079076 i'm not sure but i think that before you used it you need to have lg drivers installed, once you extracted the srk tool zip, open the srktool.exe and select 4.- fixed utility and then select 5.- unbrick qhshbulk, it's pretty easy to go through the process, only thing that you need to be sure that you select your model, and selecting the right disk see the video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERZvlJIC9dE so when you're done doing that you will need to go back to stock, i'm pretty sure that kdz method won't work, i was on the same situation, after i unbricked my d801 with this tool i was getting an error on flashtools stucked at 2%, so you will need to use the TOT method found here http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2432476 scroll down until you see the TOT method, if the download for the 2gb file and the dll is too slow you can find them here http://downloads.codefi.re/autoprime/LG/LG_G2/D801BK/Stock_Firmware using the TOT method you will go back to JellyBean but is the only way to bring your device back from the dead, once you done with the TOT method the phone should boot normally and then you will be able to flash any kdz again using flash tools, if you have more questions PM me on xda by the name ""thedoctor13th"" sorry for my bad english and regards! hope you can bring back your g2 :)"

lgg2,3dl7mp,turzaa,3,Fri Jul 17 04:16:42 2015 UTC,"To get V4A to work you do have to set SELinux Mode to permissive and you also have to delete a few lines in the audio_policy.conf file but first it seems you can't install the right driver. Try uninstalling again and try to install the High Quality Driver not the Super.  Once you have the High Quality Driver installed, V4A will still not process audio so you have to navigate to /system/etc/audio_policy.conf Open it and find   deep_buffer {  sampling_rates 44100|48000  ...  ...  ...  flags AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_DEEP_BUFFER  }   Delete the deep_buffer and all the code inside the brackets.

lgg2,3dkx4p,lazykryptonian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:34:29 2015 UTC,You'll need to wipe and flash your ROM fresh to fix it. G2 Xposed swaps the recents key with a menu key the instant you go into the navbar section. It can't be undone other than to fresh flash. Dirty flashing will not fix it. Don't use G2 Xposed for anything.

Also unfortunately even with my 2A charger hooked up to my slimport connector the phone still had a net drain on the battery giving me about 4hrs of watching.  A bluetooth mouse and keyboard will connect and allow pretty much full integration into android for navigating,  you'll want an app that locks the phone in landscape mode as well since when the phone is in portrait it doesn't use the entire TV screen. For this reason also make sure you enable landscape home screen on your launcher. I used the GEL launcher with xposed for my purposes"

Presuming you haven't taken the latest OTA update, you can still root ZVE with ""stump root"" an APK you can find and download with phone browser. Then next install ""SuperSU"" from APK from download with phone browser. After SuperSU you can use ""AutoREC"" to install recovery. Another APK that can be located from the phone browser. Finally you can enter recovery and install the correct latest TWRP from .zip from phone browser download too.    I didn't include any links, but these should be your searches to help you on your way. Although if you mess up and get a soft brick, you'll need a computer to .TOT reset. Good luck."

lgg2,3d8u65,Zork91,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"No it won't do anything to your ROM or your recovery or something else.  You exactly flash it once you have the rom installed, Dorimanx kernel will install 3 apps after you flash it through TWRP.  Display color panel (you can set up saturation and other things there), the kernel control panel itself where you control CPU/GPU clockspeeds, tweaks and etc and an info app to see and at what mhz, temperatures things are running.  If a recovery with thermals, rom with thermals and kernal with thermals won't solve phone running hot or battery drainage then it's faulty battery. Unless it gets hot where the  CPU is (near camera) and not where the battery is. Do you still have your warranty? If not you can buy a new battery and change it yourself, it's not that hard, there are tutorials on youtube.  And if you still have warranty, google ""LG flash tool"" and flash complete stock rom, kernel and recovery with a stock .kdz file. It's very easy and automated. Your phone will be like new and people who will be repairing your phone won't even know that you had a custom rom or root on your phone (which breaks your warranty)."

lgg2,3cz49o,bikemandan,2,Sun Jul 12 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"That's a bug with CAF ROM's. Any one that uses the LG Devs bootstack - you can't access recovery via keys and Download Mode is broken. If you hard bricked the only way is via Download mode since it sends you to QHUSB_BULK mode.  Autorec for Lollipop is useless for this instance. It's only for stock. Either it'll break your LCD (happens alot with people using AutoRec stupidly, like this reason). Do nothing, or brick your device.  Since you broke recovery you pretty much lost your safe haven if you want to flash a new ROM. If you brick it you can only reboot into broken Download Mode redirecting to QHUSB_BULK mode.  I think flashing Blastagator's BUMP!'ed TWRP from here, http://blastagator.ddns.net under 'TWRP with Thermal Control' and flashing it with Flashify will fix it. But don't quote me on it.

It had something to do with the placement of the white antenna cable.  Moving it around in a slightly different position did it I think.  I really can't remember exactly what I did, but it might had something to do with one those little antenna cable hooks (where you're supposed place the cable) pinching the cable too much.  Try turning it on with an open back with the antenna cables completely loose (but still connected), and see if the lines are gone.  Also, may or not be related to the charging, but I had a second problem where the phone would turn off after putting on the back cover.  When I originally took it apart, I removed some of the random tapes that I believe were on the battery/battery connectors.  Putting them back exactly where they originally were fixed it.

Im not sure about the international Exynos based model but I wouldnt buy that one anyways, no 4g in the usa and a few other things that made it kinda undesirable.  For what its worth the TMobile version seems to be the best bet as  the bootloader is unlocked and ive read that installing custom ROMs on their note solves the issue."

I have the commuter series which is significantly less bulky than their hardest ones and I have had nothing but a great experience with it. it doesn't cover the screen but it leaves plenty of room to put a protector on. At $33 its not so bad.  If you really don't want to go for an otterbox look into case mate, they are another case company that i used and their cases work great as well, for lower the price. However i think they only make back to the g3 now... Those are the two cases ive used and they work very well.

Sure there are better phones out there, but for the price (I got mine a while ago for $200) there are no competitors, believe me, I did the research before I decided. The second thing is the sizes of new phones are crazy. Just like your girlfriend, this screen size is the biggest I'll ever be okay with. Keep in mind that the screen takes up most of the front of this phone, which means that the size of the phone as a whole is smaller than other phones with similar, or even smaller screens.   Unless your girlfriend is going to need top specs, this phone is perfect and any average user will find it so."

And another small question concerning backups with TWRP, they only backup the operating system and not the apps and everything else? Because If I remember correctly Clockwork recovery on my good ol' ZTE blade also recovered installed apps.  And as far as bootloaders go, let's say Cloudy 3.3, it requires Kitkat bootloader. So if I'd be on Lolipop I'd have to flash Kitkat .kdz and then root again, install recovery again and then install that ROM?"
lgg2,3cj8pj,damnation333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:26:33 2015 UTC,"yeah. 2.2 already includes the drivers. just need to install the .apk :)    Backup in twrp or CWM is called nandroid backup. It includes literally everything, system (rom), data (apps with all the settings and rom settings), modem etc. Time to get rooted (one-click root) and use autorec v1 to get recovery with JB bootloader and flash cloudy. easy.    if you were on lollipop you would use autorec v2 which installs a kitkat bootloader and then flash cloudyg2 3.x  I am on cloudyG2 3.3 like many others on the D802, it works flawless. I haven't noticed any bug really. But do go for 2.2 (kitkat) and see how you like it :)"
lgg2,3cj8pj,damnation333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:36:04 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for the info.  Will try this out today, If I run in to something I'll ask some questions if that's fine by you.  And the question about ROM backups in TWRP, they don't backup your apps?"
lgg2,3cj8pj,damnation333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:41:23 2015 UTC,"yeah, I edited my post regarding TWRP backups. all apps are included. I do recommend to you though to use something like titanium backup, so setup in cloudy is easier. Don't restore everything, but the few apps you like to set-up again without much hassle (say email app, games where you don't want to start from the beginning for example). Just ask if you run into trouble. I will check back."
lgg2,3cj8pj,damnation333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, installed recovery, updated it from blastigator's website, newest 2.8.7.1 for D802.  Currently making a full backup of everything, temperatures stay at 60-70, sometimes spike to 74. Is that alright?  I'm trying to be as careful as possible, don't wanna burn the screen.

It just means that those problems don't exist for all users.  Edit: Answers to your questions.   Yes you can use Xposed and get G3 Tweaksbox. Make sure to use the G3 version since Cloudy 2.2 is a G3 port. Stay away from the G2 Xposed app in the Play Store. It's made of evil and will screw up your phone."

lgg2,3cai53,GloopTown,2,Mon Jul 6 11:29:09 2015 UTC,"I think you need to clarify a bit. When you say there's a black line taking up half the screen, do you mean you can't see what's on screen? Because you say the screen is mint condition but it sounds like it is not.   I'm no expert but this is how I understand it: there's an lcd on the bottom (this shows images) then a digitizer on top (this registers touches) then a layer of glass on top (protective only). So the three layers can break or be fine independently.   My lg g2 dropped and the glass and digitizer broke (bottom half only) but lcd was just fine. Another phone I dropped had lcd issues in about a third of the image, but digitizer and glass were fine.   I fixed my lg g2 by buying a full frame assembly with lcd, digitizer and glass already installed for 50. Relatively easy to swap out the parts and it works wonders. This way I also got a scratch free game and did not have to worry about separating glass layers in the fix process."
lgg2,3cai53,llamadramas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks alot, sorry about the lack of detail in the paragraph. Okay, I mean't the actual screen as in the physical layer of glass has no scratches.   And the 'black line' is not a line, basically half the screen is black and I can't see anything on half the screen, it's funny that it's actually exactly taking half the screen. Touch screen works tho.   Okay, touch works perfectly as far as I know. So the problem must be coming solely from the LCD.   Do you have the link for the replacement by any chance? Was it OEM?  Thanks alot for the help, I tried to make this question to help anyone with a problem relating to the screen. I know understand some of the terms I got mixed up with :) Good day!

I just enabled aeroplane mode, turned off background stuff, greenified lots of stuff and barely touched the phone.  Typically however I get about 4 hours. Try using GSAM battery monitor. Just install it, set it up and then forget about it. After a week or longer it'll give you good insight into what is typically eating your battery life away.  Typically the screen is the largest user. Try auto brightness.  If you're not rooted, do so and try tools like greenify. There's no reason Amazon, Airdroid, BBC News, MX Player should run except when I tell them to. So they're frozen."
lgg2,3ca61e,Roph,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:04:37 2015 UTC,"Great response. Another factor to consider is that not all SOT is equal. Playing Asphalt 8 at 90% brightness will drain battery fast and see about 2 - 3 hours max of SOT. Whereas using a Reddit reader in night-mode (black background) with 0% brightness will give a much much longer SOT.  I tend to get 3 hours without trying, even hitting Asphalt 8 for a couple hours. Sometimes 4 hours if I am conservative or in certain usage scenarios, but rarely get 5 hours and never any longer if memory serves. I imagine you'd have to really nurse your battery to see those sorts of times."

Temporarily activated a shitty old Verizon phone, and started Motorola's repair process. Paid $175 plus like $20 UPS shipping to send it from PA to El Paso, TX, and they said I would hear back within a week to 10 days. Never heard, called them after like 2 weeks and they seemed oblivious. They said they would contact their repair team but that it would take 48 hours to get an answer. I hung up and called back the next day, and I flipped shit. They said they didn't but I'm pretty sure they lost my phone in Mexico, and they would just send me a brand new phone for free because they wipe your stuff anyway (which they hadn't told me to that point).

Probably based on what they do, lolipop might be somewhere better at saving battery and worse at something else.  And also some minor bugs. I'm still sitting on stock KK, thinking of flashing Cloudy's G2 but I don't want to risk damaging my phone. Basic TWRP does not have thermal control (KitkatRec by cloudy as an example) so it pretty much burns your screen when you're flashing something. Then you end up with a line or lines of dead pixels on your screen, and I don't want to risk it."

I don't hold too high hopes for the drivers though, I already feel like the current stock L camera isn't as good as on KK.

The difference it really made was in the wakelocks. if I dont touch my phone at all Im sure it could last 5 days but who does that?

So far as to set up many tasker profiles to change brightness with autolux. I disabled anything besides the bare essentials.   Long story short, I finally achieved a strong (and I mean, 6 hour SoT strong) battery life, but my phone wasn't fun anymore.   I looked through some of this, and I'm curious.. How is your phones functionality after all of this? Do you use google now? Or any location services?"

I don't play games other than super hexagon or other little arcade games so I don't know if my performance suffered. I'm using greenify with xposed so I still get all my notifications and stuff. Power nap just makes sure my phone doesn't use a lot of battery while asleep. And amplify (with default settings) disables or schedules  wake locks.

They weren't rooted and they didn't have a custom recovery or ROM. However, we didn't have a Thai carrier mainly because our phones weren't unlocked until we got back.   I'm wondering if you ever connected to another wifi service provider and if you still had the same problem? Anyways, the internet service we were using was called True Internet and there weren't any problems with it. We connected to it with a password and it worked just like how it would in the US. I would try taking out the SIM card if you have one, factory restoring it, then connect to wifi with data off, edit: since maybe unlocking it caused it?

The G2 is supposed to have a sapphire lens cover, yet 2 of my returns had a junk plastic lens cover. A Sprint tech changed one out for me immediately upon me showing him. The other one came to my house from Sprint and I swapped the part into it that the tech had put in.   It's complete nonsense for a refurbished device to have cheap 3rd party components."

A recovery is software stored on another partition of your phone's memory that allows you to restore your phone. Most phones, including the G2 come with a recovery, created by the OEM (in our case, LG). This will allow us to restore our phone to factory settings.  Some people, if they wish to install custom ROMs, will install a custom recovery, which will allow many more actions than just restoring, such as backup and ""flashing"".  The most common recoveries are TWRP and ClockworkMod. Personally, on the G2 I recommend TWRP, but you may find that ClockworkMod works for you.  How to install:  The easiest way to install a recovery, once you have rooted your device, is to use AutoRec, assuming you are on Android 4.4 ""KitKat"".  If AutoRec doesn't support your device yet or you are not on Android 4.4, you can try using FreeGee.  A manual way of installing TWRP can be found on this tutorial.  step 2, installed  http://lgvinh.blogspot.com/2015/06/guide-install-cloudyg2-31-for-lg-g2.html   Install CloudyG2 3.1 for LG G2 LS980 LG G2 LS980 no Lollipop, therefore need more flash rom patch.

lgg2,3bjqez,epsys,2,Mon Jun 29 22:57:03 2015 UTC,Anecdotal data is just that.  I've had my phone since October 2013 and I've done factory tests with each major update.  My battery is a shadow of its former self; your assertion is simply not true for everyone.  I run stock with no root.

lgg2,3bjqez,epsys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:32:00 2015 UTC,Idk.  I had to do a full factory reset about 2 weeks after I upgraded to Lollipop because my phone was getting extremely hot (almost 50C) and my battery was lasting maybe an hour.

There is still many developers working to bring all the latest versions of Android to it. Plus it's a big upgrade to the Motorola G, trust me I own both!  I'd love to trade my G2 for the G4, which is in my opinion the best phone out right now, but the price is holding me back. For that price I would buy the G2, you will likely love it.

I had to connect the phone to my laptop and run commands through cmd to wipe everything, download some files that setup the partitions, and configure everything from scratch on the phone from within the fastboot screen. Then I was able to install the stock lg rom and root my phone the correct way (which is what I was trying to do and ended up bricking it). I'm not able to search for all that stuff at the moment, but you should be able to find it searching Google for ""stuck in fastboot"" or something like that.

The screen on the G2 seems to have issues with many people, like portions of it would permanently stop registering touches and that breaks the double tap to unlock (happened to me before and got a replacement G2). I think now my screen is crapping out again, I can't notice any dead touch zones, but I have the problem where the double tap doesn't work, most of the time. I blame my tight case, or just the phone bending in my pocket or I don't have an idea really."

But if you don't use a launcher, just swipe up from the home button and it opens Google Now. I think if you're still on KitKat you have to hold the home button down, but I can't remember. It's a personalized news feed and so much more. It will show you travel times to locations you go to often (though that may be linked more to Google Calendar than Now). It shows updates to websites you frequent and recommends similar sites. It shows upcoming reminders, events on your calendar, sports scores for teams you follow, and even shows where you parked if you go somewhere. It's basically the center of all your Google services. It's totally customizable, so if you don't like a certain bit of info (presented on cards) you can tell it that you don't care to see it anymore. I highly recommend you check it a couple times a day. You'll be surprised at how useful it can be.

lgg2,3bcxkp,Michafiel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:10:48 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't blame them for wanting to wait for M. Here's the reasons they'll do it.     They'll be able to advertise how many large releases of Android they shipped. If they start working on a 5.1 update right now it won't be released until around the time M is released. There's a very small chance they'll port UX 4 like they did with the G3's UI to the G2 so it'll take longer to port that to different devices.

lgg2,3b0cwu,BSCA,2,Wed Jun 24 23:17:26 2015 UTC,"Repairing it yourself is not too bad. Make sure whoever is selling it has a defective warranty because the g2 and g3 screens have issues with touch sensitivity sometimes. Besides that i would recommend buying the pre cut adhesive to make life A LOT easier (it also gives you the best grip). Ifixit.com has good tear downs and there's many videos on youtube to help you through the process. My biggest advice would be to get some electrical tape and make sure you cover (if it isnt covered already) the diodes/chips that sit on flex next to the connector. This flex sits underneath one of the antenna cables and if it left uncovered and it makes contact with the atenna cable, or other metal, it will give you touch isssues and display issues. Good luck! It can be scary but it should save you a lot of money."

lgg2,3b0cwu,epsys,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:24:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I already ordered one on eBay for $40, and a $5 precut adhesive from a different auction."
lgg2,3b0cwu,epsys,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:06:11 2015 UTC,"I bought one on ebay $45 and the colors/whites were blue enough that I removed it and purchased the OEM one from etradesupply. I guess the trick would be did that auction say it's an OEM screen, or does it simply say it's compatible. Mine said compatible, didn't say OEM. The gorilla glass doesn't taper near the edge like on stock either. So that's why I try to warn people to buy OEM from a known good source-- the extra $20 was worth it. Also, buying one that comes with the frame makes the entire process about 3x easier because you don't have to break out hairdryer to remove the old screen/digitizer from the frame.  make sure you try to remove/scrape off/clean off the adhesive from the stock frame. It didn't look too bad but the adhesive didn't bond very well in the middle section of the phone with it, even with heating it and lettings some books sit on it for two hours. So, I would recommend some goo-gone or other adhesive removal, and a final cleaning with soap to help cut and actually remove the goo-gone oil/grease-- otherwise the residue will also limit adhesion"

If you know another way to contact corporate/customer care please let me know.     I bought a new LG G2 at the end of April 2015. About a month later the led screen had a black line of bad pixels. I contacted LG for a warranty repair. I mailed the phone May 30.    LG did not send a temporary phone or offer a replacement. With standard shipping the phone arrived in the repair center in TX 6/4. - DAY5 Repairs took a very reasonable 3 days. DAY8 LG mailed the repaired phone on 6/9 and the phone arrived locally 6/12. I contact LG and inquire about the phone and am told to wait for delivery. DAY14 There is still no word from LG but I have a tracking number so I reach out to Fedex and file a claim. I am advices the claims process takes 5-7 days. DAY17 6/21. I find out LG has to handle the claim with Fedex. I call LG Customer Service and am told the funds for the phone will be refunded according to my Fedex claim. 6/23 I call in hopes of reaching a manger but no manager is available. I call an hour later and am bounced around to the top: executive services. I talk with executive services and am told I cannot get a new phone until Fedex confirms the phone is lost, refund the money, and LG builds a new phone. This can take anywhere from 10-18 business days.  6/24 I call and am directed to Executive Support. On DAY 25 Fedex and LG can in fact confirm the phone is missing. Still have to wait on claim, new construction, and mail.   The Executive Service Representative/ Supervisor was nice enough to authorize overnight shipping once LG gets a payment from Fedex and a new phone is built. He however cannot do anything else for me.  Please let me know if you have another way to contact LG for help. Also let me know if you know a good twitter handle/ email for customer service support.

lgg2,3az4o8,minimoss,6,Wed Jun 24 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"When you ship them the phone, you can pay to ship it faster to them. I think you chose to pay the cheapest way there, which means slower total time. Having the phone being transited back to you in 12ish days is still pretty fast.   And then Fedex must have lost it somewhere, so it seems your complaint is more about Fedex being terrible than anything else."

lgg2,3az4o8,robogo,5,Thu Jun 25 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"You thought that the manufacturer was going to supply you with a loaner device or just straight up replace your device? they explicitly say in the warranty info that they will try to repair the device first and replace second. If you were to speak to their customer service they would tell you up front they do not supply loaner devices, almost all manufacturers do not supply a loaner device; if one was ever supplied it would have been through your carrier and at your carriers expense.  This issue, while shitty, seems pretty standard as LG can't do anything until Fedex confirms to them, I highly doubt they won't refund you until ""a new phone is built"" considering these are mass produced consumable electronics and has been out of active production for a year. The reimbursement might take a litttle while as LG won't pay you out of pocket because Fedex is the one to pay you. Again, this part is shitty, but is proper liability practice for companies.   Not sure what this post is even about now that I am finished? Basically, you didn't read the warranty info, had your phone get lost in transit, had LG handle everything by the book, and you want to publicly berate LG until they give you a new phone or money faster?"

Frankly, there are many more options for him if that's the case, especially when phone makers like Asus and Alcatel are rolling out relatively high end devices at budget-friendly prices. For existing G2 users, the phone is still an extremely capable device. I switched to CloudyG2 3.1 rom over the weekend and couldn't be more happy with it. In fact, Cloudyfa will be rolling out an update this weekend to fix certain bugs and make the rom even more stable.

lgg2,3asku0,qnoel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:04:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry for getting back to you guys so late, but we were finally able to work on the phone! So we started to run the SRK Tool that /u/qnoel suggested. So here's what we did. We knew if we tried to enter download mode, we would get back to the QHSUSB_BULK mode we were in before doing what we did last time, so we decided since writing over what we got shouldn't hurt, as we've done it before, it shouldn't hurt getting it back into that state and running the unbrick option. So we run it and it stopped running the unbrick on laf.img. Like it just straight up crashed.  No warning, nothing, the program just ended for whatever reason. So we try running it again, and we get the same problem, it just ends out of no where. So we decide to see if we can get into anything at this point, so we unplug and try the different key methods to get into download mode and recovery mode, and neither of those key combos work. We can still get into Factory Hard Rest and Hardware Button Control, so we get into Factory Hard Reset, decide by trying to go through with it without an image on the phone, we can just likely get it back to QHSUSB, so we let it run, and then we end up crashing the phone. We got a grey screen with it reading ""Critical Error!"", exactly this text  Critical Error!  DemiGod Crash Handler : Critical Error!  Press Key to Choose Dload Mode or Reboot 1) Volume up : Dload Mode. 2) Volume Down: Reboot.  If u choose Dload Mode.  please do following action.  1) Dload Mode. Please Connect USB  2) Get the Ram Dump image using QPST Configuration.  3) Send email to G2-SW-Stability@lge.com    Board Info  Rev. : 1.0 speed.pvs : 1,2 Serial : [this is likely our serial #]  We tried to get the RAM dump, but couldn't, when selecting Download Mode, our phone was detected by the computer at this point, and actually read as LGE AndroidNet LG Phone (or something like that), it installed the driver for the phone. We didn't bother getting the QPST tool to get the RAM dump, so we restarted the phone and was back where we were, stuck in a bootloop. We want to try to get into fastboot mode, but we're not sure how. Everywhere we look on XDA it tells of people who are already stuck in fastboot mode, not how to get into it, so we're stuck again. I wanna say the SRK Tool has the correct files for the D801, so I don't want to replace them in the program, but would that be an idea since it failed on laf.img last time?"
lgg2,3asku0,pmdevita,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"When I had a bricked D801, it showed the critical error part then after a couple reboots nothing would show up - just a black screen. The SRK tool didn't help and crashed just like you said. Eventually my phone stopped showing QHSUSB and stopped showing the multiple partitions. What does your phone show in download mode? Have you tried the other ""fixes"" in the SRK tool?  What I had to was open my phone and short a couple capacitors to force it into QHSUSB mode. Then, I had to boot up Linux and load the main partitions (laf.img, aboot.img, and boot.img). This is probably where you have to start if QHSUSB mode is still working.  I had a huge problem with my phone though. Every time I tried to load the partitions, i think my phones partitions would keep disappearing and reappearing in Linux so had to keep clicking enter until the command went through.  Link to the linux part:  Link  Btw I had no prior Linux experience so if I can do it, so can you guys. Just make sure you have the right .img files for your phone! Hope this helps!"

It has sd card but non removable battery. It has same screen size as g3 but much lighter.  Zenfone 2 for 300 bucks gives you 4 gigs of ram which doubles g2 and sd card non removable battery.

Its the only phone that has reversible design.  You can flip phone upside down and the screen adjusts and you have mics on top and bottom so you can take phone calls on either side.

Regarding the GPS, you may just need to lift the contacts/feet to make better connection with the copper pads on the back plate of the phone where the antenna is integrated.

lgg2,3apv6e,epsys,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but a newer processor and camera would be the icing on the cake. Both are still capable now and are not limitations to the device, but there are some new features that would be nice to include.  I just ordered my wife a replacement G2 from Amazon, new for $210. Until I see a viable replacement for my G2, I'm sticking with it until it dies. Hopefully Motorola will make major improvements to their camera in the 2015 Moto X, since I'm a fan of that phone in general. HA! Who am I kidding?"

lgg2,3apv6e,ThePa1eBlueDot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking along the lines of improved efficiency with big.LITTLE architecture. The 800 isn't a slouch by any means.  The camera is fantastic but isn't as great of a performer as the newer sensors. Adding the 3D OIS from the G4 would also be sweet.  Oh, and Band 12 support for T-Mobile.  Again, none of these improvements are necessary to make the phone 'great', but if the G2 got a refresh in its existing form factor with improved performance/efficiency, it would be a winner IMHO. These phablets are getting out of control."
lgg2,3apv6e,epsys,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think AT&T's band 17 coveres 2/3rds of the Band12 T-Mobile uses, but I think someone also pointed out AT&T's is lower A and B  700mhz carriers and T-Mobile's is upper A B and C (in other words saying that I'm wrong).

It can also flash recovery images which doesn't require a reboot (you don't flash the recovery from within the recovery).  The G2 is different than the other Android devices I have had.

Anyways, what fixed it for me was re-flashing a couple of files from this post (#465). Since you're going to try moving to LP, I would follow those instructions and see if it works for you. You can always nuke it with a stock ROM if it doesn't work.  Also, remember that you should still be able to get into TWRP by:   Turning phone off Holding power + vol up  As soon as logo appears release and then hold power + vol up again   The phone will ask you if you want to reset. Click ""yes"" twice and TWRP will launch."

Flashing new ROMS only messes with the internal portion, so stuff saved to the ""SD Card"" isn't touched. If you do the 'back to stock' route with the KDZ, that WILL nuke everything.  Am I correct in assuming you do not have a ROM stored on your phone that you can flash? Even reflashing 2.2 just to easily transfer the 3.1 install files over would be a good route.

I think the Note 5 will be the first, when it comes out.    bigger display, better camera, more ram   Also much higher quality display.  And better camera is an understatement...!    I also have a Moto G in my household, and It's a large upgrade in every way except battery life (similar), and build quality (lower - Motos are tanks).   I use Cloudyg2 2.2, which is a stock-based ROM.  I prefer stock-based ROMs, as they offer the best battery life & camera quality.  Cloudyg2 2.2 is essentially based on the G3 Kitkat ROM. Cloudyg2 3.1 just came out this week, and is essentially based on the G4 Lollipop ROM, but 1.) that's a first release so...eh, and 2.) I think Kitkat is better still - so am staying on 2.2.  That said, Cloudyg2 2.2 looks like a de-bloated G3 stock ROM, so maybe you wouldn't like it...?"

The only thing that's better is the battery life, and only slightly. The G2 is also the first phone I've ever had that I didn't immediately feel compelled to slap a custom rom on, although cloudyg2 is a great choice if you want to go that path. After rooting and flashing a custom kernel, this phone has battery life rivalling the Moto g, with incredible performance as well!  Honestly, the G2 runs circles around the Moto G."

Lg should have definitely stuck with g3 recents.  That's just my preference because when you have a full view of 9 open apps its quicker and easier to multi task.  Not many people actually used it this way.  I dont know how many actually pinched to change the view in recents from typical two app scroll.  In lollipop the only option is file folder type of scroll and it takes longer time to find the app you are looking for although animation is smooth and prettier.

lgg2,3akvm8,Kuplex,3,Sun Jun 21 06:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I think there is some signal/data issues that cloudy will probably issue patch for unless someone already did in xda forums. Other than that i think faster charge doesn't work because g4 uses 808 snapdragon and rom was designed custom for it.   Lollipop in my opinion made g2 less functional or added unnecessary changes that Lg could have fixed using their UI.   I look forward to M update mostly and will probably stick to 4.4 till another rom.   Unless there is a really nice nexus coming with similar size to g2, battery improvements,  ir blaster and most importantly nexus 5 price,  I will probably stick to g2 for a lot longer.  For 200 bucks and less this phone is unbelievable especially with roms and future possible updates."
lgg2,3akvm8,Minohaji,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:07:16 2015 UTC,G2 really is a hidden gem. Vastly underrated with all I need out of a feature phone.
lgg2,3akvm8,Minohaji,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:43:10 2015 UTC,"Lg is just badass since low end optimus one and first G that was also turned into nexus 4. Lg has a way of lowering their flagships prices faster than others. Last year's g3 can be had for Almost 300 or even under soon.   You cant find s5, iPhone 6, xperia z3 and m8 under 350 brand new. Htc m8 comes closest. Lg does this i believe to move higher volume or something. They cut prices and depreciate much faster.  And i prefer Lg over others ever since nexus 4.  I'll probably add G flex to my collection because of its size and similar available roms.  Maybe at end of year pick up G flex 2 for around 250-300.  It doesn't make sense to get any midrange phones that cost 200-300 online when g2 has better specs for cheaper.  Their price to performance ratio is probably the best."

lgg2,3alp8o,NAMELESSdotTXT,3,Sun Jun 21 13:12:06 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have sent it in.  It's an issue of needing a special kernel with the rom
lgg2,3alp8o,sportscrazed2,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"Is it? Because i flashed Resurrection Rom, and on the XDA page it doesn't say anything about a special kernel."
lgg2,3alp8o,sportscrazed2,2,Sun Jun 21 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"From what I have noticed in the update-binary files in the kernel zips is that there are 2 different different displays for the G2 (One from Japan Display Inc (JDI) and another from LG). The installer checks which display you have and seems to compile part of the kernel on the fly (not really sure about that part).   If it's true what the previous commenter said you'll just have had to flash back the stock rom and it should have fixed it, but I'm pretty sure that the stripes are actually a hardware defect from when the phone becomes to hot while in recovery."

lgg2,3ad76x,LitrosNub,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:55:35 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing to do is to KDZ back to JB if you're on stock Lollipop. If you're already on JB or KK stock then you should be able to root (Stump, towel, idk try them until you find one that works), install TWRP (Blastgator), and flash whatever ROM you want.  The radio/modem doesn't matter much. Just try one if the ROM doesn't specify. If you notice rotation issues or other odd things, try a different one. JB, KK, modded, etc."

lgg2,3acw7x,propjoe,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:32:53 2015 UTC,"Your problem is you're not using Lollipop. Camera was far too slow to actually take a photo on KitKat. Also, I believe the stock app gives better results than the google camera app overall, but that is just my personal opinion after very minimal testing."
lgg2,3acw7x,tapiq,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:45:07 2015 UTC,"I thought so, it's probably the lack of the new camera API in KK. Damn, I have to figure out how to safely flash it, the transition from sweet fresh lollipop on N5 to ye olde bloatwary LG KK is harder then expected"
lgg2,3acw7x,propjoe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:48:00 2015 UTC,Actually I don't think lollipop has the Camera2 API on the G2. I think that LG just improved the software and that's it.
lgg2,3acw7x,speedyg0nz,6,Sun Jun 21 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"The custom rom scene for the G2 is much less vibrant. With Lollipop likely to be the last official rom for the G2, and the N5 certain to get Android M, you might want to take this into consideration. Undoubtedly, G2 developers will bless us with Android M at some point in the future, but as with all AOSP based G2 roms, the camera quality will be poor, among other compromises."
lgg2,3acw7x,LitrosNub,4,Fri Jun 19 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"Cheapest place to buy Refurbished G2's (T-Mobile that you posted) would easily be ebay, most sellers have them up for grabs for about $150-180 new or Refurbished.   Even less if you decide to go for other variants (AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint variants) all go for about $130.   if you're on T-Mobile, I suggest getting the AT&T variant. I'm using it on the T-Mobile Network and it supports all of T-Mobile's bands (wireless bands that each carrier uses differently) except 1 3G band that isn't used much. I get full LTE everywhere and it's pretty much fully supported as a T-Mobile version replacement.  If you don't believe me then go to http://willmyphonework.net and pick LG G2 D800 and pick T-Mobile.  As for battery life, I'm using Resurrection Remix 5.1 ROM and I get 5-6 hours of full heavy usage, Youtube while driving, Bandcamp on traveling, GTA while bored, but with kernels I've seen over 8 and sometimes even 10. The battery is nothing to joke about.  Well thanks for reading this giant wall of text. Hope this helps you get your own G2."

lgg2,3acw7x,Wizardofsmiles,2,Fri Jun 19 03:40:45 2015 UTC,"About 5 months ago I switched from the Nexus 5 to an LG G2.  It felt like somewhat of an upgrade to me.  You get (in order of importance).    Substantially longer battery life.  Gsmrena's battery testing matches my experience - I get about 2.5 times the SOT  (seriously).  From 2.x hours on the Nexus 5 to 5.x-6.x on the G2, and very occasionally 7 hours.  They're almost on opposite ends of the smartphone spectrum for battery life.  Better camera.  From an OK one, to a great one.   .2"" extra screen size in almost the same size body.  imo a nicer looking screen.    For software, I'm currently on CloudyG2 2.2, which surprisingly enough I somewhat prefer to the Nexus 5's Kitkat, and vastly prefer to the Nexus 5's 5.0 Lollipop (which was a bit whacked) - I sold the N5 right before 5.1 came out though, so can't compare to that."
lgg2,3acw7x,pmdevita,2,Fri Jun 19 07:13:01 2015 UTC,"I did just this! My n5 just fell apart and I wanted a budget phone and could not be more happy. The battery , camera and screen made it feel like a huge upgrade! It's a great move its different enough you will be very happy."
lgg2,3acw7x,Geosaurus,2,Fri Jun 19 15:20:55 2015 UTC,The G2 and the Nexus 5 have the exact same CPU/GPU so you aren't getting an upgrade in the performance department.
lgg2,3acw7x,gr8pz,2,Mon Jun 22 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent idea. I made this same move from my beloved Nexus 5 to a G2. I haven't regretted my decision yet. Vastly improved camera (HDR isn't as good, but the G2 is much quicker to capture without blur) and battery life.  The two phones have many similar parts, but the G2 is the no-compromise version of those pieces. The Nexus 5 had a few corners cut (battery size, camera, screen size).  They go for $200ish on Amazon and eBay new."

Right now I have a broken recovery because apparently you can't just update TWRP to the latest version (which I thought I already had) by using the DD method described, it causes an insecure booting error. And because I'm running linux, the LG flash recovery method is not an option. Putting the older version back with dd didn't work either.   I managed to get cloudy 2.2 running yesterday with no issues. There doesn't seem to be good guides on 3.1 at all. I would use caution or wait until there are better guides for the inexperienced.   Edit: Looks like Autorec worked to put 2.7 back on. Guess I need to be more careful and get shit together before trying again.   Edit 2: I have successfully updated my D801 to Cloudy 3.1 using the directions in this post. Important to update TWRP to latest by installing the blastagator zip in recovery. Seems to be working well so far. It's still an adjustment from vanilla 5.1.1 on the Nexus 4. I would rather have that on this phone, but I will probably be fine."

lgg2,3a7ae9,WanderingIdiot2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks. Yeah I wasn't sure since it's not the Canadian model, it's the US one. Really don't want to flash ROMs since I've messed up my HTC one doing that, but I'd be willing to try. Even so, I've heard that KitKat still runs really well on the G2."

I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I haven't gotten the update to lollipop yet and the phone itself says there's no update. There's a chance of we're not on their network they'd have no way of giving us the update. It's an amazing phone though, best I ever had and it only costs $200, you really can't beat it at this price and kitkat runs like a charm so I'm really not worrying about the update."

When I wanted to update I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a phone that was going to be obsolete in a year so I looked at alternative brands, I got a phone called Blu Life Pure, which was not good at all, and finally after a couple of months it stopped working all together so I had it replaced and I found the LG g2 for the same price on Amazon and it is amazing, it blows the Blu out of the water and it's easily comparable to all the big name brands out there. Amazing battery life, super fast, really good camera and the screen looks amazing. For the price, I've found no comparable phone to be honest."

lgg2,3a75t4,asw1791,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:28:42 2015 UTC,This only happened to me once. I revolted my phone and it worked fine. Maybe a bad flash?  Try flashing dorimanx kernel. If that doesn't work try re downloading the rom and flashing it.
lgg2,3a6fsp,Crake13,5,Wed Jun 17 16:26:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't try to just replace the port, the port is part of a larger piece so I'm not sure you can even reconnect it with the tools you're likely to have at home.  Plus it's one more thing to go wrong with the repair so you really should just buy the whole assembly to swap it out.  I did this to my phone a few months ago and it wasn't that bad, just go slow and set aside a couple of hours if this is your first attempt."

lgg2,3a45bf,hokiefan240,2,Wed Jun 17 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"First off, I would highly recommend reading everything over and over and ensure that you are flashing the correct version for your phone. It will be something like D800/D801/D802/D803/F320/LS/VS980/L01F and depends on the carrier. For example, my phone is the the Tmobile variant and therefore my model is D801. It should say on your box what model it is. Memorize this when flashing many items!  I am going to go ahead and assume you have TWRP or another recovery that works for you.  Cloudy G2 2.2 is the go to as far as stock-based roms are concerned.   Dorimanx Kernel is also something I use and have noticed a nice improvement on battery life when you tweak the right settings.  Lastly, I would highly recommend XCam LG by xdabbeb. I have been using this mod of the camera for about a year now and it just gets better and better each time.   That's all I have really done. I have gone back to stock Kit Kat and just rooted for Dorimanx and XCam as the battery life was slightly better than Cloudy G2 (for me anyways). But I would still highly recommend Cloudy G2!  EDIT: Apparently Cloudy G2 3.1 is out (lollipop based)... so I would try that"
lgg2,3a45bf,danosmanca,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:09:52 2015 UTC,Wait so far all the ROMs are KK or JB based? (New to rooting and flashing also)  That explains....
lgg2,3a45bf,LifeSad07041997,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:46:32 2015 UTC,"No, there are lots of roms that are lollipop based as well. Search within the the LGG2 subreddit ""best roms"" and this will yield multiple discussions."

It didn't detect it (I don't know if it can while it's still on) and then I turned it off and turned it back on again. I fthat doesn't work, then try taking out the SIM card before you recover back into what I hope is an up-to-date recovery that you have saved in TWRP  Edit: MY sister called and texted me after I did this and they both worked, so unless its not triggered by a specfic action and just happens over time, then I should be alright, knock on wood.

lgg2,3a4g9u,runninsavvy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"My exact steps were thus: 1. Do a wipe (dalvik, data, cache, everything except internal, you know the drill) 2. take out the SIM card 3.

The bad news is that I'm still stuck in a bootloop after trying to push CM12, but the good news is that I'm able to push other things now.     So, I'm telling you all this because it seems you know enough and I would like to ask for your help one last time. My previous steps were:      On CM12 last nightly, I decided to go back to stock I created this topic, and as suggested flashed the bootstack-d802-LP_30d-loki-signed.zip found on the link above and then Cloudy G2 3.1... Then all went to hell. A week later and here I am, able to sideload through TWRP; tried to do it with CM12, the push was successful but sadly I'm still stuck in a bootloop.   So, what would you suggest to do now? Should I try a Kitkat bootstack before pushing CM12 again? Try a stock rom?     EDIT: I'm trying this right now (downloading the files). Wish me luck :P EDIT 2: I'm now rocking CloudyG2 3.1, everything seems to be working except I get no radio signal. Tried to flash some modem.img but nothing seems to fix it!"

lgg2,3a5hhp,hdas,2,Wed Jun 17 12:08:41 2015 UTC,well i was doing my research and found out that at that 2% it verifies the device and if the kdz doesnt match the device it stops !  I am guessing there is something wrong with the cloudy rom we should flash a rom which is completely stock and try flashing kdz again   I am in search of a stock lollipop rom without any changes !!!!

lgg2,3a0j8n,doctorxerxes,2,Tue Jun 16 17:47:11 2015 UTC,"So it's definitely smoother than stock. There are still a lot of random hangs/lags that are not present in AOSP but I think that's the G2's MO right now on stock.   Battery life has been rock solid, camera is fantastic.  All in all, the most stable/battery friendly/camera positive experience I've had so far. On D801.   Currently missing wifi calling (not a deal breaker IMO) and my G3 that's in the shop :P  EDIT: I should note that I flashed the Dormanx kernel almost immediately so it'll take a few days for me to get solid battery life stats back.

lgg2,3a0j8n,rhomqw,3,Tue Jun 16 13:16:03 2015 UTC,Pretty worse. Unless you generally don't care about taking pictures with your phone then it's not worth switching to AOSP in my opinion.

I'm running cloudyG2 2.2 on a d800 and apparently I need to get to stock lollipop before I wipe and install. I found the LG Flash Tool 2014 here but I can't find the correct kdz file. Apparently if you aren't a goddamned expert and even think about asking a question in the xda thread you're giving everyone else eye cancer so I thought I would ask for help here.

All you have to do is flash a few files in addition to the rom  There's this way  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=61382662&amp;postcount=135  or this way  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=61382930&amp;postcount=148  From what I read in the comments, they work the same way. All the files are from the same developer,  so I'm not exactly sure  why the methods are slightly different.  I did the second method.  For whatever reason, after I finished, i got a bootloop, so I went back to recovery, and reflashed the 800-30f-modem-blastagator-signed.zip and bootstack-d800-LP_30f-bump-blastagator-signed.zip files, and then it booted up succesfully."

No different from dialing a phone number, except it tells Sprint you want them to push the latest PRL.  if Cloudy 2 was showing you as Verizon, you may have purchased a Verizon phone. I would take off the back cover of the phone and check the model number on the PCB to be sure the person didn't sell you the wrong one. 'not in our systems' generally means your MEID isn't associated with an account, which usually only happens when you have a non-Sprint phone  I have good reason to think you need to be doing more due-diligence"
lgg2,3a0j8n,Sunny2456,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"Hold up. If you go thru the build.prop for cloudy g2, you can easily see that mostly everything is coded in using the Verizon version. Basically, selecting sprint in the setup menu for cloudy doesn't make a difference, since it will input all the Verizon data anyway. And yes, I am sure I click on sprint on both my phone, and my dad's.   My phone is definitely a sprint phone, as it was, is, and will be connected to their towers in the future."

lgg2,3a0j8n,YoursTrulySarcastic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:10:25 2015 UTC,I had these exact same thoughts. I came to the G2 from a Nexus 5 and am appalled that being Canadian means I'm stuck on kit kat forever.
lgg2,3a0j8n,madboymatt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:11:15 2015 UTC,"Fuck, me too man. I was waiting patiently for cloudy to drop this, hoping that the 803 would be supported. Nope. Fuck LG. I'm done.  Edit: apparently there is a patch that will allow this to work on 803. I'm at work so can't test it. I'll try tonight.  Go into the xda thread and search 803."
lgg2,3a0j8n,YoursTrulySarcastic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm mad at LG. I'm still happy that cloudy gives more support to phones than fucking LG Canada. The patch is a glitchy workaround thst uses the kit kat baseband instead of the lollipop one. This means that there's going to be a lot more bugs and slowdowns and isn't really lollipop. It's lollipop ui without the lollipop system optimizations. This makes me beyond mad. The G2 was perfect for my needs hardware wise but LG decided that Canada is too ""third-world"" to receive a software update. I'm going to wait until September ish when the new nexus is released, that or Moto X 2015.  I'm done with flagships that are left behind shortly after launch."
lgg2,3a0j8n,madboymatt,2,Tue Jun 16 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"That's a shame about the patch.  I couldn't agree with you more about LG. This phone is not even 2 years old, and it has only received one major update. One! That's garbage. Considering the hardware is still excellent, it doesn't make any sense to me why they wouldn't push LP to us. Ridiculous.  Edit: I just called LG Canada to ask why the G2 was not being updated, and after waiting on hold for about 5 mins, the CSR returned to tell me that ""the Lollipop update for the G2 is not available at this time, but that is not permanent"" I asked if that means it will for sure be getting Lollipop, and all she could tell me is that she was told that the lack of a current update is not permanent.   What I don't get is, how different can these variants be, really? Is the 803 and 802 so different that they can't just basically copy the code and make it work for the 803? I don't know enough about it, but it seems crazy to me that they can't release an update for the 803."
lgg2,3a0j8n,YoursTrulySarcastic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"LG released an official statement saying that the Canadian D803 will not be updated to lollipop so what the LG customer support person said is a cop-out. I thought the same thing too but if it was that easy to change, someone on XDA would of come up with it. I don't know much and can't claim to be an expert but its probably tweaks under the hood and possibly drivers that only exist for the variant and can't be simply changed to fit another variant."

lgg2,3a4io3,boyd02,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, that is exactly what happened to me several months ago and I just successfully replaced the LCD and digitizer... sort of. I bought this and did it myself watching this.  My only advice is to be crazy careful when undoing the latches. I was lazy on one and it cost me the phone. Basically, my replacement went perfect, new screen worked to a T. However, I wanted to tape back down the screen using two-sided tape I got for it. However, opening it back up caused this (the insanely small missing tooth below the part I'm touching) to happen, and that's all it takes to ruin the process and cause the screen to stop working entirely.  Tread lightly and god speed. (Sorry about the super long answer, just thought I'd share since this just happened to me)"
lgg2,3a4io3,hey-ohaydayjetski,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"I had this happen and bought a digitizer and LCD combo. I would not just buy the digitizer.  In fact I would buy the one with the bezel too as mine ended up bulging, and causing phantom touches.  Then I sent it to lg who fixed my botched repair for free. I would evaluate sending out to them as they will fix it for about 100 if it is out of warranty even and refurbish the entire device as part of the process."
lgg2,3a4io3,jreddittwice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"replacing the glass/digitizer alone is pretty tricky and to 'get it right' you need to have some fancy lyca glue or something and an ultra-violet lamp to cure it.   Personally, that's too much trouble to be worth saving the $40. Also, you'd have to find a lyca glue vendor you can trust...and that glue is probably important for reducing reflections and refractions between the LCD and the front glass/digitzer.  I'd simply recommend buying a replacement screen+digitizer+body from etradesupply. Not ebay or amazon, no guarantee on the quality. My first has nasty obvious blue tint to whites requiring kernel mod to manage. Which worked, but to save $20 on $65 instead of $45? nah. The edges of the gorilla glass on the ebay one also didn't taper to the chassis/body of the phone like originally, like on the Iphone6, and like on the Galaxy S3. It wasn't that I installed it incorrectly, it was that they didn't pay for the 2.5D gorilla glass feature. I have photos of the curviture and reflection on this taper between OEM and the one they sent me, the reflection is wider on the OEM because the taper at the edge of the gorilla glass is decidedly more gradual.  I have to say I'm impressed the chinese are getting so good at cutting costs. Everything else worked-- double tap to wake, it was 1080p, the touch firmware responded to the update...all very close to OEM...but not quite. Seeing as they only advertised it as COMPATIBLE and did NOT specify whether it was actually OEM...I let them slide, and won't be opening an ebay case with them. I'll let someone else do the complaining, as I can just save the original with replaced LCD/Digitizer as a backup in case I break my etradesupply one   and check your youtube videos and google. it's been done before"

Move both downloads to it. Next hold down power and volume down. When phone restarts and lg logo flinches and goes dark  , let go, hold buttons again and when lg logo comes on again let go and hold one more time , reset should pop up hit power to go back to recovery.

lgg2,3a0zaf,doctorxerxes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:06:53 2015 UTC,So you're telling me your phone cannot get into download mode ? Not recovery mind you. It appears that MAYBE your recovery partition got corrupt during the install. Not sure how though. I still feel your phone should be detectable via adb. Make sure your drivers are correct though.  Once detected flashing a new recovery should sort out your issues. Keep me updated and I'll try and work out your issue.

lgg2,3a0srh,thedankonion1,3,Tue Jun 16 09:45:35 2015 UTC,"CloudyG2 3.1 comes with UX4.0 so it looks like the LG G4 interface. It also removes plenty of LG bloatware, making for a smoother experience. It's pre-rooted and Xposed friendly for people who are into those things. It also incorporates an advanced camera driver that extends the camera's capability and improves quality/controls. AROMA installer allows you to configure parts of the rom as you flash it via recovery. It gets updated when LG updates the stock rom, or to offer bugfixes  (based on his earlier roms). Only if LG offers an official update to 5.1."

Size wise the G2 is similar to Samsung Galaxy S4 (since Samsung is so huge world wide, I am sure you probably handled one), only the buttons is software not physical like Samsung, so the screen is slightly bigger."

The case options are so limited because their version is slightly thicker than the other models so it took awhile to find a decent case with a kickstand on Amazon.   I love the phone and I will be pretty sad when I finally have to switch to one of the newer LG models. The rest of my friends and relatives are either using iphones or samsungs galaxy line.

lgg2,39v8hb,doughboyreturns,2,Mon Jun 15 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue with stock 5.0.1 is how old it is compared to 5.1. Ram management is garbage, apps will die in the background so easily. Also notifications can only be dismissed, not swiped back up to the notification drawer. With cm12.1, you do loose camera quality, but lenovo super camera helps take way better pictures. Heads up can be dismissed and the notification stays, unlike stock. Stock KitKat might be the best bet, way more stable since its not using a broken version of lollipop, decently fast, camera is good, no ram issues. Xdabbeb (don't know if its for the at&t variant) it gloudy g2 are probably the best stock roms, definitely recommend you take a look at those. Also, take notice on the bootstacks, and which version you must be on. (At least for my Verizon g2) Going back to KitKat you have to flash the KitKat bootstack in recovery, reboot back to recovery and then flash rom. Works for me every time, however you should check out the roms OP and make sure what your doing is correct. Good luck!"

Since LG phones don't have a fully unlocked bootloader (the bootloader is patched and passed by), it's hard to flash recovery without any risks.  Well, autorec (app from playstore) pretty much solved that problem and made it very simple to bring TWRP for the G2, but if you want a phone that has toons of development go for either a Samsung flagship or a Nexus. Samsung has a large fanbase and has unlocked bootloaders, Nexus is a friggin nexus!  If you want a nice phone with good hardware but don't mind staying in the same rom (which personally I think are stable and nice enough for that), go for the G2. Otherwise wait for a couple months, two new Nexus devices will be announced. Save your money and spend like 300$ to 400$ in the new nexus which will most certainly be a remake of the Nexus5.  I own both G2 and a Galaxy Nexus but since my G2 isn't being used by me I only rely on the Nexus (which is becoming old) so I'll do the same: wait for the new Nexuses!"

You could try to get a pin in that place, it will likely not be trivial and you'll almost certainly have to fashion your own ""pin"" from something else. It's not impossible, just a pain to do if you're not interested in fixing for the enjoyment of fixing it. Also there's a good chance of damaging the connector while attempting to fix it, but given the phone isn't working and the ""easiest"", similarly hacky alternative is replacing the connector you wouldn't have a whole lot to loose.

Don't know exact temperatures but like 8 sensors or something in CPU-Z shows more than 60 celcius.  I really like the phone but this overheating makes me nervous it's gonna break the screen when gaming. There are some recoveries that do not come with thermal control (i.e. Cloudy's Kitkat autorec) and when you flash a rom phone just goes all out and it most of the time burns the screen a bit leaving a line of dead pixels or more.

It does come with a ton of AT&T bloatware, but you have the option to disable it and it won't bother you again.

lgg2,39k2sh,joho0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:54:30 2015 UTC,Is your hand anywhere near the distance sensor at the top? It's really touchy about that.

lgg2,39k2sh,AshamedOfYou,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:12:49 2015 UTC,My phone does the same thing.  The best solution I've found so far is to hit the volume down and power buttons at the same time.  Even then I sometimes have to try multiple times to get the screen to stay on.
lgg2,39k2sh,Dracolis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:25:38 2015 UTC,Mine did this too. Never found a fix. I ended up returning it and getting a replacement since it happened during the warranty period.

I gave the light sensor on the front, by the front camera, a really good rub with a cloth.  Seems to have sorted the issue.  Before that, I has hitting the down volume button (as said elsewhere) as quickly as possible to sort of coax it into staying on.  This normally took a few attempts."
lgg2,39k2sh,bradlove17,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"I have this issue too.. Very annoying. What I found as a work around on another thread is the following:   Cover the proximity sensor wake the phone (it will immediately sleep) remove proximity sensor cover wake the phone.    95% of the time, this process works to allow normal phone usage. incredibly stupid to have to use this work around.. Mine seemed to go bad at the same time as the lollipop update. I'm still hoping this is a software bug and not a hardware issue, although I fear it is hardware related."
lgg2,39k2sh,INeedChocolateMilk,0,Fri Jun 12 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"Had the same issue, pried the phone apart, ripped out the proximity sensor(which is sadly one module together with the frontLED, and other sensors), put the damned thing back together, and viola.

lgg2,39gvml,turbodude69,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"Mine never gets hot, and your battery shouldn't ever be pulling enough current to make it so.  Sounds like used might have equaled abused. Get that battery replaced or get a refund / warranty claim.  Edit: If/Once you've done that, reining in battery usage is basically as simple as getting an app or Xposed module to re-enable the App Ops menu and disable some wakelocks and other aggressive battery drains on a per-app basis.  As with all phones, screen-on time is typically a big battery hog so minimizing that, and getting into the habit of using the brightness settings appropriately should help a lot also."

Also, note that this will cancel your current service, so you'll need to talk to your service provider to set you up with another number after it's ported out. You could also just use the number that Google Voice gives you and keep your current number the same."

lgg2,39hbvu,americanhitcher,2,Thu Jun 11 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have any problems with lollipop as long as you factory reset once you update (doing so helps your battery life). If you want to go back to kitkat you can reinstall the stock .kdz file by using the LG Flash Tool and putting your phone into download mode (Hold volume up and plug into pc). Download the stock kdz here. Here's a guide in case you need help. Enjoy your G2!  Edit: If you want to get into custom roms, check the sidebar for a list of lollipop roms. I personally would recommend CyanogenMod 12 or BlissPop. If you want kitkat then CloudyG2 and CyanogenMod 11 are good roms."
lgg2,39hbvu,someidiot1998,2,Thu Jun 11 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Would these custom roms work with this flash tool, or do I need to do further work (such as unlocking bootloader or something like that)?"
lgg2,39hbvu,someidiot1998,2,Thu Jun 11 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"To install a custom ROM you would need to be on stock kitkat first. Then you would need to root using stumproot (link in sidebar). After that you would use autorec kitkat for d801. Can't get a link since I'm on mobile, but just do a Google search. Autorec automatically downgrades your bootloader and installs twrp (custom recovery). Once you do all that, you can flash the custom ROM zip file in twrp. To boot into recovery (at this point twrp) you just hold power and volume down while the phone is off, and as soon as the lg logo shows up, let go and press them down again instantly. It will say factory reset, but you just have to press the power button a couple times and it will boot into twrp. Once in twrp, do a factory reset, then find where you downloaded your custom ROM .zip file using the install button at the top left. Click on it, swipe right to flash, and you're done. Not all custom ROMs come with Google apps, so you may need to download them separately and flash the gapps zip through twrp as well. Good luck!"

I usually just make a list of apps and then I'll go to the playstore and reinstall. When the phone first resets and enters LG's setup prompts you'll have the option to sign in. IMPORTANT > 1) Verify you're currently syncing you google account info before resetting (under settings>accounts&sync>google>[select your email]) 2) Go under ""Backup & reset"" settings and make sure you have both boxes checked for BackUpMyData and Automatic restore.

It's good looking, still fast, stable, battery life is great (though maybe it would've been better on KitKat, I don't know, but I still get 6 hours of screen on time), can't really say anything bad about it.  While it's a great phone, I wouldn't say it's an upgrade to the Note 3, the 2 phones are on the same level, the differences only come with the software."

lgg2,39bmlj,dartstothesea,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:32:23 2015 UTC,see my reply here as it pertains to both his and your reply: http://www.reddit.com/r/lgg2/comments/39bmlj/g2_owners_how_is_it_running_on_lollipop/cs26z3c
lgg2,39bmlj,letmebehealthy,3,Wed Jun 10 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what to say, I just simply use it, don't even care about using battery saving apps like Greenify or Amplify, I have location on (but Google Location Reporting turned off, that helps a lot), Google Now is also on, with Google Location Reporting off it basically uses no power, and I used to use auto brightness, but I really hated it, sometimes it was way too bright, sometimes too dark, so now I use Lux.  2 hours of SoT sounds terrible for the G2, even if you don't get 6 hours, you should reach 4 hours without worrying about anything.  So what I recommend is to either do a factory reset, as /u/dartstothesea said, or if you don't want to lose your apps' data, then install Wakelock Detector and GSam Battery Monitor, and for a day or two watch what causes battery drain.  If an app causes battery drain, that's pretty easy to fix in most cases, though it might cause some reduced functionality (for example I disabled notifications on Facebook Messenger, and it went from 8% to less than 1%, but now I don't get notifications. which is fine for me, it's actually what I prefer, but it might be not okay for others).  I always hated trying to find what causes battery drain, so if I were you I'd just do a factory reset, if you don't want to lose data then use Titanium Backup, it needs root, but so does Wakelock Detector."
lgg2,39bmlj,Pr3no,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:18:33 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, even after a factory reset, the battery was identical. This is both when I was running on big red and right now Orange (study abroad trip) so GSM should be theoretically be using even less data. But what I've noticed is that if my data is on, when wifi is off, my battery will tank in 5 hours whether or not I'm using it. The culprit when that happens is Google Play Services, which is something i can't really change.. Not sure what to do at this point. THis is my 5th G2 as I've had numerous issues with the others. :("
lgg2,39bmlj,letmebehealthy,3,Wed Jun 10 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"When data is on it's understandable that battery drains quickly, because there's a bug in Lollipop: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/39amvy/just_a_friendly_reminder_play_services_mobile/  But if it's also draining while data is off, then you probably have some wakelocks."

Aside from that, Lollipop has still been bad -- very buggy, laggy, and an utter battery hog. It feels like something they rushed out the door with no testing or quality assurance at all. I hated it so much I rooted and flashed a KK ROM. Hubby needs to get his phone replaced anyway since the top 15% of the screen is unresponsive to touch (which had also happened to my 1st G2 -- I'm on my 3rd now) so we're holding off on rooting it, but he goes through about 15-20% of battery per hour on Lollipop, compared to about 5% per hour before the ""upgrade"""

I can barely get 9 hours out of a charge, and I don't use my phone much at all.  Do you also have issues with the phone heating up for no apparent reason?  I have found that if I don't stay near a strong wifi signal, my phone gets really hot and battery drains like crazy.  When I go out to run errands, battery drains about 3x as fast as if I'm at home.  I've also found, that if you leave apps open in the foreground when you shut your screen off, it seems they still continue running and heat the phone up.  I have to kill all open tasks every time I shut my screen off.  This was such an awful update."

Thanks again."

If you don't use the UV glue, it's just not going to turn out well. On top of that, it's tough to get the new glass to adhere to the frame with the supplied tape.

Basically, you tried installing a lollipop rom and then decided to go back to kitkat or something previous. You do the normal ROM flashing schism, ie. Factory reset, whatever. All of a sudden, your old rom that you are trying to flash doesn't boot and you are stuck in a soft-boot. This is because you no longer have the kitkat modem installed.   How to fix it: Boot into recovery (TWRP) by holding down power+volume down, once the screen turns on, let go, then do it again until it brings you to a white screen. If you have TWRP installed or a custom recovery installed, then don't worry because the screen tells you that it will reset all your data. This screen is LYIIIIIIING. Go ahead and ""wipe"" your data. It will then boot you into your custom recovery, where if you plug your phone into a computer you can add and remove files to it. Download the kitkat baseband for your phone D80x or whatever your model is and bring it to your phone. Factory reset, flash the baseband, flash your rom, boom.   Go me."

lgg2,3948ks,z0mghii,4,Tue Jun 9 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"NO. buy from etradesupply. I bought ebay and the edges of the gorilla glass on the screen don't taper to the bezel like the stock G2. You'll pay $65 for screen digitizer and frame, or $45 for screen and digitizer for the cheapest option on ebay. I was meticulous in my ebay installation and the portions of the screen in the middle of the phone don't stick down/flex down a bit due to insufficient adhesive / I didn't clean the adhesion surface before installation because that would be a lot of work.  not to mention, the screen was WAY off color, too blue of whites like 7000k, far more blue than the stock unit I received (probably 6300k or something). it was NOTICEABLE.  so to be clear I first installed an ebay screen I purchased for $45 using hairdryer to remove the old broken screen, and then went to the $65 etradesupply option. So yes, I paid $110 total to get more accurate colors and gorilla glass that tapers near the edge of the device.  I'm OCD/anal/pedantic/picky. you can flash dorimanx kernel which includes color modification app to change the whitepoint of the display, highly recommended, possibly even for a normal G2.... the G2 screen seems a bit blue as is...hmm..."

Stock Lollipop seems much smoother to me. At least comparing to Cloudy G2. Camera is the same as on KK. Not sure how you'd go about going back to KK. You'd probably have to use the LG Flash Tool. You'd lose all of your data.   Overall I'm very satisfied with Lollipop and see no reason not to upgrade.  EDIT: I did a clean install"

I got a G3 to replace it, had it for  about 2 months (because I really wanted to hold out for the G4) and I wasn't feeling as much love due to the battery life and washed out screen.  I have a G4 now and I think it's a vast improvement from the past two models.  Definitely worth the $600 that it is now.  But I think the G2 would be great for the price you listed."

I'm struggling with 3G at the moment because I have no LTE signal. Something isn't allowing the antenna to operate. I'm currently on the VS982.5 with the 28a bootstack.
lgg2,389mah,threadsoup,0,Wed Jun 3 05:56:42 2015 UTC,You are not allowing the antenna to operate. Op says 39a bootstack. Following directions is important if you want things to work properly.
lgg2,389mah,Demilitarizer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:55:44 2015 UTC,He is talking about a different Rom. A Lollipop based one. I guess I am asking the wrong group. 28a is the correct bootstack for the VS982.5 by xdabbeb. I'm surprised you wouldn't know that. I am asking if anyone is having this issue between flashing from different Bootstacks. The Lollipop Rom OP mentions wouldn't operate at all on the wrong bootstack.
lgg2,389mah,threadsoup,0,Wed Jun 3 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"I see that now. Either I didn't read op's post or he edited it. Either way, it's a silly place to post the question. My advice to him would be to clean flash the current rom (or any stock rom) or possibly kdz flash if all else fails.  Edit- the problem is unusual. An efs error usually leaves you with no signal at all. I recommend kdz /or/ tot flash."
lgg2,389mah,Demilitarizer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"I've tried both. Couldn't get either to work, but that is a different story. I have, in the past, been able to go back to a 'stock-like' Rom and return LTE functionality. This functionality will sometimes remain when flashing Lollipop Roms and their corresponding Bootstacks, but not always. It is an odd occurrence. I'm probably going to have to start over again with the stock like Rom. I was hoping this current version was stock-like enough, but I digress."

If you can still access download mode you should be able to install everything back onto your phone using your computer. This should work.  Hope this helped.  Edit: make sure you download the correct drivers for your D802
lgg2,37phem,thiswillbeahoot,1 point,Fri May 29 14:13:57 2015 UTC,According to my laptop all my drivers are up to date. I accessed download mode to try to flash the stock ROM but it failed because apparently the software was already installed. Thank you for your help :)
lgg2,37phem,DoYouKnowTheTacoMan,2,Fri May 29 14:28:52 2015 UTC,By bricked do you mean bootloop? If you can get into TWRP I wouldn't call that bricked.  Well you can try several things:  -Flash a new rom  -Use the .tot method  -Flash your correct modem/radio? (I doubt this is it)  -Just wipe everything (including internal storage) and try installing a new rom / the .tot method

If it's not in their IMEI database (read: not specifically made for Verizon), their systems will throw an error.  It's possible to get an unlocked device on Verizon, but it messes things up in the future, like you're unable to do plan changes. Since it's a work phone, the company probably has insurance and thus an extended warranty on the device, meaning OP can get another G2 easily (but might have to go through his company IT to do it)"

As a fellow runner, I don't like taking the g2 for bumpy rides like that.   As for phones, i'd wait and see what verizon can do for you before looking for another phone--is it under warranty etc? If verizon can't do anything, I'd sell the busted one on ebay as is and grab another g2; a new/lightly used g2 will run you 150ish on ebay. For the price, I don't think another phone can compare, unless you can find a great deal on an M8 or something. On that note, you can try /r/hardwareswap if you're looking for a used phone!"

I haven't looked into bootloader - but for battery and camera:   Battery - You can check GSM Arena's Battery Testing.  You can even adjust the sliders to your usage.  Out of that, and Verizon's current phones - only the Sony Xperiz z3, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and Motorola Droid Turbo are in the same battery life class as the G2.   Out of those - the Note 4 has a better camera.  I've read the Xperia Z3 is worse.  Turbo - I'm not sure, but offhand being Motorola - I bet it's worse.   So - Note 4?

The final version of Android M will probably be available in September, and it's at least 3 months for LG to release it for the G2. The G2 will be 2 years old in September, so that'd mean the G2 will have been supported for 27 months, not even the best supported Nexus device reached that so far (I think the longest supported Nexus was updated 23 months after its release date).

A factory reset only deletes the data partition, the recovery is in a separate partition, while the necessary files for are in the system partition, which both don't get erased in a factory reset.   In short there are multiple version of the G2: D802 (International), F320X (Korea) and multiple D80X version (different US carrier versions and Canada), VS980 (Verizon), LS980 (Sprint).  They all require different software, flashing the wrong software might result in a hard brick, although that can be fixed by opening up the G2 and shortening 2 pins.  For more information you should visit the LG G2 section on the XDA developers forums, they have a few beginner guides in the general section."

lgg2,37dv8n,someidiot1998,8,Tue May 26 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"Kernel basically is the middle man for your phone. It takes requests from software and tells what the hardware on your phone needs to do. There's a lot of advantages/disadvantages to using different kernels but the big picture is different kernels have different methods of taking these requests. These methods may be faster or slower depending on use cases. Also in rom development, most developers will add additional features to the kernel. These features tend to mostly consist of different scheduling algorithms (the method/algorithm the kernel uses to take requests).   A person on XDA wrote a huge thread on these algorithms here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/general/ref-kernel-governors-modules-o-t1369817."
lgg2,37dv8n,z0mghii,2,Tue May 26 22:36:56 2015 UTC,"So I'm running cyanogenmod and my kernel is the cyanogenmod kernel. Do I HAVE to use that kernel, or can I use a different one, and if so, how could I go about changing it?"
lgg2,37dv8n,z0mghii,4,Tue May 26 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether the ROM you're using supports the kernel you want to use or not. The kernel handles these requests by interacting with the operating system which is essentially your ROM. If you the ROM you're using on does support the kernel you want to switch, usually all you have to do is just flash the kernel and you're good.   IMO, custom kernels are generally a waste of time unless you're looking for a specific feature (like fast charging). I've tried a lot of kernels that promise better battery life, but I've seen very negligible improvements. It's pretty far stretched that simply changing a governor will give you an extra 1 hour of screen time."

If you don't know how to use ADB: Download Minimal ADB and Fastboo, enable USB debugging on your phone, connect your phone to your PC via an USB cable, you should get a sort of pop up window on your phone where you can authorize USB debugging from your PC, check ""always enable"" or something like that and click OK.  Now you should open a command prompt in the folder where you installed Minimal ADB (fastest way is shift + right click in the folder and then ""open command prompt here), and now you can type in those commands.  After that you just have to flash the zip, reboot to recovery, you can do that with ""adb reboot recovery"" without the quotation marks, once you're in recovery just tap install, find the Xposed zip (btw don't unzip it) and click on it. Once it's done reboot, and now install the apk with a file manager, that's it.

When lg logo comes on release buttons quickly and hold them again. It should say factory reset click it, it just takes you to recovery.  I did exact same thing awhile ago. Best thing to do is get one of those flash drives that are dual micro usb and flash and connects direct to phone to transfer files..  Backup your phone to it. So you can always just plug it in and restore your files,  roms,  porn..   Here is a nice one.. http://mobile.walmart.com/ip/Imation-32GB-2-in-1-microUSB-Flash-Drive/37938128?type=search"

It should show lg g2 or somethin similar external drive.  If not than get flash drive put rom on it,  plug it in phone than from recovery there is option to flash from sd card or external drive. I use philz recovery but it should be similar to yours as well.  So don't worry you didnt kill your phone.  Just try to get flash drive like the one i posted from Walmart and put rom on it.

As a bonus, my replacement screen came with all of the tools needed to replace it which made it even easier.  Overall difficulty: 6-7/10  I may be biased though as I've replaced other screens before however if you just follow the tutorial along, you should be fine and it won't be too hard at all"
lgg2,375lkh,the_hoyboy,1 point,Mon May 25 03:41:42 2015 UTC,I'd rank the difficulty as a 2/10. Its one of the easier phones to repair.
lgg2,375lkh,gr8pz,1 point,Tue May 26 04:12:10 2015 UTC,"I would say 4/10, not terribly hard but a little bit. And I doubt its OEM. The site I got mine from said it was OEM gorilla glass and it scratched soo much easier than my previous screen"
lgg2,3722lo,ryangehret,15,Sun May 24 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"definitely agree with with 1080p/5.2"" perfect sentiment"
lgg2,3722lo,epsys,2,Sun May 24 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the G2 also have remarkably small bevels, making the 5.2"" screen feel a little smaller in the hand (compared to other ~5"" phones)?  Personally the 5.2"" is a tad big for my hands, but just a tiny bit. The resolution is perfect though."
lgg2,3722lo,yiazmaty,1 point,Mon May 25 14:16:49 2015 UTC,Yes. That's what makes it wonderful in my personal opinion.   The g3 has wider bezel consisted to g2

lgg2,3722lo,o0adam0o,8,Sun May 24 23:18:24 2015 UTC,Its the first phone that I seriously don't feel enticed to upgrade. G4 is too big. S6 has poor battery life.   If I could get the exact same dimensions as G2 but with upgraded internals... I'd be sold.   So far there's a New Moto X coming but I don't think it will be on Sprint
lgg2,3722lo,aDerpyPenguin,2,Sun May 24 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly I played with a G3 (same size as the G4) today and it really isn't that much bigger than the G2. I could prolly rock a G4 no problem, but I need to be sure it doesn't overheat or have other issues."
lgg2,3722lo,yiazmaty,2,Sun May 24 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"I find the G2 slightly too large so going even larger wouldn't be good for me.  I really looked into the Z3c before I got another G2 (switched from ATT to Tmobile), but for the price the G2 is amazing."

lgg2,3722lo,Sir_Beelzebub,3,Sun May 24 05:38:15 2015 UTC,I don't have any reason to replace mine at the moment.  I think I should be able to keep it for quite a long time.
lgg2,3722lo,knuckles1978,5,Sun May 24 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"My only gripe with the phone is the dated looking stock software (even on lollipop, imo). But at least it's quick, which is more important.  Other than that, I agree, it's amazing. The phone is as small as it can be with those tiny bezels next to the 5.2"" display, which is the perfect screen size. And yet, the battery life is fantastic, better than a lot of new 'flagships' even.   Its build is sturdy too, I dropped it countless of times (without a case), and the plastic is still mostly looking fine."
lgg2,3722lo,Sir_Beelzebub,3,Sun May 24 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"G2 was and is my favorite phone, it kicks my note 4s ass. Note 4 lags and touchwiz is shit. Do not get any Samsung devices,  don't know much about the s6 tho"
lgg2,3722lo,knuckles1978,2,Sun May 24 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"Samsung hardware is good, just throw a custom ROM on it and you're good to go."
lgg2,3722lo,Sir_Beelzebub,2,Sun May 24 20:16:22 2015 UTC,Yea  but it usually ruins the camera and warranty
lgg2,3722lo,knuckles1978,1 point,Sun May 24 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"That's true, the camera is one thing that is awesome on stock ROMs, and not quite as good on custom ROMs such as CM. It's still very good though.  And as far as warranty goes, if you ever did need to claim warranty, just blow the thing up with a 12v power supply. Nobody can tell that you had it rooted and flashed when the screen doesn't come on at all. ;-)  The chances of you needing a warranty claim are pretty minimal though anyway. I've never once had a phone go bad. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen though, but if it did then just use the method above ;-)"

Or anything else to do with them. Before I got this G2, I had a galaxy s1, galaxy s2, galaxy s3, galaxy s4, and I've messed about with the note series too. The methods for rooting, custom recovery installing, and flashing ROMs on them are exactly the same for every single one of them pretty much, so I'm pretty much an expert with them. I've done a huge number of them for other people as well as my own phones.  Been there, done that, got the T-shirt on any situation or problem you could ever encounter on a Samsung phone.  So I've gone from being an expert on Samsung, to a noob on LG lol... I'm getting there though, I've got my G2 exactly how I want it now. :)"

The thing is though, that the G2 is already such a high specced device that there isn't a huge amount to gain by upgrading to the G4, or any current flagship for that matter."
lgg2,3722lo,JeffIpsaLoquitor,1 point,Mon May 25 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"Excellent. I'm always up for getting good specs at good prices, thats why i'm going to wait until next year, as mentioned before."
lgg2,3722lo,someidiot1998,1 point,Mon May 25 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"A good move, yeah. The G2 is such a powerful phone that there's just no rush to upgrade anyway.

lgg2,3722lo,IranRPCV,3,Sun May 24 18:44:45 2015 UTC,Let's hope the G4 is better than the G3. The G3 is not a fast/smooth phone at all.
lgg2,3722lo,knuckles1978,2,Sun May 24 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"Same. I too recently got a (brand new) G2. Performance is awesome, the screen is awesome, the camera is great and OIS really makes a big difference, and the battery life is in a totally different league compared to any other smartphone I've ever owned, and I've owned my fair share of smartphones.  It was an amazing phone when it was released, and it's still an amazing phone now. The G2 is of such high specs already that there's not a huge amount to gain by upgrading to any current flagships."
lgg2,3722lo,IranRPCV,1 point,Sun May 24 19:54:51 2015 UTC,I totally agree with this
lgg2,3722lo,anonbrah,2,Sun May 24 23:14:38 2015 UTC,"My wife has a G2, and we both agree with your evaluation of the phone.  However, I have a G3, and I wouldn't trade with her.  I have never had the overheating issues that some claim.  I find that the camera is even better than the one in the already very good G2."
lgg2,3722lo,Roph,3,Sun May 24 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"How do you find the battery life on the G3? That was probably the main issue that there was with it. There was a lot of people saying that the battery life was nowhere near as good as it was on the G2. I consistently get 7 hours of SOT from a full charge, and that's with an hour or two of music streaming from Google play music also. WiFi or Mobile data permanently on, location permanently on, brightness at 50% which is fairly bright.  Reading the battery life that people were getting with the G3 is the main thing that makes me want to skip the G3 and get a G4 for my next phone, because I've been hearing good things about the battery on the G4 also. I doubt it's as good as the G2 either though."
lgg2,3722lo,vampirepomeranian,2,Sun May 24 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"Including commuting time, I am gone for work around 11 to 12 hours per day, and I almost always have 20 to 30 % battery left when I get home, including use of mobile data always on and Bluetooth during the drive.  I usually put the screen brightness on auto, but at 100% when I am actively viewing videos.  I find the battery recharges quickly - about an hour from 20%, using the stock charger.  I am still on Kitkat 4.4.2, unrooted.  I have the D851 on T-Mobile.  I was planning on getting a second battery, but I haven't needed to.  I have found GPS uses battery faster, but I can use usb charging in the car.  If I were to use GPS constantly on long hikes, I would probably get the spare battery."
lgg2,3722lo,tl2horse,2,Sun May 24 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"The camera sensor itself is identical across the G2 and G3, its the same Sony module.  The only difference is the laser autofocus on the G3, which trumps the G2 by a mile - as well as a nicer flash IIRC.  Otherwise they're identical :)"
lgg2,3722lo,JeffIpsaLoquitor,2,Sun May 24 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"The G2 and G3 have literally the same camera though. The G3 focuses with its laser, but otherwise takes the same photos.  The G3 basically is a slightly larger G2. The only differences are Snapdragon 801 (overclocked 800), 2.5K or 2560x1440 display, more RAM (some markets only), and removable back / SD slot."
lgg2,3722lo,tl2horse,2,Sun May 24 23:36:43 2015 UTC,A phone ahead of its time which has aged well.  Reviews of all the new flagships plus their price just makes me want to keep my G2 even longer.

lgg2,3722lo,nnotserPx,1 point,Mon May 25 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"I assume it was because the phone attracts dirt in between the gap, which makes the adhesive useless. What I did was lift up the screen with a spudger, put some super glue on the corner of a paper and slid it in there. Used binder clips to clamp it down while it dried.      Did this for all four sides and now it's good."

lgg2,370ggn,richc3,1 point,Sat May 23 18:50:27 2015 UTC,I'd say it's not worth the update unless you leap frog to a newer iteration of it (not likely unless you get a custom rom). The earlier ones can be rather buggy in terms of memory issues and alike.

Performance is 10/10, battery life is great, I can easily get 6 hours of screen on time (but I don't play any games, I mainly use Sync for Reddit, Facebook Messenger, Spotify and Youtube), I might even be able to reach 8 hours if I used the phone from morning to evening, but I usually get 6 hours of SoT in 36-48 hours.  Didn't have any bugs so far, and Lollipop is mostly well designed, my father has a G2 still on KitKat and unless I had to, I couldn't use it, because it's fugly.  I only have one complaint, but I'm not sure if it's Lollipop's fault (since my previous phone on LP had no such issue) is that auto-brightness (or adaptive brightness, I have no idea which one does LG use) seems pretty shitty, so bad that I'll probably have to download Lux or something like that."

The link you posted says it's for the F320 model?! *Edit:* I saw the post detailing instructions to get it working on D800, but I don't know if it'll work on D802.  I'm interested in trying it if it does, but what's been holding me back from installing lollipop is all the reports of substantially worse battery life. But I've got full backups, so suppose there's no harm in me giving it a go.  I've already posted in here about the awesome battery life I've been getting with cloudyG2 KK. A couple of days ago I took my phone off charge, it was fully charged. Brightness was set on manual at 50% all day, I did approximately 1.5 hours of Google Play Music streaming, and also 5 hours of screen on usage, and a few 5 or 10 minute calls. WiFi and location left on all day, and I still had 47% battery left at the end of the day. I couldn't believe it. It's just impossible for me to kill the battery in a day. I constantly get between 7 and 8 hours of screen on usage from a full charge. The only battery saving tool I use is greenify."

Without a drive letter, the recovery software can't treat it as a drive.  Thus, the need to root the phone.  That, I believe, allows Windows to see it more like a USB drive.  At least that's my understanding, anyway.  All are welcome to correct any misconceptions I might have.  Anyway, I'll surely follow up here if it works."
lgg2,36ryv8,epsys,2,Thu May 21 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"MTP is a virtualization of the filesystem, which on most android phones is a journalized system using ext4 or sometimes ext3. It's conceivable old entries would still be available, but that would also be dependent on the flash-wear-levelling-algorithm implemented, and also on whether you have encryption enabled.  IMO, due to the limited free-space flash storage available on most phones, the odds of recovery are quite low, even with a journaled, ""i'm not rewriting new data in the same place"" filesystem like FAT32 on a physical spinning drive, which actually improved your chances of finding the old data un-written-over"

I rooted my phone but I don't use any battery saving app (no Greenify or Amplify or anything), I have a friend who bought his new G2 a couple days after me, and he has the same battery life as me, so getting 6 hours of screen on time is nothing special, seeing some other posts it might not even be that good, but it's good enough for me, if I used it all day from morning to evening I might even hit 7 or 8 hours of screen on time, but I've never used it that much.  Edit: I just realized that I almost always check the battery stats after I hit 75%, and I always reach that after 2 hours of screen on time, so by simply multiplying it by 4 I'm pretty sure I could get close to 8 hours of screen on time, maybe even more."

lgg2,36ns22,mindbleach,-7,Thu May 21 16:55:47 2015 UTC,"Like hell. It forces you to have another system button, which only duplicates the long-press function of the Home key. It fucks up the LG Keyboard. It deletes all lock-screen apps.   Lollipop is awful in the same way every forced UI change is awful. Skip it."
lgg2,36ns22,sharjil333,4,Thu May 21 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"Uh, just go into settings and customize how you want the buttons. You can keep just the main three if you want and the long-press still works."
lgg2,36ns22,mindbleach,-2,Thu May 21 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"No I can't and no it doesn't.   The app-switching Square button is unremovable. The only way to pare down to three buttons is to remove the Option button, which should not be optional.   Long-pressing Home (which is now a meaningless Circle) does not open the app-switching screen. It opens an overlay which contains a Search link, and all that link does is open Google.com on the default browser. Even that overlay has been bodged - it used to contain more options, and it used to be swipe-activated, and its Search option used to open a Siri knockoff.   And none of this addresses the keyboard ""update."" They removed the dedicated comma button to make the spacebar bigger than it needs to be. Swiping is now squirrelly as hell. Which letters you begin and end on have little bearing on which three words are suggested. Three. Not the scrollable list of guesses from before. Just swiping the word ""Lollipop"" is a huge pain in the ass."
lgg2,36ns22,sharjil333,4,Thu May 21 12:43:57 2015 UTC,"If you long press the app-switch button you get the settings function. So you can still get all four functions with three buttons. They just changed which button you need to long press and which function it performs.   The long press Home button takes me to Google Now, maybe you don't have it enabled.  Also I'd recommend Google keyboard over LG for sure."
lgg2,36ns22,mindbleach,0,Thu May 21 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"LG Keyboard was superior until LG fucked it up for no benefit whatsoever. The same damn thing happened to the camera app on the Droid 2  - it was great, I updated, it was garbage.  I'm not even going to bother looking for an old APK. I'm just going to roll back to Kitkat or flash Cyanogenmod."
lgg2,36ns22,jesusice,4,Thu May 21 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"It forces you to have another system button, which only duplicates the long-press function of the Home key.   Yet, the dedicated menu key is not redundant?"
lgg2,36ns22,mindbleach,-2,Thu May 21 14:30:31 2015 UTC,"No! It isn't! It's literally the only guaranteed mode of interaction that users have with a program, aside from touching onscreen elements. Now every app is going to require some wiggle magic bullshit to make a menu appear, or else they're going to have a menu button onscreen at all times. The entire fucking point of the dedicated Menu button was to PREVENT redundancy."
lgg2,36ns22,jesusice,3,Thu May 21 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"Well, while I disagree with you I certainly admire your passion. Coming from a Galaxy Nexus to the G2 I've always hated the menu key. It has always been wasted space. I've never needed a menu key and even if I did use it there's a high chance that it would do nothing at all. This has always been the case with the menu key. I've had Android phones since 1.5 and it has always been a gamble what, if anything, the menu key does.  The recents key is perfect. It's intuitive and streamlines the user experience. Holding the home key, IMO, is not and does not. For me the lollipop update has upgraded my opinion of the G2 from mediocre to pretty alright."
lgg2,36ns22,mindbleach,0,Thu May 21 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you can use a browser without relying on the Menu key. The amount of screen space you'd have to sacrifice for an always-on tab bar is massive, especially in landscape orientation.   I've never seen an app where the Menu key does anything besides bring up a menu."
lgg2,36ns22,jesusice,2,Thu May 21 14:56:45 2015 UTC,I use Chrome Beta. It auto hides the tab bar if you scroll down any.
lgg2,36ns22,mindbleach,0,Thu May 21 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"It's not the hiding, it's the showing. You have to scroll up every time you want to switch tabs - a wiggly magic bullshit gesture."

Pageplus customer support was generally polite and helpful. I did have issues with their website and payments. I couldn't update my CC with a new expiration date for a few months (it completely bugged out the autopay feature). CS was very helpful and I always felt like they were doing their best to solve my issue though...even when they couldn't.  BYO Wireless is a completely different story and was a nightmare to port out from.  When I decided to change from BYO Wireless to another carrier it read like one of the nightmare Comcast posts you read here on reddit.  Ultimately, I had to file an FCC complaint against them for refusing to port my number because they kept refusing my new carriers port request for 3 weeks and each time cited some different BS reason (wrong account number, wrong address, wrong password) and would just simply recycle the reasons over the course of 3 weeks and numerous port requests...  They did this for 3 weeks straight until my account expired. The last time I spoke with them on the phone their CS supervisor tried to tell me that didn't have to respond to my next port request for 7 days (which isn't correct according to the FCC website). Sadly the way the whole process works, you're pretty powerless to do something if the company just wants to be difficult so I just decided it was easier to get a new number but I still have a pending FCC complaint against them."

Going back to stock KitKat worked for me.    But, before doing any of the stuff I explained here, you could try and contact the customer service. I know it isn't the preferred way if you want your phone working again within a few hours, but if you've updated to Lollipop via the official way and have not been messing with it, they should help you solve the problem (in my opinion, at least). Be sure that before you do this, you should still back-up your internal storage.  Alternatively, you can try a factory reset. This might work, (little side note: It didn't work for me) But be sure to do as I said: Copy your internal storage files!    Using a factory reset, you will be losing all your installed apps, but that's something you're just gonna have to deal with. Maybe you can try using the LG PC Suite to back-up your apps+appdata (I'm not sure if it's available in the US.. You should Google it and see what you can find).    Last but not least, this is only some advice. I can not tell you if it will work at all, because computers/smartphones/pretty much every electronic device are weird objects. Besides, I've got another model. I can't try any of this stuff on an LS980. Performing a factory reset should be pretty safe, but manually flashing the stock ROM requires attention and following instructions carefully.

IPhone 5 takes better low light pictures, even my droid x takes better, but darker pictures in low light. Wtf lg"

There were many poor design choices such as in the dialer, the favourites tab was too long to fit the word in, so it either elided or put the 's' underneath. You could tell it was a rushed OS as it had virtually no polish. When wifi doesn't connect to the internet properly, you get ""Network is not respond from internet"". Why couldn't they hire some translators if they were going to ship internationally? It's mostly UI issues, but also capabilities such as the camera.

However, upon some further research it seems that this is an issue with upgrading to the 39A modem--I didn't do my due diligence and make sure that all sensors were working correctly after upgrading. If you get that sorted out, it should be fine. Volumes are low. Like, super-low. Everything is maxed in the software, but I can't hear notifications or ringing if my phone's in my pocket, especially if there's even a small amount of background noise. And my alarms are quieter enough that I almost slept through it one morning... this is something that I'm actively researching at the moment, so I'll report back if I find anything specific. Every so often, the keyboard-selection popup appears when typing. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind it, and I have a hairline scratch on the face of my phone which could very well be the cause. A very minor issue if it is coming from the OS.   Other that that, everything is a gravy.  E: Oh, one other thing that has issues would be the Adaptive Brightness setting... but again, I believe that's a sensor issue.

lgg2,36fcsi,no_4,2,Mon May 18 23:16:51 2015 UTC,I have one of these. I like the feeling of these and it hasn't broken yet even though I dropped it a couple times. I do have a thick case with a raised lip.  Only caveat I would mention is your current case might not be able to fit the phone after you put on the tempered glass cover. Your phone will get thicker! Also edges don't lie completely flat (LG G2 curves a little around the edges) but works for me since my case covers the edges.  I would not go back to a normal screen cover and I think the tempered glass gives a little more protection than those plasticky ones.
lgg2,36fcsi,minimoss,2,Tue May 19 02:37:05 2015 UTC,Great tip thanks ordered the Spartan glass and a new usb cable for 5.50. Hopefully the screen protector works with my case.

I don't know what can happen to the screen but you can always replace those problems via warranty. All LG G2 still have manufacturer warranty because they launched Aug 2013. Ask for the invoice of the original seller and check if that has the IMEI and/or SERIAL NO.  Get the phone with original box and acessories and check if it doesn't have any more damage so the warranty guys don't refuse to repair the screen.

lgg2,36ba5p,AGuyNamedGreg,1 point,Mon May 18 04:59:59 2015 UTC,your phone compresses the picture to fit within the 600kB or 1MB limit.  carrier also reencodes audio to 24kbps on the back end no matter the MMS size.  which makes annoying for sending quality ringtones to friends.  probably voluntary on behalf of carrier to keep RIAA off their back
lgg2,36ba5p,epsys,1 point,Mon May 18 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"Isn't sending videos via MMS expensive as hell? But as another user said above, it's probably the carrier's compression. When I send videos with Whatsapp, they get compressed to like 3 MBs with a size of 320x240."

lgg2,36an3d,AGuyNamedGreg,1 point,Mon May 18 03:08:37 2015 UTC,here.  The instructions are pretty simple. But this erases everything on your phone so you might want to put your pictures onto your computer.

lgg2,369rzd,Z91www,2,Sun May 17 21:49:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! Looking around I think this one seems the most apt for my situation
lgg2,3690q3,cicciaebona,3,Sun May 17 10:04:11 2015 UTC,"1) I like its build. Its not metal nor glass, it's the same kind of plastic that comes with your S3. Any phone will break if you drop it face down or high enough so this one isn't exeption. Considering you will buy a case and a screen protector you will not have problems with damaging the device with normal use.  2) It's hard to disassemble the phone because it has sealed back. But I've seen videos of people showing and demonstrating how you can do that. Watch some videos of that and see by yourself. What can be easy for me can be hard for you and vice verça.  3) Playing WWE Immortals (stock lollipop 5.0.2 without any custom kernel, just root) the phone gets really hot so it means it uses its full potential and I get aroung 3.5 hours of SOT (all that playing the game, I'm quite addicted to it). Without that heavy usage and maybe lowering the screen brightness this phone can easily get 5 hours. I've seen battery champs reaching 8 hours while watching video with low light... You can expect surely more than 3 hours, 4 hours with normal use, 5 hours with less intensive use and more if you tweak the phone someway.  4) It's very easy to root any version of the phone. Just run an automated script and you're good to go. But it's kinda hard when it comes to flashing rom/kernel/recovery. The phone has different bootloaders and they are locked so they had to be modded. The phone also has many versions depending on the region so it's very confusing to know exactly what you can flash without risking to brick the device. It has a solution for any kind of brick but the really hard brick involves opening the phone and shorting some capacitors in the main board so I'm sure anyone would not want to experience having to do that.  Hope I've helped."
lgg2,3690q3,diogofd8,1 point,Sun May 17 12:32:16 2015 UTC,On mobile right now so this will be a little short. I came from a GS3 a year and a half ago and couldn't be happier the GS3 broke extremely easy the GPS was okay and it's battery was nowhere near as good. The only two complaints with G2 is stick lollipop sticks it runs hot and has horrible battery life but with a ROM I get 5 SOT if you don't use the screen the idle drop is like 1% an hour. No expandable memory kinda sucks. The headphone jack went bad on mine so if I move with headphones in the music will stop. I got a Bluetooth adapter to remedy this and now I hardly notice. I love the buttons on the back and double tap to wake also wireless charging in the Verizon variant is great. I use a slim case on mine I believe it's an incipio feather case it's rely thin and do far I've yet to break it.

lgg2,3690q3,cas-v86,1 point,Tue May 19 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"My usage pattern is very similar to yours, I get 6 hours of SoT easily, without messing around with Greenify or things like that. Rooting is really easy, there's a one click method, it's done in less than 5 minutes. I'm on Lollipop and it's very stable, haven't had a single issue, I think it's only buggy if you do a dirty flash, if you do a clean flash (everything is erased from the phone during flash) you probably won't have any issues."
lgg2,3690q3,Pr3no,0,Thu May 21 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"My G2 has a defective headphone jack and GPS rarely gets signal.

I use a cheap second skin type case and have dropped the phone a few times with no cracked screen so far.  Overall, I'm disappointed with the G2 hardware.  If you move around while having the headphones plugged in, it's very annoying."

But if ever messing around, you can update TWRP with ""Flashify"" from the Play Store.    call quality is awful.   Make sure to go to Google Settings > Search & Now > Voice > ""OK Google"" Detection > From Any screen = OFF.  Otherwise, it makes the user's voice muffled when calling.

Overall, xposed on KK had better battery life but I'll eventually get xposed on mine and it will probably be better on lollipop. Standby is certainly much better on L for me."

I originally upgraded without factory reset, and battery life was absolute shit.  Then I reset and things got a lot better.. but have been progressively getting worse again over the last 3 weeks or so.  Some things I have noticed:   Overheating seems to be happening a lot when I shut the screen off with an app open.  If I have Facebook open or something, and shut my screen off, my phone will start getting hot in my pocket.  If I go back to the home screen and shut the screen off, it gets better.  I mention FB because that one seems to cause it most often. When I am away from Wifi, it will get hot. Adding to that, if I have a poor cell signal, it will get even hotter.   I am really pissed off at Verizon (or LG?) for releasing this update in its current state.  It obviously was not tested very thoroughly."

Settings.db Global.  Name.  Scroll down to tether_dun_required.  Click on value and update value. It will highlight 1 click it and change it to 0.  Click to save on upper right corner that little arrow and click commit twice i believe till it says change is made.    Turn on your data and hotspot and you are done. The value will probably change back to 1 every time you restart your g2 so just repeat above steps and make sure value is on zero. It only takes about 10 seconds to do all of the above so its not such a nuisance.

Have no idea how to ""save"" games other than backing up the apps and their data.  The safest way to avoid a brick (and I hard bricked going from LP back to a nandroid backup of Cloudy; cost $50 to fix it) is to do an LG Flashtool install of KK for your variant. Detailed instructions are on XDA in the G2 general section.  After you've got KK back on your phone, you can use Towelroot or Stumproot to root, along with Autorec for KK to install TWRP. After that I flash Blastagator's TWRP immediately because I""m paranoid about the white lines issue with JDI panels and Blastagator's recovery auto-detects your panel type. After you've done all this you can go ahead and install Cloudy, being sure to flash the appropriate baseband for your variant before flashing the ROM itself."

On a side note, I did the upgrade, ran the LG backup utility afterward then did a factory reset before restoring from the backup file as most on this sub have advised. It seems to be running good, and so far I dont see the battery life problems that so many others have complained about. My only complaint is I cant auto rotate the home screen anymore even though I have it checked under the settings. This only happens under the home screen for whatever reason.

lgg2,35w7x6,melikeybacon,1 point,Thu May 14 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"Your baseband is responsible for WiFi and mobile data signals.  Go to XDA, find a different baseband, and flash through recovery. First try to find one which is specifically for your region, but ones which aren't specifically for your region may also work.   Before you flash basebands, take a backup of your EFS partition. Then if you have any problems you can just restore the backup. You can either do it manually, or I'm sure there are also apps which will do it for you.  You'll obviously need to be rooted with custom recovery to do any of this.  Edit: actually, before you try any of this, the first thing you should try is backing up your photos etc, and doing a factory reset."

lgg2,35w7x6,knuckles1978,1 point,Thu May 14 06:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm open to learning something new, but as far as I'm aware, the Android baseband does not control the wifi. Older phones may have bundled these responsibilities into the baseband, but recent phones do not.  The firmware for a wifi radio, while technically (but not typically) called a ""baseband,"" is usually flashed directly to the wifi chip itself at some point in the manufacturing process, and not changed when flashing an android baseband.  If you have any reputable sources that say otherwise, I'd love to read them."
lgg2,35w7x6,PyroNavi,1 point,Thu May 14 08:51:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I've only had a G2 for a couple of weeks now, but with my galaxy S4, I would sometimes flash a ROM that was foreign, and because it changed my baseband my WiFi signal became extremely weak, even when I was within a few metres of my wireless router, and I wasn't getting nearly the speeds that I should have been. To fix it, I downloaded a baseband which was specifically for my country, flashed it, and my WiFi signal was instantly at full bars and working perfectly at full speed again.  I did this many times. Also, flashing a baseband specifically for your region can fix bad battery drain problems on mobile data."
lgg2,35w7x6,knuckles1978,1 point,Thu May 14 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"That is compelling evidence, assuming that you didn't flash anything else along with the baseband, but it doesn't directly demonstrate that the wifi is controlled by the baseband. A bad baseband could cause many issues (for example, the phone could boot loop, but this does not mean that the baseband controls the boot process).  Don't get me wrong, it's certainly possible that you are correct, or that we both are (depending on the phone in question). I'm trying to find a definitive source for this information, but nothing good has come up yet."

lgg2,35vhl2,dolmaface,2,Wed May 13 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're rooted and have a custom recovery, so that's what I'm going to assume.   Download the 39A bootstack (not modem) from here, and Micromod's LG-based Lollipop ROM here. You'll also need the ""normal"" gapps from here.   Transfer all of those to your phone, then after you've backed up all your apps and stuff, reboot into recovery. Make a backup, then wipe everything except internal storage. After that, flash the files in this order: bootstack, ROM, gapps. If that's successful, reboot your phone and you should be on LP.   I dabbled with like 3-4 different AOSP based roms (both 5.0 and 5.1 variants) but they all were giving me issues one way or another (no gyro, very slow charging, etc), so I came back to the Micromod ROM. However, your experience may vary, so if you do want to try one, the best one I used by far was Temasek. Before flashing, you need to make sure all of your sensors (gps, gyro, proximity, data signal) are working exactly as you need them to, then just full wipe and flash as normal. Just remember that you need to come from an LG-based rom first."

I got the lollipop update this morning, (started the update at 100%, it was charging overnight) and the battery life isn't bad on my end. I would have to give the edge to KitKat with regard to battery life at this point in time, but the difference on my G2 seems to be relatively slight. Even with the fluctuating cases of battery life issues that have been going around, I feel like Lollipop has a much more refined feel to it. My G2 feels almost like an entirely new phone just with the software update. KitKat was pretty decent on the G2, but I'm enjoying my experience with lollipop so far."

(These are good indicators, but I have seen exceptions before, like I had a fairly long and fairly thin cable that gave me 2000mA current all the time). So there's no guarantees of anything.  Best thing to do is download an app ('charging report' is a good one) which tells you what current the battery is currently charging at.  Remember... If you use an app to measure and compare cables, wait until the phone has been on charge for ten minutes or so with the screen off before you take your measurement.

After which, if you decide to experiment with Lollipop, do a Nandroid backup of your CloudyG2 and flash the stock rom via flashable zips. You could easily revert back to Cloudy if you decide that you don't like it.  I always stuck with stock or stock-based roms because the camera implementation is just better on them."

I loved being able to just nudge the phone while it was on the table to see if I had any notifications. Pull the phone out of your pocket and hold it up to look at it, boom, screen activates. The battery life is great because of the AMOLED screen with said software. Of all the things I enjoyed about that phone, the notifications are what I miss the most.

I pop in my T-Mobile Sim and switch the network mode in cm to LTE (which includes gsm). And boom LTE works, amazing speeds. Sometimes the phone likes to hang onto edge and jump into LTE minutes later, totally forgetting what hspa is. When you get or make a call, the phone drops to hspa usually, sometimes edge and the phone loves to stay on edge afterwards. Sms send super fast even on cm roms, where Verizon would use 1x for sending and it would take years to send. If you use a stock lg ROM, make sure it has APN support for T-Mobile, otherwise I'm not sure it will work. Micromods LP extreme 1.1 worked fine on T-Mobile. Good luck OP and if you have any other questions feel free to ask me.  P.S the T-Mobile ipv6 APN works too, and I can confirm that ipv6 works."

However, LG managed to make everything slightly worse. The lock screen is fugly, the settings are confusing, the notification sounds are horrible. I could go on for ages.

lgg2,35jb54,diogofd8,3,Sun May 10 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"It's pretty difficult to brick this phone (at least true brick). I remember seeing a post around XDA saying this phone is now unbrickable because of the methods available to give it life again. Others can feel free to correct me, but I think the worry of bricking is pretty much nil if you make sure to flash items specific to your device (obviously don't flash things that aren't for your specific D802 phone). I'd suggest looking around the XDA LG G2 forums for your specific device. In terms of versions, it's generally good practice to keep your recovery updated (which could be the different versions you're referencing). I'd just install TWRP or your recovery of choice and that should be enough. I've never had (nor heard of) an issue that erased the recovery from flashing a rom or something similar.  I believe the camera mod you're referencing is Xcam (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2548974). It's for STOCK BASED ROMS only, so you can't use it with AOSP. Some AOSP roms may have similar abilities built in, but I can't confirm that from my personal experience. That XDA page should give you a better idea at what to do and how to use it.   Hope this helped even a little!"

lgg2,35jb54,tempusers,1 point,Mon May 11 06:43:02 2015 UTC,"If you take a rom for a different version of the phone, that could brick your phone. But probably just a soft-brick that you can undo. Also what can cause bootloops etc is when you need a certain bootstack for a custom rom to flash, but you are on the wrong one. But that is usually explained in the threads and it tells you to flash ""flash this baseband before flashing this rom"" and you are fine.  There is bumped and lokied versions of TWRP. Read up on that. It is about the exploit that is used in the version of TWRP in order to gain access."

You'll get the update eventually but if you are in a rush you can try via LG PC Suite or by flashing a Lollipop rom but that last option voids your warranty if they discover you did that.

You may also have to remove the lens from the case of the phone to work on it, so you don't scratch the rest of the phone.  When they sell it as having a sapphire camera lens cover, you assume it will be scratch proof, or can only be scratched by diamond.  Whereas in actual fact, lots of people have scratched camera lenses negatively affecting their pictures. Lenses which have scratched very easily.

When I create the MMS (either by just adding the 2nd number, or by selecting everyone in that group), it says that it sends to everyone in the group. The only one that received it was the other phone, and not the Pinger number. But, I think that's more a problem with Pinger not accepting MMS messages) than with the messaging app itself.  Even with I look at all of the threads, this one shows 2 people in this particular  thread. I used 2 apps. The stock messaging app on the G2, and Google's Messenger on my wife's N4, since the stock messages crashes when I try to send a message to more than one person on it.

lgg2,35d4mc,ESCEW2,1 point,Sat May 9 04:05:22 2015 UTC,Most roms based on CM12 for G2 have the double tap to wake feature. You just have to enable it in the settings.

LG One Click Root v 1.3 is the what I ended up using and it worked like a charm.   I feel the same way as you about the stock experience, but I am finding things each day that are sort of nice to have: custom ring tone vibration patterns, hiding the pattern lock until you touch the screen, etc. I'm slowly accepting the compromise. I'll probably check things out in a few months once cm12 and 12.1 builds are more stable. Coming from a Nexus 5 I'm not willing to give up this camera quality, knock-on, or ir capabilities right now."
lgg2,35d4mc,mosesman86,2,Sat May 9 11:20:32 2015 UTC,I ran CM12 nightly for a while on an LS980 and for the most part it worked well. Could never figure out how to get Quick Remote to work or get the GPS to track (admittedly these were probably my own ineptitude more than anything) which caused me to switch back to stock. But other than that the nightly was very stable. I may have crashed 3-4 times over the month that I used it (updated about every 3 days).

The ability to search for local businesses right from the phone app is amazing and I really really miss it.

Root that with Stump Root (brute force) Use Autorec to install TWRP Flash latest TWRP from Blastgator Flash the ROM SaberSunset v2.1.1 Enjoy close to Nexus 5.0.2    It looks like a lot of work but it isn't. There aren't any really stable 5.1 builds out and a link to SaberSunset 2.1.1 can be hard to find in the thread but it has been the most stable ROM ever and it isn't packed with extra features and other crap. I'm on Resurrection Remix right now and sometimes my screen won't turn on or I get FCs. I'll probably go back to SS 2.1.1 this weekend.

And when I'm on the lockscreen the phone tells me I have No service on the top left where you'd usually see T-Mobile even when I do have service. Any suggestions?
lgg2,35d4mc,firstking,2,Thu May 14 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"I occasionally get the No Service message also, but not all the time.  I've never actually run into a problem, I always have service regardless of what it says in the corner so I've learned to ignore it.  The echo is a common problem on a lot of AOSP-based ROMs but it doesn't happen every time.  I bet if you told the person to call you right back it wouldn't echo anymore.  I'd have to say, the echo that happens sometime is probably the worst bug I've run into with AOSP ROMs, they're otherwise pretty stable.  With that said, I haven't done much research on it since I tend to forget about it as soon as I hang up with someone lol so look around XDA in the G2 forum and see if anyone has a fix for it yet.

lgg2,35cs6h,tjberens,2,Sun May 10 05:18:49 2015 UTC,Rooting and installing TWRP doesn't do anything to fix anything. What stock version did you try and was it a ROM or did you flash with LG Tools? Did you try entering ##UPDATE# into the dialer to force an activation? That can sometimes sort out data issues. I'm assuming you don't have device protection with Sprint?

lgg2,35cbj0,ManSore,2,Sat May 9 09:07:51 2015 UTC,"Just replaced my OPO with the G2 for the same exact reason. Would not recommend OPO to anyone. The G2 is a great side step for 1/2 the price (USD). What I miss most from the OPO is the larger storage. Aside from that...  G2 is easier to handle. Vibration is actually(!) vibration and not just noise. Battery is almost as large with a smaller display so lifetime should be similar if not better. OIS hardware so that's a plus. Much smaller bezels. Flash is much brighter.   OPOs speakers are definitely louder. Front facing camera definitely better due to wide angle lens. Ability to choose navigation buttons from on screen to hardware was great.  I already got used to the back buttons on the G2 and already prefer it over traditional buttons...aside from accessing recovery mode and taking screenshots..(which can be solved via software implementation easily).  UNFORTUNATELY! OPO has the manufacturer defect of ghost touches and yellow tinted display.....and LG G2 has manufacturer defects of ghost touches, dead zones on digitizer, and the display could fail under circumstances i'm not too sure about..(vertical black lines from top to bottom of the screen appear and is permanent damage.)  So far the G2 has been great. I JUST settled with the Resurrection Remix Lollipop 5.0.2 ROM after flashing VANIR and Cloudy. Battery life is great. Sound is a little low which can be fixed by Viper4Android. The phone does tend to get relatively warm compared to the OPO."

Unless you are having problems with the OPO, I really don't see the point of getting rid of it for the options you provided. The OPO is superior to the g2 in every way except the size could be a preference thing. And if I remember correctly, you would pretty much be side stepping if you chose the 7a except I would say software wise, the OPO beats all other phones on the market."
lgg2,35cbj0,ltmcbaggin,1 point,Sat May 9 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"I used someone's OPO and would definitely say the camera is better in that than it is on my g2 despite the g2 having ois. Cannot really comment on battery life other than almost every review puts the OPO as having better battery life.  As for the find 7a, that notification is slick and fast charging is nice but having a battery that lasts more than one day should be more important than charging fast but to each his own. Having 64gb of storage on the OPO should be enough but I guess if you need more, an SD card would be nice."

lgg2,35b8b1,lazykryptonian,2,Fri May 8 19:18:59 2015 UTC,Cloudy ROMs need KK bootloader which starts with ZVC. CM and CM based ROMs require JB bootloader that can be loki exploited (not sure of correct term) which is ZV8. ZVA patched loki.

What's the best option to update the firmware? She'll be ok with just the stock firmware and I don't imagine AT&T will just let me update to the latest firmware without being on their service...

So assuming the phone is unlocked (and I don't know if Verizon phones are unlocked by default) you should be able to pop in a sim card and get voice and decently fast data.   However, I'm not sure how much support there is for your 4G bands in Europe.  So you may be forced to live with decently fast data instead of high speed data.   Of course if you aren't certain if the phone is unlocked, you need to figure that out first and then get it unlocked if necessary."

Hmm it may be possible for you to update to stock lollipop through att's support site.. I'd try searching terms like ""how to install LG g2 lollipop update at&t"" I think I remember reading somewhere that one of the U.S.  providers has some sort of computer (pc)  based program to upgrade the phone...    Honestly, unless there's something specific you're after, seven to eight times out of ten, you're fine with stock and just rooting and using xposed, that will get you most features you'd get from a custom rom and being on stock you'll keep awesome battery life, awesome camera, etc.. You lose battery life sometimes significantly and pretty much lose good camera going to aosp based roms like cyanogen etc. I've tried virtually everything out there for my D800 and have always come back to stock (cloudystock) mostly for battery life and stability."

I believe the proximity sensor plays an integral part in it. If the sensor detects something it kills the digitizer, but if not, the digitzer stays awake.  It's the digitizer, and it's not a special one. The kernel may just lower the power to the digitizer? We could be completely over estimating how much battery the digitizer actually uses. It may be impossible to truly 'turn off' the digitizer at will.  I believe the other DTTW and gesture mods use the acceleromator which fucking annihilates battery life. It could also be that they have to use the camera as the proximity sensor on devices which don't have them like tablets.   in both cases, this kills the battery."

Try rooting, installing Xposed, installing G3 Tweaks Beta, turning off the Wake on Plug feature, and seeing if your phone responds the same way.  Additionally, see if you're still able to go into Download mode. If the phone won't stay off, I don't think you'll be able to.   Report back."

Stuck with stock ROM for about half a year before moving back to AOSP.  PA KK ROM until xposed worked for Lollipop,  now on Sabersunset with Renderkernel.  Battery lasts a long day, not much gaming. Mostly surfing the web on chrome that eats the battery. I can go 12-13 hours with 50-60% left, which includes redditing, checking work email,  whatsapping.  No major crashes or overheating issues. Physically there are a few dings in the side of the case and ""LG"" on the back fell off a year ago.   Phone runs perfectly fine and smoother than virtually all phones out right now, but this is because I run a tight ship on what I install etc. and runs in the background.  Setting all animation scales to 0.25x seems to help as well. A lot of my friends are already complaining their phones are running slowly, which is really due to the fact they install so much crap that runs in the background with their live wallpaper."

It has a few dings on the chrome rim on the front, but since I've used vinyl skins and glass screen protectors for most of its life, it actually still feels pretty new.

I dropped it a couple times and the last time it seemed to have taken out it's wireless charging capabilities.  Not a big deal to me really. Its knock on and knock off are more unpredictiable these days I am guessing that has something to do with the last time that I dropped it.  Lolipop is fine on it but it does have some strange behavior that requires a reboot every so often. Like half my icons will be missing for no reason and it becomes slugish. All in all its a good phone (one of my favorites ever). With that said though, I will be looking into replacing it come this December."

Aside from that little detail, its been great and I've even dropped it many times and aside form some minor scratches and the back letters falling off, its been great. Friends still are amazed at it's speed and the camera is still one of the best overall (the selfie flash is so unique and no other phone has it). I have no rush in upgrading to the G4, though I am certainly liking the leather back, but I will probably wait until the Note 5 comes out to make my decision."
lgg2,34rvre,FlyinEye,1 point,Tue May 5 17:20:26 2015 UTC,Had mine for over a year and I still love it. Only wish it had a removable SD card. I recently rooted it and flashed the kernel to Dorimanx now at 10.4 and I love it even more. Thought I had a charging issue but it turns out both my cables were bad. Replacement of said cables fixed it. I would buy one again.   Seemed to run a bit hot. The Dorimanx kernel has tons of settings including Max heat which I did turn down a bit.
lgg2,34rvre,vnlegend,1 point,Mon May 4 03:55:48 2015 UTC,"Battery got hot sometimes and the phone would randomly shut down or reboot itself about 4-5 times. One time the phone completely died despite being fully charged. I had to take out the backplate and unplug the battery for it to come back.  Anyway, everything's been fine except the battery's probably getting worse. I used to get 5+ hrs of SoT and now it's closer to 3.5 hrs. If it wasn't such a pain to remove and the replace the battery, I would've done so and be completely happy. I might just pay a shop to replace the battery some day.  Anyway, I would recommend unplugging the battery wire and plug it back in. This solved the whole overheating & rebooting issue.

It depends on what bands are used in your area.  No, its very snappy.  Yes, its well worth it at the going price today. ROMs are a huge factor for me. I hated the stock rom."
lgg2,34oh4b,srazul,1 point,Sun May 3 02:45:49 2015 UTC,little question. what is the last build number (eg 10b 10c) that is rootable? that's pretty much what i meant.
lgg2,34oh4b,r4ymonf,3,Sun May 3 05:29:11 2015 UTC,"All are. If you use Lollipop, you have to root from a PC, I think."
lgg2,34oh4b,robogo,4,Sun May 3 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"The G2 is one of the rare devices that are on the market for a long time (since 2013), and that can still compete with the most recent flagships. OK, no, it doesn't have some of the latest gimmicks and features, but it's still a very competent phone with a spectacular price-to-performance ratio. Plus, it got updated to Lollipop recently. I found literally nothing that can stump my LG. Not one app, game, anything.   Battery life is great. Of course, SOT is no measure for that because you can have 5 hrs SOT over the course of 10 hours, or 2-3 days. I can go for 48+ hours without a charge on a combined (data/Wi-Fi) connection.   Slowdown issues? None. Not one since day one.   Worth buying? Well I'd say it's definitely the phone to buy. Okay, its support cycle might be nearing the end, but this phone has great developer support for either stock based or AOSP/CM based ROMs."
lgg2,34oh4b,no_4,3,Sun May 3 10:36:36 2015 UTC,"1.)  I get about 6.5 hours SOT if at home (so not using GPS navigation, etc.).  That said the battery isn't (meant to be) user-replaceable, so it will depend on how old it is.  You know you can get brand new AT&T G2s for $190 on Ebay, right?  2.) Download stumproot to your phone - run it. All versions are rootable, LG didn't really try to lock things down seemingly. 3.) 2G - yes. LTE - yes.  3G - mostly.  It lacks one of the three bands that T-mobile uses for 3G.  If you're in an area that only uses that one 3G band, but has LTE anyway - doesn't matter.  If that area doesn't have LTE, you'll be stuck on 2G. I dunno how common that situation is.  4.) No 5.) It's the clear best value for most people.  a.) it was a well designed phone & b.) It was released with perfect timing - right after the last major update from Qualcomm.  And since then, Qualcomm hasn't advanced their chipsets much.    If it helps conceptually, it has the same internals as the Nexus 5.  Alternatively, you know the Galaxy S5, which until a month ago was the latest Galaxy right?  Well, the G2 has the exact same graphics chip, and almost the exact same CPU (just clocked 9.6% slower).  Until the G4 there wasn't even a clear upgrade to it.  Like, I kept looking at the ($500+) Note 4, but kept reading so many people who ended up going back to the G2, that it wasn't clear.     With ROM's being a contributing factor?    It's very well supported ROM-wise."

With the Lollipop update, the skin is MUCH better than KitKat which was really my biggest complaint.  Few phones can rival the battery life as well.  If you can live with a little worse battery and an average camera, I would hands down go with a 1st gen Moto X 32GB which can be had for under $200."

lgg2,34oh4b,anonbrah,12,Sun May 3 02:05:35 2015 UTC,The G2 is in a whole different category to the Moto E. Literally so much better in every way.  Moto E is a budget phone. The G2 is still very decent.

After updating to Lollipop, my phone usually doesn't make it until mid-afternoon without needing a charge.  For example, my phone has been off charge for about an hour & a half, and I'm sitting at 70% battery with under 15 minutes of screen time. According to my battery monitor, Android OS and Kernel are basically eating up the entire battery (each over 30%).

I used it somewhat sparingly throughout the day at work barring my lunch, so yeah, it was rare for it to be any lower than 60-70% unless I was using it more heavily. It was very uncommon for me to ever need to charge my G2 before evening.   I don't know what the hell Lollipop did, but the OS eats through the battery like crazy now."
lgg2,34obxl,Atranox,3,Sun May 3 17:58:35 2015 UTC,I like the Lollipop look and features but battery life is worse than before and sometimes it lags and the phone heats up.  Full factory reset didn't help.

Phone got really hot all of a sudden, then the screen sort of whited out, and then permanent lines.  You'll need a repair. HOWEVER, I've had yellow spots on my screen (a known G2 issue) on two different phones and I contacted support out of warranty to see what options I had. They said they'd cover the repair and shipping even without warranty since it's such a big issue. You could try your luck since your issue is a pretty debilitating one."

They aren't far apart, but the nexus has a somewhat better design and wireless charging. The roms for it tend to be a bit more stable as well. The battery is not great, but when I had mine it lasted all day under moderate use. The nexus is far better if roms are important to you.  As others say the g2 is nearly identical to the n5. However, the quality control appears to be a bit worse. You get the occasional screen issue or gps problem. But the battery really is better. Claims are that stock based roms have better battery life than aosp, but you would have to live with the horror that is lg stock Android.   I don't like the buttons being on the back. I've had it for months and I got used to them, but they're inconvenient if you have the phone face up on a table and want to change the volume."

With Metro-PCS you will have to call them and give them the new phones IMEI which can be found in the settings. Once they apply the LG's IMEI to your sim card you pop it in, restart your phone and you can do calls/texts.  You will have to make a new APN for Metro-PCS to get your data back, it's very simple and take about 5 minutes.  just google ""metro pcs apn settings""  The G2 is a pretty great phone, be sure to buy a TPU case and tempered glass screen protector (cheap on amazon) and you'll be set. it is the only phone of that quality for under $200."

Last year when I bought my first carrier unlocked phone it was really hard to figure out on my own so I'm glad to help out. I've come to find that AT&T unlocked phones are the most versatile if buying carrier branded. GSM phones are the way to go.   Metro will have to input the imei for you. I have 6 different phones I switch and metro was just to hard to deal with so I ended up buying an AT&T GoPhone sim because you can just throw it in any unlocked phone with no imei switching. Also since I only buy att unlocked phone I still get the android updates. (Metro will not receive any OTA updates on you phones, so your stuck with whAtever is on it when you buy it) my GoPhone sim is $60 a month and I get 4 gigs of 4gLTE then it steps down to 3G.   If you need any help setting up your phone pm me and I'll be glad to walk you through it.  The G2 is in my top three phones ever made it is a great epice of hardware.

Mine had a section that didn't register any touching and it was a hardware issue so I got a replacement under warranty. You automatically get 1 year manufacturer warranty from LG so use that if possible. My replacement has been working fine and I still use it.

lgg2,34ev9p,BLACKGUY981,3,Thu Apr 30 17:59:02 2015 UTC,Google towelroot and root it. Its an apk and takes few secs. After your g2 is rooted follow this.    Download sqlite debugger app and turn off your data and hotspot.  Open sqlite and go to browse apps. Scroll down to settings storage. Settings.db Global.  Name.  Scroll down to tether_dun_required.  Click on value and update value. It will highlight 1 click it and change it to 0.  Click to save on upper right corner that little arrow and click commit twice i believe till it says change is made.    Turn on your data and hotspot and you are done. The value will probably change back to 1 every time you restart your g2 so just repeat above steps and make sure value is on zero. It only takes about 10 seconds to do all of the above so its not such a nuisance.

Download the app called WiFi analyser and select a channel which has the least traffic on it.   Something else to try would be using 5Ghz instead of 2.4  And something else to try would be changing the baseband of your phone. That's probably the highest chance of being the problem actually. Look out a baseband that is specifically for your geographical region. Chances are that the upgrade has changed your baseband.  There's a few things for you to try. Personally though, I'm pretty sure that your phones baseband is the problem.  Good luck :)"

lgg2,34ag61,Shidell,3,Wed Apr 29 16:15:07 2015 UTC,Can you see the screen? Or is it all black? I had a similar problem once but the screen was completely black so i couldn't see anything. If you can see the screen it would be much easier.   I had the same issue with an old Galaxy my friend had broken. ADB and Fastboot didn't help anything and USB debugging was disabled. What did work was a program from the play store that I installed on the phone remotely. The app has a PC version to and when you attached the phone to the PC with a USB cable it showed the screen on the computer. I used that to enable USB Debugging.   Here is a link to the app  If you can see the screen you could use Something Like this and just plug and a mouse and re enable the USB debugging.

That would have put all the pictures on the internet automatically. Seems like a lot of work for something probably not worth saving. But if you can get it into recovery I believe that adb might come on by default.   I've had phones not be recognizable by adb while booted into the os before but work fine in recovery.  Have you maybe tried getting it into download mode to see if adb or anything will work.  That might be easier than getting into recovery. I don't know why they make it so difficult to get into recovery to actually recover your device sometimes.

Using a bad cable can massively slow down your charging.  Make sure your charger is rated at 1.8 amps too.    If all of that is fine I've got no idea why lollipop is messing it up for you and I'd note that I'm using cyanogenmod lollipop and having a great time with charging working fine :)

lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"I am in the same boat as you. I have the anker battery pack too and it charges at 300-400mA now whereas it used to be around 1500-1600. It's not the cable, it's the charger. My 30$ battery pack (2nd gen Anker 12000mA) is now worthless. Your cables look pretty good quality. I use the amazon cable on a regular basis. You need to get the original LG charger (1.8A) for good charging speeds at the moment. That is what I have been using after the update.   Also, I use amazon cable with LG charger and it works fine."
lgg2,34aep1,andylong42,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:02:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I actually do have one charger that charges at decent speeds 1200ma ish so that will do for now. Sounds like you know a lot more about these phones than me. Do you know of any apps or anything that can help improve my battery life? It seems that lollipop has also made my battery worse (Maybe a placebo Im not sure). My phone isn't rooted or anything and to be honest Ive never had any desire to do so but if I need to Im sure I could figure it out.
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"Rooting is something that I highly recommend. After rooting, install titanium backup from playstore and uninstall all the carrier apps (Bloatware). Install greenify, I use the paid version. It helps disable google apps from invoking wakelocks. Wakelocks are responsible for draining battery. Facebook is the biggest wakelock generator, make sure you disable it. I personally have only WhatsApp and Gmail enabled and I get amazing battery life."
lgg2,34aep1,Namtab,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:21:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies, Ill take a look into rooting."
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yea but Im long past the days of the original cable. I got my phone the day it came out, that cheap stock cable is long gone. I have since bought various high end cables all of which preformed flawlessly giving me the max 1.8A until lollipop came around changed everything. What is the point of this? The cables Im using are much higher quality than the stock."
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem which I never had on CM12. I'm sorry, but saying use the original charger doesnt really make sense or surely the charge issue would have been there with kitkat and CM12? I use several chargers/cables at home, work and in the car and they all worked perfectly well on CM12. Now I've returned to stock Lollipop, the battery drains faster than it charges in the car when using GPS. This is clearly a problem with this ROM.  Does anyone have any ideas?"
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,3,Thu Apr 30 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"Stock lollipop has code that checks for original charger being used. Some code from qualcomm fast charge has been incorporated in the new stock ROM. I have monitored the current that the phone takes using different chargers.   -2.1A 3rd party charger on Kitkat: 1500mA, lollipop 300mA  -1.8A LG charger on KitKat: 1500-1650mA, lollipop 1590-1610mA  -2.1A car charger on Kitkat: 1.2A, lollipop 250mA.   I am sure everyone is having the same issue but busy cribbing about it than looking into the details on what has changed. CM ROM does not have the fast charge code incorporated or does not check for type of charger. Same goes with KitKat."
lgg2,34aep1,capeorigins,2,Thu Apr 30 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"Upgraded to lollipop the other day and was wondering why it was charging so slowly. I was using my trusty touchpad charger (5.3V 2.0A) and it took 2 hours to get to 50%, I use the original charger and its charging full speed again at 1604 mA."
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:15:28 2015 UTC,Glad I'm not the only one who realized this.
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,2,Thu Apr 30 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yup Ive been testing since I posted this and this is exactly right. The same chargers that charged my phone at full speed on KitKat are slow as hell on Lollipop. The cable Im using is much higher quality than any stock garbage cable that Verizon or LG provided so Im wondering why they did this.   My car charger is the only thing that charges my phone at full speed on Lollipop. My 2.1A wall charger gets about 1000mah, Anker portable battery capable of 2.1A now charges at 300mah. What the fuck."
lgg2,34aep1,Namtab,3,Thu Apr 30 19:43:32 2015 UTC,I'll try to find a fix for this and post it as soon as I find it. It will take some digging into XDA threads. Maybe there is a root exploit or a package that can be deleted/disabled.
lgg2,34aep1,Blackspade50,2,Thu Apr 30 19:55:33 2015 UTC,"That would be fantastic. Please do post if you find a solution. This ""feature"" is absolutely killing me."
lgg2,34aep1,zibebo,2,Thu Apr 30 19:57:36 2015 UTC,Here is the solution. http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-g2/development/kernel-d801-tmo-g2-lollipop-30b-kernel-t3097932  This is modified stock kernel and it will fix the charging issue. This is for D801 model. If you are using other model make sure you find the correct one for your phone. You have to root and flash custom recovery for this stuff to work. I know it's not very convenient but that is how it works. People are seeing upto 1.8A of charging current with this kernel.

They want others to do the search for them. They do not want to read after a couple of comments on a thread on XDA and give up. If you look at the comments above, most people don't even know about the charging rate on their phones, it's just fast or slow for them."
lgg2,34aep1,NalNalas,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:31:24 2015 UTC,Try turning off smart charging. It's a new feature that is on by default. I've been having the same problem and I just turned it off mid charge and it seemed to speed it up.

Even easier if you have a linux box which doesn't need lg drivers and you can install adb with a single command http://forum.xda-developers.com/sprint-g2/general/zvg-ota-update-zip-t3094537/page2

lgg2,349oso,ClassyJacket,2,Wed Apr 29 12:48:07 2015 UTC,Are you on Lollipop? Ever since the update I haven't been able to get Light Flow working properly. I ended up having to disable the app entirely. It's a shame because it makes my notification light do exactly what I want it to.  I'd love to get it working again since the stock notifications are a little lackluster.
lgg2,349oso,MiddiePSU,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:24:24 2015 UTC,I did to no avail. I'll give it another shot and maybe let it rest over night... really clear it out.
lgg2,349oso,MiddiePSU,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:27:04 2015 UTC,If lollipop is causing problem with light flow let me know. I downloaded it for the first time and constantly had problems no matter what I did. It was the free version since I wanted to test it first. It wouldn't even keep the LED notifications turned off during sleep mode.  Right now I have tasker turning off the LED at night.
lgg2,349oso,GuardianBLKWolf,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:48:44 2015 UTC,You may want to upgrade to the pro version as it allows you customize almost any app where the free version has only a handful of apps you can customize
