polandball,3e2fnx,SmokinBear,60,Tue Jul 21 13:29:42 2015 UTC,Yes. Homosexuality was classified as a sickness until 1979.
polandball,3e2fnx,Lhindir,47,Tue Jul 21 13:36:38 2015 UTC,So Sweden's been down there for 36 years? No wonder he's happy to see America.
polandball,3e2fnx,SmokinBear,27,Tue Jul 21 13:39:52 2015 UTC,It wasn't until 2009 homosexuals legally could get married on the same terms and get the same respect as a marriage between a woman and a man. It wasn't until 2003 that two people of the same sex could adopt.
polandball,3e2fnx,Lhindir,13,Tue Jul 21 13:49:47 2015 UTC,"So 1979-2003 was basically ""You're not sick, but you don't have any rights""?"
polandball,3e2fnx,SmokinBear,10,Tue Jul 21 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"Well.. not really in the eye of the law but in practice.. In 1987 it become illegal for business to discriminate people just because they were homosexual. So i guess 1979-1987.  1995 they got the right to marriage, but not on the same term as everyone else and the laws applied to that marriage was separate from the regular laws for a traditional marriage. Why? I really don't understand it. It was not really called a ""marriage"" either instead they called it registered partnership. Yet again, Why? No clue.   If you want to read more about it wikipedia is decent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Sweden"
polandball,3e2fnx,Slyndrr,6,Tue Jul 21 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"It was to keep the church happy. It kept insisting on having a sort of monopoly on marriage, despite us having had civil marriages since a long while.  Since then, the Swedish church has stopped being as much of a cunt and is now mostly pro-gay and marrying gay couples. Lesbian bishops and all that. Churches around the globe still insist on this ""ownership"" of marriage as an institution."
polandball,3e2fnx,Kanorsanity,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:43 2015 UTC,TIL Sweden still has a church

polandball,3e2fnx,Captain_Gonzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:47 2015 UTC,Still better than what we had. In 1995 we were still making jokes in mainstream media that being gay meant you were a sexual deviant.

polandball,3e2fnx,SmokinBear,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"Well they had the right to marriage as ""early"" as 1995, but it wasn't called marriage and they could not get married in church. Why it took the legislators so long as to 2009 to get rid of the differences between the two kind of marriages is a good question."
polandball,3e2fnx,StrangeworldEU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"What the fuck Sweden? I mean, I know we only recently legally forced our church to perform homosexual marriages (the state church anyway) but at least they've had equal rights since 89."
polandball,3e2fnx,bluesydinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:47 2015 UTC,They allowed same-sex couples to adopt before fully legalising same-sex marriages?
polandball,3e2fnx,SmokinBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"As I said in one of my later comments   In 1995 they got the right to marriage, but not on the same term as everyone else and the laws applied to that marriage was separate from the regular laws for a traditional marriage. Why? I really don't understand it. (Because of the church). It was not really called a ""marriage"" either instead they called it registered partnership.    So to answer your question that depends on how you see it, they had the right to ""marriage"" but it was not ""marriage"" as in a marriage between a straight couple in the church. As I see it, yes they had the right to adopt way before the state recognized that the marriage should be equal."

Gladly Russians fucked their grannies, so now germans are nearly half-russian. Jews were always a 2nd cathegory of people when it comes to international affairs.  Also Russia commited Katyń, because they wanted to get rid of Polish inteligence and country's ellite to avoid ressistance and independence movements, just to be easier to enslave Poland and send their people to Siberia.

polandball,3dyodo,SuperCaliginous,85,Tue Jul 21 13:50:08 2015 UTC,The fourth crusade disaster happened when the Greek emperor wouldnt pay the Germans what he promised to them.  This is an exaagarated factoid based on facts.
polandball,3dyodo,Futuralis,40,Mon Jul 20 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"It happened when European (mainly French) crusaders were unable to pay the Venetians for constructing the transport fleet, and the Venetians suggested they stopped by a rebellious/independent-minded  city on the Dalmatian coast and Constantinople to compensate them.   They found a Byzantine pretender, who promised the crusaders a ridiculous amount of money, military support and the Orthodox Church submitting to the Papacy, and used that pretext to invade Constantinople. When the pretender did not pay up (he did not manage to assert control over the Byzantine Empire, and would never have been able to make good on his claims even if he had), the crusaders sacked Constantinople.  Both the siege on the Dalmatian coast and the sack of Constantinople had been expressly forbidden by the Pope, but the documents in which he did so were kept secret by the clergy of the crusade because they feared the crusade would fail otherwise. For a brief moment, all the crusaders has been excommunicated without them knowing it, but the Pope soon relented and revoked all excommunications, except the Venetians'."

polandball,3dz3gr,coldmail750,6,Tue Jul 21 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"Except not really. The Sunni-Shia split is over whether or not Muhammad ibn Abdullah banu Hashim al-Qurayshi- the Prophet Muhammad, that is- was to be succeeded by someone selected by the Muslim community through a process called shura(as the Sunnis maintain) or by a close relative(as the Shias maintain). The rift truly began when the Sunnis voted to make Abdullah ibn Uthman banu Taym al-Qurayshi- known commonly by his nickname Abu Bakr- caliph, because the Shias maintained that the title belonged to Ali ibn Abu Talib banu Hashim al-Qurayshi, Muhammad's cousin, son-in-law, and closest living male relative. That dispute is based in what would become hadith; the Sunnis maintain that Muhammad endorsed selection by the ummah, and the Shias maintain that he made it clear that a family member was to succeed him.  Had Muhammad had a son who lived to adulthood- he actually had three sons, Qasim, Abdullah, and Ibrahim, but none lived to be 20- the Shias would have argued that said son was the intended successor. In essence, they would make the same argument, except they would be arguing for someone other than Ali. And with both sides making the same arguments, it's likely that the rift would have developed in the same way."

polandball,3dxwcz,introsh,5,Tue Jul 21 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, National Socialist = Nazi.  The socialism in this context is not in the sense that we know of. In this case, it's more about people having a complete devotion to the state and its ideology, and as a consequence, the society is shaped into a community that is entitled to them. If that happens, there is no individualism, as everyone belong to a specific society based on a racial criteria (aryans, koreans...). In short, it promotes the national unity, and blend every social classes into one instead of presenting them as enemies. This permitted Hitler to say that, contrary to the Marxist ideas, history isn't about the struggle of classes but the struggle of races.   This definition means that ""socialism"" can only work with ""nationalism"", that is to say, the pride of belonging to a particular state, its history, culture, and acknowledging the fact that the state is a key part in the society. In this case it is more than nationalism, it becomes fascism, because it promotes the idea that a specific society is above the others.   Now where is DPRK in all this ? In North Korea the whole politic is based around the Juche, an ideology which is unique to the country. The Juche explains that North Korea must : 1) be independant 2) construct a national economy and 3) be able to get a self-defence. Through this ideology, the Koreans become a sort of master race, above any others. To help them to get through the Juche, the Great Leader is here to guide the masses (cult of personnality). The Juche is also, like Nazism, very conservative, even reactionary : traditions, families, religions, all of these are very important to them and there isn't any idea of reform.  The Juche was described as an original way of interpretating the Marxism-Leninism, but in truth it is the complete opposite of communism. In communism there never was this idea of isolationism, master race, great leader, and racial struggles. Concentration camps, police of the states and things like that were never the ideas of Marx or Engels, although Lenin later brought these notions with him. That's why in DPRK, the books of Marx, Engels and even Lenin are not allowed in the country, because it could be a danger to the Juche if the Koreans were to read it. In its early years the country was built around Stalinism, which is itself already distant from communism.   So that's it, saying that DPRK is communist is just plain wrong, and poor old Marx would probably commit suicide if he could see how Stalinism/Maoism and the likes of it have twisted his ideas and his philosophy."

polandball,3duq2f,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,8,Mon Jul 20 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"So fun fact here! The U.S.A. is one of the oldest Western nations in the world. Older than France, Germany, Italy, or even the low countries. While many of Europe's nations retain the same culture that can be traced back hundreds and even thousands of years most of the nations are young. The Federal Republic of Germany (was called West Germany until reunification) for example was founded in 1947! The U.K. didn't exist 350 years ago as the U.K. wasn't founded until 1707 when the roles of King of Scotland and King of England where formalized into the King of the U.K. finally placing Scotland and England under a single official political entity. France not only went through many entire political changes during the Napoleonic period but it was also conquered by Japan and Nazi Germany during world war 2. Although it did survive in a tattered form it re-solidified in the 1950's with a new constitution and governmental system. Italy too wasn't a country until the 1800's! If you want to include many of the Slavic nations as ""western"" you still run into the issue that the bulk of them are some of the youngest nations on Earth. Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine for example didn't become independent nations until late 1991!   Anyways I'm just guessing you're American because 350 miles is trivial to Americans due to our country having civilized lands all over the nation and it's one of the largest nations on Earth. Sure Canada and Russia are big too but neither have the same amount of industry and population centers spread across their borders."
polandball,3duq2f,DasHeadCrapHGN,2,Mon Jul 20 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"We're also older in the sense that we weren't blown the fuck up twice in the 20th century, so we didn't have the tabula rasa that most of Europe had after the wars, or after 1991 in the case of post-Communist countries.  Combine this with 1945 through the oil shocks in the 1970s being the zenith of car-worshipping culture and you have an explanation for why local public transit sucks in this country.  High speed rail travel is harder, too, since every single line worth the money needs to be a fairly straight shot of about 1500km if not more (Boston to DC, Boston or NYC to Chicago, LA to Seattle), pretty much every step of which would have to go through somebody's private property or a protected wilderness area of some sort.  Why does $(insert complaint about American political system) exist?  Because it seemed like a good idea in the 1780s.  Why does $(insert complaint about suburbs) exist?  Because it seemed like a good idea when we had cheap oil.  Why does $(insert complaint about technology) exist?  Because we did it first and tended to stick with a relatively early implementation.  The one area where we're unequivocally getting fucked in the ass is internet service, and the FCC finally seems to be growing a fucking spine under Wheeler."

Horses proved to be one of the most reliable ways of transportation (trains could rarely be used due to sabotage and different track widths).  That's another reason why both parties used so many horses. Tracked vehicles on the other hand, opposed to wheeled ones, didn't suffer as much from the circumstances."

polandball,3duq2f,AlmostAlcoholic,24,Sun Jul 19 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"The reason the USA's tank columns kept moving nonstop was because most Sherman tanks had interchangeable parts. Even if you blew a tank up we could scrap it and use the parts to fix another broken Sherman. Blowing up a Sherman just provided more parts to fix other Shermans with.  German tanks used a variety of parts and most were not interchangeable. So when a part was busted you had to order another one from the warehouse/factory, assuming the factory/warehouse still existed.   Mass production and interchangeable parts lead the way to VICTORY!"

Combined with the fact that the Sherman didn't break down at a moment's notice and were something that could be mass produced made it vastly superior.  On the field, Shermans only met Tigers three times. One was a Sherman victory, one was a Tiger victory, and one saw the Shermans rip apart unoccupied Tigers."
polandball,3duq2f,AlmostAlcoholic,9,Sun Jul 19 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're not thinking of the Pershing? because the most widespread later variation of the Sherman was the easy eight, which had a long-barreled 76 mm gun, which, while much better than the previous short-barreled 75mm, was still worse than the 88 mm gun on the Tiger. The Pershing had a 90mm gun, which was very similiar to the Tiger's 88. And the Pershing was the tank that only had three confrontations with Tigers. There are plenty more than three Sherman vs Tiger battles, mainly because Shermans made up the majority of the western allied armor."

polandball,3duq2f,Mallus2,4,Mon Jul 20 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"Having more tanks wouldn't have helped, when the already critically low fuel supply was hindering mobilisation of existing tanks, and artillery power would have been ineffective against the immese aerial superiority of the Allies.

And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.   Obviously the German Empire what with having an emperor and conquering and shit.   And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, come and see. And there went out another horse [that was] red: and [power] was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.   Nazi Germany, no question about it. Their flag was mostly red and they sure did their part in the fight against peace.   And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; and [see] thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

Joining words to create a longer word which combines the meaning of its parts is a basic feature of just about any Germanic language. That's why, in theory, Germanic languages have the most words.

La independencia sola El gran clamor no acalla: Si el sol alumbra a todos Justicia es libertad.    Chorus   Del hombre los derechos Nariño predicando, El alma de la lucha Profético enseñó.

List of Länder from north to south, west to east(sort of):  Wien and Lower Austria:   Wien has the biggest population of all Länder and is the smallest by land area. It is a city famous of its cultural value and a diverse coffee culture. And it has a horrible enclave relationship with Lower Austria, which is the second most populous state of Austria.   Upper Austria:   Linzer torte, said to be the oldest cake in the world, comes from there. There's also this village that always gets its road signs stolen from some reason. A certain Austrian artist and WWI veteran corporal was also born there.   Burgenland:   The least populous state of Austria. Joseph Haydn, the composer of the melody used in the German anthem, was born there. It also contains the largest lake in Austria, Lake Neusiedl.   Vorarlberg:   Has many ski resorts and the dialect spoken there is Alemannic, rather than Austro-Bavarian, which makes it culturally closer to Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Baden-Württemberg in Germany rather than the rest of Austria or Bavaria.   Tyrol:   Consists of two parts, North Tyrol and East Tyrol which are separated by Italian-controlled South Tyrol and the state of Salzburg. Tyrol is known for its distinct Tyrolean hats along with yodeling, which is a common part of the culture in the Alpine countries. The highest mountain in Austria, the Grossglockner, is situated in the middle of Eastern Tyrol and Carinthia.   Salzburg:   The famous Classical era composer Mozart was born there.   Styria:   Promotes itself as the ""Green Heart of Austria"". Arnold Schwarzenegger comes from there.   Carinthia:   Known for its numerous lakes, ski resorts and the most sunny hours in Austria, it is a year-round holiday location.   I'll also give a mention to South Tyrol:   The populace of South Tyrol is mainly German-speaking(62.3%) and there is a secessionist movement that seeks reunification with Austria.

polandball,3dtvwz,Hobbycoder,8,Sun Jul 19 17:39:59 2015 UTC,Yeah like ſt and ch ck tz and stuff. Those are treated as single letters. When you use higher kerning (which was used instead of bold or italic in Fraktur printing) they would not be split up. Example:      I ch   p u tz e   h i e r     There are rules for the usage of ſ though. Don't just replace s with ſ.
polandball,3dtvwz,Hobbycoder,6,Sun Jul 19 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty aware of the rules for it, weren't they similar to the rules for the two different Greek s-letters?"
polandball,3dtvwz,Hobbycoder,4,Sun Jul 19 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Now you got me. I do not know the Greek rules. In general it is: Inside the word? Long ſ. At the end of the word? round s. Attention at compound nouns: Glückspirat. The word can be split up into Glücks and Pirat, making the s an ending-s. There are exceptions but those are icky. I have an old Dictionary in Fraktur, so if you are uncertain I'll look it up."
polandball,3dtvwz,TheZett,5,Sun Jul 19 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"The rules are same, it seems. Greek-influenced scholars liked the two different s-letters for Fraktur apparently.   And thanks for pointing the compound word exception out, that's a rule I tend to forget sometimes."
polandball,3dtvwz,TheZett,4,Sun Jul 19 18:01:34 2015 UTC,it is not of Greek origin though. The round s evolved into th ſ on its own account. ſ saves a lot of space in handwritten books. Also it makes the reading go faster.
polandball,3dtvwz,rafeind,3,Sun Jul 19 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"IIRC it was of Roman origin and ſ was the equivalent of s in cursive script.

Just none of that direct contact ever got back to Rome.  There were surviving legionaries from Marcus Crassus' invasion of Parthia in 53 B.C. The 10,000 Roman prisoners were moved to the East and enlisted by the Parthians to fight the Huns. And who else was fighting the Huns at the same time? At some point the Han Chinese overran a Parthian army post in modern-day Uzbekistan and they were so impressed by the engineering skills and battle formations of the defenders that they packed them off back to China and settled them in a new city, named by imperial decree Li-Jien (Legion, get it?). By this time there were only a few hundred left and they did garrison duty 'til the end of their days.   Sounds fanciful right? This was a theory put forward by an American sinologist historian named Homer H. Dubbs in the 1950's and most people thought he was crazy.

polandball,3dswuf,lucidsleeper,11,Sun Jul 19 10:00:30 2015 UTC,"""Losing the mandate"" most often simply was you being deposed or having bad luck. In practice and for ordinary people life wasn't better or worse than in Europe."

You see, the emperors have duties to fulfil to heaven and rituals that he needs to do in order to keep that mandate. Also, if he deviates from the normal norm of ruling and against the advise of his Confucian ministers he runs a risk of displeasing heaven and losing that mandate. So if bad shits happens during his reign, like a long drought for example, is a sign that he fucked up somewhere and heaven pissed with him."

For anyone curious - the use of national flags is a relatively modern convention. The Chinese only really adopted a national flag in the late 1800s to facilitate relations with Western powers.   The Romans didn't exactly use flags either, not as we know them. But the battle standards and symbols they used - which survive today - were iconic enough that we can adapt them for Polandball."

However, once Tito was gone, there wasn't that much holding together Yugoslavia.

Because Latin works are much scarcer than with modern still spoken languages, it's much harder for accurate statistically significant matches to be established between the available tokens. And this extends to not being able to accurately establish existent collocations, as well as individual discrete lexemes. Also in general, it's much harder to support synthetic morphology (which abounds in Latin) than isolating morphology in NLP. One of the main reasons for that is the difficulty in establishing inclusive dictionary correspondences, since that would require dictionaries being able to handle all variants of affixal possibilities relating to the relevant lexemes."

polandball,3dsow1,Dlimzw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:26:20 2015 UTC,Are you a history student?  Because I have no idea what all that means.
polandball,3dsow1,Teh_Slayur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:55:05 2015 UTC,"Right; The areas of once Magna Germania, stretching informally past Vistula, were where many Germanic tribes once lived and hailed from, many of them great migrators - Langdobards, Vandals, Goths and Burgundians to name just the few. Before Germanic peoples came to dominate barbarian Europe, many Celtic peopleslived there, too, today believed to have originated from somewhere between Austria and Bohemia.  Beyond and to the north of them there were Germano-Baltic and Germano-Sarmatian peoples - Still living quite like the Germans, sedentary, fighting predominately with shields and spears, etc. but culturally differing enough to merit the distinction.  When the Huns and Attila rolled around, about 420s, they were driven west and south in large numbers, but... (Here starts one of my pet theories, to do with unknown, disputed and muddy origin of the Slavic peoples, then, though retroactively (today called so in reference to then) known simply as a tribe of Sclaveni.   Prevailing wisdom, though the learned are starting to question it, would make it seem as if these lands were completely abandoned, and then simply occupied by completely different people... But, Western Slavs in particular, appear in so many ways, so much like their neighbours.  Sclaveni, it's theorised, served as administrative class of Attila's empire, therefore such a spread of their language, but in order to spread, and realistically speaking, there might not have been so many of them. Indeed, when the Horde came knocking, they'd simply establish dominion over the locals, many of whom remained, and with time, the new ruling class was assimilated and taken by osmosis by their new subjects, not the other way around.  After all, Sclaveni were steppe people - Horse born and lived, worshipping Tengri, the Infinite Blue Sky, and so on. In a span of a hundred years, they are settled, bearded, blond, praying to wise Svetovid, or Perun - God of Thunder.   In time, Catholics and Byzantines take note of those new, wandering peoples, and stick their own name on them, but Europeans are capable of landing in the Caribbean and calling the people 'Indians', same as the natives of Dakota. Amongst Greeks, 'Slav' might've been only slightly more specific than 'Pagan'.   The Bolghars are an example I like to reach for, to finish. Same principle, steppe people, migrating to an already occupied land, but somewhere about 6th century, and much better recorded, for that.  We know where they came from, we know where they went, we know that ruling a bunch of people on the Byzantine border, and then accepting their god and letters (Old/Church Slavic being a Byzantine export, one which would surely define people a great deal, but still, just that) made them into Bulgarians, whom we today pen down as Slavs, while their cousins back at the steppe remained distinctly different people, and converted to Islam sometime there after, by the way.  And so, rejecting any of those silly, almost arbitrary and meaningless divisions, while entertaining them as an historian, and an amateur anthropologist, I like to think that Czechs, Poles, and the lot are Germanii, with extra steppe flavour."
polandball,3dsow1,Teh_Slayur,2,Mon Jul 20 10:18:44 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a lot of sense.  Polish and Czech culture is basically the same as German and Austrian, so I was always wondering why they belong to 2 different language families. (Of course both are indo-european, but half the world is that by now)  My theory was always that it's simply because the agricultural products of those 4 countries are the same. Potatoes, Wheat, Beer, Cabbage, Pork. (I know potatoes are imported, but they have been the defining piece of this region's cuisine for centuries now)  But the idea of Slavs taking over proto-germanic lands and adapting the local culture is a better explanation from a political point of view.  One thing doesn't add up for me though. In all other cases I know about, when a new group of people took control of most of the living space of a local people, they would always completely replace the local language eventually, since even if they didn't control 100% of the area, the new language would be used for trading and politics so eventually even the local people would adopt it. Examples are Indoeuropean languages replacing the old local ones on the Indian subcontinent. English in North America, Russian in Siberia.  So what happened to the Slavic languages? As you said the old Germanic tribes were living even beyond the Vistula, so when the proto-Slavs controlled land all the way to modern day Hamburg, they certainly held a majority of ancient Germanic area. The interesting thing is that this might be the only case where the previous local language became dominant again after many centuries, when German rule expanded east, again beyond the Vistula.  And with the Roman dominance in the west it's even more surprising that the Germanic languages prevailed and started expanding again after almost being wiped out from Central Europe. Was it because Slavic languages were impossible to learn? Was it because Germanic languages stayed dominant in Scandinavia, even when Central Europe was almost degermanized?  As you mentioned, along with the Germanics there were also Celtic tribes, but they vanished from Central Europe when Latin and Slavic languages pushed into Central Europe around the 6th century. Why was the fate of the Germanic languages so different from the Celtic ones?"
polandball,3dsow1,Teh_Slayur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:14:38 2015 UTC,"Well, we'd have to look to the time of that change to find the answer.  Let's review: Sclaveni become the rulers of the eastern-central European peoples, the language is... Oriental German, about 65/45 foreign to local.  When the Goths, and later and for good the Langdobards take over Italy, because it was the heart of Rome, Italian language becomes 90% Latin, the local, 10% foreign influence.  Gaul is also Romanized enough for the Franks to let the local flavour, language and tradition assimilate them, likewise.   Every tribe, in order to become a nation, even a kingdom, eventually, had to be strong enough to survive, do well enough to prosper. When Sorbs/Venedii were pushing into German lands in the 7th century, it wasn't a cauldron of melding, and changing peoples, relationships, etc - It was post Charlemagne HRE.   The fully Germanic tribes managed to build successful states that lasted long enough to solidify their identity, and they held vast swathes of lands which had always been theirs, however much the tribes varied, and theirs alone. They changed, with time, like English, but those were slow, gradual changes, not the wild times of the fifth century.  Also, just to touch on the Celts, again, their heyday comes to an end, if I recall it well, in early iron age. From there on, they are deposed as the fist group of peoples in Europa Baraborum by the Germanii. Many once Celtic lands - some old enough for their presence to had been all but forgotten, like bits of Germania and Austria; some newer like Gaul, then Britain shifted from Celtic cultural domination to the German.  And since language is such a great divider, and almost always dictated by the ruling class, no wonder that those changes occurred, and that once Goths and Vandals thought themselves separate people from their neighbours over the river after a few generations, particularly once the Greeks created the Slavic alphabet, and codified the language - distinct if not entirely different from the old one.   Not much had changed, but peoples convictions, and for centuries, that was enough."

The problem was that naval ships (like everyone else in the world), unless desperate in which case they would boil some, would just collect barrels of water straight from rivers and lakes and drink that. Though terrible, the water found on a ship during the age of sail was actually no worse than the water anyone else drank on land. Literally everyone drank beer and tea, simply because they realized that it was the only thing that didn't make them sick. But if the water was desalinated, it was by definition boiled and purified during this time period."

Some suspected this was the main reason of why they considered whale's meat as top tier delicacy."
polandball,3dqeph,DarkSkyKnight,61,Sun Jul 19 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"More fun facts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanaya_Yohei   Hanaya Yohei (華屋 与兵衛 or 花屋 與兵衛; 1799–1858) is generally credited as the inventor of today's Tokyo-style (Edomae-zushi; 江戸前寿司) nigiri sushi (hand-formed sushi) at the end of Japan's Edo period   [...]   His sushi was totally different from today's ""raw fish"" stereotype."
polandball,3dqeph,poclee,41,Mon Jul 20 13:48:49 2015 UTC,"There is something even funnier in Japanese's wiki.   Because other sushi chefs were competing about making more luxurious sushi back then, most of them were throw into jail during the Tenpō Reforms when the sumptuary law comes out.(他の業者と競い豪華な寿司を提供したことから、奢侈を禁じた天保の改革の際には他の寿司職人ともども投獄されている。)   BTW, back then, commonly known sushi were basically Oshizushi (押し寿司, ""pressed sushi""), this guy among other two chefs back then, are considered as the inventors of Nigirizushi (握り寿司, ""hand-pressed sushi""), a more commonly known form of sushi in modern day."

polandball,3dqeph,snarkyxanf,37,Sat Jul 18 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"I suspect a lot of it also had to do with economics: in a sparse country with grassland raising beef makes a lot of sense, but in a densely populated country you either have to sacrifice farming space for pasture, or feed grain to the cattle, both of which look like an expensive choice in a pre-industrial society.  Fish and whales are essentially using the ocean as pasture, which you can't farm on anyway. Chickens have shorter lives, so they have a better meat-to-feed ratio."
polandball,3dqeph,RdClZn,23,Sat Jul 18 14:30:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, chickens were also banned by Emperor Tenmu, for chickens like other birds, are considered as messengers of heaven in Shinto.  To be more specific, Tenmu's banning act didn't say you can't eat meat the whole year (only from September 30 till April 10 in lunar calendar), nor did he ban to eat those animals he thought as vermin toward agriculture, like pigs or deers. But since him, a lot of emperors or shoguns renew this act with various conditions, as a result, a culture despise cattle meat was born."
polandball,3dqeph,snarkyxanf,13,Sat Jul 18 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with that per se, but like you pointed out, the rules kept getting reinstated in various forms. People have a tendency to find excuses to disregard or forget rules that don't work, there's no way that one emperor's proclimation in 675 about food would stick around unless his successors had a reason to keep it. The fact that the rule kept getting made over and over indicates that people didn't really think the original one was still effective. In theory laws might be binding forever, but in practice they aren't. All I was trying to say is the reason that rule stuck when many others did not was likely to be economic."
polandball,3dqeph,RdClZn,6,Sun Jul 19 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"It seems the extent of such culture could be contested. It seems that it was more like /u/snarkyxanf said, those measures were done due to practical considerations:   Many heroes in the Japanese warring states period including Iyeyasu Tokugawa, Soun Hojo and Motonari Mori lived long with numerous offspring. In addition to good luck and inborn physical strength, it appears they were particularly careful with their daily habits including diet. Since around the Fifth Century AD, Japanese rulers began building government-run pastures in many places to raise horses and cattle, from which meat and dairy products were regularly supplied. As this episode portrays, beef-eating was practiced since ancient times, the popularity of which was so high that the Tokugawa Shogunate often attempted to control its consumption with prohibitive orders. The Imperial Court also tried to discourage a meat diet as it did not want rice-growing peasants to consume meat. Samurai, the warrior-class people, however, regularly hunted for wild animals for their own consumption. Many samurai of the warring states generally kept manufacturing facilities for weapons and armor, and such facilities regularly produced fresh meat as byproducts.   Source"

So while there isn't a lot of racial content in the abstract, the irrelevant insertion makes me feel like he might be motivated by racial theories.  The study is literally about food habits of different classes, which of course does not mean the author is pro-classism. But again, the comments about heroes and their longevity and fecundity makes me feel like he might have a pro-samurai/aristocracy thing going on.  In sum, irrelevant to whether the research is correct and informative, just a bit weird."

Context: The Third Italian War of Independence was fought with the goal of obtaining Venetia from Austria; however, after many humiliating losses on the Italians side, Austria gave Venetia to France in an attempt to keep it away from Italy and Prussia, but France soon gave the territory to Italy anyway. So, despite several humiliating military losses, because of the Prussian military and their relations with France, Italy was still able to declare the war a victory and take Venetia."

Most immigrants go to neighboring countries, Turkey has thousands of Syrian refugees, and we bitch about 7 percent?

polandball,3dmgm3,SetFireToTheRane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:18:26 2015 UTC,Well from my point of view 7% islamic immigrants is huge seeing as it was only 3.5% in 2000. That is a doubling up in only 15 years. On top of that many of the recent migrants are uneducated people with no sorts of skills. How can a modern society even begin to absorb these people?
polandball,3dmgm3,Lexandru,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"You're making three assumptions  1 - you refer to migrants as if they are only muslim. There's 14,3% foreign-born people in Sweden. And around 7% of these immigrants are Islamic. Half of your immigrants are NOT Islamic.   2 - You assume all immigrants do not have skills and no education. I know for a fact that there ARE educated immigrants, most even are since it requires a lot of cash to arrange fleeing to Europe.  My Pakistani friend's father studied gynaceology, but his degree does not count here (with a good reason, but still). However, his family in Pakistan is very rich, and they own multiple appartments in my city.  3 - Immigrants, contrary to belief, work as well. The percentage in most Western countries is 10% higher unemployment for certain groups of immigrants, but still the majority of them have a job.  Not only that, but their children, especially in great education systems like Sweden's, almost always learn the language fluently and will possess skills.  Yes, immigrants can have some financial impact, but you overestimate it by a large margin, not only that, but you have a lot of presumptions about immigrants/Islamic immigrants in general"

It all varies I'm sure there is ""getting tired of being there"" and then there are conditions which make it impossible to be there. If its anything like the Army in the US the quality of working conditions can vary greatly due to command related conditions. While I was a food inspector for the Army 3 out of 4 commands were great, drama free do your job go home after a 8-5 shift type of a deal add some Army stuff to it. The last one which led to me leaving the service(retired due to disability) was filled with what can only be described as abusive incompetent psychotics... It was really strange at how there were so many of them concentrated in that one unit."
polandball,3dmi7n,TheNominated,25,Fri Jul 17 21:41:54 2015 UTC,It's better yet to have a small core of professional soldiers who can coordinate reservists to make them more effective.

polandball,3dmi7n,Intup,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:06 2015 UTC,That isn't true in the US. Have you checked the CDC stats on accidental injuries and deaths over the past decade or so?   The only studies I have heard that make that claim intentionally exclude DGUs that don't result in a justified homicide and other cherry picking behaviors.

Presuming you follow all safety measures there really isn't a chance you'll hurt yourself.

polandball,3dmi7n,Lawfulgray,7,Fri Jul 17 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"here in the U.S.   Excellent, keep spreading the mämmi."
polandball,3dmi7n,TheBoldakSaints,16,Fri Jul 17 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"This ,This,  This, and This disagree with you.   This says guns are 22 times more likely to be used in a homicide, suicide, or accidental death than in self defense. A VPC paper finds that over a five-year period, the actual incidence of people using guns in self-defense amounts to less than 1% of crimes committed.   During a study (12 months in Memphis, 18 months in Seattle, and Galveston) 626 shootings occurred in or around a residence. This total included 54 unintentional shootings, 118 attempted or completed suicides, and 438 assaults/homicides. Thirteen shootings were legally justifiable or an act of self-defense, including three that involved law enforcement officers acting in the line of duty. For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.  I'm not sure where you drew your numbers from, but you didn't draw any sources and your statistics have no reference intervals. 1 million what? per year?   My source specifically indicates that in four years, 2007-2011, .8% of cases, amounting to 235,700, people interfered using a firearm.  I have no problem with owning weapons. I own a .22 rifle, which I use for shooting, but I do not exclaim that it is my born right to own a gun, because it is essential to the protection of my family.   You also mention that that is presuming you follow all safety measures. Yes, presuming you take all precautions, you'll be fine. But there are always people who do not, and these are the people who cause these numbers. Only citing numbers from people who take all precautions isn't really fair, considering we do not have extensive screening or anything to make sure people are taking these precautions. It's like saying ""knife related injuries, presuming you are an extremely skilled cook and wearing protective gloves"". Knives aren't restricted to cooks, and you are not required to wear gloves (though unlike gun precautions, you aren't usually told to wear them either :P)."
polandball,3dmi7n,szynka,18,Fri Jul 17 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"That's kind of consistent with what he said, since he said that the lowest estimates are 50,000 times a year and your source says that there were 235,700 cases from 2007-2011. 235,700/5 = 47,140 times per year, which is pretty close to 50,000."
polandball,3dmi7n,EfPeEs,4,Fri Jul 17 22:13:22 2015 UTC,Pilot has to use misleading amounts by listing several years. How else is he/she going to artificially inflate his/her statistics in order to push an agenda?

polandball,3dmi7n,ToTheRescues,2,Fri Jul 17 23:36:01 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that anecdotes are not proof, but I think this one displays a relevant trend.  While living in the ghettos of northwest Florida, I had two separate occasions to chase off home invaders with a rifle - three dudes who actually got inside my house, and one more who was trying to break in during a hurricane.  No statistics will reflect those things ever happened because I did not report to anybody.  I think its reasonable to assume that many similarly prevented crimes are not reported.  On the other side of the statistics, when someone gets shot and ends up in a hospital there will be a paper record of that ~100% of the time."

The whole procedure usually costs between 500 to 1000USD. Then there are a whole bunch of rules you need to follow and you need to pay annual fees to the state and stuff.

I was excited but expected to be bored because I'd be all by lonesome. I decided to treat myself to a seat behind home plate.  Just happened to sit right next to this older Cuban dude. We chatted a little. His English wasn't perfect but we managed. I bought us some beers and found out he played Cricket. He taught me stuff about Cricket, and I taught him about Baseball (he wasn't totally familiar, which is strange for a Cuban) and by the 5th inning we were best friends.  We were getting trashed, abusing the mascot, cursing at the umps. My team ended up clinching a playoff spot and the players sprayed us with champagne.  Best. Baseball. Game.

The same thing happens in the US with tactical voting. Almost everyone in the US likes a third party canidate better than the left and right wing canidates, but we know if we vote for our personal favorites, we are taking votes away from our second choice and will end up with someone we despise instead of merely dislike."

As much as I may hate him, he at least had a semblance of a plan, whereas his party is now beheaded, and Maduro is a figurehead for the rest of the group, they dont and while clearly not idiotic as they make themselves look sometimes, they will run us down like Chavez would have never done. (Still, his death was probably a good thing, he had said charisma to keep winning the masses, since his death everyone just gets more and more disillusioned with things).  Ah yes, the USA issue. Vote for the lesser evil. I will only say it CAN be resolved, Venezuela also had two parties locked into a similar stalemate. Then Chavez came.

polandball,3dn6o5,badkarma12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:06:39 2015 UTC,"Ironically, what chavez reminded me of more than anything was a charasmatic version of some notable US politicians. The distilled idiocy that only being promoted far beyond your capabilities can bring, utter conviction in their beliefs with no room for compromise and a belief that the end justifies the means.   Unfortunately in the US, our third party will either be the theocratic block that swept to power in numerous states the last election as a part of the Tea party, ultranationalists (think expanded monroe doctrine with indiscriminate bombings like WW2 in every conflict, puppets and nuke all who oppose us. You know how trump recently said he would just burn all the goddamn oil wells in the middle east if someone acts up, like ISIS? He's not alone, that opinion actually has some support here), isolationists (according to numerous polls a significant minority of the US population actually wants to either withdraw to switzerland levels or cut ties with everybody but the Anglosphere and to a lessor extent NATO, Japan and South Korea, imagine the power vaccume. Seriously, a total withdrawal of all US forces from everywhere, including peacekeeping and defensive forces), or European Style Socialists (which will be fought tooth and nail by the other 50% of the US population and deadlock us for literally years).   We don't really have any choices until one of these scenarios happens, which will unite the rest in support of a moderate compromise in the face of the destruction the previous administration wrought. And god help the rest of the world if the Isolationists or Ultranationalists win, at least the courts would limit and overturn/prevent most of the theocratic block from making major decisions and the socialist debate would stay internal."
polandball,3dn6o5,runetrantor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine Europe wasnt too fond of us breaking free.  The European influence I mean is after all these points, when they sort of gave up on the idea of recovering us and saw us as a new place for investment given our low development. Germany in particular invested in us, maybe due to having the 'Germany of the Caribbean' in our borders. That said, even post the World Wars, our culture has been HEAVILY influenced by Europe, as we were the only continent that didnt get involved in the World Wars, like at all, so many europeans fleed to our countries, specially in the second one, my mother's grandparent left after the war, but he had stories of the time, and how his brother was old enough to fight for Italy. Nowadays it's pretty common for teenagers and young people to have european grandparents, mine are spanish and italian, but I have met many germans, polish, and whatnot, so they brought their influences and transfered them to us. Plus many artists fleed and settled here and many stayed once Europe rose from the ashes (They for some reason like the heat. >_>).  As for USA being key in our independence, yeah, you guys went first and while you were understandably in no position to help (Maybe you wouldnt even care, we were pretty far away from you, back then without planes or anything), but Bolivar did went to speak to Washington iirc. I remember he went to England or France at some point too. England in a way helped us, in the same way France did for you guys, makes sense, our overlords were rivals, so freeing their rivals' subjects was a good idea for them.  I had never heard of the Mexican intervention thing, that's not history we touch upon. Very surprised to hear the Union and the Confederacy even considered a truce to deal with that before resuming their war. That's very 'civil' for a country split in half in a civil war. (Even if they didnt went through it. Most wold just scream NEVER and be done with it).  To be very honest, I dont really knew about that Crisis. I have vague memories of hearing about us getting in a mess against Europe, but that event was not really touched upon... Huh.  The issue of our rulers is that our tradition is for generals to rule, Jose Maria Vargas was I think the first civilian president and that was shocking, and even in more recent times many of them have been soldiers (Chavez too), so they would no doubt act all high and mighty... VERY balsy of us to assume USA saving us without checking first.  We would be SO easy to blockade too, we have three main ports, the Capital one, the Lake of Maraicaibo, and Puerto Cabello, any fleet worth their salt would lock us out of the water. XD  Man, that's a LOVELY tale, we screw up so badly USA has to amend the Doctrine. I do realize USA is no saint and has it's own interests, I am not that naive. (Though I do feel the whole United Fruit mess with the Banana Republics was a bit too far. If you want so much control, annex outright and stop being sneaky)  Yeah, I can see Panama allowing that, given they are free because of USA backing after a diplomatic blunder with Colombia cut the canal plan short.  Interesting agreement the alliance with USA has as small print. I can see reason in parts, others irk me a bit, but that's a more deep-rooted distrust for the USA government. (As a poster from the Egyptian Revolution put it, USA Government, GO AWAY. USA people, we love you. An important distinction to make, most I have spoken to dont hate USA itself, but rather... the pilots. :P)  I love imagining potential scenarios, specially when someone else is along for the ride, then we can amend each other, whereas by ourselves we may not see obvious things."

It's not like they kept track of everything the way we do now. On top of that, 2000 years ago there wasn't production of much besides crops and stone or wood based construction, at least in large numbers. So that means whoever had the largest population they would have an inflated (or at least misleading) GDP. IDK maybe Maddison takes all that into account.    I know it's stupid to say this to Canada, but native Americans do count.   We don't hate the aboriginals and first nations. Some Canadians did in the past but cultures evolve and progress. No one is eradicating anyone anymore. Like how, today, India isn't a cesspool of hate, racism, and intolerance anymore...oh wait.  That being said, no, the natives don't count. They don't count because they were not citizens of the United States of America. The States is not a continent. It is a country; one that did not exist until 1776.

polandball,3dmd95,skoge,3,Fri Jul 17 18:01:48 2015 UTC,Hey I am just curious about something for you native Lithuanians. I was doing some genealogy research and I found out on my maternal side there is some Lithuanian ancestry but I for the life of me cant find any immigration records due to the Anglicization of the surname. So in short I was wondering if you guys could help me out with meaning/spelling of the name so I could have more in depth information. Thanks for any feedback and the name is Konapayus.
polandball,3dmd95,FltLtSibanda,3,Fri Jul 17 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm i found only one Lithuanian word that sounds like that it could be ""Kanapius"" if thats not it try asking people at /r/lithuania"
polandball,3dmd95,skoge,2,Fri Jul 17 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"It seems the name is actually of Slavic origin, deriving from Конопай - Konopay (variant of word конопатый - freckled), which is fairly popular Russian surname. The ending ""-yus"" is purely Lithuanian though, which may mean that your ancestors were of Russian origin, but lived in Lithuania for some time, or got Russian surname in some other way. If they emigrated from Lithuania in the first half of 20th century, for me the most likely scenario seems to be following: some guy from Russia, named Konopay, alone or with his family, settled in Lithuania in 19 century. After the First world war, when Republic of Lithiania was established, either he or his children/grandchildren added ""-yus"" to the name (that was common practice back then). Few decades later they set their sails to the land of freedom.  Anyway, this is pure speculation, although I am fairly sure that the original form of that name is Russian Konopay."

To avoid devastating attack of heavily Teutonic Knights, Tatars and riders(Lithuanias) broke away from the enemy and moved to the north-west of Tannenberg. Lithuanians began to retreat. Researchers estimate that turn controversal. Some (mostly Polish and Russian authors) are considering a retreat Litvinov as an escape, others (mainly Belarusian and Lithuanian authors) speak about the tactical maneuver Vytautas.

According to Jan Dlugosz, the credit for stopping the Teutonic onslaught belongs to these banners, what says: ""In this battle Smolensk Russian Knights fought hard, standing under the banner of their own three, alone not fled, and that earned great glory""  Point of site, which were given by saint_of_balbieriski is exactly what Jan Dlugosz said, ""In this battle Smolensk Russian Knights fought hard, standing under the banner of their own three, alone not fled, and that earned great glory"""

polandball,3dmd95,rindindin,8,Fri Jul 17 14:07:49 2015 UTC,"Well in essence there were 2 sides in the battle. Teutonic order which consisted from knights and knechts and other soldiers of Prussia (Livonian order was not participating), mercenaries and knights form Europe (maybe less form certain regions because western Europe had it's own wars going so less support for Teutons).  On other side we have what I call Allied army: Poland with it's vassal?? Moldavia and mercenaries.Btw Vytautas(Grand Duke of Lithuania) gave money to his cousin Jogaila(Władysław II Jagiełło king of Poland) to hire some merceneries. So you have Czech and Moravians and famous Jan Zizka with them.  And then we have other part of allied army, Grand Duchy of Lithuania. We know Vytautas had Tatar soldiers from both his domain and allies from Crimea. We can't be certain how many of them were there though. And then we have most controversial part. For example, Dlugosz mentions brave Smolenskian regiments but no other historian(as far as I know) mentions them. And also it's hard to say how many troops were from speciffic parts of Grand Duchy, how many were left to guard border and so on. And also we can't be sure of nationality of said soldiers regardless from which regiment they come from since nobles form Lithuania proper( broadly speaking modern Lithuania) could have served in garrison of Smolensk or Vitebsk or other places, same way the Tatar soldiers could be from Lithuania proper, Vytautas domain in Trakai or what is now western Ukraine.

Most of these Georgians converted to Islam, but due to Geographic isolation they kept their Georgian identity. They've integrated heavily with Turks and they're now known as Laz. They've got their own distinct dialect of Turkish heavily influenced by Georgian, and many of them still speak Georgian. Unlike Kurds who seem to have problems integrating with Turks, Lazs seem to not have any issue like that. Some claim that RTE said himself in his first days of his political career that he's originally a Muslim Georgian, however he later denied and complained that ""They've first called me Georgian. Now they're calling me Armenian!"", and yeah in Turkey 'Armenian' is a curse word.

I mean if we want to get picky The Italian Job was also distributed by an American company, as was Hot Fuzz & most of the other examples listed. That's because all the major distributors are American.   What makes a film American or British? Total Recall was directed by a Dutch director, does that make it Dutch? I don't think so."

But if you asked someone from Northern Ireland they wouldn't give themselves that designation. It's also more clear to call people from other places by their location otherwise it's confusing. Most people would assume British people are from Britain I think, even if the technical designation includes people from elsewhere.   EDIT: I should note that people from Northern Ireland are both British & Irish citizens btw, both would be correct. If you're born in N.

polandball,3djf8t,oakpacific,5,Fri Jul 17 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you write Baxi as 巴西, the 西 means the West, although if you just write ""xi"" without any character or even tone marks, then it could be many things. But most of these transliterations are just there to match the sounds, their meanings of the characters aren't to be taken literally. Their transliteration of Malaysia 马来西亚 also uses the 西 character while not being a Western country, even relative to China."

polandball,3djf8t,protohom,7,Fri Jul 17 07:16:40 2015 UTC,"You cannot overstate the influence of Journey to the West on the Chinese.  Partially because of this, up until the modern times we consider you part of the 'West'-commies buried dead Indian soldiers' bodies properly, following the international protocol during the war between us, while Vietnamese soldiers could not expect to receive the same treatment, they were always considered our traditional subordinate, and Chinese protocol applies.   We always called you चीन (Chīnaḥ), from Mahabharatam onwards.

polandball,3djf8t,oakpacific,6,Fri Jul 17 08:31:36 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons we welcomed the Portuguese for trade was because we had such good trade relations with the Chinese. We thought new fair-skinned traders would be as generous as you :(  Zheng He also visited us many times, and he left a plaque similar to the Galle inscription here. The treasure ships were a source of wonder, and he thought the Hindu king Zamorin was a devout Buddhist  :D  Some say he died in Calicut too, and was buried in Sea.  We also have local myths involving Chinese merchants. Like how a local Ganesha deity helped a Chinese merchant to lift up his ship from under the sea.  Another one is about a merchant who lost all his stuff in sea, and left a some porcelain jars in the safe keeping of a poor local Brahmin, saying they were filled with rice powder. Then he went back to China. The Brahmin, driven by extreme poverty and hunger, took the extreme step of taking an ounce of rice powder from them, but found that they were filled with gold. He conducted trade with that. So when the merchant came back, he was astonished to see how rich the Brahmin got. The merchant thought he lost all his gold, but the Brahmin had doubled the gold and gave it to the Merchant. But he accepted only what was his, and graciously rejected the rest. And he gave one peculiar damaged porcelain jar to the Brahmin as a sign of gratitude, and it is said that it is a a source of prosperity, and the best mango picle in the world is produced in it. :D"

Nobody ever has to say 'no homo' because 'no homo' is always assumed. It's the same reason some people who read letters between the founding fathers in the US, specifically Alexander Hamilton and Washington, speculate that they might have had the gender-feels for each other. They didn't, they were just able to write about their 'feelings' and 'affection' for one another in their letters more freely than you could today."

Stability returns to the middle east for the first time in many years and the region prospers. The US, deprived of their arena for phony wars to keep the military-industrial complex afloat succumbs to civil war and crumbles. Mexico annexes the entire midwest, the states of the old confederacy become independent nation-states and many wars are fought between them. The states of New England agree to revert to overseas possessions of the United Kingdom.  2020-2022: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Egypt and various former yugoslav states agree to annexation by the entity by now known as The Hellenic Empire. The european union solidifies control over remaining states by making secession illegal and a casus belli. A common military is established. The individual nations by now have next to nothing to decide for themselves.  2023: The European Union is renamed Großdeutschland. The legislatures and governments of member states are disbanded. Elections to the European Parliament are cancelled until further notice. Reichskanzlerin und President Merkel acquires supreme legislative power.  2025: Revolts take place in the middle east  as a new, well-trained and well-armed foe appears. With ruthless efficiency, they pierce through the hellene heartland with their aims set for Konstantinopolis. The force appears to be backed by foreign powers, and fingers of suspicion are pointed at Russia and China. CyborgPutin denies all accusations of involvement, China is silent on the issue.  2026: The enemy force are at the doorstep of Konstantinopolis, but its dome holds fast. Germany pledges aid to Hellas and sends an army of their own to the greek capital to help defeat the enemy. Well inside the City, the germans instead turn their weapons to the greeks. It is soon common knowledge that the middle eastern combatants were trained and supplied by the germans, in the words of Der Führerin: To ensure the balance of Power in Europe.  2030: Europe is completely overrun by turks and arabs, Germany included. THE END."

polandball,3dilsa,QitianDasheng,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:49:30 2015 UTC,They don't. Nomadic people have completely different DNA from sedentary people.   But maybe ethnic Mongols have more Turkic DNA than Anatolians.
polandball,3dilsa,lucidsleeper,2,Fri Jul 17 08:51:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen this pie chart multiple times,but I've never seen the actual study or the raw data,the fact that Mongols and Kazakhs have O3* M122 show that portion of their male ancestry originated from the south.   Autosomally Anatolian Turks cluster with Armenians and Kurds despite speaking different languages.  I'm taking it from a historical view,there were plenty of nomads that eventually settled in Northern China some of which might have shared some sort of ancestry with early Turkic speakers.  People undeniably move around,you can still find O1a* M119 in modern day Han,Koreans,Japanese,Mongolia etc in varying proportions despite it's origins in coastal China."
polandball,3dilsa,QitianDasheng,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:09:38 2015 UTC,"You overestimate the population of nomads that survived all the war and famine, and underestimate the amount of Han Chinese. Historically anytime nomads marched into China, apart from the Mongol conquests, they were outnumbered by Han Chinese 20 to 1. It's also well documented some nomads ended up migrating out of China, like Khitans and nomadic groups which oppressed the local Han population too much got wiped out like the Jie. And The study can also be found in the American Journal of Human Genetics."
polandball,3dilsa,lucidsleeper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:39:34 2015 UTC,"Nomads were able to invade or settle was because of warfare amongst Sinitic speakers,if you are willing to take ancient censuses at face value then the Western Jin have a population of 16 million which is a steep decline from the Han.(Ge Jianxiong,Wang Yumin etc. already show that ancient Chinese censuses are unreliable and that several times nomadic groups were able to settle on the behalf of a Chinese Emperor)  The historical Han Chinese(Which was first used by Xianbei and Khitans to refer to northern Sinitic speakers) was never homogenous to begin with(neither was any other group) and they had interactions with other ethnicties that may not exist today.  Yes,sedentary Sinitic speakers outnumbered foreigners whether they be nomadic(Xiongnu,Xianbei etc) or sedentary(Jurchen,Sogdians etc) but that doesn't hide the fact that they mixed with each other.   Han Chinese from Jiangsu and Zhejiang can be autosomally northern Han while still carrying paternal markers from natives(O1a* M119).  My point is historically there have been Turkic speakers that migrated to northern China(Gok Turuk,Uyghur,Shatuo etc.) while the Seljuks already intermarried with Persian speakers prior to their arrival to Anatolia.  Modern day Uyghurs are the result of Soviet naming policies and Turkic speakers assimilated whatever remnants of Tocharian,Yuezhi,Xiongnu etc that inhabited the Tarim Basin."

So basically Uyghur refugees, a group of Turkic Muslims that are oppressed in China, went to Thailand, and recently Thailand basically had to repatriate nearly one hundred of them back to China, but a group of them was able to flee to Turkey. Because Turkey has no plans on repatriating the Uyghurs sent to them, China's angry at them harboring these so-called ""terrorists.""  Leading to the punchline.  Anyway, that's enough politics.

polandball,3dilsa,wuerling_520,10,Fri Jul 17 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"Uyghur separatism has pretty much been a thing since the Soviet Union dissolved, and the Chinese government has increased tensions in the area by deciding that the best way to improve the economic state of the otherwise very poor region is to give incentive to millions of Han Chinese to move there and set up shops and businesses. The Uyghurs, who were already separatists, were rightfully upset about this, and have been carrying terrorist attacks for most of the 2000s.  The Chinese government continues to take a hard-handed approach on the matter, but some of the policies are misrepresented by Western media. For example, earlier this year, China banned burqas in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang which seems like a move directly targeting the Muslim separatists, until you do a bit more research and realize that traditional Uyghur dress doesn't involve burqas at all.  As a matter of fact, the Uyghur Muslims are not the only Muslims in China. The Hui are an ethnic minority in China who have been practicing Islam for centuries and they never show up on the news for these kind of sociopolitical reasons. Which is good, because I need my 串儿 otherwise I'm going to throw a fit.  I don't want the flair and content of my post to make me seem like some sort of Chinese government shill, because I'm not. The Chinese government's hardline stance, combined with archaic, confusing, and sometimes just completely unrelated policies directly targeted at Uyghur minorities, is clearly exacerbating the issue in the area, and I believe that there needs to be change in China's stance. I just wanted to note that the issue may be more complicated than just ""China vs. Muslims"" and there is a significant racial and economic undertone that is in many cases more important than the religious overtone that is put on by the media. Xinjiang province's status in China has been muddled and murky ever since the Qing dynasty, and it doesn't look like there's any solution down the road."

polandball,3dfax8,SockFinn,148,Wed Jul 15 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"Kontext:  Here I present you a map of Germany, consisting of 16 States(Länder).  List of Länder from north to south(sort of):  Schleswig-Holstein   Has coast on both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, connected through the Kiel canal situated in there. There's also the historically important Hanseatic city of Lübeck.   Free Hanseatic City of Bremen   Smallest state of Germany by land area.   Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg   Second-smallest state and also the second-largest city of Germany, houses the second-largest port in Europe.   Mecklenburg-Vorpommern   #1 tourist location of Germany which also has the 2 largest islands in the country, Rügen and Usedom.   Lower Saxony   Second-largest state of Germany by land area. VW comes from there.   Saxony-Anhalt   The Harz mountains are located in there.   Brandenburg and Berlin   Piece of the Berlin Wall and a horrible enclave relationship.   North Rhine-Westphalia   The most populous state of Germany, has the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area with a great industry, football clubs and a lot of immigrants.   Saarland   Was a couple of times an independent state in between the World Wars, but both times voted to go back to Germany. Is the smallest German state that isn't a City state.   Rhineland-Palatinate   The biggest wine producer of all the German states.   Hesse   Houses the busiest airport in Germany, Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.   Thuringia   Has cuisine famous of its variety of sausages, including the Thüringer Rostbratwurst.   Saxony   Neo-nazism and neo-nazi marches in the area   Baden-Württemberg   Car industry(Mercedes-Benz and Porsche), Schwarzwald Forest, cuckoo clocks and Lake Constance(Bodensee). They still haven't defined the mutual country borders of Germany, Austria and Switzerland that would cross the lake.   Bavaria   The largest state of Germany by land area, famous for its beer(and of course, Oktoberfest), BMWs, football clubs and a thing for independence.   I'll give a mention for Alsace too(which is nowadays part of France)   A variety of the Swabian dialect of German is spoken there.       Edit: Gilded! A big kiitos to you for my first gold, mysterious gold-giving stranger! :)"

Er schaut zuerst nach BMW und wird über eine Wartezeit von 3 Monaten informiert. Er ist beeindruckt. Bei Mercedes hört er von einer 6 monatigen Wartezeit und ist sich sicher dass das ein Indiz für die hohe Qualität und Sorgfallt, die deutsche Autos auszeichnet, ist. Dann hört er von einer Marke namens Trabant. Mindestens 5 Jahre Wartezeit. Er ist begeistert und beschließt einen Trabbi zu kaufen, schließlich scheint er mit extrem hohem Aufwand gefertigt zu werden. Als sein Auftrag bei dem VEB Trabant Werke Zwickau eingeht wird die Leitung extatisch. Mit Blick auf die Devisen und Propagandamöglichkeiten wird beschlossen den Auftrag schnellstmöglich zu erfüllen. Zwei Wochen später trifft der Wagen beim Kunden ein. Dieser trifft sich am nächsten Tag mit einem Freund und schwärmt: ""Du, ich habe mir einen Trabant gekauft.

Some interesting notes from that page:   Firefighters from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States military and National Guard assisted with fighting the 2000 fires.  This use of additional personnel and resources highlighted issues in coordinating personnel from different sources.   Environmental differences among countries potentially affected performance of international firefighters.  Crews from Australia and New Zealand left winter climates to arrive in the particularly hot, dry conditions of the western U.S. in 2000.  For Canadian crews, the terrain was also a factor.  One Canadian firefighter noted, “We’re flatlanders.  Where I’m from, this is pretty steep country–really steep country.” Tactics for fighting fires were different.  Canadian crews found themselves fighting fire with dirt instead of water. Use of soldiers and the National Guard necessitated providing basic fire training.  One National Guardsman stated, “When we got here, we didn’t know anything about firefighting.”    (almost seems like material for a  comic)"

polandball,3df2gu,Etherius,7,Wed Jul 15 23:31:13 2015 UTC,What is it with the French (even the faux French) and supporting an entire country defaulting on its debts?
polandball,3df2gu,Pilot0000,7,Wed Jul 15 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"Mine has nothing to do with been 'faux French'. And moral support to the country that gave birth to civilisation is at least to be expected.  EDIT: Plus personally I would like to see a united Europe for once putting its national interests asside and working together as real equals. Greece might not have realised it, but for the first time in its history the EU, worked intensively together, even if it was against one of  their own. The one whom they want to oust, is the one that forced them however indirectly to take a step forward. What pains me though, and I find it ironic to an extend is that the people have fallen victim to foul propaganda."
polandball,3df2gu,Etherius,11,Wed Jul 15 23:42:17 2015 UTC,"How many more billions of Euros worth of ""moral support"" do you suppose Greece deserves?   How many more reforms should they be permitted to refuse enacting?  Are people still avoiding paying property taxes by having pipes sticking out of their roofs?  Greece is a fucking mess and, while I may be American, I haven't seen them enact ANY meaningful changes in the way of combating tax fraud (which may be their biggest problem) or their over bloated public sector."
polandball,3df2gu,Pilot0000,14,Wed Jul 15 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"This is what I call foul propaganda. You are summing up a currupt goverment (succession even) with the entirety of its people. Then you conviniently ignore several people involved in this 'mess' (La Guard first and foremost, Junger the British Prime minister etc) who spoke openly that from 2010 and onwards the plans and loans and ""reforms"" were ill convived. Not that the Greek goverments had nothing to do with it ofc. But if the EU wanted to fix this mess they could have ousted them from the begining or resorted to extreme measures from the start. Not the least to say refuse membership outright. The situation as it is, is convinient to certain interests.   You all seem to believe that the average citizen has been tax frauding so much as if to be rich enough to own Luxemburg. And regarding their public sector there are smaller nations inside the EU that have more civil servants than Greece.Their biggest problem is intervention in their country since its inception after the indipendce war but to know this you must study their history. Which led to a series of corrupt goverments.   The problem is a European one. Yes the Greeks created it and could fix it, but it was a problem that was convinient to everyone and could have been fixed at least 20 years ago with European intervention.  EDIT: ""How many more reforms should they be permitted to refuse enacting"" You honestly believe that the lenders which contrary to common belief are not states, are not expecting to take their money back one way or another and they didnt already had a profit?   All those things are summed up to me and the French as the innability of Europe to manage its own afairs and extend a humane hand to its members while fixing them. And Greece is the textbook case of this innability."
polandball,3df2gu,Etherius,4,Wed Jul 15 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"Hold up.  I never said it was the entirety of its people, nor did I deny the role corrupt governments played in the current predicament.  The amount of tax fraud exhibited by many Greeks is astonishing.  One economist once said that if Greek tax laws were equitably enforced, EVERY medical professional in the country would have been incarcerated.  It IS pretty goddamned bad.  Second, inheriting debt from a corrupt government does not absolve them of that debt.  If I borrow money from the bank to buy a house, never make a payment, and then proceed to die, do my heirs have a right to keep living in that house just because they weren't deadbeats?  No, of course not.  They have to either pay off the loan or sell the house.  Alternately, they could declare bankruptcy and liquidate assets to pay off the loan.  Greece is a government with a LOT of assets they could liquidate to pay their debt.  To allow them to just say ""No, we won't pay 1/3 of the debt we owe and we don't want to accept the consequences of that"" and just be okay with that?  Then what happens to all their creditors?  They're just shit out of luck?  SOMEONE has to get fucked in this deal... it might as well be the ones who did wrong."
polandball,3df2gu,Pilot0000,5,Thu Jul 16 00:11:24 2015 UTC,"Paragraph one:  And I read on a very well known news channel that has world coverage that they also get 900 euro each time they get to their works on time....Multiply that and tell me if its even reasonable. I can tell you from persoanl paycheck 1.2 years in Greece, I didnt get a single boost and I arrived everyday before my shift. Media tell whatever the fuck they want.  Paragraph 2: Who told you to absolve them? The thing is that this mess requires fixing, and everyone so far who (except Soyble maybe) who worked on this case made Press statements admitting that the plans and reforms and strategy was wronng. So we have a nation that is been thrown money at for 6 years and causing the living standards and its own economy to fail because we give it the wrong medication meanwhile we grow the cancer (debt). Again the patient has not been the most cooperative but still.  Paragraph 3. If the EU was interested in that they could have let them do it from the start. Sarkozy called their prime minister a  fucking psycho (spelling) for him wanting to go into a referendum back in 2010-11 for the thing you speak about you know. The problem is the Europeans didnt want to, werent able to or wanted to load more debt and therefore when the bunkruptcy stroke to take more. For 50 years nobody in Greece had no idea that they had resources (Gold, petroleum and gas), and suddenly AFTER the crisis and singing the memorandums, Greece has a fucking treasure trove. Is that happenstance? IDK smells a bit fishy to me.  As to them saying No, its not the first and will not be the last historical precident to be as such. Germany did it too, many other countries did. Allowing a country to set itself streight and then asking for the money is not unheard of not should be considered bad.   As to the creditors, well those are the dangers of gambling. If you are looking for those who did wrong, then it should be the European nations as a whole that did wrong therefore they too must pay the price of their own greed."
polandball,3df2gu,Etherius,3,Thu Jul 16 00:24:19 2015 UTC,"It's my experience that turning discussions such as this one into endlessly extending walls of text is not conducive to any sort of debate, so I'll only answer the most relevant points.  I don't know anyone who believes nonsense like someone getting 900 euros just for being on time.  What I'm talking about is the well-documented grey market in Greece.  I'm not saying people are willfully and knowingly avoiding taxes in Greece.  I'm saying that lackadaisical tax collection combined with a higher-than-average percentage of self-employment in Greece combine to leave Greek coffers coming up VERY short every fiscal year.  Second, the prescribed medicine has worked for every single one of the other PIIGS.  Look at any other of those 5 economies and tell me how austerity programs have caused them to founder.  In each one of them, the story is the same.  Recovery is slow but steady.  It is existent.  Yes, it JUST began turning around recently, and many people are still hurting, but that won't last forever.  So what makes Greece so much different?  Lastly, not one person has offered a real solution to the Greek problem ASIDE from austerity.  You say ""those are the dangers of gambling"", and you're not wrong... but the consequences for Greece are FAR greater in the event of a repudiation of that magnitude.  If Greece were permitted to slash its debt load by 30%, the consequences would be substantial.  NO ONE in the private sector would be willing to lend to them at rates resembling sustainable.  Their bonds would be below junk status, and their only lenders would be foreign governments (AKA: Germany and France).  With such a dearth of buyers for their debt, their rates would be considered generous if they remained under 10%.  How would THAT be sustainable for a healthy Greece?"
polandball,3df2gu,Pilot0000,11,Thu Jul 16 00:35:33 2015 UTC,Good heavens these paragraphs are far too large for polandball! It would take me whole minutes to read them!
polandball,3df2gu,tidux,3,Thu Jul 16 00:39:01 2015 UTC,"I dont dissagree on that the tax problem should be fixed if that is your point. But you must admit the exageration is there. As to who believes it, well you will be unpleasantly surprised.  ""Yes, it JUST began turning around recently, and many people are still hurting, but that won't last forever. So what makes Greece so much different?""  Why dont you ask the people who designed it, enforced and in the end admited their own failure?After all I am not an economist. What I know of though, is this: Ireland didnt finish the plans, it voted to exit before their finish, same did Island. Spain and Portugal are still a mess and far from been able to make a verdict as to weather it worked or not. Italy IDK what is happening. Also you compare countries that have different stats all around: Population, Industrial production, GDP, Resources, budget and even threats. It is only reasonable that worked on country A might not work on country B.  As to your last paragraph: Are their bonds of any value now? What with happening for so many years who realistically wants to invest? The very fact that they invest, to me underlies something else...IDK it might be the scheptic in me.  In all seriousness now, had I be an investor of that magnitude I would simply expect the EU to force to liguidate as you said, and buy whatever I wanted in redicoulous prices. Or they bunkrupt officially and I do the same. For a crow its a win win situation.  The question is therefore not weather to slash their debt, but this: Do we want a healthy Greece without forcing ten million people into poverty,thereby doing the neccessary reforms but also be a bit lenient in our monetery demands?Or do we want Greece to be turned into a carcass and each one of us dibs for morsels when it dies? Whatever the answer it will set a presedent. And that is what (I believe) France sees and thus wants to ensure the most humane and solidary solution possible."

polandball,3ddo78,stasia89,5,Wed Jul 15 15:58:11 2015 UTC,filled the skin with money stolen from the Greek people   greece is refusing to pay back their debts. lots of europeans loaned them money and now all they have to do is cut their spending and the EU basically pays for three years of debt repayments that they owe.  so if greece borrows and doesn't pay as long as he cuts spending then that means greece is a...

Now, don't take it the wrong way, or get misled by what I'm saying. I did not say the US is the most accomplished country of all time, or that it is ""the best in history"", I simply pointed out, that over the past 100 years (around 1900-2000s), the US can very easily take the title as the most accomplished country in the world. In the past 100 years, the US has accomplished so much in the fields of technology, science, medicine, and global cultural influence, that no other country can compare over the same period.  The impact the US has left on the world over the past century is so large, that life as we know it would literally be entirely different if the US hadn't existed or been as influential. There's a reason the 20th century is called the American century.  Anybody that gets offended by this fact, simply has an inferiority complex, and is too brainwashed and arrogant to admit it."

polandball,3ddhut,Pilot0000,5,Fri Jul 17 11:47:23 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true: The Soviets needed time, time that was bought by dragging (sorry for the word but its the best description) the cannon foder of British and French colonies to fight in Europe. The statistical loses of the colonies combinied (in military not civilians) are higher than the actual European nations, excluding the eventual retaliation of the Soviet Union and their mass loses in the end."
polandball,3ddhut,protohom,2,Wed Jul 15 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that before the French surrendered? In my understanding, the colonials were employed in the north African theatre and the Italian theatre before the Western Front was opened.

polandball,3ddhut,Pilot0000,4,Wed Jul 15 16:17:22 2015 UTC,I think I am missing you point. What wasnt before the French surrendered? The French surrender was far too early in the war.
polandball,3ddhut,Gawdfather,2,Wed Jul 15 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"I meant the French colonial troops employed in war. There were about some 70 regiments and 13 battalions of colonials in 1940 serving the French army. As for the Indian army, it was only employed in the North African and Italian campaigns. I think you meant the African and Italian campaigns in your comment."

polandball,3ddhut,IsaacM42,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"My comment was about Nazi Germany. US did the major share in the Pacific theatre, but they were late as usual. US was not fighting single handedly like the USSR either. The British, Aussies, Indians, Chinese, Pinoys and many others did their fair share as well.  As for the one-on-one part, the Western front opened up only by June, 1944"
polandball,3ddhut,Etherius,2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"Is that why Stalin spent the entire first half of the war begging Churchill to open a second front?  Without operation overlord splitting the German resources, Moscow would've fallen like a house of cards.  Even Stalin knew that.  Soviet victory in Stalingrad alone cost the USSR far more than it cost the Germans... And the Soviets had already proven their incompetence with expeditionary operations when they got their shit pushed in by the Finns... A nation right next door.  You expect anyone to believe the USSR could've pushed to Berlin against the Germans... alone?   IMO it's only by the grace of Truman that Patton didn't get his wish to keep marching east until he hit Moscow.  He assessed that Soviet supply lines were fragile and the only thing keeping their whole army going was morale."

polandball,3ddhut,demon321x2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:48:19 2015 UTC,"not alone. USA wasn't doing that well against Japan at the start either.  We had our Shit pushed in because F2As and F4Fs tried to fight zeros the wrong way. It wasn't until coral sea and midway where we began to push back.   USA and Russia once they got situated began to push back both Germany and Japan. We aided each other. Expecially the fact that the invasion of Russia placed a large toll on the Germans along with our ever increasing strategic bombing campaigns.   The Soviets did get alot of help at the start with our lend-lease program. Expecially before they had a comparable airforce to the luftwaffe. Expecially our shipments of P-39s and P-63s along with other things.   I'm sure usa would have suffered the same as the Soviet Union did, if we had to face Japan invading our mainland in full force.   One thing the Soviets can be creditied with is the fact that once they started to push back, they where hard for them to be stopped by the Germans. They kept going till they hit Berlin destroying everything in their path."
polandball,3ddhut,WestenM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of a Japanese invasion of mainland USA is a pipe dream by armchair historians.  Yamamoto (as well as other Japanese brass) knew invading the mainland USA was impossible.  The attack on Pearl Harbor wasn't the opening salvo against America, but a bid to keep us from entering the war."
polandball,3ddhut,Long-Schlong-Silvers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:51:08 2015 UTC,If Germany had been competent they wouldn't have attacked Russia while still fighting on the Western Front.

polandball,3dayma,GruePwnr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:45:22 2015 UTC,"Mahayana Buddhism is similar to Hindu but was connected more so to Sikhism than Hinduism, Theravada Buddhism is the older, less popular version which tries to stick to Siddhartha's original teachings and is not related to Hinduism in much any way other than they were persecuted by Hindus. In Mahayana Buddhism the Buddha is ""like"" a god or spirit while in Theravada Buddhism the Buddha is a state of enlightenment reached by living according to the eight-fold path, which was first reached by Siddhartha Gautama when he meditated below a tree for several weeks. This form of Buddhism is called ""non-theist"" which is a way of saying atheist without being persecuted or considered inferior. This is my understanding of Buddhism."
polandball,3dayma,protohom,2,Wed Jul 15 06:48:36 2015 UTC,"they were persecuted by Hindus   What? Buddhism vanished in India because of the Islamic invasions, lack of state support (it was a state religion) and Adi Shankara, who defeated the numerous Buddhist philosophers in debate. Buddhists were never persecuted by Hindus.  And you don't need to teach me about Siddhartha Gauthama, every Hindu knows of him from childhood. He is even revered as an Avatara of Vishnu. Tell me, do you know how Buddha's teaching differs from other schools of philosophy? Because your understanding of Mahayana Buddhism is the same as the Samkhya or other schools."
polandball,3dayma,GruePwnr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:10:28 2015 UTC,"Buddhists were persecuted by pretty much everyone in that area at one point or another, King Pushyamitra specifically pushed them out when he began to take control of Northern India. The Mahayana Buddhists however have always been in good relations with the Hindus especially as India began to become more of a whole like it is now rather than the mess of ethnicities it once was."
polandball,3dayma,Sciencepenguin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, about Pushyamitra Sunga. He was the lonely Hindu king who persecuted Buddhists in the 2500 years of Buddhism. Don't you think the negative Buddhist accounts of him could be because he was the usurper to the Maurya throne? And he may have withdrawn the state support of Buddhism too. There are no other accounts of persecution by Hindus, even in Buddhist sources.  And why would Hindus persecute them anyway? Indic faiths are very different from the Abrahamic ones, and we don't believe ours is the only way to god. And there wasn't much distinguishing Buddhists from the plethora of monastic practices in Hinduism then. The distinctions between Indic religions came about ones the Westerners began to classify them.   You have not answered my other questions either. I believe you, as an outsider, is imagining differences and persecutions that we have never felt. I can be a Hindu and follow Buddha's teachings as I please. Such distinctions only exist in your minds, not in actual practice here."

The Tunisian flag however is derived from the ottoman star and crescent a Turkic symbol as the star and crescent only became a symbol of Islam in the twentieth century.

But the Dutch version of clogged isn't what one would think, 'geklompt' but it is 'verstopt' (literally translated: hidden). Although if you were to literally translate the word 'clogged' taken out of context you would instead of getting 'geklompt' (again, not a word) get 'geklont' which it surprisingly similar.

polandball,3d8z13,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,5,Tue Jul 14 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"Stroopwafels have thus far never failed to bend any foreigner to our will, though. It is a well known fact that the Nazi's never really wanted to invade the Netherlands. Many say they did it anyways because they wanted a faster way to Brittland. But, the actual truth is that they wanted to capture the Stroopwafel production, which as a result moved underground in the hands of the resistance.   After the war the Americans were, just like after WW1, very reluctant to give any financial aid. It is said that just 1 bag of Stroopwafels send to the Americans changed all that and inspired the Marshall help program. Because a single bag of Stroopwafels only contains 10, a fight broke out under the US top government officials. The results of this fight is said to have killed Roosevelt.   In the 90s it is believed that the Soviets, starved for long of good food, saw a man eating Stroopwafels on the other side of the wall. Even the Soviet guards dropped their weapons and ran for the West. The mass of people was so large that the wall fell and Germany was reunited. This is why they still as of today keep their fuel and booze prices so cheap: So that we can visit them and shop cheaply. Sadly, the newer generation seems to have forgotten that (look at the new German plans)."

As I understand it, there are two pieces of additional context you could add to more accurately describe the situation:  1) Germany lets Greece into the pool even though they don't have a certificate.  2) Germany, being part of the pool company, benefits directly from having as many people as possible use the pool  Of course Greece also lied about being able to swim, knew they couldn't swim and tried to swim anyway.  Obviously it gets way more complicated when you consider the relationship between the government and the populace, and who the populace has the right to be mad at and what level of responsibility do they share in the decisions of their government. With that said, it seems to me to just be another chapter in free market economics: two parties act in their own self and short-term interest and blame the other when it all falls apart in the long term.  So I'm asking. rather uninformed on the topic, how fair of a characterization do you think that is? What am I missing? I'm sure I'm missing some things. I know this is polandball and I don't take it too seriously, but I still like to think about this stuff and I thought I'd ask you your thoughts."
polandball,3d9nbt,Grenshen4px,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:43:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I agree with your first point. Actually on the second too, although Greece would be more like a (perhaps less powerful) partner in the business and not just a customer of 'europool'. I understand that the Greece population is upset about the situation (and that they have a seriously hard time) but the call to boycott Germany as a response is ridiculous to me."
polandball,3d9nbt,ama_deo,2,Wed Jul 15 11:53:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. I looked around a bit and the thing I find hilarious is that Goldman Sachs essentially sold a bunch of Credit Default Swaps to Greece that temporarily reduced it's debt in the short term. This is hilarious because Goldman made that deal around the same time they were making actual CD Swaps based on securities derived from the American housing market. That is literally what tanked our economy in 2008.  If I was going to blame anyone, I would blame the EU's regulatory agencies. Eurostat I believe it is?"

The first panel is still just 90% white space, which won't generate an interesting thumbnail. The amount of different colors can't be the only thing the algorithm looks at, it must also take into account on how big of an area those colors are spread out."
polandball,3dav1b,yohney,4,Tue Jul 14 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a combination of some sort. The last panel in this comic is the most spread-out and colourful with the most amount of colours per pixel."
polandball,3dav1b,Maxi_W,3,Wed Jul 15 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"most amount of colours per pixel.   Aren't pixels just one colour, as they're the smallest unit for that stuff?   I'm just taking wild guesses here."

polandball,3dav1b,DickRhino,3,Wed Jul 15 12:12:27 2015 UTC,"So if here's no work around to prevent the spoilers while drawing perhaps we should impliment some reddit side spoiler prevention, perhaps use some built in feature that hides the thumbnails..."
polandball,3dav1b,Yodude1,3,Wed Jul 15 03:29:58 2015 UTC,"The NSFW tag is for letting people know what content is unsuitable for viewing at work. It is not meant for hiding thumbnails, and it shouldn't be used that way either.  Remember that many people have NSFW filtering, which means that for them it's not just the thumbnail that is hidden; the entire post becomes invisible to them. They will never know that the comic is even there. We don't consider that to be a good fix for something that practically no one is even bothered by in the first place.  The NSFW tag is not a ""built in feature to hide thumbnails""."
polandball,3dav1b,nondetermined,2,Wed Jul 15 07:44:16 2015 UTC,I wondered why we weren't allowed to use NSFW. This makes perfect sense.
polandball,3dav1b,houad,2,Wed Jul 15 10:10:53 2015 UTC,Maybe the admins are working on this as a mod tool or something?
polandball,3dav1b,nondetermined,2,Wed Jul 15 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that such an algorithm scales the image down in a first step for further processing. And then you can imagine what will happen to your funny pixels up there, right?  Other than that, go have a cup of coffee (or two) and do a quick google search for ""image entropy cropping"". Often this is simply based on edge detection (after converting the image to grayscale, mind you).   A nice starting point, in case you're interested, might be this: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1wz2e4/cropping_images_in_php_based_on_their_entropy/  And if you dig a bit deeper, you'll find lot's of nice papers, like this one here: http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~xsh835/Saliency_CVPR12.pdf    tl;dr: a line of multicolor pixels? It does nothing!!"
polandball,3dav1b,houad,2,Wed Jul 15 07:42:58 2015 UTC,"If you look at the reddit code, it doesn't do anything that complicated. It just computes colour entropy straight away, unless I got it wrong."
polandball,3dav1b,DickRhino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:23:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, why, yes. We could also just have a look at the actual code, 8), which seems to just cut off 10px from the top or bottom (which ever has less entropy), until the desired hight has been reached. But if the image first gets scaled down to the default thumbnail width, you can imagine that this color-strip gets blurred into oblivion; so not much entropy will be left up there. Maybe you guys wanna try larger blocks instead of pixels to trick the robot."
polandball,3dav1b,LiamNL,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"If this is the code that does it as I think it is, the only thing the code does is calculate entropy in horizontal slices of the picture, and take the maximum.  So you need to put something that actually affects the entropy of the top square of your image. A single, hand-made line of pixels won't do it, but a few lines or computer-generated noise will probably work."
polandball,3dav1b,LiamNL,2,Wed Jul 15 09:22:03 2015 UTC,"Ah. Thank you Vikomt DickRhino. Although that leads me to believe the only way to not spoil the joke is to go have one drawn panel more detailed. That might then ruin the flow of the comic, or require a 'pointless' panel that was more detailed so I'm still a little uncertain of one to get around this..."
polandball,3dav1b,Stuhl,3,Wed Jul 15 10:14:33 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with having more panels be well-drawn than just the final one? I honestly don't see how the ""flow of the comic"" would in any way be ruined by having things happen in earlier panels as well.  My philosophy has always been that if possible, every single panel should be funny in it's own right, and not merely being used as time filler until one reaches the punchline. If you consider any part of the comic ""pointless"", then it probably shouldn't even be there in the first place. I just don't understand that reasoning at all."
polandball,3dav1b,Tintenlampe,2,Wed Jul 15 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"You're perfectly right.  What I meant was, if you weren't planning on it, and the last panel happens to have more detail and be shown, to get around this you'd have to add more detail to other panels. I don't favour the ""other panels are fillers"" or the ""last panel should be the best"" mentality. In this comic, for example, most panel only have two countries in them. The last one happens to be the busiest due to the colour scheme. To avoid this, I'd need to add more to another panel which wasn't in the plan.  Either way, I'll use this as a learning point to improve the quality of future panels and comics as a whole :)"

polandball,3d9pyu,thirdegree,19,Tue Jul 14 22:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it was also a reaction to the expansion of the federal government.   Before the civil war the US was often called 'These United States' and each state had its own military. In french, it is still Les Etats-Unis. Pre civil-war US was more like modern day EU.   The governmental term of confederation means a limited governmental grouping of independent nation states. The confederate constitution starts its first sentence acknowledging states rights ""We, the people of the Confederate States, each State acting in its sovereign and independent character.....""  So yes slavery was absolutely the largest cause for the civil war but the limitation of federalism was still a huge part of that.   Edit: I found Article IV of the CSA telling of the situation as well. Particularly that is specifically calls it negro slavery not just slavery.   ""...In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected..."""

polandball,3d9pyu,Prez_Material,4,Wed Jul 15 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yes but they were given liberty to expand and multiply under their own laws as long as they paid tariffs to the King. Many opportunistic people fled to the colonies because they were under looser laws and no one would care if a Native American tribe were pushed out. It was a fair deal and the founders knew it; the ideal of freedom and liberty to colonise and expand were well respected amongst colonists, the revolutionaries tactfully manipulated the ideal into an independence scheme that the people could unite under. The 'stars and stripes' which so many loyal Americans parade under everyday, is not representative of general freedom but shows how manipulation and tact can lead to uprising."

Most cultures had slaves that were captured in war, and many had ways for slaves to work off their debt and enter society. The system of slavery that the Confederacy was advocating was brutal, dehumanizing and utterly devoid of hope, far beyond any other system of slavery that was widely practiced.  While comparing it to Nazism isn't quite valid (we can all admit that the Holocaust was far and above anything the Confederacy did), that doesn't change the fact that the Confederacy was an evil excuse for a government that only existed on the pain, suffering and death of an entire race of people."

polandball,3d9pyu,Sharknado_1,2,Wed Jul 15 04:14:30 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? Statements like these honestly belong on r/badhistory, the entire war stemmed from a cultural divide that occurred with a social pyramid founded on slavery, and when the dominating factor of that pyramid was bound to be freed by Abolitionists, and a President from the Republican Party, a well known Abolitionist group, threatened the political prowess of the South, many states seceded. Without slavery there is no chance in hell that would happen, slavery was apart of their customs and life in the south, from the vantage point of the poor/farmhands, slaves would absorb most the blows or beatings that otherwise they'd have to take, and to the rich they had literal control of Human beings in an agrarian based economy, the land wasn't going to farm itself..   The excuse that they started the Civil War was states rights is a strawman, of course it was states rights... states rights to have slaves.. The other excuse that Slavery wasn't even a factor in the war until Abraham Lincoln needed more manpower is also absolute bullshit, it is true Abraham Lincoln kept tactfully quiet about slavery to maintain the slave states that were preserved in the Union from defecting, but other than that slavery was inevitably bound to become defunct, and slaves were bound to be free, abolitionist sentiment at the start of the war towards the end of the war was growing. Slavery was the single most important reason for the war starting, and was the catalyst for the entire war."

They are historical fact. 4 million slaves lived in the South, Abraham Lincoln, as candidate to become President, wanted to prevent admitted states into the Union from being slave states, the South, fearful of a slave revolt consistently opposed any legislation that would lessen their grip on their slaves. This caused greater divide, until Lincoln's election in 1860 when South Carolina seceded dramatically from the Union, and every other CSA member followed.

It doesn't matter if it was the 1% or the 99% who controlled the slaves. There were slaves, and everyone defended the slave owners rights to have them through their actions of secession."
polandball,3d9pyu,Tropic33,2,Thu Jul 16 05:26:15 2015 UTC,"Not really. Most were just poor farmers barely able to make ends meet. Sure the plantation owners were getting rich, but not every white man was getting rich. Not every black man was a slave either. There were plenty of abolitionists in the South too.   Not to mention the whole lack of education a lot of farmers of that time period had. You can't expect them to be the most progressive people in the world. What the farmers were told was that the North was attacking their way of life, and they should sign up to defend their nation. How would the farmers know any different?"
polandball,3d9pyu,PM_ME_FIREARMS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"But there was instilled racism in these farmers, 4 million African Americans were enslaved in the south, and 500,000 freed African Americans spread throughout the country, many of which migrated to the North to avoid persecution throughout the war.  As Southern Historian Gordon Rhea puts it ""As Southerners became increasingly isolated, they reacted by becoming more strident in defending slavery.  The institution was not just a necessary evil: it was a positive good, a practical and moral necessity.  Controlling the slave population was a matter of concern for all Whites, whether they owned slaves or not."" Churches, politicians, slave owners all pushed the rhetoric that the way of life was about owning slaves, so many people who defend the ""innocent"" of the CSA often use the term ""way of life"" recklessly, without realizing the context of their ""way of life"" meaning to own black humans, which were seen as inferior, not only culturally, politically, but spiritually inferior as many Churches suggested.  ""Reverend Furman of South Carolina insisted that the right to hold slaves was clearly sanctioned by the Holy Scriptures.  He emphasized a practical side as well, warning that if Lincoln were elected, 'every Negro in South Carolina and every other Southern state will be his own master; nay, more than that, will be the equal of every one of you.  If you are tame enough to submit, abolition preachers will be at hand to consummate the marriage of your daughters to black husbands.' "" The Church was to many in the South a place of congregation and meeting.. And nearly every Church in the South was against Abolition and preached that Holy Scriptures had backed them, if you think only Slave Owners attended this meeting than you're wrong, more often than not laborers and other members of the lower class would attend to find salvation, only to have it politicized to convince them that owning slaves was good. It wasn't only Farmers in the South, it was the entire structure of the pyramid that was above slaves, and benefited from slaves."
polandball,3d9pyu,Tropic33,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"As I said,  there was racism at the time. While it was certainly a factor,  and led to the secession,  it did not cause the war. The war itself was started by Lincoln refusing to move his troops out. Lincoln himself was willing to compromise on slavery,  showing he was more interested in keeping the union together than abolishing slavery. A house divided against itself can not stand. The south had agriculture,  cotton which was needed for the textile mills in the north."
polandball,3d9pyu,PM_ME_FIREARMS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"If you want to be absolutely technical and down to the wire, sure. But it was a major factor for the cause of the war, and throughout the war. Lincoln's individual choice as a tactician doesn't diminish the wave of fervor surrounding the Abolition movement, and Lincoln was willing to compromise on slavery to stem the war in the first place, but the South was unwilling as slavery was detrimental to their way of life. See how this comes full circle? Slavery did cause the war, because had there not been slaves, the fear of a Slave Rebellion would not have been present and the Southerners wouldn't have seceded upon Lincoln's election. What went down in the South regarding Slavery was pure demagoguery and it's amazing that people to this day still choose pride over facts."
polandball,3d9pyu,Tropic33,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, the abolition movement was gaining a lot of traction, especially in the North. Lincoln himself was against slavery. But first and foremost, he was trying to keep the Union together. Slavery did lead into the war, but the North wasn't exactly innocent either. They had really shitty workshop conditions. Look up mill towns.   I would think, although this is just speculation, that after a few decades of seeing the mill towns do well, the plantation owners would start using that system instead, seeing as they could probably make a better profit.

Flying a flag doesn't mean complete agreement with everything done under that flag. We should be changing the English, American, Dutch, Spanish and many more flags if that was the case.

On the one hand I don't think that public spaces, properties, buildings, etc. should be showing support to anything other than the U.S. (in the U.S. of course) maybe armed forces if it's appropriate, or other government divisions as appropriate, but on the other, I also believe that the people who run those buildings deserve their own freedom of expression.

polandball,3d9pyu,Tambien,5,Wed Jul 15 02:09:33 2015 UTC,"Perhaps because it stands for different things for different people? For many it's a sign of individualism and rebelliousness, and regardless of whether you agree with them or not that's what it means to them.   NOTE: I don't own a Confederate flag nor do I plan to, but I think the feeding frenzy over the flag went quite a bit too far.

But this comparison is like saying the UK shouldn't fly their flag because it represents colonialism. The confederate flag is the equivalent of the Nazi flag to most people. This is a special case. The confederate flag was SPECIFICALLY MEANT for a country that was founded specifically to continue slavery. There's a big difference. Then there's the fact that the confederate flag is also specifically used by hate groups. The confederate flag is used today by the KKK as a symbol which they adopted after the civil war. The U.S. Flag just represents America. It doesn't represent atrocities we've committed anymore than the Belgian flag represents the Belgian Congo."

The firebombings of Japanese cities were more devastating than the nukes ever were even on an individual basis. And on top of that if they weren't used the only way Japan would have surrendered is not at all. By the time the nukes were used Japan had already lost the war. The only question was when would they accept that fact. The answer allied brass and intelligence found to that question was ""never"" unless something drastic happened. The land invasion of Japan (which was becoming more and more unavoidable as the US island hopped closer and closer) was predicted to cause hundreds of thousands more American casualties and the genocide of the Japanese people.   Yes nukes in general are horrible and fortunately haven't been used outside that one instance but dropping them was one of the most ethical and humane things any country (both axis and ally) did over the course of that terribly horrible war.  Also if you're gonna call the us out on shady shit, banana republics, the supression of ""unfavorable"" democracies through coups and installation of ""favorable"" totalitarian regimes, japanese internment, the royal buttfucking of the Philippines, and the arming of insurgent groups in foreign countries are way better examples than the nukes."

polandball,3d8sk6,thedorkofyork,7,Wed Jul 15 01:33:17 2015 UTC,"This is not a matter of separation of powers, it is a matter of federalism. This reform has been conducted entirely through the judicial branch. The Texas Attorney General's main responsibility is the direction of all of the state's lawyers, mostly prosecutors. State judge are (de jure) independent of politics, being elected or appointed by the governor. How this happens varies by state and I am not a Texan, so I do not know the specifics. I can tell you that what the Texas Attorney General says is irrelevant for two reasons: he is not the person who has ultimate authority of the interpretation of Texas State law, the Texas Supreme Court is. The most important reason is that state law is inferior to federal law; the federal decisions trump local ones. Even if the Texas Supreme Court ruled that outlawing gay marriage was constitutional, their ruling wouldn't matter for the United States Supreme Court has already ruled on the matter and they have primacy. That is federalism. The states can rule on the small local matters and the feds take care of the matters important enough to warrant national attention, but all the states must follow what the feds say. If a state doesn't like it, sucks to be them. A federal law is the manifestation of the will of all of the American people and a Supreme Court ruling is the manifestation of the constitution of all of the American people. If the states could choose to ignore these things, the Union would be a ""rope of sand"".   Isn't democracy all about making laws to stop people doing things you don't like?   Sort of, but I wouldn't say that all laws are restrictive by nature. The thing is that if we allowed the People to make whatever laws they like, sooner or later a law would be created that contradicts a basic human right. Segregation for example. The constitution is meant to counteract this, among other things. It limits the ability of the government to legislate in certain areas, therefore defending the rights of the Individual from the People. The Supreme Court decision is part of this. It deemed that the constitution did not give the government the ability to ban marriages and that there has been no good argument to show that gay marriages would conflict with other people's rights. Thus targeting gay marriages specifically is unconstitutional discrimination.  In essence, what consenting adults do with each other is their own business, as long as it does not hurt themselves or others. The government can encourage certain life choices, but, if it cannot give a good reason why said choice hurts people or their rights, it cannot stop them.  My butthurt is over, return to your polandball."

If you feel your way of life needs to be validated by the government there really isn't much I can say to you.   What the Supreme court really ruled was that marriage is a right that everyone should be able to partake in(disagree, but kinda understand) and that by not acknowledging gays they were actually disenfranchising them.

Does that mean they can't be differentiated so that certain ones get different privileges? I don't know and I don't care enough to spend the time to dissect the official report.   Do you see the problem with your position? If the government gives everybody the same privilege (in this case marriage, whose privileges are both in terms of actuality and prestige) and then arbitrarily denies that same privilege to a group of people without being able to give a good reason for doing so (in this case gays, in the past interracial couples), then that is discrimination. People are protected from such discrimination by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution (my second favorite amendment, right after the 1st). These problems have already been met in the past with Loving vs Virginia and Brown vs Board. Namely that marriage is a settled right that cannot be arbitrarily refused and the Separate is not Equal. A Civil Union, while equal in strict actual terms is not equal in prestige. The people involved in Civil Unions do not get the same sense of satisfaction as they do out of marriage and, by creating a separation, it is leaving the door open for such unions to be put into the cultural ""other"" by society. The law cannot be blind to such morale concerns, even if they are far less important then de jure matters. By your logic, everything would have been fine if we did not allow mixed race couples to get married but instead limited them to civil unions. Can you see how such a thing would be demeaning. As one half of a mixed race couple myself, I cannot stand for such things and I am glad that the Supreme Court has ended what began with Loving. Now marriage is equal in America as well as parts of Europe. May such enlightenment spread to all lands.   What the Supreme court really ruled was that marriage is a right that everyone should be able to partake in(disagree, but kinda understand) and that by not acknowledging gays they were actually disenfranchising them.   Close, but you missed an important subtlety. The Court said that everyone has a right to marry. Gays start out with said right to marry, the same as everyone else. That is the default position. Laws forbidding gay marriage contradict this right. Since said right is guaranteed in the constitution, any such laws forbidding gay marriage are unconstitutional. It is not extending a right to a people that didn't have it, it is realizing that said people had said right and that it must be defended.  PS: When did /r/polandball turn into a subreddit on constitutional law?"
polandball,3d8sk6,demon321x2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"Race is very different than sexuality especially in marriage. I think I disagree with the fact marriage can't be favored towards straight couples for obvious reasons(kids). I just don't see sexuality as some kind of protected class like race. The only place should ever be relevant is in marriage. Under any other circumstance no one(aside from friends) should even know. It should be considered a personality quirk and treated as such.    A Civil Union, while equal in strict actual terms is not equal in prestige. The people involved in Civil Unions do not get the same sense of satisfaction as they do out of marriage   Prestige is irrelevant. As I said if you need the government(or others) to acknowledge your lifestyle no one can help you. If not being able to use the word married is hurting them I can't help them. I don't think that is where the problem is. I think the problem is that most people don't view them as equal. Society as a whole doesn't look at them the same way as straight people. Not even negatively per se, but they are viewed as different. The government can't fix that and I think using the government to fix it only makes it worse. Society values certain things more than others. Being able to make children is something highly valued by society. Gay people can't/don't want to partake in procreation so they lose out on some of the benefits society offers directly related to procreation to those who do. 9 people on bench aren't society. The inherent problem won't change because of the decision. All that will change is the words people say. In my opinion nothing has changed. Civil rights happened when MLK showed whites how horrible they were to blacks. His goal was never a law that said they were equal. His goal was to convince people that they were equal and I think he did a good job. People react strongly when they feel they've been forced to do something against their will. More than appropriate and more than they would normally act because they feel threatened. True change will have happened when Gay Pride parades are no longer needed. When gays no longer feel it necessary to continue fighting because there is nothing to fight for. The real problem is how far is that and is it too far to be pursued.

polandball,3d8sk6,thedorkofyork,3,Wed Jul 15 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"I too will end my side here. I will try to be brief, but is impossible to be brief in legal matters.   I think I disagree with the fact marriage can't be favored towards straight couples for obvious reasons(kids).   I believe that this position is misled for two main reasons. Many gay couples start stable families with either their own children (with one partner in a lesbian couple often getting artificially inseminated) or by adopting others. In fact, the high rates of adoption amongst gay couples is one of the best things that could happen to America's orphans. Many more children will now find homes when they would have found cold institutions otherwise. The other point is that our culture, for a hundred - two hundred years has not cared if infertile couples got married. I grant you that infertility used to be a factor in the middle ages, but within living memory, such infertility has not been a problem. We do not force infertile couples to have civil unions so why should we force gay people to take on that status. To the greater good, what is the difference between a gay couple and an infertile couple? None at all, thus they should be treated the same.   Society as a whole doesn't look at them the same way as straight people. Not even negatively per se, but they are viewed as different.   That sounds like something to fix, not accept.   Prestige is irrelevant. As I said if you need the government(or others) to acknowledge your lifestyle no one can help you.   On this point, we simply disagree. I understand your position and, in a perfect world, it would be a logical solution. However, when one creates a separation one invites judgement. I refer back to the arguments against civil unions that I made in my previous post. I also present a new one. If you are right, and civil unions are the exact same thing as marriage in every way, then why have civil unions? What is their utility? Why not call it a marriage? What good does it do to call it something different? If gay couples want to get married and we agree to give them everything that marriage entails, then what good does it do to change the name and dissatisfy the couple? It does no good at all and the Supreme Court agrees with me, the State has not provided a good reason for this different status.   Civil rights happened when MLK showed whites how horrible they were to blacks. His goal was never a law that said they were equal.   I am a historian and, while my specialty is not American history, I cannot allow such a misunderstanding to pass. The majority of the Civil Rights Movement's strategy was by forcing progress through Supreme Court rulings and then through the passage of laws. Yes, forcing the whites of America to confront their own racism was part of the process but this was part of building up a base for future legislation. The goal was not convince all of society period, it was to convince enough Americans so that reform can be enacted. Once that reform was enacted, the ability of racists to resist progress was severely diminished. We still have a lot of racism in our country, but we have made much progress. America's original sin is hard to purge from our body."

Even the Israeli workers association which offers vacations for Israeli workers during Israeli holidays like Passover or Hannukah canceled Turkey as an option and offers vacations to Greece, Italy, Spain instead. You can blame it on the Mavi Marmara, but Israel apologized and paid reparations, and yet he continued with his way and continued inciting and the relations did not normalize.  Erdogan's remarks on the Israeli-Gaza conflict - ""“The government and I will never look positively [at Israel] as long as we are in power … [Israel] may seem like the winner for now. But it will eventually be defeated,” Erdoğan said, before calling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi an “illegitimate tyrant,” for attempting to broker a peace agreement to end the conflict.""  So no, no exaggeration, Erodgan does not want to normalize relations with Israel, so why should Israelis enter more Turkish liras to the Turkish economy. I prefer turning my Shekels to Euros.  When relations will normalize, and when Turks will stop hating Israelis(Emphasis on Israelis, they can hate the Israeli government as much as they want), Israeli tourism to Turkey will return. In the mean time, Greece and Cyprus are good and cheap destinations to replace Turkey. Also, there are still Israelis who vacation in Turkey but they are few, and Turkish Airlines still works in Israel, but mostly as connection flights through Istanbul to other destinations(I flew Turkish Airlines to China)."

They used the area as a refueling point on the spice route to India. After starting the city of Cape Town and becoming the Batavian Republic the British showed up and not politely took it off their hands. Dutch colonists trekked inwards on ""The Great Trek"" setting up colonies in the interior of the country, among them today's Capital and seat of Government - Pretoria.  A short while later the British totally not butthurt about the wealth and success of these goldmining new inland colonies, showed up again and took control of it. After forming the separate colonies into the Union of South Africa, a vote was passed in 1948 which set up new laws with the Nasionale Party in power. Citing their conservative and traditional beliefs they enforced this ever expanding law with a pretty iron fist. This officially served as the beginning of the infamous Apartheid.  Meanwhile, back in the Netherlands - the source of these 'traditional' beliefs - the Dutch have become almost stereotypically liberal, legalising many things that are still fought over in more conservative countries, often being seen as one of the most open-minded nations on Earth. Is funny."

While it started migrating to red in 1650 it would have been a slow change and in 1652 and aboard a ship that had set out a long while before it would most likely have been orange still...  You can also see it as orange in this really famous image of the Dutch in Table Bay and while that's probably not super accurate as artists are famous for anachronisms, it's probably pretty true...

The number of Dutchmen throughout the entirety of Dutch Asia for example wouldn't have been more than a few thousand for most of the pre-modern period.

polandball,3d6ftc,Death_Brownie,6,Mon Jul 13 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"For more context.  In the early 1900's there was a large movement to change the spellings of many english words with the intent to make English less contradictory and easier to learn. For example, in the US the Simplified Spelling Board fought to change a whole bunch of words to what it considered easier to learn, but much of it didn't take hold. One of the more popular movements was the removal of the letter ""U"" where it was seen as unnecessary (although this movement was also present before the SSB, it was just accelerated). England also had their own movement, but it didn't take hold as much in the UK as in the US."
polandball,3d6ftc,dpny,16,Tue Jul 14 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"Goes back earlier than that. When Noah Webster wrote his first books on grammar in the late 1700s, English orthography wasn't nearly as standardized as it is now. He chose to simplify the spelling of words, choosing a phonetic spelling for terms like color, check and center to better represent how the words were actually pronounced. This carried over to his dictionary, by which time the language he was cataloging had turned into a recognizable American form of English.  tl;dr: Suck it, England."

polandball,3d6ftc,The_sad_zebra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:05:20 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering, it was Noah Webster who made these changes. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, all the US wanted was to not be like Europe, so Webster decided that his contribution would be to change the spelling of different words to be spelled more like they sound.  There were also some much crazier changes he made (look it up) that didn't catch on."

One of their beliefs was that they could sell God's Grace because the Church was good and had a boatload of it they didn't need. They would cut down time in purgatory/hell if you donated money to them. They turned forgiveness into a commercial good and advertised well enough people actually bought it. If that isn't capitalism I don't know what is. What's even better is that no one could prove it didn't work so they didn't have to worry about a defective product. They literally created a product based solely on belief and sold it to people. And the people don't even know if the product works and yet they want to buy more. They are truly model entrepreneurs that we should all aspire to be like.

polandball,3d7fuo,reichtangly,12,Tue Jul 14 09:18:21 2015 UTC,"No Catholicism was Feudal, in fact it was the largest feudal landowner in Europe for a very long time.  And Feudalism is an entirely different economic system from capitalism, capitalism is what replaced feudalism mostly through the 18th and early 19th century.  What you're describing selling a commodity (forgiveness in this case) is a market transaction, markets aren't exclusive to the capitalist system."
polandball,3d7fuo,SpiSpySpi,0,Tue Jul 14 07:15:55 2015 UTC,There is no such thing as feudal.
polandball,3d7fuo,quacainia,10,Tue Jul 14 08:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yes there is. Gross oversimplification incoming but it covers the basics. And I have to go to class in a bit.  Feudalism: An economic system wherein a bunch of people (serfs) work the land of a lord (who can be a member of the clergy like say a Bishop), everything they produce for X amount of days they get to keep themselves and everything they produce for X amount of days their lord takes. The lord then gets to do with his bit as he sees fit so do the serfs with theirs (though most likely the serf will use their bit to feed their families with little left over). The lord is likely to distribute some of his stuff to people in his employ who don't work the land (like bureaucrats) so they don't starve. He might also trade some of it with other lords for goods his own lands don't produce, he might do that using a market (or not).  Capitalism: An economic system in which a bunch of people work for a boss and he pays them for their labor, they don't get to keep any of what they produce (be it goods or services). The various bosses then take the produce and sell it on a market where the people can also go to buy the various products. Hence why capitalism is often thought to be synonymous with 'the market' since the market tends to be the main way goods get distributed in a capitalist system.  Feudalism was done away with in a number of events like the French revolution and mostly replaced with capitalism. Though in other cases like Russia the feudal system was first replaced with a non-capitalist system first.  But an 'economy' at it's core is nothing more then a method of distributing goods between humans. Capitalism is the one that we predominately use today, but capitalism and the market as the main method of goods distribution is only about 3 centuries old."
polandball,3d7fuo,Brolonious,0,Tue Jul 14 09:32:21 2015 UTC,The fact that it's an over-simplification of a very complex period with lots of nuances shows that there is basically no such thing as feudal. It's as much of a messy idea as Dark Ages is.
polandball,3d7fuo,Sr_Marques,3,Tue Jul 14 13:33:19 2015 UTC,"That's a non-sequitur. Just because I oversimplify something for the sake of brevity and clarity doesn't mean there's no such thing as feudalism.  Feudalism as an economic system is well documented. Even throughout the middle ages themselves and no they didn't call it feudalism I think the term was coined in 15th century Italy, but don't quote me on that. And yes ofc there were many different variants as there are many different variants of capitalism around today as well.  But for example both Adam Smith the father of modern capitalism and Karl Marx one of early capitalism's greatest critics describe economic feudalism as what preceded capitalism. Since both of them lived through that change into capitalism In respectively England and Germany & England, I'd say they were qualified to make that observation.  Anyway we have veered very far off-topic. The original comment claimed Catholicism and specifically the church of rome/the vatican was capitalist, that is not correct. In fact they maintain to this very day that usury (lending against interest) is a sin."

polandball,3d7fuo,Sr_Marques,7,Wed Jul 15 09:52:14 2015 UTC,"You're right it isn't official doctrine, but that's how the pardoners sold it. You donate money to project xyz of the church(or any catholic monarch) and you get forgiveness even for those who have already passed on. Technically donations to the Church are still a proper form of penance for the living, but they aren't represented as such. Just read the part of your own source on late medieval abuses. The Church itself may not like it, but they created the single greatest product of all time and 'sold' it by calling it donations."
polandball,3d7fuo,Leecannon_,12,Wed Jul 15 10:36:49 2015 UTC,So you're saying people in a church for sinners... sinned? It's a bit dishonest to take something that some bad people in the cgurcb were doing and present it as the church itself.
polandball,3d7fuo,jhaand,8,Tue Jul 14 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"The Church treats donations as a minor form of penance. Even if it is a donation to feed the poor and does work they are getting money by offering forgiveness. They no longer phrase it like that because it sounds corrupt and because you aren't supposed to donate to be forgiven. You donate because you want to and the forgiveness is a nice little bonus. The old Church phrased it the first way because it worked a lot better, but it was easily taken to far. The belief behind the corruption is still accepted by the modern Church. The Church has an infinite amount of merit it can give out to those who need it and prove they deserve it. It's just no longer direct monetary compensation. The concept makes sense even. That's why they're the greatest capitalists. They made a sensible argument that they can give out merit, an intangible object with no effects in the physical world, in exchange for good deeds. And since the Church is founded on doing good deeds helping the Church counts as a good deed therefore anyone who helps the Church can be given merit. The logic is fine as long as you believe Jesus allows the Church to distribute his merit. The entire basis of forgiveness is capitalist, it just isn't phrased as such because it sounds corrupt."
polandball,3d7fuo,StrangeSemiticLatin,5,Tue Jul 14 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"The only form of forgiveness in Christianity (regardless of denomination) is confession and penitence. And flagelation and all those things are just crazy. Giving money to support the church and its activities is not a form of forgiveness, its a form of sharing. The church plays the mediator (supposedly) between the one who has to spare and those who need the aid. You are not absolved of anything. However if we assume that you get bonus points for performing good acts (wild exaggeration on my part but bear with me) by donating, you indirectly help those in need because you donate to help THEM and the needs of the church, supposedly an institution that goes by on donations only."

We did it for a long time in Australia and it's never worked out well. At some point government assistance has to be withdrawn and the industry has to stand on it's own two feet. Otherwise the industry just becomes experts at lobbying the government instead of becoming competitive (see defence projects).  Further complicating matters is that Australia, and Victoria in particular, have huge reserves of coal. Victoria has absolute mountains of very cheap brown coal which is terrible for the environment. It's so cheap and we have so much of it (that we can't sell due to terrible quality) that no major party wants to get rid of the coal fired plants. From an Australian point of view it would be much better if we could mitigate the effects of coal rather than replace it with an alternative technology.  There is a bright side though. Due to increasing costs many manufacturers are shutting down in Australia. This will mean less power generated which in turns means reduced CO2 output. With a bit of luck we'll be able to join the other advanced western nations sneering at the countries (EG China) where manufacturing still constitutes a major part of the economy. All the while ignoring the boatloads of coal, iron, uranium, etc that we export."

There could be several arguments or causes, one of them being a mistrust of liberlaism as an ideology, and especially a foorm of indignation in seeing that the economy has taken the upper hand over politics.  In this way, it becomes extremely annoying to see that decisions affecting th very conditions of life of citizens of a common union have been taken based on a pure economical reasoning.  And something else that might be even more important, I (perhaps we, as it is possible that many of my fellow Frenchmen would agree on this point) perceive Europe as far more than an union which motives are economical strenghtening. Remembrance of gaullism is still strong, and the perception of an 'Europe of nations', united by a common culture and ideology, moved by common solidarity is something that speaks to us way more than a sum of economic interest, be they also in our short-term interest. (Btw, the idea of the Europe of nations is now strongly used by the extreme-right and souverainist mouvements, but I do believe is shared on a wilder spectrum of politics).  A sense of affiliation with the Greeks as being one of the very forefathers of european 'identity' -if there is such a thing- is also to be taken into account.  Of course, once more, I can only claim to represent myself in this and would be happy that others frog-eaters (even Parisians) correct me with their own visions about it).  TL;DR : As far as I can say, we perceive EU as way more than a sum of economical interest but rather a union of culturally both close and diverse countries, in which not expressing solidarity between members is a sin."

polandball,3d241a,Taedaetae,3,Mon Jul 13 09:53:35 2015 UTC,That might be true but the Chinese do kind of see Indian as a competitor.  In terms of modernization the Chinese are really hoping that all the jobs existing in China now don't leave for India. There are also some random border conflicts but nothing so serious. It is more likely for them to cooperate than it is for Japan and China to cooperate.

polandball,3d0536,ninj3,2,Mon Jul 13 07:48:05 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to Taiwan's claims on mainland China clay? TBH, I think CCP prefers them to keep claiming it, because it means they both agree that Taiwan and mainland should be together, they disagree only on who should be ruling it. Both sides can keep yelling about it and nothing will happen and that is good. But if Taiwan were to drop that claim, that would likely lead to a push for independence which would be much more dangerous!"
polandball,3d0536,White_Null,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I mentioned those other countries because the claim overlaps with those countries that are not PRC, Hong Kong and Macau.  On the one hand, ROC is about to be destroyed by Taiwan.  On the other hand, if all those other countries, like India, Japan and Russia are invited.  And PRC inherits clay ownership from ROC, and Taiwan who is handling ROC's clay ownership, if they don't interfere, Taiwan can potentially declare independence, give huge claims to say Russia in exchange as a nation that is not China.  But if PRC interferes, then they are in fact admitting that ROC and its government still exists.  Remember, Japan is in the East, Russia with the 2nd greatest military power in the world is up in the north and India with fourth greatest military power is in the west.  Which way do they take?  just send us all the nuclear missles to the island?  All three choices are unprofitable to the CCP."

Bulgaria originally got roughly half of the Bulgarian-populated area, while Serbia got the other half and the bit with the shqips.

I really don't know much about this, and it's a mere speculation. But it doesn't change the fact that Serbia was fashioned on Rashka, Kosovo and Macedonia, so I view it as a rightful part of our nation, despite the population living there.   In a fair, perfect world (lol), Bulgaria should have received the entire region while Serbia got Montenegro and territories in Austria-Hungary   Even with saying that Serbian Macedonia should be rightfully Bulgarian, Greek Macedonia was still inhibited by Greeks and was historically Greek. Montenegro was fighting in the war on the side of the Balkan alliance, so it would be senseless to give them to Serbia if they're helping."

polandball,3d1984,TheBloodySerb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hm, I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.  Serbia had de facto independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1817, much earlier than Bulgaria which received autonomy within the Ottoman Empire in 1878. So we had no army to help you in your 1815 uprising against the Turks.  On the other hand, if you are saying we should have helped you in 1878 during the Russo-Turkish war, we had only 12,000 armed men, who were fighting for our own independence.  If you are talking about Stepan Stepanovic, a Serbian army under his control invaded Bulgaria during 1885 to prevent two of the Bulgarian principalities from uniting (which was also a shitty move. The Serbian troops were told they were going to fight the Turks, because the King/generals knew that the ordinary people would not want to be part of a war against their fellow Christian Slavs) because they were scared that Bulgaria would get too strong.  That takes us to the First Balkan War, where 50,000 Bulgarian troops were placed under Serbian control to help fight the Turks in Macedonia, while the rest of the Bulgarian army fought the Ottoman army in Thrace and outside Istanbul. Serbia and Bulgaria had agreed to split Macedonia as per this map, but Serbia disagreed, and did not remove its troops."

If someone is interested, i've got inspiration for Germanys character here     Edit: This comic was one big experiment for me, so let's sum up my TILs:   I didn't intended Ukraine to be cute! I really didn't, but many people say it's adorable. Since he is smaller than others, I had to enlarge his eyes. In scale they would be small, too small to convey emotions properly. Apperantly big eyes + small size = cutness overload. Eh. If i make a long comic, it's better not to release it in parts. I've meet negative feedback trying to do that. People don't like unfinished comics, and it's better to finish everything at once and release it, than butcher it into pieces. And... eh, as somebody mentioned in the comments, I should work on tigtening the script somehow. I really don't like doing that! But sometimes less is more. New art style. It was intended to look like this. Problem was, that this image alone took me whole day to make! And its not a complicated panel! There are 3 stationary characters, and no other items. Not even shadowing! So I decided to make the simplest art style possible. Something looking okay, clean  and simple. So I made most lines look like they were not thinner than 5px and very limited colour palette. I've got panel time down to 40-10 min, which was acceptable for 61 panel comic. And people like it! Cool. Unforunately it multiplied cuteness factor... but hey, they will be always some side effects. Not using text. Well... i have mixed feelings about that. In one hand using pictographs and figuring out how to tell something without words was a really fun challenge. Apperantly it's possible to tell a lot with just one image. Buuuut... there is also a downside. Not all things can be easly told by pictures or emotions. I was struggling when Ukraine had to ask Germany if he is hungry. And... everything i could think of was lone question mark. Questions are very hard in this Antarctic - speak. Also, I had to give up verbal jokes, so comic may seem to be less funny. I had to draw Pickelhaube 42 times. Worth it. Fuck this awesome helmet."

They are old and outdated, in Ukraine war they get destroyed without any problem whats so ever"

Take those SAM's away and rebels are nothing"
polandball,3d0zwr,RezKez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yup for example Armata is probably a very good or even the best tank nowadays but I think Russia just can’t afford it. To be honest they can’t afford even T-90.  So sanctions matters. But anyway conventional war is the least probable scenario.   What is probable though is all sort of ""deniable"" attacks like hacking, spying, lobbing, tourism, minoritism :) etc.   Russia goal is to ""disturb"" Ukraine and wait until it fall into pieces.  Ukraine goal is to survive, reform and do not turn into radical state. The West goal should be to help Ukraine but we sent pathetic 5 billion euro when just to compare:  1) Support for Greece 2010 - 2015 - 200 billion euro  2) Support for Poland 2007 - 2020 - 145 billion euro  I think we have a tie here. The west don’t want to go further than ""keep Ukraine barely alive but still alive"" (which I can somehow understand according to all the recent problems EU faces) and Russia just don’t want to risk anymore of its influence and wealth when basic goal ""don’t let Ukraine get out this shit and take Crimea back"" is achieved.   Poor Ukraine though. And poor Poland cause I expect Ukrainian nationalism to grow and since it is a bit anti polish by definition ehhh..."
polandball,3d0zwr,angryteabag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yup for example Armata is probably a very good or even the best tank nowadays but I think Russia just can’t afford it   Armata is not a tank yet, its just a prototype, it'll be years until it will enter production and get decent testing. Right now its just a concept, it even broke down during the parade training, Russia can boast on how its the best super tank on the planet but its useless right now. I think it will suffer the same fate as T-90, that beeing that they cant made enough of them. They would need to replace like 10.000 T-72's and T-80's, that would need a lot of money, and seeing how sanctions and low Oil prices have completely put their economy on halt that wont happen in next 10 years at least."

polandball,3cwzb9,Pilot0000,5,Sat Jul 11 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"If it was genocide, why did they let women and children live and not kill them instead? Also, why only soldiers were killed?"
polandball,3cwzb9,Eesti_Stronk,4,Sat Jul 11 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Because women were raped (as the Dutchbat witnessed) and children were killed? The youngest found is possibly 8, while children of 12 or 13 have been found.   Oh and MILITARY-AGED MEN, shockingly enough, not every military-aged male is a soldier. I'm not.

polandball,3cwzb9,zdr0id,6,Sat Jul 11 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"I won't get into a big debate or anything about this, but I've just always found it stupid to argue about whether something should be called a massacre or a genocide. Either way, many people died, and a horrible crime was committed against those people. At the end of the day, no matter the politics, history, and tensions behind it, can't we just agree on that?"
polandball,3cwzb9,AdonisEuropeo,3,Sat Jul 11 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Genocide is a lot more violent than massacre, that is why it has its own word.   What Serbia did was killing the males, then raping the women in order to impregnate them, thus making them give birth of 'their' race. It is a whole other magnitude of cruelty.  Massacre is killing everybody, genocide is killing with the end goal being to get rid of an ethnicity. Both are treated differently same as manslaughter is treated differently from premeditated murder"
polandball,3cwzb9,MarmeladeUlme,4,Sat Jul 11 19:05:25 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me again? Of course that somebody was raped. That always happens in war, I don't know what's the difference in this one. But nobody sent people massively to rape somebody, those who raped women were mentally disturbed persons and I hope they're dead.  And you miss the point with genocides. 1 million people died in Rwanda genocide. 1.5 million people died in Armenian genocide. Compare it to number of people who died in Srebrenica and tell me the difference."
polandball,3cwzb9,Hrulj,4,Sat Jul 11 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"So Srbrenica was a genocide even not on a broad scale. Was a slaughter against a ethnic whose intention was just kill them all.  yes, so it a genocide."

Bahrain receives groundwater by lateral under-flow from the Damman aquifer, which forms only a part of the extensive regional aquifer system, called the Eastern Arabian Aquifer. This aquifer extends from central Saudi Arabia, where its main recharge area is located at about 300 meters above sea level, to eastern Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, which are considered the discharge areas. The rate of groundwater inflow has been estimated at about 112 million m/year under steady-state conditions (before 1965) and this figure is considered to be the safe groundwater yield in Bahrain.

polandball,3cugbz,ShadowRenegado,69,Fri Jul 10 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, since I'm no economist, but...   And screwing over the rest of the EU/world is ok?   They wouldn't destroy the world, if Greece defaulted, it would only affect its imports/exports, which means it would slightly worsen some countries' economies, it would only do a great damage to anyone who had Greece as their main exporter/importer, and I think nobody is in such position.  Now, about the rest of the EU, it also has to do with imports/exports, since they would be using a different currency, their products would be more expensive again, since that was one of the goals of the Euro, to eliminate the issues with exchange rates.   I understand that they want to fix problems, but to do so doesn't require a Grexit, or a referendum not adhering to international standards...   The thing is, one of the reasons why Greece is in such situation is because they had too much freedom with the Euro, they constantly tried to devaluate the currency in order to keep up with the larger economies such as France and Germany.  Nowadays the EU has very strict fiscal policies regarding the Euro, this was done in order to avoid a second Euro crisis.  Now, if Greece left the Eurozone, it certainly would face some issues, it would cost them quite a bit to print all that new currency and stuffz, and with the now increased exchange rate they could end up not making as much money when trading with Europe.  But the upside is, they would have full control of their fiscal policies again, since they would use a currency of their own, they could certainly make their internal market thrive, at least.  (A country defaulting is really no big deal, Argentina did that 7 times already)"

Also from the point of view of the south, the north was trying to take a fort back that was on their land, so war was inevitable.

polandball,3cugbz,laybros,2,Sat Jul 11 06:06:03 2015 UTC,"I think you're mixing things up. The EU does not have any common fiscal policies (from what I remember) - only monetary. The problem is that Greece had ramparant fiscal policies focused on high government spending (they have the highest minimum wage, pensions and social benefit payments in all of Europe) while completely disregarding any sort of increase in tax collection to cover for said spending. What did they do to cover the difference? Greece borrowed from many different banks and the IMF. Now they can't repay said debt.  And a default of a country would basicly wipe their credit rating to default to null again, which will negate any more chances for them to borrow any money soon. And if Greece were to default, it would affect the price of the Euro (make it weaker), which, while helping with exports, would make everything more expensive in the Eurozone, which could lead to deflation and/or people no longer being able to pay for commodities (though this is the most extreme (and most unlikely) thing to happen).  And if Grexit were to happen, then I fear the UK and other major anti-EU countries would try to leave the EU, since up to now that was not possible. This would make the EU an even weaker union than it is now."

For some reason, I don't know why, everyone on reddit conflates the European Union with the Eurozone. One is a part of the other, it is like calling the IMF and the United Nations the same thing. Greece is a European country that is a member of the EU and also a member of the Eurozone. Britain for instance is a member of the EU but opted out of the Eurozone.   I Greece leaves anything it will leave the Eurozone but remain a member of the European Union.

In practice other EMU members can make persona non grata and give no aid and have bare minimal interactions with greece, but greece still would be legally a member.

I do know what's going on. Greece needs to do one of two things:   Exit the monetary union to get control of its national currency and print more money. This would mean the end of a fixed exchange rate with the Euro/the rest of Europe. Over 70% of Greeks oppose this plan. Embrace austerity measures pushed down on them by the larger Eurozone economies that benefit from not printing more Euros. ~60% of Greeks don't want to do this.   Unfortunately they had to choose one, so although they voted against austerity, it's actually their best option, both from a democratic standpoint and IMO from a political standpoint.

polandball,3cugbz,catking2003,5,Sat Jul 11 04:55:27 2015 UTC,"The Master Negotiator needs a Part 2.   If you read the news on the various stances in Greece and all of the EU countries, you'll see there was a very different tone once the US finally spoke out officially on how it felt: Greece must stay in the EU.  I think it was a German that gave the comparison of Puerto Rico's absurd amount of debt and Washington's approval to that of Germany and Greece. Essentially saying that the US won't help Puerto Rico, an actual US territory but it's essentially demanding that Germany help Greece with relatively the same amount of debt that's not bound to Germany other than being an EU member with massive debt.   Grexit is simply not happening now, as soon as Washington made it's stance Spiegel and Welt even changed it's tone from Grexit imminent to negotiations likely.   To make things more interesting, Russia is for a Grexit and even a Brexit but China agrees with the US and is strongly against an EU breakup, that includes Greece. So essentially from a German perspective you're fucked because you'd greatly piss off China and US which would end very badly for you and Greece can now continue to demand 10's of billions more with even greater risk to the EU economy.  TL;DR: German politician compared US / Puerto Rico debt to that of Germany / Greece, essentially calling out the US as a hypocrite after US made official stance. Saying that a Grexit is a very bad idea that they against yet Washington refuses to help Puerto Rico, an actual US territory."

The problem, though, was that this wasn't done for every country, only the ones that were expected to have /int/ posters (Europe, Americas, East Asia, etc).

polandball,3ct7q7,rafeind,7,Fri Jul 10 21:50:50 2015 UTC,We do. Jeg husker ikke meget. I end up using to much German when I try to use Danish these days.  Edit: I remembered a bit of danish grammar I forgot when writing this originally.
polandball,3ct7q7,ofRedditing,6,Fri Jul 10 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"Hehe, some people might end up getting a bit ""pissed"" if you talk german to them, I would rather go for english then ;)"
polandball,3ct7q7,ofRedditing,4,Fri Jul 10 22:40:43 2015 UTC,"At least for the time it would take me to start remembering Danish again. I mean I can read it, and understand surprisingly much when listening. not the numbers though, I am incapable of hearing the difference between fyrre and firs."
polandball,3ct7q7,Finland_is_so_fun,3,Fri Jul 10 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"Seems like a lot of Icelanders go to Denmark to study for some reason. I live on a university and there's tons of you here. Unfortunately I can't understand much of Icelandic, learning it is on my bucket list though."
polandball,3ct7q7,ZeSkump,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"The reason: A lot of Icelanders go abroad to study, Denmark is less expensive than a English speaking country and there are a lot of Icelanders there already. And as said before we learn Danish in school and for the longest time (I'm not sure if it is like that any more) we didn't need a proof of the fact that we spoke Danish to get in a university in Denmark, just an Icelandic stúdentspróf. I went to Germany instead."
polandball,3ct7q7,DickRhino,2,Sat Jul 11 05:25:19 2015 UTC,"I've heard that it's easier for Icelanders to learn Norwegian, actually. A lot of them come here, and they get a grasp of the language fairly easily. Also, our Nynorsk form of writing and a lot of our dialects are fairly similar to Icelandic and Førøysk :)"
polandball,3ct7q7,ZeSkump,2,Sat Jul 11 16:38:54 2015 UTC,Knowing Icelandic and having been taught Danish (Even if most people only remember enough to make fun of the Danes) is most definitely enough to learn Norwegian quickly. And it is sometimes easier for an Icelander to understood in Norway than in Denmark even if we are supposed to have learnt Danish and not Norwegian.
polandball,3ct7q7,kyrsjo,2,Sat Jul 11 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"My only problem with it is that I think maybe Ireland should sound more Irish. The rest of the countries represent their native dialect but he's missing the typical accent. Just a suggestion,  otherwise I thought it was good."

The court, the highest court in Germany, has the exclusive power to ban parties if they are found to be ""anti-constitutional"". However, the petition was rejected in 2003 after it was discovered that a number of the NPD's inner circle—including as many as 30 of its top 200 leaders—were in fact undercover agents or informants of the German secret services, like the federal Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz.

A witness for the trial died of Ninja-Diabetes, another burnt himself in his car or so they say, and one of their agents was present during one murder. He didn't go to the police as a witness, because he was chatting to his affair in the internet cafe whose clerk was killed.

polandball,3cu0dv,theteriaky,3,Sat Jul 11 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"But I did it on purpose. I do not know much about the early stage of WW1 after the war was declared by everyone. I know that France had problems getting all their troops to the front in time as the French railroad system was centralized in Paris and almost every soldier had to pass through Paris to get to the front. Germans railroad was faster. I do not claim that this is the only reason for the fast advancing of German troops at the beginning, but I do know that what I said before is wrong. That is what makes it a joke.    I do not understand why you do not put the trust in me that I am capable of making a joke. But instead you assume I am ignorant and stupid because I am making a joke about your nation."

What I dislike is the implication "" others won the war for you while you stood around being useless"". Like I said below, I really despise the french WW jokes. They're stupid and unfair, don't have a leg to stand on which is my major gripe, they've been ran into the ground yet people here bloody love it like it's the funniest and most creative joke they've ever heard... I've become sick of it, like germans could be sick of nazi jokes.

Seriously though, if ""nobody's been seriously disputing it for five centuries"" makes claims invalid then the German claim to Alsace would be extremely valid, as it was part of Germany a mere 75 years ago.   Wow, a textbook sophism in the wild. Rare occurrence.  Edit : to elaborate a bit and advert drama, the reasons the German claim to Alsace was bullshit : the claim was basically that Alsace was ""culturally German"", and thus should be ""reunited"" to the German nation, but this didn't hold water because :   Alsace was annexed in the early 18th, a century before any German nation or German national identity started to appear the territory annexed included areas where French was the exclusive vernacular, and many more that were bilingual (because the actual reason they wanted to annex it was to create a buffer Imperial Land between France and the Catholic kingdoms of Southern Germany) the elite language was French, throughout the region, while high German knowledge was rare (most of the first batch of elects to the Reichstag didn't even speak German), indicating the lack of connection of the region to German culture the fact that French wasn't the vernacular in part of the territory was absolutely not remarkable within France, and applied to most of the country at the time, and doesn't contradict it being French land in any way the most compelling reason : the locals clearly didn't want to join Germany at all. For all the existence of the region they elected primarily anti-German representatives, and for the first two decades those won all elections with like 90% of the vote."
polandball,3cu0dv,sdfghs,5,Sat Jul 11 14:45:43 2015 UTC,"I'm very interested in Alsatian history and between the two wars there was a huge movement in Alsace so that they are allowed to speak German.  But I also read : ""Hitler did make Alsace more French, than France did during 20 years"""
polandball,3cu0dv,RedKrypton,5,Sat Jul 11 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, there was some anti-German repression in the interwar period, and a sizeable regionalist movement that didn't really exist before 1870. 50 years in Germany obviously left traces. Though to be fair, most of the other regionalist movements only appeared towards the end of the 19th as well.  They didn't want to leave France though, if only because interwar Germany wasn't a very attractive country.  You're also right that their association with Nazis and Vichy made Alsatian regionalists lose all credibility after WW2. This is in fact also true for Breton and Occitan regionalists."
polandball,3cu0dv,OldBreed,5,Sat Jul 11 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"That's true that we have been deeply frenchified throughout the years. My parents, who both went to school the first time as young children without knowing one word of French, only spoke Alsatian (I recall my mother telling me that she was watching exclusively the German TV with her grand-mother as a child), and now they both speak only French (with no accent). As for my generation, we, for the most part, have little (and some none at all) affinity with the German culture. It's merely the neighbouring country not so far away, where you can buy your groceries for cheap. My native language is French, I was born in the French culture, and I surely don't see Germany as my homeland (my knowledge of the German language mainly comes from school) And it kinda grinds my gears when I see German nationalists on the Internet still claiming we are part of their ""Heimat"". Because we're not. Especially don't tell my father he is German, because he is a fervent French patriot, and I don't think he would take it very well. I think in my family, only my grand-parents are the remnants of our Germanic background: They still speak Alsatian between them (or more a mix of Alsatian with some French words thrown here and there), they still watch German TV (I would say 50% French TV, 50% German TV) and have the accent when speaking French. But they don't see Germany as their country. My grand-father displays the tricolore when it is the fourth of July. Moreover, past the Schwarzwald, there's no mutual intelligibility between Alsatian and other German dialects.  So plz Messieurs les Allemands, forget about us."

Were the cultures of the Spanish Empire and British Empire that different? Did the Spanish favor integration while the British favored extermination?"
polandball,3cp7sc,OldBreed,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"Probably because the areas Spain conquered were densely populated and thus were taken over and governed by the Spanish. In North America North of Mexico there were few large cities and most of the natives lived in tribes instead of the advanced civilizations of Mesoamerica and South America. The English didn't have any cities to conquer so they settled in their own settlements. There was not as much mingling but it was still considerable. However, much of the time it wasn't natives assimilating into European culture but vice versa, as settlers or fur traders lived with native tribes. That's why many Americans and Canadians have small amounts of native blood."

polandball,3cnm76,dehemke,6,Thu Jul 9 23:56:31 2015 UTC,Simple answer is most African Americans are no more African than I am Italian. It's just a PC term for blacks who live in America. So no they wouldn't. America is weird though because Native Americans are not what most people mean when they say American. Europe and Africa are different because their indiginous population is still the major ethinicity as well so they overlap. It is more appropriate to call them Arabic German because just saying German implies German German. 1st generation immigrants are normally called (Ethnicity + Current Country) and 2-3rd genreation start to simply be called (Current Country) because they have assimilated enough that they have more in common with their current country than their genetic one.   tl;dr Should they? Yes. Are they? Not based on how we use the term.

When done properly going to the sauna and sitting in the heat is a form of cardio and people with serious issues there in should avoid going in to a sauna and overdoing it too much. Heck partaking in sauna related activities regularly due to the cardio effect can improve health therein overall.  Now per Finnish tradition downing copious amounts of alcohol also helps.   The only guys who had burns and hyperthermia etc were the dudes taking part in the last Sauna sitting competition... the Russian competitor died and the Finnish one had horrible burns and went in to partial kidney failure. The competition is not representative of normal habits.   Did I mention... Sauna is almost like a religious experience for most finns... drinking is a form of meditation therein."

That was the only good joke I could come up with, though, and I didn't know how to end it. Plus, I can't draw cotton for shit), but the comic ended up being a lot more US-centric than I intended.

In 1812 we had some strategic defeats, but in the end the war was status quo antebellum. No one gained or lost anything in the fight, even if we didn't manage to hold Canada after invading and got bombarded by the British. And in Vietnam it was the opposite, the Tet offensive was a failure, the US was doing fine militarily, but we didn't have the political support so we pulled out, failing our objectives. So if winning battles matters, we lost 1812 and won Vietnam. And if actual results matter 1812 was a draw and Vietnam was a horrific defeat."

polandball,3cjjw1,Zombiedrd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"It's like convergent evolution giving distantly related animals identical solutions to physical problems even though the genes responsible aren't related.  A kabuto and a stahlhelm seem totally unrelated, both by era and location, but they were probably designed to protect the user from the same type of threats.  Falling debris and shrapnel from artillery was the constant threat in the trenches, so helmets which expand in the front and rear to protect your neck and head regardless of your head's orientation (unlike the Brodie) are extremely practical.  This is total speculation on my part: but I think Japanese helmets might have been designed with very similar threats in mind.  You could have the Empire as an real life alien organization and still not be surprised by seeing so many helmets which give good protection for neck and shoulders.  I like that."

polandball,3cjjw1,Zombiedrd,3,Wed Jul 8 20:37:11 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Remember that guy who posted about his grandfather that was in the SS and was a fucking CONCENTRATION CAMP GUARD?   The dude talked about how he wasn't really a bad guy and he was oh so brave and it was all because he loved his country. Seriously? He joined before the war started, became a Nazi party member, swore allegiance to Hitler, and fucking participated voluntarily in the torture, murder, and imprisonment of his own countrymen. The post got gilded multiple times, bestof'd I think although I can't find it, blah blah.  I mean come on, next we're going to see Larry Hitler, 7th cousin 4 times removed talking about how his ancestor was really just misunderstood and not actually a bad guy and everyone will pat him on the back too. I feel like I'm losing my mind when I see this shit.  It's one thing to make a distinction between the Wehrmacht and the SS/Gestapo (although it's not exactly like every member of the Wehrmacht was an innocent little angel), and even to not make out like every single member of the SS was an evil demon from hell, but I feel like that line keeps getting blurred more and more. If even the concentration camp guards weren't really bad guys who was? Only high command? Next I'll hear that the only real Nazi in the entire third Reich was Hitler. The axis keeps getting a little more whitewashed every year."

polandball,3cirsp,ninj3,265,Wed Jul 8 07:35:50 2015 UTC,"Context: A strip based on Boomerang by Michael Lewis.   When you asked a smart Wall Street subprime mortgage bond trader circa June 2007 who was still buying his crap, he could say, simply, “Stupid Germans in Düsseldorf.” —the book   What, you thought Germany was getting off the hook? They’re the “sensible” ones who let the inmates take over the asylum!  Inside Germany, the credit boom of the mid-2000s had little effect. There was no housing bubble, no living extravagantly with borrowed money, no bizarre financial monkey-business. But outside Germany, German bankers wreaked havoc by lending huge sums of money to all the worst people. This is why Germany is stuck as the creditor to all these deadbeat European countries: they were the ones stupid enough to lend money to those deadbeats in the first place!  There are several theories for why Germany did this:  Theory 1: The Germans (being German) assumed everyone else was playing by the rules. It never occurred to them that America was inventing creative new ways for Wall Street financiers to screw everyone else, or that Ireland was lost in a self-made delusion, or that Iceland hadn’t a clue what it was doing. The Germans were just too naive and trusting for the dirty, cutthroat world of American investment banking. (This is my favorite theory, and the one depicted in the comic.)  Theory 2: Being raised in a society of strict ordnung, Germans get an illicit thrill out of rule-breaking. Since German bankers couldn't misbehave at home — their fellow citizens wouldn't allow it — they had to misbehave abroad, like a Saudi going to Bahrain for booze and hookers, or like a goody two-shoes egging on his friends to do stupid shit while he watches from a safe distance.  Theory 3: Regarding Greece: Germany and friends were dazzled by Greece's heritage, culture, status as the birthplace of European-ness, so they let Greece into the Eurozone even though they had to know there was something fishy about Greece's finances. They let sentimentality and nostalgia trump practicality.   Theory 4: Regarding the PIIGS: Germany did benefit from lending to other Euro countries, because those borrowers often used their new money to buy German manufactured goods.  Some more book quotes:   There had never been any innovation in German banking. You gave money to some company, and the company paid you back. They went [virtually overnight] from this to being American. And they weren’t any good at it. —economist Henrik Enderlein  You’d talk to a New York investment banker and they’d say, ""No one is going to buy this crap. Oh. Wait. The Landesbanks will!"" —reporter Aaron Kirchfeld"

polandball,3cirsp,jimmybabs,51,Wed Jul 8 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"This struggle never really existed. As soon as the USSR dissolved, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and the Baltic States had already made it clear that they wanted to be with Europe, not any Slavic union, no matter how loose.       South-Eastern Europe is a more complicated story, but Croatia and Slovenia shouldn't have been a surprise for Russia. Hungary was never close with Russia, quite the opposite, but that's a very strange case and a disliked member of the EU (as a member state and government, not as a country or people).     Russia hardly minds the EU. Any type of influence on its member states but Greece and Hungary was not to be anyways. It does care about NATO however, since European defences are now awfully close to the Russian borders with the latest members, despite the Cold War being over. Putin calls it bad faith, I would call it prevention and a justified reaction, but they do have a reason to complain there.     Putin said before that he would really like to work together with the EU within two decades with a strong partnership. If he was telling the truth, it seems like Russia has decided which countries to influence a long time ago already: Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Greece and Hungary. Which, if you think about it, makes sense. Finland is a neutral country out of fear for deterioration of their relation with Russia, the others are the outcasts of Europe."
polandball,3cirsp,sabasNL,11,Wed Jul 8 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"Two cents: Russia always had great relations with Belarus, and it was the same with Ukraine until not many years ago (which is why Russia gifted Crimea to Ukraine in the first place: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_transfer_of_Crimea ), Finland has always had strong economic ties with Russia (which put them in a severe crisis with the collapse of the USSR, since they lost most of their exports), Greece will seek its best potential ally (and toying around with Putin is a good way to get on Merkel's nerves) and any kind of influence on today's Turkey government in a no-no.

While they're a NATO member, and probably will be for the foreseeable future, there is potential for a stronger partnership between the two nations.    Hungary: A really awkward case of global politics, but in recent years, the corrupt and semi-authoritarian government of Hungary has been moving towards strengthening ties with Russia, especially as it gets constant complains from its neighbours and European partners. Hungary being a... Disloyal member of the EU, could be interesting to anyone who wants to have more influence within the Union.

I believe only a sentence or two was dedicated to it. Or I could have completely made it up in my head. Either way, it's somewhat related to Theory 1.

And there was Greece, sitting all pretty promising the world, and America saying they found out how to turn their McMansions into gold. . .

And, the 1st theory probably is the one better suiting the case of Spain... When we entered the Eurozone back in the 2000's, the German banking sector basically began to pour low-interest loans into the Spanish financial entities, thus helping our already oversized housing sector to grow even more, leading to insane things such as 40-year mortgages and news like ""Spain is building houses at a rate faster than France, Germany and Italy put together!"" - and there were people that thought of it as something to be proud of! And yet better, after the crisis we have ended up with tenths of thousands of eternally abandoned households AND record-breaking eviction rates due to the inability of lots of people to pay for the overpriced places they tried to acquire through those insane mortgages! (Not to mention the evicted ones remain in debt because the Spanish law on mortgages doesn't count the house as an asset whose value cancels the financial obligations with the bank...) And then the EU told our dull conservative government to bail out the Spanish banks in trouble instead of letting them fall, because what's wiser than making the State (and thus the taxpayers) assume the debt derived from this utter mess created by the selfish decisions of the people running this thing? And then the German government and the IMF tell us that we have to cut public services, increase taxes, ease the process of firing someone from a company and pay them less in their new jobs, all in order to pay for ""our"" mistakes... oh, the irony!"

Each time you use the chili spoon, you do this as it slowly adds layers to the surface and creating flavors for the food it comes in contact with. A ""Chili Spoon"" is best if it's wooden, as the porous fibers soak up the flavorful bacteria that makes food so delicious.   My family is in possession of a seasoned ""Chili Spoon"" that hasn't been washed in over 90 years. My great-great grandmother used it cook chili for my great grandfather after he returned home from Iwo Jima."

After having been in the contest for several hours, this entry was rejected because of the ""Netherland is high"" and because spain had no crest. This is a modified version of the original entry, which can be found there. This is a shame because I was in a hurry saturday, and despite the fact I had only 3-4 hours to make an entry for this contest, I really wanted to participate. I still think it was unfair to reject it once it was in the contest, while it was approved in the first place.   EDIT: I post this a second time this evening cause this version got removed too (they said the crest was not beautiful enough). So I decided to remove spain and put Austria instead, because drawing this crest is just beyond my strength.

The only thing unusual about this is that the fires are so close to a major city due to incompetance.   It's much better now than it was a century ago though. We used to fight fires anywhere they popped up, rather than where they could harm people. As a result, the forests became extremely overgrown and flammable, which in turn resulted in massive firestorms every 5 years or so that killed thousands. We finally learned our lesson when basically the entire Midwestern United States and Ontario went up in flames in a day, during the simultaneous, Chicago, Petchtigo and Michigan/Ontario fires. Literally 10s of thousands of square kilometers burned in a day in massive forestorms, with walls of fire moving in excess of 100 mph, burning hotter than a crematorium. Funfun."

polandball,3cf0fp,Mazertyui,2,Tue Jul 7 20:18:43 2015 UTC,Ahhh the perpetual French idea that the state and citizenship equals a nation. Good thing the Maghrebis are showing you there's more ot it.... :D
polandball,3cf0fp,Szkwarek,5,Wed Jul 8 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"But citizenship does matter. If she didn't feel french at least to some degree she would never have taken citizenship. She only studied and became a scientist in France, married a frenchman, spent like 40 years there and died in Paris... but yeah sure she was totally 100% not french !"
polandball,3cf0fp,Quas4r,0,Wed Jul 8 06:11:35 2015 UTC,"No, citizenship matters exactly zero in the minds of most people. It's a piece of paper, nothing more. Plenty of people move to countries for entirely different reasons than feeling any connection to the identity. They live their whole lives there without absorbing it. My father has spent 35 years in this country, he speaks the language fluently, has a ton of friends and operates a couple of companies, has a local wife and two kids born here. He feels exactl 0% Bulgarian and has not moved one inch from his original identity. On the contrary - he's become more nationalistic and attached to it than before. As happens with almost all immigrants - they ""rediscover"" their original nationality from abroad and cling on to it harder. That's why Chopin was so focused on dedicating his works to Poland. That's why Maria Sklodowska named her element Polonium, and not Franconium. That's why all those Algerians and Marocans in your country will never be French, will never care one bit for your identity and culture and will continue to hold even stronger to the identity of both their original country, and in many cases - to the country of their parents or grandparents, or great-grandparents. You will never assimilate them because you have this flawed mentality that identity is country and citizenship based, when in fact those are empty bureaucratic ideas to most people, who instead consider unchangable factors such as ancestry, blood, culture, traditions and historical loyalty as the basis of their identity. You might not like it, but you certainly have to stop denying it exists and live with the rose-glasses on that tell you ""Whoever has French citizenship is French, considers himself French and will be loyal to the French"". That's just a delusional load of bollocks and it will blow up in your face one day."
polandball,3cf0fp,Szkwarek,5,Wed Jul 8 12:32:05 2015 UTC,"Whoever has French citizenship is French, considers himself French and will be loyal to the French   I never said that, I said citizenship matters. Of course some people hold citizenship in one country without assimilating, but it's not everyone, your father's example is not universal. There is also a concept of dual identity, YES it is possible to be a citizen of several countries and to feel attachment to both. Your examples of Chopin and Marie Skłodowska-Curie (to use her full name...) dedicating things to Poland only show that they never erased the polish part of their identity, which is good, while at the same time adopting an additional identity which was french. I don't know why you're railing into me so violently. You talk a lot of shit about arab french people, I'm sure you've met tons of them personally... and many would be offended at you saying that they can never assimilate or feel french, because they've done just that. Maybe you're just a crazy nationalist who thinks that segregation is a good idea and that different races can never live peacefully together."
polandball,3cf0fp,Quas4r,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:41:29 2015 UTC,"Living peacefully is one thing. It has nothing to do with the fact whether a large group of immigrants from entirely different continents and their descendands will assimilate entirely, absorb the local culture, identify with the history, ancestors and traditions of the land. That rarely happens with inter-european immigrants and absolutely never with Afrikan or Asian ones. A black person can't possibly fool himself that his ancestors have anything to do with the celts, franks or any other historic people who formed the french nation. I'v lived long enough in the UK and Belgium to meet throngs of non-european immigrants and their descendants, both at uni and at work, and am entirely convinced assimilation of these people does not occur. Integration does. Peaceful co-existance does. And it's great those things do, but ultimately it isn't enough if the native identities get replaced one day, albeit in a peaceful demographic shift."

polandball,3cf0fp,vidkunquislingII,7,Tue Jul 7 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a Pole and I don't really blame for not invading all that much.

polandball,3cf0fp,vidkunquislingII,3,Tue Jul 7 22:43:03 2015 UTC,"So that was the prelude to Phoney War, ok.. Why didn't they continue their offensive when they had such ""considerable"" success?"
polandball,3cf0fp,vinjoza,7,Tue Jul 7 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Because, like I already said quite plainly, the French command decided to go for a defensive approach. The general gist of the French Military during the early stages of WW2 is that it was a fine fighting force, led by a not-terribly-good command structure.  Another thing to consider is another thing which was already posted, the French were concerned they may be attacked elsewhere, thought that their forces weren't ready, and the British hadn't yet arrived to provide support. A good chunk of the French command had also supported the construction of the Maginot Line, and were determined to see it used."
polandball,3cf0fp,vidkunquislingII,4,Tue Jul 7 23:38:18 2015 UTC,"That stands,you're absolutely right but that still proves my point. I still think that if France really wanted to help Poles they could have done it. But they decided to go for a defensive approach, like you said, even though they alone had bigger army than Germany, not including Brits. I personally think that such course of action eventually led to the Blitzkrieg."
polandball,3cf0fp,vinjoza,4,Tue Jul 7 23:45:55 2015 UTC,If the allies just helped Czechoslovakia in 38 the war could have ended in like a year. If France + UK attacked the Germans while they were busy with Czechoslovakia it would have ended quickly.

polandball,3cf0fp,ruber_r,3,Tue Jul 7 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"Germans were invited as gastarbeiters. They were allowed to colonize subprime highland agriculture land (skopčáci = from mountains) and extract mineral resources, with industrialisation  many migrated to cities to work in factories.  Sudeten was heavy in textile and glass production, and mining. These industries were worst hurt by 30s great depression. Thus more Germans lost jobs compared with Czechs, especially their youth. This perceived injustice, together with old nationalistic rivalties and Hitler´s alluring propaganda of superior nation turned them into dissatisfied rioting masses. A little similar with Arab Spring, but instead of radical islam, they supported nazi ideology.  How would you feel when some part of Germany with majority turkish population would embrace radical islam, decide to renounce being part of Germany and voted to be annexed by Turkey? Turkey, with Erdogan in power and your mortal enemy that wants to annex your land and destroy your nation? (Czechoslovakia was liberal democracy, while Germany had NSDAP).  I dont want to say that Czechs were without sins or that Germans had no right for their self-determination.

It is possible that we would make German Army weaker so Hitler wouldn't be able to conquer Poland and France. But Czechoslovakia would be totally destroyed, you can't fight 3 armies alone.

If Germany was to suddenly declare Nazis their heroes, we'd be scared shitless. If Russia was to suddenly declare Holodomor and Katyn totally-nothing-to-be-ashamed-at, we'd be legitimately scared for our well-being. With Ukraine not posing a threat, it's easier for the Polish people to tolerate the situation or even recognize out own fault in it."

I considered switching girl Texas to another southern US state, but I feel the joke wouldn't really work that way.

polandball,3ce7tn,NSNick,76,Tue Jul 7 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"German perspective:  Because the people don't really care. Here in Germany and other European countries it's a long standing stereotype that all men love football and all their wives and girlfriends are annoyed by that obsession. And yet there probably are more female fans for male football, than there are male plus female fans for female football.  Sure there is a great female football scene that genuinely loves the sport, but it's a complete niche compared to the male football scene. If I think of a weekly football magazine with 30-40 content pages, perhaps 3 would be about the female scene."
polandball,3ce7tn,calle30,43,Tue Jul 7 13:48:02 2015 UTC,"Here in Germany and other European countries it's a long standing stereotype that all men love football and all their wives and girlfriends are annoyed by that obsession.   Same in the USA, only they mean gridiron rather than association football. We even joke about ""football wives"" and people are ridiculed if they scheduled their wedding on the same day as an important game."

polandball,3ce7tn,Roflkopt3r,8,Tue Jul 7 14:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just realised. That would be a magazine that ""focusses on gender-diversity""."
polandball,3ce7tn,ChokeZero,23,Tue Jul 7 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"Also explaining why the US is better (and thus the rest of the world is worse) is that we 1) mix sports and school very closely and 2) we have a lot of academically bad schools.  I don't know about Germany, but in France and the UK, sports teams for 18 and unders aren't as closely linked to schools as they are in the US.  There are a lot of schools in the US where the core purpose of the school, academic education is pretty well given up on as pointless, so they focus intently on sports.  The stereotypical example is small towns in Texas, where the culture shuns kids who do well academically, and the miserable adults focus their attention on the 15 to 18 year olds American Football teams.  While American Football and Basketball for boys have been the main focus, and Basketball for girls has been the main girls' sport, Soccer for girls has grown enormously in high school (and younger) sports."
polandball,3ce7tn,Roflkopt3r,4,Tue Jul 7 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"We have schools that focus on sports specifically, but usually sports is with sport associations and unrelated to schools. There is some degree of cooperation, like if a young athlete participates in competitions during school time and things like that, but organised sports is generally external to schools.  Extracuricular school sport clubs usually don't quite have the same quality, or are just entry points into higher level  outside of schools and universities."
polandball,3ce7tn,JeSuisSuedois,7,Tue Jul 7 15:06:39 2015 UTC,So it's basically the same reason the Americans are always so bad in the men's World Cup? ie. Nobody cares?
polandball,3ce7tn,ofRedditing,4,Tue Jul 7 15:21:36 2015 UTC,Yep. The same reason why USA have the best American Football clubs yet don't compete very well in male football.

Bud Light, which cost four times as much (or more depending on where you buy) - but isn't much better. Maybe a little.
