olympia,3dv5ja,chrono2x,6,Sun Jul 19 19:52:36 2015 UTC,My out of control japanese plum tree has decided to produce a bumper crop this year. So I figured I would ask if anyone was interested in getting a load of plums.  My offer is $5 you bring your own container and you can pick as many plums as you would like. If you are interested then drop me a PM and I will send you my address.

Check Craigslist. Like, stay on that, and search all over the region - not just Olympia. It's a long shot, but if someone does try to sell it, CL is a likely bet.    Good luck!"

They often collect them then move a bunch of them somewhere.   Big cities like Seattle might be your best bet.  Good luck!   edit: You can build a bunch of links like this for each of the local craigslist  area + craigslist.org/search/sss?sort=rel&query=norco would search for norco bikes in area.  For instance portland.craigslist.org/search/sss?sort=rel&query=norco would search portlands craigslist.  You can see CL for regions in places like this http://geo.craigslist.org/iso/us/or and this http://geo.craigslist.org/iso/us/wa  I'd search for things like norco, blue and maybe if you have time other terms.

olympia,3d3rth,whodkne,2,Mon Jul 13 07:55:58 2015 UTC,"I just wish it didn't have to always be through Facebook.  All this talk about Bernie fighting the oligarchs and we use their toy/tool to spy on us as our way to spread the message?  I just really, really, don't get it.  Anyone who supports the kind of policies as Bernie does should also be well aware of how abso-fucking-lutely evil Facebook's business model is and how much of your data is piggybacked from them straight to the NSA/CIA.  (Just in case you or anyone else forgot, while the USA Freedom Act might have scaled back the domestic phone monitoring, the full-take canvasing of the entire internet is still in full swing by the NSA and no one seems to give a flying fuck.  Thanks, USA Freedom Act for doing fuck-all except codifying this bullshit.)  Fuck Facebook and their Office Of Information Awareness Venture Capital Funders.  People wonder why there are no more real activists in America?  It's because we allowed our activist groups to be ceaselessly monitored by not making our own sites and giving them good encryption and privacy controls.  The FBI has been inserting itself into activist groups for decades.  If there's a reason Sanders is going to lose, it will probably be because while all of us endorse his ideas, none of us have enough balls to really make a change in how we, the people, interact with him and with the overall electoral campaign in general.  And that means learning to not organize on sites like Facebook and reddit, where all your conversations and organizations are plaintext and easily disruptable.  See:  The infiltration of Occupy Wall Street."
olympia,3d3rth,deadaluspark,2,Mon Jul 13 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"It's a tough situation. The way I see it we have to use the tools available to get the most impact and spread the message far and wide. From what I have seen it still seems like the newer voting generation isn't as active as the older and there is a definite learning curve to get that older, more active generation using better tools. Do we even have better, somewhat mainstream alternatives? The problem is the user base is easily found and contacted on FB, almost everyone exists there now to see family photos and the like. While using it as the main means of organization isn't ideal, alternatives seem sparse if at all."
olympia,3d3rth,deadaluspark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to help build an alternative, but I lack the financial resources to do so on my own.  I understand the need to make it simple and available and everyone already uses Facebook yadda yadda, but it leaves people like me out in the cold since I refuse to continue handing over personal information to a company I actually get so little in return from.  What, it's impossible to use a calendar and make plans with people using email?  The OPIUM board has been around forever, but they use a public Google forum.  I mean, that's really the core of all you need, an easy to remember website name, and a forum that is private and encrypted except for those with a username and password.  You could do like the reddit-born invite-only torrent site, baconBits, and make it invite only to ensure that the people who are being involved genuinely are directly involved, as them joining the forum comes mostly from them being socially connected in real life to another user.  I mean, I guess, as a guy who was deep into the internet long before Facebook, all I see positive about it is ""ease of use.""  Everyone still has a regular email address.  Everyone can choose to use sites outside of Facebook, it's that people choose not to.  On top of this, Facebook has undergone the same demographic change as MySpace.  Now that the majority of users on the site are in the 24-34 category, younger people are fleeing the site in droves, because nobody wants to be on the same site as their grandma.  Young kids aren't even using ""social networking"" anymore as much as social apps which connect you with others based on geolocation, not because you're actively connected to them.  Things like Yik Yak are blowing up while people are fleeing Facebook and Reddit to any alternative they can find.  Just because they have the widest audience doesn't mean the audience isn't fed up with the platform.  (We've seen that in spades on reddit lately, people just waiting/itching for an alternative to bail to.  And I'm sure as shit not going to fucking Voat, where all the FPH'ers and racists are going.)  If I had all the money and time I needed, I would already be busting out these kind of sites for people, but I don't and I'm certainly not running into tons of people who want to try.  No, I just get arguments about how its ""so easy to use"" Facebook.  Yeah, well ease of use in the modern era is also part of why suddenly, young people can no longer solve problems using technology.  By making it so easy to use that you don't need to know the basics of computing to use it, people just don't learn the basics.  A friend who is a teacher recently went through having to explain to his class of middle schoolers that smartphones are computers (a notion they were dumbfounded by, as well as how WiFi works.  Dumbfounded.  Literally unable to cope with the idea.), and none of them were even aware of how to change settings.  This dumbing down of computerization has led to this inability to do anything that even takes a small amount of thought, because ""it's just so much easier to use Facebook,"" and it's the core of why NSA/CIA spying works so well in the modern world, because we stupidly congregate in these large areas that are funded by the very billionaire class we want to be freed from.  By not forcing people to learn the difficult aspects of computing first and foremost, by putting that in school curriculum, we have an entire generation that will have most of their lives documented, and they are oblivious to it even happening.  (and since they are unaware of how any of it works, it makes it that much easier for the FBI to propose banning encryption, since most people don't even understand what they're talking about, let alone understanding encryption is what allows you to do online banking without all your money being stolen every day.)  Sorry to be so ranty about it, but the refrain of ""it's just so much easier"" rings in my ears as ""it's just so much easier to let the smart, rich people make the decisions for me."""

olympia,3cx3oy,erasmosis,4,Sun Jul 12 00:05:29 2015 UTC,"It's the two weeks where we lock up all our shit tight, make sure our motion detectors and burglar alarms work, and go out with a flashlight and a baseball bat if anything sounds funny after dark. It's also when we avoid downtown except for the one token demoburger on an off day when it's not such a zoo. The Yokels though...They dig it. For them, it's the most exciting thing all year. They all wear wifebeaters to show off their hickeys and homemade tattoos."
olympia,3cx3oy,jemmyjoe,3,Mon Jul 13 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's crap. Lakefair is a misnomer, it should be called swamp carnival. Majority of vendors sell import junk and I assume the majority of the revenue does not stay in the community. I don't know where they are from but the character of the crowd generally makes me uncomfortable. Reminds me of some sort of ex-convict reunion."
olympia,3cx3oy,erasmosis,2,Tue Jul 14 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"Its when Olympia hosts a party for tenino, elma, shelton, and all the other small towns around it.   Olympia brings them into the middle of town so they can collectively hate on them and their festival."
olympia,3cx3oy,jemmyjoe,3,Sun Jul 12 12:29:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. One of the things I've noticed in living here a few years is that Oly people seems to take pleasure in bashing the surrounding areas (smaller towns or the military base people). Oly is a unique and special area, but we needed be so snobby about people who aren't in line with our small college town culture."
olympia,3cx3oy,erasmosis,5,Sun Jul 12 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"""...and all the bad elements from Mason county show up.""  From the top comment.  Are ""all the bad elements,"" to mean people not from Olympia?  Not too sure who this is referring to.  But Olympians, who I like to believe are inclusive, seems to be quite insular when it comes to out-of-towners at Lakefair.  It the behavior at Lakefair particularly notorious or something?"
olympia,3cx3oy,banjo2ey,2,Sun Jul 12 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"The behavior is pretty working class poor folk from the woods.  Olympia has a really hard time with poor white folks. I've never experienced any bad behavior at lakefair, well not from the festival goers.   I really think it's just classism."
olympia,3cx3oy,erasmosis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I have downvotes so I say nothing."
olympia,3cx3oy,kowalabearhugs,6,Mon Jul 13 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"As heard on the bus a few days ago... ""In Olympia it's cool to pretend like you're poor.""  Thats the thing, they pretend like they're poor, but hold onto all the classism, and oppressive baggage of being rich.  Olympia, as a city,  talks a lot of shit about its neighbors because they're poor, and white.  rich white people don't understand why there are poor whites, it makes them uncomfortable, and instead of going after the oppressive forces that are harming everyone, they treat them like untouchables.     Also, I don't care about the downvotes on this one.  Having lived in Olympia for 10 years, I feel pretty confident about what i'm saying.  It isn't acceptable to talk shit about poor brown people in Oly.  And you better believe that the shops on 4th ave aren't paying those white kids enough to buy all those new macbook pros and car insurance."
olympia,3cq49g,piinabisket,7,Thu Jul 9 21:41:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not really seeing the causal connection there. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm totally 100% behind municipal wifi. Or maybe just burning Comcast to the ground. Either way, really.  But building up a municipal internet is a big investment, particularly since the state bans the sale of retail internet services by public utility districts. Getting that ban lifted would be a good first step."
olympia,3cq49g,CypressLI,5,Fri Jul 10 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"Looks like Kitsap has found a way around that, the public entity sells the services wholesale and then hopes private and non-profit will sell retail.  edit - and Mason county"
olympia,3cq49g,Jumpsuit_boy,2,Fri Jul 10 01:28:35 2015 UTC,That's good to know.
olympia,3cq49g,TheZeven,2,Fri Jul 10 02:01:23 2015 UTC,grand fathered in I think
olympia,3cq49g,Allevil669,3,Fri Jul 10 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"Mason County PUD#3 provides no retail services on their fiber network. It's wholesale only, which the law permits.  Olympia/Thurston county /could/ build out the network (more specifically, it would have to be a utility provider), but they could only sell to other business.   I know at least a couple local ISPs that would probably love to have the ability to resell in the area."
olympia,3cq49g,CypressLI,5,Fri Jul 10 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Olympia/Thurston County attempted to do this back in '98-ish. They got 99% finished, and were getting ready to throw the switch when Comcast sued them.  The city/county lost. The cables are installed, just dark. Oly/Thurston Co. have learned their lesson, and won't be trying again."
olympia,3cq49g,olyphil,10,Fri Jul 10 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"I would love to read more about this, got any links?"
olympia,3cq49g,deadaluspark,3,Fri Jul 10 01:34:15 2015 UTC,Know anyone  on the city council?
olympia,3cq49g,TitanReign25389,4,Thu Jul 9 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if anyone does.  On the state level, this is still illegal in Washington.  Until someone takes the state to court (perhaps the FCC themselves), we are and have been explicitly disallowed from forming municipal internet per Washington Revised Code Annotated § 54.16.330 since 2000.  We have to get this state-level law reversed before the city can even attempt to do this."
olympia,3cq49g,olyphil,4,Fri Jul 10 04:21:06 2015 UTC,You can thank the telecom lobby for that law. It was a direct result of Tacoma building it's municipal broadband and cable.
olympia,3cq49g,deadaluspark,2,Fri Jul 10 07:53:01 2015 UTC,So you are saying i need to go buy some lotto lickets to pay for the lawyers..... and a party for the whole oly sub
olympia,3cq49g,bi-fornicated,2,Fri Jul 10 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"That or we could attempt to petition the FCC to try to overturn the law, so maybe we wouldn't have to be on the hook paying for the lawyers."

Im 40 years old now, and trained to fight MMA for about 5 years back in my late 20s.  Your probably going to catch some static for fighting in a chair, but I say fuck em: be the warrior you know you are. Hit your opponent like a 4 wheeled beast and dont let up until you tap him with a bar or choke.  Lets see a submission!  Good luck buddy. Enjoy that mountain climb. I hear that shits breathtaking up top."

The theater is nicely air-conditioned too!  I tried leaching a free video feed for the previous nights, but the video was poor and the feed kept stuttering. Don't know how they do it, but the live feed signal was just perfect.   If you like the Dead, it's now or never!"

olympia,3bxt1f,-I-am-who-I-am-,3,Fri Jul 3 01:14:46 2015 UTC,Any particular tattoo style you're interested in? You want to go with an artist who will be keen on doing what you have in mind.
olympia,3bxt1f,kimarya,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:16:56 2015 UTC,"That's true. I still have a lot of ideas I'm rolling around, I'll check out the work of a few artists and go from there :)"
olympia,3bxt1f,kimarya,5,Fri Jul 3 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"Well Lexi at Lo & Behold is excellent and does a variety of styles. Stacie just opened her own shop called Olympia Tattoo, and she's really great, especially at black and grey, but has good color work as well. If you're looking for portrait or realism, Bryan Child's at Spidermonkey is fantastic. Lexi and Stacie have Instagram as well, which is a fantastic tool for checking out a lot of artists portfolios."
olympia,3bxt1f,mechjesus,2,Fri Jul 3 05:54:01 2015 UTC,Oh nice!! Thank you so much! I'm going to be working on a sort of collage affect from shoulder to upper thigh. I'll probably end up with mixed styles

olympia,3bxt1f,ktron24,2,Fri Jul 3 05:36:24 2015 UTC,Tattoos- bulldog tattoo parlor on the corner of lily and Martin way.  As far as piercings go I like Metro. The one down town and the one at the Capitol mall are both really rad😊👍🏼

olympia,3bybod,traconi,3,Fri Jul 3 04:04:51 2015 UTC,I started looking for one and found them fairly cheap on Amazon.
olympia,3bybod,itsmeee,2,Fri Jul 3 06:37:33 2015 UTC,"Costco had portable ac/heaters last week. If the stores are sold out, they can be ordered online. The good thing is that they can also be returned to the store.   Lowes and Home Depot also have in store or online options,  and I think that you can return it to the store.   Sears and Walmart also sell ACs. Online orders may need to be shipped back, not returned to the store!   Best Buy, definitely.  Target and  Fred Meyer,  maybe.   And head down  to Tumwater, the sales tax rate is a tiny bit lower!"
