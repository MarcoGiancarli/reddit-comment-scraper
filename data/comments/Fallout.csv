Fallout,3e2e2c,Aikidi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"I did that before. It's fun sometimes. I had a low int char that punches things and takes a million bullets. I had a ""normal"" well rounded character. I had a hardcore game for a while. And I had a character that was evil with low charisma and basically slaughtered everything.  The last time I played, I had those going on concurrently. Sometimes I feel like punching. Sometimes I want to kill the people who smile and bring laughter to those around. Sometimes I just feel like questing like normal.   Now that I'm back, I'm doing one playthrough with Practice Make Perfect so I can get all my skills past 100. It's a TTW playthrough so I also have the perk to make all my stats at 9. It's my ""God"" playthrough one last time before FO4. I can pass any skill checks I need, whether it's for skills or SPECIAL stats. It's a way to scrounge around the entire worlds again one more time and seeing if I missed anything else in my previous several hundred hours. I don't need separate loads for this one since I can switch to punching or sniping or heavy guns any time I want. I think I'm liking it since I've played the game enough already."

So if you noclip through the ground you can find just random radios that you can talk to that are transmitting the sound for you to hear

Fallout,3e0svq,raps_caucasionally,18,Tue Jul 21 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"Just like in Skyrim, where your inventory is just a chest under the map. Every single location had to have this chest under the floor and when you press ""I"", you effectively only opened said chest."

Fallout,3e0svq,Artyloo,43,Tue Jul 21 15:12:47 2015 UTC,I believe he is mistaken. Vendor chests are hidden under the map. A character's actual inventory is tied to their actor object.
Fallout,3e0svq,simpleglitch,23,Tue Jul 21 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"This is correct. An entity's inventory is tied to it; that's the thing you get when you pickpocket or kill someone. Vendors' ""stock"" is a chest, which contains all items in their separate inventory and their gold. That's why you only get a few things when you kill or pickpocket a merchant."
Fallout,3e0svq,GoogleBen,6,Tue Jul 21 16:12:19 2015 UTC,That correct. It's normally just under them. My Cousin tried this and spent 30 mins each merchant just looking for that chest  (He tried using the ps3 version). He even tried a glitch where you're inside a hold/City and you go outside without going through a door/loading screen. WHen you do that you can go under that Hold/City and basically see all the NPCs items inside a chest.
Fallout,3e0svq,jexdiel321,31,Tue Jul 21 16:45:23 2015 UTC,Their engine seems like a grown-up version of RPG Maker
Fallout,3e0svq,hurenkind5,8,Tue Jul 21 15:11:55 2015 UTC,That's not correct. Entity inventories are tied to the entity. That's how you loot corpses.   The chests under the floor are inventories for shopkeepers. That's why you can't necessarily steal all of a shopkeepers stock from their back pocket.
Fallout,3e0svq,Booman246,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:04 2015 UTC,Wasn't this just for shopkeeper inventories?

Fallout,3e0svq,johhny_topside,107,Tue Jul 21 12:45:27 2015 UTC,Because the full ones were next to the devs mouse at the time.
Fallout,3e0svq,g0_west,20,Tue Jul 21 12:51:21 2015 UTC,Or maybe they needed to start finishing some dungeons while other people finished up the coding for the tables.

Fallout,3e0svq,warmechanic,23,Tue Jul 21 15:41:30 2015 UTC,Because the left leg needed to be longer? Just a guess.
Fallout,3e0svq,nukeclears,6,Tue Jul 21 14:18:51 2015 UTC,Probably the correct answer here.
Fallout,3e0svq,someoneiswrongonline,6,Tue Jul 21 15:54:52 2015 UTC,"Gonna take a random guess, but let's say you have a room with one of those full height shelves and you also need a half height shelf.   Instead of loading both the half height shelf, and the full height shelf, just load the full height shelf and have the bottom half of the full height shelf under the floor.  To the player, it looks mostly the same, but behind the scenes you have cut down on loading time. Instead of loading two different shelves, you have loaded one. Anything for efficiency I guess."
Fallout,3e0svq,iwumbo2,27,Tue Jul 21 15:39:13 2015 UTC,That's hilarious.  People getting butthurt over stuff like this confuse me.  It's not like you can tell that table is the top half of a bookshelf by looking at it as intended so who cares?  I'd rather the group spend less time creating graphical assets and more time working on the game anyway.
Fallout,3e0svq,stokleplinger,1303,Tue Jul 21 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the NPC running fast. The player is equipped with an armor piece that makes their view look like a train.  Then the player has a special camera animation played that moves the first person camera forward along a specific track.  And to the people saying that this is somehow the fault of the engine or lazy, you guys are also pretty stupid. These kinds of solutions make up the bulk of game development. It's a clever, bug free solution that works brilliantly, even if it's only able to be used in one area. It's not like they're gonna waste time coding up a big system for running trains.

Fallout,3e0svq,MrBlankenshipESQ,38,Tue Jul 21 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking of clever solutions: Try noclipping next time you're in an elevator (like the one that takes you to the top of the Washington Monument in FO3, for example). Instead of the elevator moving, it stays in place while everything else around you moves. Not exactly sure why it was easier for Beth to do it this way but I thought it was neat."
Fallout,3e0svq,livemau5,32,Tue Jul 21 07:22:36 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty normal way to program that, it's like moving the map instead of the character, a lot of games do that"

Fallout,3e0svq,Oooch,6,Tue Jul 21 09:43:41 2015 UTC,"I remember those maps. The ones with the boats were good to. My favourite was the Destruction Derby map for CS.  The basics of it is: the physics systems weren't very good back then. They only really worked with cuboid shapes and didn't have the best collision detection and collision resolving.  In some cases, it's the equivalent of teleporting the moving object, a little bit at a time. This often caused the player to end up inside the moving object which lead to various things... Clipping through it, getting stuck inside it, gibbing because the game thinks you've been crushed, etc... Combine that with network latency (multiplayer) and it was pretty much guaranteed to happen.  Modern physics tries to conserve momentum, meaning the elevator's upwards velocity would also be applied to the player. This prevents it teleporting inside/through you. Though it's not perfect still... Physics is still one of the glitchier parts of games."
Fallout,3e0svq,zeritor,2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:55 2015 UTC,"Partially, yes. Pushing the physics of the elevator up through the player has caused issues in games for years.    A mod for New Vegas, XRE - Vertibird, included physics elevators that moved the player instead of the world. They......weren't the most reliable things in the world. I've fallen through them. XRE - Cars also includes one that gets used for recovering cars you've lost or disabled somewhere, but it's so unreliable I have only ever witnessed it function properly once in >200 hours of playing with that mod installed.

Fallout,3e0svq,TheUnspeakableHorror,21,Tue Jul 21 05:28:07 2015 UTC,What is the reason behind this? Is it keep the player model from bouncing around when repeatedly colliding against a moving platform?
Fallout,3e0svq,DarkestHorizon,10,Tue Jul 21 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"The engine did weird things when the floor moves. If the floor was dropping, your character would 'hop' down instead of smoothly following the floor. When the floor rises, I believe you would actually clip through the ground.   So the smart solution is to move everything else so you don't encounter either of those problems."
Fallout,3e0svq,simpleglitch,5,Tue Jul 21 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"You'd think they'd just turn off clipping, clamp your x+z, and temporarily parent your y to the elevator. Seems like a ton of trouble to move everything else."
Fallout,3e0svq,KnightDuty,6,Tue Jul 21 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"True, But I've seen mods attempt to do it that way and the effect can be buggy or look unnatural. They likely tested that method and found moving the floor was a more stable solution."

Fallout,3e0svq,nateisgreat999,30,Tue Jul 21 09:55:20 2015 UTC,I think in BF4 the elevators just don't move. The doors close and after 6 seconds you're teleported to the top.

Fallout,3dypkz,redhatGizmo,7,Tue Jul 21 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing in Skyrim. I want the world to be as populous and varied as possible, so I don't want anyone to die. It's the same reason why I installed so many NPC mods, from nameless NPCs to liven up taverns, to named NPCs that give quests and are followers.   People always want to kill Heimskr, too. I don't get that sentiment. I'm actually a fan of Heimskr, as a Stormcloak and Talos believer. I actually installed a mod that allows him to follow me, so he screams sermons while killing my Imperial enemies."

Then put the body in the kitchen, left some half-cooked food, the murder weapon, and empty ale bottles all over the place.

What I did was roll for attributes; hair color, race, gender, etc. After I rolled all of those, I was basically looking at a description of my potential victims. Then I killed accordingly.

I even took trophies. :)"

Fallout,3dypkz,lemmiwinks81,27,Mon Jul 20 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno, maybe it's symbolic. He's happy he won the lottery, he gets to leave with his life. Sometimes people need to remind others of the harsh realities, stamping out hope and aspirations.   Sometimes you take pity on these poor souls and snuff out their light as quick and painlessly as you can. It's better this way, they died happy, instead of at the hands of a gang of fiends that raped their whole settlement. Maybe it's not your place to decide, but the law of the wasteland is that the strong survive.   Sometimes the strong protect the weak, but it can come in different forms. In a way, a quick painless death is more humane than giving someone some caps to buy food for their empty stomach.   Or you could just be like me and murder pretty much everyone you can on your first playthrough"

Fallout,3dypkz,SunshineBlind,14,Mon Jul 20 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"Seriously? You never explored Nipton? Depending on your character it can have some great stuff for you, and at least 1k worth of loot unless you have shit Charisma/Barter. 50 Lockpick can get you some great stuff out of the houses, not to mention all the food lying around if you are going for high Survival or are playing on hardcore. The main building has good stuff and a bunch of dogs to kill, and the whole town is littered in magazines.  My start for FO:NV is super min/max EXP and caps farming. I typically get to the Lucky 38 level 10-12 depending on how dedicated I was to clearing out the bottom half of the map, and I usually have enough to pick up Bozar/Esther/Sub-Dermal or whatever other expensive-ass thing I want for my primary playstyle without touching the casinos. Then I get minimum 75/75/60 Science/Lockpick/Sneak and go clean out Dead Money, which gives you 370,000 in Gold Bars (getting all 37 is as easy as having 60 sneak and decent timing) plus however much Prewar Money you are willing to get, somewhere in the 3,000 range for non-Luck characters and closer to 20,000 for 8-10 Luck (I don't touch casinos unless I have 8 Luck minimum). 3,000 Prewar is 30,000 caps, 20,000 Prewar is 200,000 caps. Dead Money literally cures all cash problems for the rest of the game.  Not everyone min/maxes that hard, but how could you not have been in every structure at least once? I've probably checked every container at least twice."

Fallout,3dypkz,joshua_nash,33,Mon Jul 20 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"The lottery is probably a comparison to decimation from the roman army irl. Decem means 10 and in roman times a way to punish a large group of offenders in the military was to put them in groups of 10. A lottery would occur among each 10 soldiers where 9 soldiers would beat one of them to death. I could be wrong but I believe the english word ""Decimation"" comes from this allthough the meaning has somewhat changed  (english is not my native language). This lottery done by Caesars legion is actually even more cruel than the real roman legion because this version of decimation/lottery - only had a single winner."
Fallout,3dypkz,Ouroboros612,61,Mon Jul 20 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"The Legion practices old school decimation.  When a unit is under-performing, Lanius beats its commander to death then orders every 9 soldiers to kill the 10th."

Fallout,3dypkz,imonreddittoo,10,Mon Jul 20 19:39:29 2015 UTC,Decimate can mean to kill exactly or about 1/10 of a population or to kill a small but significant amount of a population or to kill almost all of a population in English. Most formal writers/journalists try to use the word to refer to only the first couple definitions to avoid confusion.
Fallout,3dypkz,jacktheBOSS,9,Mon Jul 20 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"Ah. I thought the general use of ""decimated"" in the english language was currently used synonymously with ""eradicated"". ""destroyed"" or ""annihilated"". So if a village was slaughtered the media could have used ""decimated"" for example regardless of the percentage of slain people."
Fallout,3dypkz,Ouroboros612,9,Mon Jul 20 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"The popular, colloquial usage is definitely closer to ""eradicate"" than ""destroy 10%,"" but I think it usually implies that there are at least a few survivors unlike eradicate. Media, like I said is often more careful in their use for the sake of clarity, but the word can go either way in news reports."
Fallout,3dypkz,jacktheBOSS,3,Mon Jul 20 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely means ""to reduce by a tenth"". I've never understood why it colloquially refers to widespread eradication/defeat, when there are still nine tenths left."

If you're fairly pragmatic and a little sociopathic (like me,) you just shoot him and try to take his winnings off his corpse. I did that the first time I saw him, and then went into town and found out what lottery he won. It sorta washed over me in waves how incredible it was that they set everything up so that I made that lottery meaningless in a completely natural-feeling way. It was an oddly powerful moment.

Unless the D.C. chapter has expanded significantly since the events of Fallout 3 (which is unlikely, considering the fact that their recruitment protocols are very strict and manufacturing new suits of power armor is essentially impossible because most of the technology that was capable of that was destroyed), I suspect that the BoS we'll be seeing in Fallout 4 will be a bittersweet bunch like they were in FNV - they'll have pros and cons, the'll seem like good guys on one hand and bad guys on the other.

Getting a tattoo of something she likes is fine, but how is it going to look to others  ""Oh cool tattoo, what is it?""  ""Oh it's of a video game I used to play a few years ago""  ""......Why would you get a tattoo of that""  "".....pop culture trends?"""
Fallout,3e00ow,Wobbly_,10,Tue Jul 21 09:42:58 2015 UTC,I think you're missing the point. Who gives a shit about how it looks to others. I have a fallout tattoo. I didn't get it for other people. I got it for myself.
Fallout,3e00ow,DefendsTheDownvoted,6,Tue Jul 21 12:49:40 2015 UTC,Sorry man but you shouldn't get a tattoo based on what other people think.  Maybe don't get a tattoo at all if that worries you.  Fallout is not pop culture.  Only a small segment of the population will ever play it.  She got the tattoo because she is a fan.  Other fans will recognize it even 20 or 30 years from now.
Fallout,3e00ow,EdibleToenail,5,Tue Jul 21 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"Almost like people get tattoos for personal reasons and not for others, huh?  Also, don't overestimate the value of commemorating your youth. When you get old and broken down, thinking back on youthful indiscretions becomes a major pastime."
Fallout,3e00ow,SJWTumblrinaMonster,-6,Tue Jul 21 13:09:01 2015 UTC,Pop culture is always bad for a tattoo. Anything that goes out of date like a game should not be a tattoo. Those people usually regret it after 30 years and the tattoo becomes irrelevant. The tattoo is very good but I just hope for her sake fallout is still mainstream when shes 80.
Fallout,3e00ow,Colley619,4,Tue Jul 21 12:59:50 2015 UTC,"When Im 80 I could care less, at that point you are more worried about pissing yourself then a tattoo. I have plenty of tattoos and dont regret any, granted I dont have an ex gfs name on me either so."
Fallout,3e00ow,MrRiggs,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:44 2015 UTC,Fallout isn't pop culture and isn't mainstream.  Most people in the USA won't recognize the tattoo on November 10 when Fallout 4 is released so who cares if they still don't recognize it 25 years from now.  Other fans will recognize it.

Fallout,3e00ow,Infinitedaw,5,Tue Jul 21 03:36:24 2015 UTC,"brutally smash her face in with a twenty-pound sledgehammer.     OK, I have no idea if he intended it or not but that line at least is a shockingly sweet quote from Punch-Drunk Love... it's an interesting little Adam Sandler film about a socially impaired business owner.    If you haven't seen it give it a go... it's short, strange and my favorite Sandler film."
Fallout,3e00ow,southern_boy,-6,Tue Jul 21 12:14:39 2015 UTC,People apparently don't understand sarcasm. I thought it was funny.
Fallout,3e00ow,StuffWithWords,6,Tue Jul 21 06:25:09 2015 UTC,uh   sarcasm    [sahr-kaz-uh m]   noun     harsh or bitter derision or irony.   a sharply ironical taunt; sneering or cutting remark: a review full of sarcasms.
Fallout,3e00ow,rudyrussoforsenate,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:49:52 2015 UTC,Irony. As in he didn't want to actually do any of that. And people got extremely offended over a joke.
Fallout,3e00ow,StuffWithWords,2,Tue Jul 21 06:56:23 2015 UTC,...It also has absolutely nothing to do with irony.  Maybe you should buy one of these?
Fallout,3e00ow,rudyrussoforsenate,3,Tue Jul 21 07:34:35 2015 UTC,"Probably should. Totally did use it wrong. Oops.   Forgive me, internet!  Should have just said jest. Oh well."

It'll be online within 24 hours of its release either officially or otherwise. I wish they'd just officially release it on YouTube that afternoon though since there's going to be leaks of it anyways.

Fallout,3dzwpg,7hru,3,Tue Jul 21 12:28:30 2015 UTC,The whole thing was staged. They wanted to make someone say something really nerdy.
Fallout,3dzwpg,Cirvis,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:05 2015 UTC,"They claim that it's a recreation of actual events but I'm voting for staged.  Even in Eve I haven't heard survival odds given in anything other than speculative ""We've got this"", or ""It'll be a hard fight"", or ""There's no point in fighting them"", or just really simple silence as you take an important fight and everyone realizes just how absolutely screwed you are.  But I've never heard a percentage."
