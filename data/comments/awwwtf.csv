awwwtf,3d2lkw,zorsebandarOc98,8,Mon Jul 13 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"I think its cause of this:  "" Quite tiny, the species normal size is up to 3cm, but it does feed on larger prey like the venomous Portuguese man of war consuming the organism in its entirety. The blue angel is immune to the man of wars venom, collecting it for its own use, using a much more concentrated venom, its sting is more powerful and deadly than the man o war.  The poison is stored inside the finger like structures sticking out of its body known as cerata, this is just one of its defense mechanisms. The beautiful blue underside of the blue angel acts as a camouflage from air born predators as it floats upside down on the surface of the water.  Its back is grayish in color and faces downward, camouflaging it from predators looking up from below the water. The Blue angel is a hermaphrodite allowing both slugs to produce egg strings after mating which they lay on driftwood, or the skeletons of their victims."""

awwwtf,3bza88,TheVentMan,16,Fri Jul 3 10:37:13 2015 UTC,"I had a mantis named Goliath when I was a kid.  My dad caught it in the early summer, and we fed it crickets, grasshoppers and other random bugs that we caught.  When I went back to school in the fall, Goliath became a school pet for a few weeks, and students would bring in plastic baggies of live bugs (weird, I know) to feed to Goliath.  As Goliath grew bigger and stronger, the seasons moved on, and it became Winter.  Normally a Mantis of this age would have died, as they die in the winter and their offspring hatch the next spring.  Kept inside, however, Goliath kept going strong.  We started picking up feeder crickets from pet stores by the dozen, as it's a bit difficult to forage for bugs with snow on the ground.  Finally, as the next spring finally started, Goliath started to slow down.  He would still eat, but it got harder and harder for him to catch bugs.  I knew that the end was coming, and this very old (for a mantis) creature was entering his final days.  Then surprisingly one day, Goliath climbed up on one of the branches in his big terrarium, and started doing what looked like taking a dump on one of them.  My dad explained things: Goliath wasn't a he, it was a she!  And she was laying her eggs.  Unfortunately they were unfertilized and thus would never produce offspring, but Goliath laid two huge egg sacs and one medium sized one over the course of a day or so.    A week later Goliath, perched majestically at the top branch of her cage, stopped moving forever.  She did not fall dead to the floor of the cage, though--she stood like a statue, as a lasting remembrance of how awesome of a pet she was.  Goliath has long since been buried--but she lived a very long and happy life.  my only regret is not being able to give her a chance to have offspring, but I hopefully gave her a good and enjoyable life.  I know it's weird to have any attachment to an insect, but Goliath seriously kicked ass as a pet."
awwwtf,3bza88,scootersbricks,5,Sat Jul 4 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"I've captured a few more mantises in the years following my story above, but sadly none of them have survived very long or have been let go after they refused to eat.  Sadly it seems that not all mantises are cool with being kept in captivity.  Goliath loved having her six legged dinner prepared for her every night, at this point I probably won't capture any more out of fear that I'll just end up reducing their chances of long term survival."

awwwtf,3b6cj3,thorium007,2,Sat Jun 27 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Mayhem (band):       Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed 1984 in Oslo, regarded as one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene. Mayhem's career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (""Dead"") and the 1993 murder of guitarist Øystein Aarseth (""Euronymous"") by former member Varg Vikernes (""Count Grishnackh""), of Burzum.  The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (""Hellhammer""), Jørn Stubberud (""Necrobutcher"") and Sven Erik Kristiansen (""Maniac"") reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen (""Blasphemer"") replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar and Krister Dreyer (""Morfeus"") have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively.  The band's music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the global heavy metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. The 2007 album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for best metal Album.

Their mother was shot by a farmer when she crawled up under his porch and when he pulled her out, she had babies all over her.

Most are rescues from bad homes.  They're so great but so many people get them because they're trendy and cheaper than a dog.  They don't expect the health issues or training that goes with it.  So many end up neglected and abused because of it.  It's sad, but I'm okay getting the power rejects because I love them.    I just reached over to pet my oldest female (not a rescue)  and she started to sing and chirp at me.  <3"

No telling you know?   I had no idea that raising skunks was a trend these days. How are they cheaper than a dog exactly? I figured they'd be more expensive being wild and ""exotic"" you know?"
awwwtf,3908al,electroskank,2,Mon Jun 8 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"When I got my female, she was 300 dollars.  She's black and white.  Colored skunks ran about 350. The price has gone up in the state I lived in /bought them in to try and deter people, but they're still cheaper than a 900 dollar puppy Mill dog from a pet store.    Vet/diet care?  Hella expensive.  I probably drop 40-60 dollars a week on them for food alone (not bad, really but so many people buy discount dog food for 20 dollars for 50 LBS) , not counting supplements they need. When ever people tell me they want to get a skunk, I tell them all the horror stories of cost and vets and health problems, and if they STILL interested, then I move into why they're totally worth the investment.    If you're actually curious, Skunkhaven.net is a great place.  I used to be a state Representative for where I lived until the laws got really wonky about it.  I then went to college and stuff so I never worried about staying active as a rep for them.  After I got out of college, I got back in contact with them and the pet skunk community.  There's a Skunkhaven Facebook group, too, that's really active.  I always give away that link for people curious about them as pets.  So much good info there.  There's even a skunkfest that they host every year.  :)    Sorry, got a bit rambley."

You do what you have to because you love them, and all that hard work and money you put into them is worth it.  They're very lovable animals and though they are more independent than a dog, they're still a joy to have around.  I love just watching them.  The way they walk, and play... It's a wonderful experience and when they trust and love you, it's the greatest feeling.  Even more when it's a rescue. Skunks often bond with the human that they're around the most, so to have a skunk that wasn't yours bond with you is special.  Though I've never had the issue with them not liking and trusting my family or friends, but we always try to socialize ours so they'd be good skunk ambassadors.    They're smart as heck too.  Block off somewhere they want to be and they WILL get in there,  it's just a matter of time.  The male we had would just sit and stare at the obstacles until he figured a way around it.  Skunk people will say that it's an experience that you can only understand when you have a skunk, but I think you can have similar experiences with dogs or cats.  They just don't have the same behavior... If that makes sense??"

When I was a kid there was a pet store in our town with an albino Burmese Python named Big Bertha that had pink eyes that looked like buttons. I didn't think it was a real snake (I was like 5) because it never blinked or moved and I had never seen a bright yellow snake with pink eyes nor one that big. I was certain that the pet shop owner and my mom were pulling my leg by showing me a stuffed animal and telling me it was a giant yellow snake with pink button eyes.

The rats (and sometimes the mice) are actually pretty friendly because rats are curious and social by nature. They don't really have any predators in the city, so when I sit outside in the vacant lot by my building while I play ball with my dog they come over and say hello. Rodents are not susceptible to rabies, so if you're worried about that it's rare. I usually make sure to keep my distance because they are wild animals after all, but they like to hang out and cock their heads at me as if to say ""hey, what's up?"". The domestic ones you can get from the pet store are nice, disease free, and even more friendly! When my budget is a little more stable I'm totally getting a couple rats.  I was actually just telling my husband about a domestic rat I met in a city park because thinking about those traps and seeing a poor dead little rat by my building made me think of it. She, the domestic rat, seemed really lonely, distressed, and had the coloring of a pet rat (she looked like this but with a brown bum domestic rats are pretty big). I called animal control and I waited with her until they came. A couple days after they picked her up I got a call thanking me for turning her in. The owner was super happy to have her back as was Snickers' (found out that was the rat's name) companion rat. It turns out the owner took them to the park for a little play date and Snickers decided to wander off. She was an adorable little gal and was super happy to see me as she wasn't used to being without her companion rat or a person.  I guess that's part of why I can't bring myself to kill them. Rats are especially social and love hanging out with their people and other animals. Plus they're so damn adorable. I've made friends with wild rats, as I alluded to, and they're just curious little folks for the most part. I'll bring them little piles of food (totally appropriate, I won't poison them. Plus it's an urban area and rats stay out of the building by my leaving out feed in the neighboring park).  As for those live traps you may want to look at a hardware store to get ones large enough to for a big rat. I got my mice traps from a big box grocery store without barely having to look, so I'd think a hardware store would carry them. I'll look it up for you!"

There's lots of other species which eat bushes and acacia, so it's not like giraffes have found the key to El Dorado by developing a long neck - to be able to draw advantage of it for feeding, they also had to develop a freakishly long tongue and very tough skin on tongue and lips.  If you look at only the neck, there's several disadvantages brought by it, such as how difficult it is for them to drink and sleep, and how difficult it is for their blood to reach their brain. They actually have valves in the artery in the neck to prevent backflow, and some of the highest blood pressure in the animal kingdom. Even a small injury to the neck can be fatal.  As for a source, it's a little difficult because I learned about it from one of my biology textbooks originally. The documentary series Inside Nature's Giants has an episode about the giraffe, though, and it's extremely fascinating. If you're interested I'd highly recommend that you find it and watch it!"

awwwtf,35ybf0,I-Argue-With-Myself,4,Thu May 14 21:21:17 2015 UTC,Shocks are just slang for them. The actual component is called a suspension dampener. Was corrected many times in my mechanical vibrations class
awwwtf,35ybf0,BaPef,2,Thu May 14 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"The actual component is a shock absorber, shock for short. Maybe they made you call them suspension dampeners because you were talking about more than just shocks, like struts too."
awwwtf,35ybf0,AurionTobi,1 point,Thu May 14 21:36:39 2015 UTC,"The actual function of them is to dampen the vibrational frequency within the suspension system itself so that the system never harmonizes at it's resonant frequency and have an accelerated coil system (spring expanding and contracting out of control). The (shock) absorber's job is just to control the amount of fluctuation in the system to balance comfort, and a safe spring ratio.    Tl;dr  Shock absorber and dampener are the same thing, just depends on what you want to call it."
awwwtf,35ybf0,joykin,3,Fri May 15 02:07:39 2015 UTC,"Dampener is a broad term that would include all suspension dampening parts like shocks, bushings and struts. Shock absorbers are the name of one kind of dampener. So no, it's not really the same.  Your original comment that shocks are actually called dampeners was wrong, they're called shocks and are a type of dampener."

The disputed islands, which were annexed by Soviet forces during the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation at the end of World War II, are currently under the Russian administration as South Kuril District of the Sakhalin Oblast (Сахалинская область, Sakhalinskaya oblast), but are claimed by Japan, which refers to them as the Northern Territories (北方領土, Hoppō Ryōdo ?) or Southern Chishima (南千島, Minami Chishima ?), arguably being part of the Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaidō Prefecture.  The San Francisco Peace Treaty  with Japan from 1951 states that Japan must give up all claims to the Kuril islands,  but it also does not recognize the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the Kuril Islands.  Furthermore, Japan currently claims that at least some of the disputed islands are not a part of the Kuril Islands, and thus are not covered by the treaty.  Russia maintains that the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the islands was recognized following agreements at the end of the Second World War.   However, Japan has disputed this claim. The disputed islands are:   Iturup (Russian: Итуруп)/Etorofu Island (Japanese: 択捉島, Etorofu-tō ?) Kunashir (Russian: Кунашир)/Kunashiri Island (Japanese: 国後島, Kunashiri-tō ?) Shikotan (Russian: Шикотан)/Shikotan Island (Japanese: 色丹島, Shikotan-tō ?) Habomai rocks (Russian: острова Хабомаи ostrova Habomai)/Habomai Islands (Japanese: 歯舞諸島, Habomai-shotō ?)

awwwtf,35bzu4,MadKian,0,Sat May 9 16:11:58 2015 UTC,Malone is also a professional trainer who knows wjay he is doing. This just happened to be a dog he underestimated the aggressiveness of and got bit for it
awwwtf,35bzu4,Icalasari,4,Sat May 9 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he did a lot of things wrong there with his body language and as a ""professional"" he should really know better, I'm currently doing an animal behaviour course at college and have worked with plenty of dogs and other animals through this, two of the first things we learn is that if we're bitten/attacked its our fault for not reading the animals body language and movements correctly (regardless of if it is a so called aggressive animal or so called tame/docile animal) and second to never touch an animal without its ""permission"", going straight in to touch it on the nose without letting it sniff you first is a threat regardless of how well you know a dog, he likely startled the dog because, as you'll notice, the dog was calm and collected then turns and suddenly theres a hand on its face (think along the lines of someone standing behind you with a scary mask then you turn around and suddenly theyre in your face, it makes you jump, maybe you yell or maybe you lash out, depends on the person)  Second thing he did wrong was an instinct after he was bitten, he stood up, on the point of standing up he looks, from the dogs perspective, big and scary, standing was a reflex but he should have then backed off instead of crouching down again. Yes with crouching you are low and submissive, but in this instance the dog has already lashed out once and is scared, the motion of him standing up then re-crouching is percieved as Caeser ""lunging"" at the dog, so naturally the dog tries to protect itself and goes in for the full attack (as a note you'll also see him looking at the dogs face/eyes as he re-crouches, eye-staring is a threat in most animal ""languages"" even if he was doing it by accident, he should know better and be looking just above the dogs head or completely away from it while backing off so it has the chance to calm down)  On the kicking, yes its self defence, if a dog is attacking you its welfare is no longer the priority, in all animal handling situations your own safety and the safety of the people around you takes priority over an animals, always. There is not many ways you can get a dog to stop attacking when it is scared so as horrible as it sounds you need to get it to stop any way you can before any severe harm is done  As a final side note, theres a general consensus in the animal care industry (especially with dog handlers) is that Caeser is god awful as /u/russkhan already mentioned. Sorry this kinda turned into a wall of text but i hope it helped explain the situation here, regardless of the animals behavioural problems, Caeser is the one at fault"

awwwtf,358lh9,JHStarner,3,Fri May 8 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Growth stages of article  Juvenile fish:       Ichthyoplankton (planktonic or drifting fish) are the eggs and larvae of fish. They are usually found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, sometimes called the epipelagic or photic zone. Ichthyoplankton are planktonic, meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with ocean currents. Fish eggs cannot swim at all, and are unambiguously planktonic. Early stage larvae swim poorly, but later stage larvae swim better and cease to be planktonic as they grow into juveniles. Fish larvae are part of the zooplankton that eat smaller plankton, while fish eggs carry their own food supply. Both eggs and larvae are themselves eaten by larger animals.

awwwtf,33x72w,tatch,10,Sun Apr 26 16:48:09 2015 UTC,There's a difference between reposting and cross posting.  Reposting is taking previously posted content and putting it in the same sub again.  Cross-posting is taking content from one sub (or source) and sharing it with the audience of another sub.  95% of material on Reddit is cross posted from somewhere else on the Internet. Sharing of material across user bases is literally the way Reddit works. No reason to be annoyed about it. Be happy your content is being shared.

It is also known as Mexican hairless dog in English speaking countries, and is one of several breeds of hairless dog.  In Nahuatl, from which its English name originates, its name is xōlōitzcuintli /ʃoːloːit͡sˈkʷint͡ɬi/ (singular)  and xōlōitzcuintin /ʃoːloːit͡sˈkʷintin/ (plural).  The name xōlōitzcuintli comes from the god Xolotl and itzcuīntli /it͡skʷiːnt͡ɬi/, meaning dog in Nahuatl.   A genetic study was recently conducted in order to determine the origin of the Xoloitzcuintli breed. The study did not find a close genetic relationship between Xoloitzcuintli and the Chinese Crested Dog. However, the study showed that this breed did not result from a separate domestication of dogs in the New World. Xoloitzcuintli appear to have been a result of a mixture of several Old World dog breeds.

awwwtf,33ebkx,mcraamu,8,Wed Apr 22 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"As I said elsewhere in these comments, I was hospitalized for a week after getting mauled by a housecat (bitten over twenty times, and badly scratched to boot). The Director of Internal Medicine who was put over my case told me that cat bites are the most infectious common bites seen in American hospitals next to human bites. The way she explained it, they have so much bacteria in their mouths and on their claws it's almost like getting bitten by a gila monster.   The reason I had to stay in the hospital so long was because I got badly infected and they had to put me on eight different courses of antibiotics before they found one that would drive the cat scratch fever back."

awwwtf,33ebkx,BlueAlopex,13,Wed Apr 22 00:12:27 2015 UTC,Well a huge part of it is raising it properly. A lot of people seem to think raising an animal is half neglecting it in your house hold and just taking care of it's bare essentials and wonder why the animal doesn't show them affection. It takes a lot of effort to properly raise an animal. All cats I ever had were super affectionate and wouldn't leave us(my family) alone. Even taught one a few tricks.

Even taught one a few tricks.   This is the way our family cats always were because we interacted with them constantly and gave them a ton of affection. We even taught them to come when we whistled like they were dogs.
awwwtf,33ebkx,danceswithronin,5,Wed Apr 22 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"That's my thing. I don't really want a super affectionate cat. They're annoying. I just lost a 15 year old indoor/outdoor cat that was like a brother to me. He was always super cool. He would enjoy a good 5-minute pet but any longer than that, and you're invading his space. He was super big on taking naps on top of people, though, that was his favorite thing to do. I miss that dude. I want another cat but I'm going to feel bad for ""replacing"" my brother.  Edit: Man, reading these other comments, my cat was the best. I could rub faces with him, and he loved a good head massage. He would headbutt your face. He'd nibble at your leg if you ignored him too long. Wasn't big on toys, but he'd bring me a dead bird or squirrel every now and then. Pretty funny, a week before I had to put him down he brought a rabbit into the house! I couldn't believe he still had the moves.  He had been losing weight on his back for some time, and started eating less and less. His liver had started failing, and with him being 15, there wasn't much the vet could do. We rode it out until it started getting bad, but I put him down before he had to suffer at all. Buried him and planted a nice bush on top of him."

You're way more likely to be killed by a falling coconuts, cows, mosquitos, champagne corks, tripping, or even vending machines.  The only time a cow attacks a person is if it mistakes them for a seal, which is almost never. Most of the time it's a person splashing around like an injured animal. As soon as the shark realizes you're not a seal, though, he lets go pretty fast.

It is often misdiagnosed as it can be confused with other forms of aggression. It is thought to be genetic in origin and is inheritable. A variety of treatments are available, but will need to be tailored to the individual needs of the specific dog. The term rage syndrome is attributed to Dr. Roger A.

He might be taking more risks than necessary but that's up to him.  With most snakes there isn't generally much chance of death anyhow, specially if he's got the antivenins like I heard a few people mention....   and obviously he'll know exactly what kinda snake bit him since he's an expert."
awwwtf,328eym,Silverlight42,3,Sun Apr 12 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have a friend who used to work with venomous snakes who went on a rant about the number of dumb things this dude has done, like she was saying in this video he should have been using a feeding pen or fed it in its enclosure, and there not being enough room to work with it and stuff."
awwwtf,328eym,LauretteOB,2,Sun Apr 12 09:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're supposed to establish a designated feeding pen if you have snakes as pets and never feed them anywhere else. If you do it in their enclosure, they'll become used to receiving magical food drops, so they'll confuse your hand for food when you go to lift them out later. I guess if you know what you're doing and don't care about that it's up to you, but I still think it's more psychologically comforting to the snake to know ""Feeding enclosure = food"" without having to guess where it's coming from or when."
awwwtf,328eym,PlumbTheDerps,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously. I would definitely think ""Lets not get bit"" is substantially better than ""It's ok i have anti-venom so it's not a HUGE risk"""
awwwtf,328eym,LauretteOB,2,Wed Apr 22 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"I've handled many reptiles before, like ones i've found out in the wild -- but where i'm at there is absolutely nothing that can envenom a person... and i've never been bitten, but the biggest I caught was a 2' long red bellied garter snake.  Now if I knew they were venomous, different story... even if I kept one as a pet I would probably take way more precautions... but that's just me.    Like I said before though, I think the risk is low and even if he does get bit... ask your friend if there's any serious risk provided the guy's got antivenin on hand for any bites... like I don't think anything will come from it apart from some pain for a bit.  To me, something like this is probably way lower risk than some extreme sports like free climbing or tightrope walking... or probably even parachuting... and way more people do those things than collect the amount of venomous snakes this guy's got.  anyway, personally I don't have a problem with what he does, provided he isn't mistreating 'em... and I can't really say that he does.  I don't really believe in keeping 'em in such small enclosures but it's still a better life than petstores i'm sure and they do it all the time and on a larger scale...  and at least he has videos and kinda educating/showing people these things, so there's a small benefit in that I think."
awwwtf,328eym,Silverlight42,2,Sun Apr 12 10:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it's not a ton of risk, I just mean like, why not eliminate the risk of, ya know, a cobra sneaking up on you by actually making sure it's enclosure is closed before ya move on"
awwwtf,328eym,LauretteOB,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"Like I said.... kinda up to him on what he sees as ""risk"".    He gets bit, suffers a bit of pain, administers antivenin... no big deal... but maybe he won't even get bit... up to him to play with that if he likes.   Not for you or me, but if he can handle, predict/etc... then that's kinda cool.  For example: Kevin Richardson with Hyena  I know it's crazy, they're wild... I never thought of hyenas as cute... but wow. yknow?   If you know how to respect... recognize the danger... etc... idk.   i'm all for interacting with animals in a more open space if you know how to act properly, which is what these kinds of people I think are all about.   Take Steve Irwin... he knew what it was like I think."
awwwtf,328eym,Silverlight42,2,Mon Apr 13 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, plus he has the scientific name of each snake labeled on each cage as an extra precaution. He's a little reckless but he's been doing it for a long time so he knows the risks he's taking."

And you know how species become endangered? Its through a million little cuts. There are native species in the US that have been pushed out of their ranges and made endangered by human activity. While your one cat may only kill a few dozen things a week, when everybody let's their cats run amok, and they feed and support feral cat colonies, they are responsible for the deaths of billions of birds. A death toll far greater than anything in nature can inflict on them.  And what if your cat is not killing a grey squirrel, but one of the rarer squirrels, like a flying squirrel, or one of the squirrel species that is very close to becoming endangered.   And I doubt very much that cars kill more squirrels than cats. A squirrel has a very good ability to evade and dodge a car. Which is not trying to kill the squirrel.

awwwtf,30buht,pineapplefries,7,Thu Mar 26 08:10:17 2015 UTC,Protocol for accidental unformed stool discharge is 10 hours at 20ppm chlorine level.....so basically no one will be swimming there until the next day.
awwwtf,30buht,CommonCent,29,Sat Apr 4 13:45:05 2015 UTC,"I saw this happen at a water park in Queensland called Wet'n Wild. This kid was about 10 and he went down the slide about as big as the one in the gif. Except he dumped a full load of diarrhoea, turned around and said ""Aww no!"" and ran off. An hour later I checked out the kids pool and it was empty and there was about 50 kg of chlorine powder covering the slide."
awwwtf,30buht,Random_Sime,32,Thu Mar 26 14:02:45 2015 UTC,Poor kid won't ever forget that.  I saw a teenage boob at a water park when I was that age. What a magical day it was. Just popped right out on a water slide. bloop
awwwtf,30buht,CupcakeUnicorn,17,Thu Mar 26 14:37:47 2015 UTC,I was a 12 year old boy growing up in Wasaga Beach the year they legalized going topless for women in Ontario. Was a glorious time to be alive.
awwwtf,30buht,diarrheaphragm,12,Thu Mar 26 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"I was 22 and my friend was 20. We were at a water park and they had this big long slide with all kinds of twists and turns and a lifeguard stood at the bottom in water about mid- chest deep to help people at the end. They had double inner tubed so we decided to go down together. I'd had a baby 9 months before and hadn't lost the extra weight so I was at about 140 and she was a bigger girl, about 165, maybe a bit more. So we get on this slide and pick up some crazy speed going down. As we popped out at the end, back into the daylight (it was a full tube so it was dark inside) all I saw was the terrified look on the lifeguard's face about a second before 300 lbs of T&A bore down on him like a runaway train. I felt really bad and so did she but I laughed until I almost drowned. Then we avoided that area for the rest of the day as not to make the poor guy have flashbacks."
awwwtf,30buht,mommy2libras,2,Thu Mar 26 18:20:33 2015 UTC,I feel like most of us or maybe even all of us women have had a boob pop out at a waterpark before. Maybe it's one of those unspoken things that we dont realize we all experience because we dont talk about it but the lifeguards are very familiar with it.

You pick up your kid, get them out of the water ASAP, and tell the attending lifeguard who will sanction off the pool and start their normal process.  Then you get your kid to a bathroom, clean them up, and come back and apologize profusely again and ask if there is anything you can do to help.  The lifeguard (or whoever) calmly tells you that they've seen it a thousand times and don't fret over it.  Then you tell the story at family gatherings forever.  Easy peasy."

They existed from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous Period (228 to 66 million years ago ). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger.  Early species had long, fully toothed jaws and long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats made up of hair-like filaments known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned a wide range of adult sizes, from the very small Nemicolopterus to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx.
