Luthier,3e3mmf,ImReallyBoard,11,Tue Jul 21 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"Best thing to do would be to just tap it back into the hole. If the fit isn't tight enough you can probably put some super glue on the pin itself and let it dry, then tap it back in"
Luthier,3e3mmf,msdccms,11,Tue Jul 21 18:33:49 2015 UTC,Part of the point here is that is CAN come out when you need it to. The end of the button is supposed to be overly large to fit with the tapered end going through your strap and the large ball becoming a strap-lock. Then it stays the strap when you put your guitar away and then just bump it into place when you want to put the strap back around your neck. Lots of acoustic straps tie at the neck/nut and this design lets the strap loose for storage without the back strap button being worked loose from a screw stripping. Hope this makes sense to you. Wipe it with an emery board to scuff it and it will stay in place without being permanent.
Luthier,3e3mmf,dragonmage1,4,Tue Jul 21 20:36:50 2015 UTC,no need for superglue..  it should tap in and hold.. maybe moisten it very slightly.. if it is way too loose one wrap of masking tape will do the trick.
Luthier,3e3mmf,sambooka,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"I tried the masking tape trick, it seems to have worked. If it comes out again I'll try either wood glue or super glue and see how far that gets me."
Luthier,3e3mmf,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:30 2015 UTC,Yep. Just glue it. Especially on a cheap guitar. Just a dab so it can come out if you need it too.   Nothing harmful can come from it and it's much better than your guitar falling off the strap.

There are convex planers that are really helpful with this. I also recommend buying a set of good scrapers with all different shapes. A good tool for beginners is a small palm sander with a heavy grit or another powertool with a sanding disc.

Luthier,3e3hck,Bhoffman330,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"Quarter-sawn is useful for necks, but doesn't really add anything to a body. In fact, with ash it may make the grain less interesting, although that only matters if you're doing a transparent finish. I'm not aware of any manufacturer (at any price point) that specs quarter-sawn for their body wood.  Flat-sawn will give you the most interesting grain, which is what I'd shoot for with something like ash (mmm, Mary Kaye blonde...) Pretty much every guitar manufacturer uses flat-sawn for bodies.  Whether you do a 1-piece or 2-piece body is up to you. I personally feel that 2-piece bodies are less prone to cupping over the years, and most bodies are 2-piece. Some people insist on 1-piece bodies, but that's a personal choice and up to you. Given the choice, i'd always go for a 2-piece center-seamed body, but that's just me. FWIW, Fender almost never uses 1-piece bodies, and the few times you'll find them are typically only on very expensive Custom Shop models where it was specified by the customer or specifically chosen by the builder for looks.  /u/MojoMonster brings up a very important point: above anything else, you need to make sure the wood is properly dried. This means that you're most likely going to need to sticker and stack the wood for a couple-few years to dry on its own, or find some place to kiln-dry it for you. Guitar builders typically go for a moisture content in the 5% range. You can buy a moisture meter to check the wood yourself, but you might be able to take some to a place like Woodcraft or something and see if they can check the moisture content for you (or try to find a woodworker locally that'll do it.) Either way, you can't just cut down a tree and make a guitar out of it right away: the wood needs to be seasoned properly and unless you're ridiculously lucky, it's not going to be ready right away."
Luthier,3e3hck,catdumpling,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"Quarter sawn.  Multi-piece would make for less propensity to warp.  Regardless of what you choose, just make sure the wood is properly dried.  Good luck!"
Luthier,3e3hck,MojoMonster,0,Tue Jul 21 18:04:44 2015 UTC,"Q-sawn is completely unnecessary for a body, and I'm not aware of a single guitar builder that specifies it for anything other than necks (where it does provide slightly more rigidity, although it can still warp or twist if it really wants to.)"
Luthier,3e3hck,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"Flat sawn if you're doing a single piece guitar. For separate parts, flat sawn for the body and quarter sawn for the neck. If you're doing multiple piece lamination, try to book match the body parts, and opposite match (if that's a word) the neck part, in a way that if a piece warp, another symetrical one will warp in the exact opposite manner, as to cancel movement at all."
Luthier,3e3hck,Broukedou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:19 2015 UTC,Rift or quartered is best. Flat sawn will warp and check bad while curing. You have to dry it for like five years though and only use stable segments of wood. You should use a real big piece and plan to eliminate a lot of checked material.

Luthier,3e1268,_Doc_in_a_Box,3,Tue Jul 21 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"Be prepared to do a fair bit of fix-up work: GFS kits (and bodies/necks) are notorious for having holes drilled in the wrong spot, slightly crooked routes, etc. Not all of them, of course, but don't expect it to be nearly as precise as something from Warmoth, USACG, Allparts, Precision, etc.  As for paint, I would caution against enamels. They take a long time to dry and also don't play nice with other types of paint, so no mixing-and-matching. Duplicolor PerfectMatch spray cans are great for color (it's acrylic lacquer), and Minwax or Watco clear lacquer is good for clearcoats. For some reason the Duplicolor clear lacquer kind of sucks and stays sticky for ages, but the colors are popular for guitar painting; ergo, most people go Duplicolor for colors, and Minwax or Watco for clear. Duplicolor is available at pretty much any auto parts store, and Minwax and/or Watco spray lacquer is available at hardware stores like Lowe's and Home Depot.  For primer, you can use the Duplicolor Primer Filler, or Zinsser BIN Primer (again, auto parts store and hardware store, respectively.) Both work fine, but I personally prefer the Zinsser BIN because it's shellac-based and works with virtually any paint you'd want to use; good stuff and it's only about $7 a can at HD. FWIW, it's also the primer ReRanch suggests for use under their nitro paints.  Sandpaper: for sanding the body and neck before any primer and paint goes on, I'd suggest starting with 100, 120 (or 150), 220 and you should be ready for primer after that. You'll need to sand your first primer coat, 300 or 320 is good for that (or 220 if it needs a little more work.) You might need to lightly sand your second primer coat, but the key is to get the primer as flat as possible, which will make the actual paint look a lot nicer. The better job you do of pre-paint prep work, the nicer the paint job will come out.  Lacquer doesn't require sanding between coats, so once you start applying paint you shouldn't need to sand again until your final clearcoat is fully dried. For final sanding/polishing, start with 800, then 1000, 1200 (or 1500) and then you can go to polishing and buffing compounds. Alternately, you can go through every grit of MicroMesh paper (1000-12,000) and skip the polishing/buffing compound. MicroMesh is expensive (about $25 for a complete assortment), but you can reuse it for years if you wash it after you're done with your current project.

When the nut isn't glued down it can cause the nut to move during bends due to the difference in string tension between the strings.

Luthier,3e0i0f,forthefunofitall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"I bet that's wood filler lifting off.  Take it down to bare wood, and use a cabinet scraper to clean up the body.  Refill the pits and finish again."
Luthier,3e0i0f,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"It may be a veneer over the actual body wood. Squiers (and a lot of Fenders, for that matter) use a birch or maple veneer over the actual body wood: this way they can use slightly ""unpleasing"" body wood with transparent or sunburst finishes and still have it look good. Heat guns can definitely cause the veneer to lift, and sometimes it's just kind of a crapshoot as to whether or not it'll happen, no matter how careful you are.  I hate to say it, but to fix the problem both of your options require stripping the finish off. Option 1 would be to get a syringe filled with wood glue, poke a hole in the bubble, and inject glue into it (then use something to weight it down flat til the glue dries.) The problem with this is that you might end up with lumps after it dries, depending on how much glue you injected under the veneer.  Option 2: remove the veneers entirely. You'll need the heat gun and a thin metal spatula (or 1"" chisel, with the small bevel down). Heat up the veneer until it just starts to lift, then get the spatula/putty knife/whatever underneath it and peel it off the body. Once the glue is softened, you can kind of ""unzip"" large strips of the veneer off the body, and it actually doesn't take that much time or work. The key is to keep the heat gun moving, but make sure you're softening the veneer glue; in this case, you don't have to worry too much about scorching the wood, because it'll mostly be in the veneer that's coming off anyway. You will probably need to clean some veneer glue off of the body afterwards, but it should be minimal if you scrape it off while it's warm.  Once you have the veneer removed and the body sanded flat again, I'd suggest either putting on a coat of dewaxed shellac or using Zinsser BIN shellac-based primer: shellac is an awesome barrier coat, and will prevent your new paint from having issues with any veneer glue residue that might be left over. Both of these are available at most any hardware store, but if you get plain shellac make sure it says ""de-waxed"", otherwise your new paint may not stick to it properly. Zinsser BIN primer solves that problem, plus primes the body in the process, so you might just want to give that a go.  If you happen to get any nicks or gouges in the body from removing the veneer, you can actually fill them with Bondo (just use the 2-part stuff, not the 1-part ""glazing putty"" or whatever it's called.)  Unfortunately with a lifting veneer, there isn't really any easier options. You can just try to live with it, but I can almost guarantee that the paint will end up flaking off those spots sooner rather than later, so you may just want to suck it up and refinish it now instead of waiting to see what happens.  If it makes you feel any better, I stripped an MIM Strat body last week and ended up having to take the veneers off. I was trying to preserve them just to make repainting easier, but I managed to rip a big piece off the front and loosen some of it around the edges, so it all came off. I didn't have much better luck with the back, so it came off too. Sometimes the paint comes off nice and the veneers stay intact, and sometimes you just get the shit end of the stick and the veneers don't make it. It's not the end of the world, it's just extra work. My mistake was experimenting with Aircraft Remover (should've just stuck with a heat gun), and I think it soaked up under the veneer and ate up the glue. I have to admit though, getting a chisel in just the right spot and ""unzipping"" large strips of veneer was pretty satisfying in a ""popping bubble wrap"" kind of way ;) ."

This only works if your neck pocket is really tight, you can't use glue squeeze out to fill the gap after you spray the body without it looking bad."

Luthier,3dw6ec,Moushy777,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"Does it have a third pickup on the bridge plate like a Tele does?  If YES, look for the 1963 Bass VI wiring - three pickups, three switches, volume, tone, exactly as you can wire it.  If NO, look for the 1964 Bass VI wiring - three pickups, four switches, volume, tone - you can just ignore one of the pickup switches and that's it. You get the added bonus of a bass cut switch, which acts as the opposite of the normal tone control."

Luthier,3dupa2,subutai09,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Ah ok well you've got tons of options.  I'd say you need to decide your big picture first.  I could recommend you a Warmoth neck, or something like Musikraft or USACG, but you'd spend more for one of those than you did on the Squier itself.  That said, it would greatly increase the quality of the guitar (in my opinion).  If you then decided to upgrade the pickups / electronics, now you're looking at something that could quite possibly rival MiM or even American Standard Fenders.  Some people would argue it's silly to spend that much on a Squier, but I think it's perfect.  I am also of the belief that bodies don't make too much of a difference in terms of quality or ""tone wood"".  Especially coming from a Fender factory such as the MIC Squiers, the build quality will be fine.  When you start getting into 3rd party (cheaper) bodies, you'll notice the fit isn't as good, not everything lines up, and the finish might have issues.  That's all I've noticed, but the Squier bodies are great.    So, you've got a platform for a really decent guitar here.  Or, you can get a $100 replacement neck off Ebay or something and it probably won't increase the quality or playability of the guitar too much.    What are your thoughts?"
Luthier,3dupa2,keveready,2,Sun Jul 19 19:43:06 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/cWZKJHo  These are my plans. I'm going to ad to it as the $ comes by. Being a poor teenager doesn't help haha. I'm going to learn how to solder everything in as well as learn how to set up the tremolo I put in.
Luthier,3dupa2,catdumpling,3,Sun Jul 19 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"If I were in your shoes I would try to find the pickups used on eBay.  You can find them for half as much as new. You might even be able to find a good deal on a pre wired pickguard with pickups. If you are changing the pickguard you have the option to try HH or SSH.  Screw holes might not line up perfectly going from fender pickguard to squier. Save money on the straplocks by using hardware store washers or rubber grolsh washers. Definitely go for the best neck and tuners you can afford. Totally worth it in the long run. Personally I would just block the bridge you have, and that's fine if you're not a dive bomber. Or upgrade the bridge later. Getting a well made nut of bone, graphite or tusq will help keep the guitar in tune, so don't skimp on that.  Edit: dont forget to save money for a tube amp as soon as possible."
Luthier,3dupa2,catdumpling,4,Sun Jul 19 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/subutai09. Look for a loaded  / prewired guard. EBay has tons and GuitarFetish.com comes highly recommended. He's right about the holes lining up too. Worse comes to worst, Google about filling the holes with toothpicks and redrill. I really like Kluson nickel tuners. Don't settle for the cheap chrome. Also recommend against a cheap neck. Save money elsewhere and get a good neck. AllParts and MightyMite are good middle of the line if you don't wanna spend 250+. You can also find tons of necks on EBay like the Stratosphere, MiM necks galore."
Luthier,3dupa2,thepensivepoet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"Any Fender-spec neck should fit. Squiers use the same neck pocket specs that regular Fenders do, and a replacement neck should drop in with little or no problem."

Luthier,3dupa2,thepensivepoet,2,Sun Jul 19 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant any replacement Fender-spec neck, not just another Squier neck. If you want to go custom, USACG makes some of the best stuff, followed by Warmoth. It's not cheap though, and you're not going to get anything custom in the $100 range; for that, you're looking at a take-off Squier neck, a MightyMite or (if you're willing to spend about $30 more), an Allparts (which are fantastic and made in Japan, although their choices are fairly limited.)"
Luthier,3dupa2,MattieTheSpud,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:18 2015 UTC,Don't skimp on the neck.  It's the part of the guitar you're actually holding and while it isn't as flashy as the body or headstock shape is much more important than I think is obvious at first glance.
Luthier,3dupa2,thepensivepoet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah the stock one is pretty crappy. I could get the frets dressed and stuff, but I want to make this a guitar I actually play. Like my les Paul. Damn that thing is awesome. This was my first guitar so modding it won't hurt me."
Luthier,3dupa2,thepensivepoet,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:27 2015 UTC,Instead of paying for a fret level/dressing you could spend about as much money on the tools and teach yourself how to do it and then it costs $0 for the rest of your life.

Luthier,3dndx2,gashhill,2,Fri Jul 17 21:24:25 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be a problem - however I would do a test with a spare bit of decal material on an oiled bit of wood just to make sure!!
Luthier,3dndx2,catdumpling,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"Formby's Tung Oil Finish is more of a wiping varnish (it's not pure tung oil), similar to Tru Oil, so it should work fine. You'll want to make sure you've got a decent buildup though, as someone already mentioned, because waterslide decals don't go over raw wood very well. If it's a maple neck, it shouldn't take too many coats to seal up the wood enough to put on a decal.  You can use wipe-on finishes over waterslide decals, but you risk tearing it in the process. If you want to cover over the decal, I'd use a spray (either poly or lacquer.) Just make absolutely sure the Formby's has had plenty of time to fully dry before spraying a different type of finish over it; I'd give it a few weeks before you apply the decal and then spray something else over it. Most finish compatibility issues stem from not letting the previous finish fully dry or cure first.  If you're going to print your own waterslide decals, print up a few extras and do some tests on a scrap piece of maple (or whatever your neck is made from.) This way you can be sure you won't run into finish issues on the neck itself, which could be a major headache and require stripping the headstock and starting over."
Luthier,3dm5rq,Elliot850,2,Fri Jul 17 11:46:04 2015 UTC,"All HHH guitars I've seen have very little room left over. So pickups tend to be crammed in there and evenly spaced.   Many humbuckers come in ""Neck"" and ""Bridge"" configurations. Bridge pickups tend to be hotter than neck pickups. In an HHH setup I'd guess you want put the hottest in the bridge, the next hottest in the mid and the coolest in the neck.   What have you chosen for the pickups?"

Luthier,3dm5rq,BrightGuitars,2,Fri Jul 17 21:24:43 2015 UTC,"placement depends on scale length and number of frets.  i dont know too much as far as bass pups, but for example the infamous 24th fret on a guitar requires a scale of 25.5 and a 22 fret neck.  the 4th and 8th harmonic share a common node at the 24th fret.  wiring the north of 1 humbucker to the south of the other would change the sound just like using 2 single coils, but you may need to check where your overtones are"

Working on guitars is a hands-on endeavor, and there's no better way to learn that to put your hands on guitar parts.   Don't be afraid to make mistakes, because you will make them. Just keep in mind that most mistakes can be fixed, and your world isn't going to stop turning just because something went wrong.

Coffee, donuts, whiskey, Fabergé eggs... and bring that to him every few visits, just to show you appreciate him taking the time for you.  Be prepared for disappointment. Creating an instrument by hand takes a lot of time. There's a lot of room for human error.  Take slight single strokes at first. Whatever you're carving or cutting, make the same motion for the first 10 or so cuts. That gives you a sense of consistency.  Patience. This can't be stressed enough. You're going to want your build done. But you've still got months of work to be done (since you're using someone else's shop). Be prepared for this project not to come into fruition for months.

Generally, if you have a tight budget GFS makes good pickups that I believe are a great value for the money.  If you have a big budget Lollar pickups, Curtis Novak, and other boutique builders can make whatever you want.

Luthier,3dim02,ProgAlex,3,Thu Jul 16 15:54:25 2015 UTC,Place the neck into the pocket. While holding it still (or clamping it in) take your neck screw and push it through the holes and indent on the neck. Drill your holes ever so slight higher (towards the headstock) from the marks you just made. Make sure to rub some bar soap on those screws before screwing them in.
Luthier,3dim02,wdmcarth,3,Thu Jul 16 20:26:06 2015 UTC,What's that last step for?
Luthier,3dim02,joeribraams,10,Thu Jul 16 23:02:59 2015 UTC,Life lesson; never put it in dry.
Luthier,3dim02,braken,2,Thu Jul 16 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"Rock maple is hard to drive screws into, even with properly-sized holes. Rubbing the screw threads over a bar of soap, old candle or paste wax lubricates the screw so you don't A) break off the screw in the new hole, or B) crack the wood. Once the screw has been tightened and loosened a couple times it's fine, but that first time you drive a screw into a new hole needs some kind of lubrication.  A bar of soap (not liquid soap!), an old candle, a bar of paraffin canning wax from the grocery store, Johnson's Paste Wax, any of those work fine. Just rub the screw threads over it a few times and load them up with soap/wax. This is also really important if you're installing new tuners and drill holes for the little mounting screws; they're notorious for breaking off in the headstock if you don't wax the threads, and it's a pain to fix."
Luthier,3dim02,catdumpling,2,Fri Jul 17 06:33:31 2015 UTC,Ah thanks great tip!
Luthier,3dim02,joeribraams,2,Fri Jul 17 09:54:09 2015 UTC,"No problem. Also, for newly-drilled holes, it helps to drive the screw in about a third of the way, back it completely out, drive it in a little further, back it out again, and repeat a couple times until it's all the way in. Hard Maple is called that for a reason, and it pays to spend the extra minute drive a screw into a new hole properly, rather than forcing it and damaging something."
Luthier,3dim02,catdumpling,2,Fri Jul 17 12:36:55 2015 UTC,"I've found beeswax to be a lot cheaper than a lot of other waxes if you buy from a local beekeeper, as for soap, seems... Interesting."
Luthier,3dim02,MattieTheSpud,4,Fri Jul 17 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer first, I'm still very much a novice but here's how I've done it.  Make sure it fits into the neck pocket the way you want it to first. Then clamp the neck in place while still allowing you access to the screw holes in the body. Drill some pilot holes into the neck through the holes in the body. Try to stay as centered and straight as possible. Drill press would probably be best but I've done it with a hand drill. Then just screw the neck on like you would normally."
Luthier,3dim02,kryonickraken,12,Thu Jul 16 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"USE A DEPTH STOP. Last thing you want to do is drill THROUGH your neck, and if you wanna be super fancy you can drop in metal bushing and use machine screws so the holes never get stripped."
Luthier,3dim02,blacksun2012,9,Thu Jul 16 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely use some sort of depth stop. Forgot about that. I used a piece of masking tape wrapped around my drill bit at the correct depth. Thanks for adding that Blacksun"
Luthier,3dim02,kryonickraken,6,Thu Jul 16 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good way to go, but do remember to make sure that the neck lines up with the center line of the guitar after clamping.  Not all neck pockets are tight and you could accidentally drill the holes to where the neck is 1 or 2 degrees off to the left or right."
Luthier,3dim02,coffeefuelsme,2,Thu Jul 16 16:55:54 2015 UTC,I recently made an acoustic body for a bolt on neck.  I cut a square piece of paper and held it against the neck heel and poked the hole positions.  Then I held it against the body and drew the holes.  It was a success.

Luthier,3dhh4o,mogwi70,2,Thu Jul 16 08:44:10 2015 UTC,"A little bit of a bulge behind the bridge is normal and fine.  If the bulge gets pronounced enough that the saddle begins to lean towards the bridge, bulge looks uneven, or the bridge starts separating from the body then you have a serious problem.  A smooth even bulge is no big deal.  If your bridge plate is too far forward, then it sounds to me like your X brace is as well.  That's ok, Martin's ""forward shifted"" X bracing pattern does this on purpose, but they recommend only using light or medium gauge strings and to be sure to properly humidify your guitar.    I would try switching to a lighter gauge of strings to see if that brings your top problem down.  If that doesn't help you can install a JLD bridge doctor and cover up the installation bolt with a pearloid dot."
Luthier,3dhh4o,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this is an acoustic guitar. Secondly, I definitely suggest posting pictures.   I've seen plenty of older guitars with the same issue that seem to be alright. I think it comes with old age and variation in humidity throughout the life of the top.   Post some pictures so we can get an idea of what's going on."
Luthier,3dhh4o,TibbittsN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"Like ""coffeefuelsme"" said - a small bulge isn't a bad thing. In fact a well built steel string, which tows the line between structural integrity and delicateness, should bulge a little. It shows that the top isn't so thick and stiffly braced that it won't move. That said, it should be a relatively small bulge, and it should equalize - in other words it shouldn't grow and grow.  As for your bridge plate, as long as the strings' ball ends are on the plate and not the actual top, then your only real concern would be the bulge / top deformation, as explained above. If the ball ends are in direct contact with the top, that's a big problem because they will tear that spruce (or whatever it is) up pretty quickly."
Luthier,3dhh4o,BrightGuitars,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"imgur link  Little more info - this is an acoustic guitar build (and by that I mean its not old - I literally just built it) that's already running light strings.  Again, just worried that this is going to wreck the guitar one day, and wanted to get your thoughts on whether this is a sustainable amount of bulge, or if I need to pull it apart and add bracing/ reposition the bridge plate.  I took some shots of the interior of the guitar to show its position - no ball ends on the top wood, but they're definitely not centered.  Also took some with either side of the tone braces (honestly not sure what they're called - the asymmetric ones).  Took a shot just of the bridge - I can't see any twist or lift from the top, but if you guys do, please feel free to tell me.  Any thoughts or advice?"
Luthier,3dhh4o,BrightGuitars,2,Fri Jul 17 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"I would say that's an acceptable amount of bulge. Just keep your eye on it these first months, minding the temperature and humidity of the room it's in. And play it a lot!"
Luthier,3dhh4o,XxSCRAPOxX,0,Fri Jul 17 07:36:20 2015 UTC,Not enough bracing. Top too thin. Something like that. You could try adding a brace.
Luthier,3dgtdt,lotrdsff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that your wood had not acclimated to your local humidity before you cut and shaped it. Standard guidance is to let the wood sit for one year for every inch of thickness. If it's freshly milled it might have a significantly different moisture content than equilibrium with your environment.   You can fill the cracks with glue and sawdust, but the wood might continue moving on you. Do your best, chalk this up as a learning experience in your first build. We all have learning ""opportunities"" like this."

Luthier,3dgtdt,toysmith,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're a big deal. Fill them in with superglue and wood dust and sand flush. This will also seal the cracks and keep them from growing. If you use a rubbed on stain it wont soak into the superglue, but the area in question is so thin it wont be a problem. If you use a painted/sprayed on color it will cover the filled in cracks. Sometimes wood does this to us and personally I hate to scrap a nice piece of wood for something so minor as this.  For finish, Tru Oil is a good one - very easy to use and pretty but not a lot of protection. Waterbased polys are kind on the luthier and the shop but can be a real bear to buff out (you can buff through easily) and they dont repair well because new material doesn't melt into old. Plus a lot of them have a milky bluish hue to them. Wipe On Poly is a nice option because it's super easy to apply with a rag or brush and it buffs out well, with the finished product looking not unlike tru oil actually, and being a poly it offers good protection. You can get a good result with just about any product as long as you take your time and prep your wood well."
Luthier,3dgtdt,BrightGuitars,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"As for a splitting risk, I'd say it's relatively low. They are perpendicular to the grain which is where most woods generally split. If you are concerned consider purchasing some thin CA clue and getting it into those cracks. CA glue should stop them from getting worse.   I've had plenty of run ins with cracks like that and haven't had any long term problems with them. Just keep an eye on them. Since it's on the body where there won't be many forces, other than the strap, I'd say they will be okay.   Unfortunately I've never worked with stains. I always go with a clear finish.   I'm a big fan of water based finishes. Solvent based finishes have no place in my shop since I don't have any ventilation. I've had good experience with Polycrylic and Tru-oil (oil based). Tru-oil is a rather easy application and builds to a very nice shine. In my experience tru-oil really makes wood grain pop."

Luthier,3dfy8f,AntiFIanders,2,Wed Jul 15 23:37:00 2015 UTC,If it's already routed for the 2 point trem then you will not be able to just screw on a fixed bridge.  Not sure exactly what state the guitar is in without picture.  If the 2 holes are there for the trem then you can simply plug those with dowels and add a vintage trem and block it without issue.  A picture or two would certainly help us help you.  edit: if you have the pole pieces installed then beware they may infringe on screw placement and are a very difficult thing to remove.
Luthier,3dfy8f,moosaid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"It will be easier to put a block of hard wood behind the sustain block and put 5 springs to the claw, but if you do want to go the hardtail route, then you will need to find a way to fill up at least the cavity where the sustain block would normally be. This will take some intricate work to get a nice fit, but it is by no means impossible. If you don't have the tools or requisite skill for the latter, then just go the block route. The difference in tone or stability will be negligible."
Luthier,3dfy8f,masters_xx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:26:20 2015 UTC,You can fill the 2 post holes and install 6 point bridge or drill 4 hole and use 2 post as outer screws.   I recommend to fill the hole and install 6 screw trem normally though.
Luthier,3dfy8f,catdumpling,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"I would drill out the two pivot posts to the next largest dowel size, plug with maple dowel (or another suitable hardwood), trim them up and sand flush, then redrill for the new 6-screw trem. I'd avoid getting dowels from the hardware store because they're usually just called ""hardwood"", which could be anything from aspen (super soft) to oak (hard, although porous and tends to split.) The ones I've gotten recently from Home Depot have been poplar, which is workable, but I still prefer something harder so you don't have to worry about it in the future.  Woodcraft and Rockler both sell maple dowels for a couple dollars each (plus shipping), although if you have a Woodcraft locally that's even better. Maple dowel comes in handy for all sorts of guitar repairs, so it's worth getting a couple in different diameters and saving them for future use (plugging neck holes, plugging strap button holes, that kind of thing.)  Your 2-post trem stud holes are probably either 9mm or 10mm in diameter, so I'd drill them out to either 7/16"" or 1/2"", whichever you can find a dowel for. 1/2"" should still be small enough to not have to worry about blowing out into the trem or pickup cavities, but measure the space just to be sure. I'd suggest using a brad-point bit to drill out those holes, because it leaves a nice flat-bottomed hole, but it's not 100% necessary. Also (and this is very important!), make absolutely sure you mark the depth of the stud holes and don't drill any deeper than that!!! Otherwise you'll blow out into the spring cavity, which isn't the end of the world but will require more touchup and repair work. That also goes for drilling the 6-screw holes too. But, if it happens, take a deep breath and don't freak out too much; it can be fixed and it's not the end of the world. It's just better to avoid it in the first place!  Once you glue the dowels in place (regular Titebond I or other yellow wood glue is fine, don't use epoxy or anything weird), trim them flush. You'll probably end up scuffing up the surrounding paint when you sand them flush, but nitro finishes are dead-easy to touch up. If you need to touch up the paint, drill your 6-point screw holes first, and leave the paint for last. After that, it's just a matter of applying a light mist of primer (or even shellac), a couple/few coats of whatever color your body is, and let it dry for a couple days at least. You can polish it out after that if you want, but remember that most of that area will be covered by a pickguard and trem anyway, so you don't need to go nuts with it if you don't want to.  If you let us know what color the body is, I can point you to a few sources for some appropriate touchup paint."

Luthier,3degxa,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:21:59 2015 UTC,That makes good sense.  I'm assuming the top is separated but I've yet to pop the neck off.  I've got few pieces in line ahead of it and wanted to start getting ideas.
Luthier,3degxa,TibbittsN,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:36:50 2015 UTC,How sure are you that the guitar isn't actually made like this? 355s have the neck pickup angled away from the body.

When you pair two materials together, especially with different grain orientation, the expansion and contraction of those materials will be different. There aren't any gaps between the top and the binding so it looks like they are still glued. Just looks like those pieces underneath the finish expanded at a different rate and the finish wasn't having it.  I'd say keep an eye on it and watch for separations. Otherwise it's just a crack in the finish and isn't a whole lot to worry about."

Luthier,3da5af,weencity,3,Tue Jul 14 22:56:21 2015 UTC,Nice.. I usually do the picguard first.. put it in place to get the location of the neck pickup.. cut out the hole in the pickguard for the neck pickup and trace that to the body.. then route out the body large enough to fit the pickup. Makes for a tighter cleaner hole in the pickguard..   What were  you using to cut the PG? Jig saw or scroll saw?
Luthier,3da5af,sambooka,2,Tue Jul 14 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"It was a jigsaw.   My reasoning for routing the holes in the body before the pickgaurd was that it had existing holes. Your method sounds way better though. If you were to have done it, how would you know where to position the pickup holes on the pickgaurd without a template? I'm probably going to make more pickgaurds in the future."
Luthier,3da5af,sambooka,4,Tue Jul 14 19:17:28 2015 UTC,I have a routing table that helps although if you have a router you can  make something passable out of good quality plywood.  If you make a routing table get a router bit with a collar (I have a few but I think the one I use the most was 10$ on amazon). I use a jigsaw to rough out the original as much as possible (not more than 1/4 in larger than the orginal ) and tape the original to it with two sided tape. Then user the collared router bit to make a copy of the original and mount it to the body (with the neck attached).  Next put some masking tape on your new pick guard (which is mounted) I use the neck and bridge location to find the center line. On the center line mark the 24th fret and draw across perpendicular. Should have a cross now.. that is the center of the neckward bobbin.  After that you can put on a HB template (which you can make with your new routing table) and route out the pick guard.  EDIT: This is far more complicated than my routing table but you get the idea.. a box with a top that is smooth and strong enough to support the weight of the router without sagging. It also has to be thick enough to handle the screws to bolt it the router to the top. .. I just have a smaller access hole on the one I made.
Luthier,3da5af,sambooka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:37 2015 UTC,That sounds pretty cool. Any tips on finding the center line?
Luthier,3da5af,goinkmygoygle,3,Tue Jul 14 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"if you know where the bridge is supposed to be (example your tele) then it is pretty easy. measure the width at the nut.. divide by two and mark that point. Measure the width at the butt end, divide by two and mark that.  Look at the bridge if it is still on and with a string (I have a hard time with a long straight-edge) you should be able to line up those 3 points. If your butt mark is not in line with the bridge and nut center points then your neck needs to be shifted in the pocket  https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=164&v=gXya9Z-2H4o"

Luthier,3d94wg,Mrjapedo,8,Tue Jul 14 13:50:51 2015 UTC,"This is a common problem with Taylor's, I encounter it a few times a year with my customers. It is caused, like many problems with acoustics, by lack of humidity. The official repair that taylor requires for this is to pack the crack with fine Ebony dust and saturate it with water-thin CA. It is unlikely that this crack is all the way through the bridge, but it can usually be seen by anyone with a good eye if it is. The best way to tell is to look at the rear of the bridge to see if there is a separation from the top. You can use a very thin feeler gauge or a thin piece of paper to try and slide under it. If there is separation, the bridge will need to be removed and reglue  anyways, providing a chance to look at the bottom side of the bridge to see if the crack goes all the way through. (Regardless, if there is a crack and the bridge needs to be reglued, I just replace it.)   If there is not separation at the rear of the bridge, and the top is not noticeable mis-shaped, then just use Ebony dust and water-thin CA. The likelyhood that the bridge plate is compromised is slim, and can easily be evaluated by inspecting the top for odd shapes, or looking directly at the bridge plate with a mirror.  This is a common problem with Taylor's because of the way they make their bridges, the grain orientation they use, and the lack of humidity that can be encountered in many places throughout the U.S."
Luthier,3d94wg,Musicalmoses,4,Tue Jul 14 15:38:46 2015 UTC,What does Taylor do technically in terms of grain orientation and build process? Is the blank flat sawn or quarter sawn? Is there a design flaw in the geometry?
Luthier,3d94wg,toysmith,2,Tue Jul 14 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'd guess and say it was quartersawn. I would guess it's a flaw in using ebony. Ebony is a very hard and dense wood. With that in mind it's not the greatest at 'giving'. A species I'm more familiar with is bloodwood which shares the same qualities. I've had thin 3/8"" pieces of bloodwood that were quartersawn split right in half after dropping them from the bench top.   The best adjective I'd pick would be brittle. Flat sawn might help a little bit. I've seen flat sawn pieces of ebony cup though so instead of a split you might end up with separation from the top and you'd end up having to replace the bridge all together."
Luthier,3d94wg,TibbittsN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:43 2015 UTC,This is a great description of the correct repair. I often like to keep the original since it is such a simple fix. It tends to be stronger repaired anyway.   Great description.   Edit: grammar

Luthier,3d94wg,wiredconcepts,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. It will keep getting worse.   You do not need a new bridge, you need this one removed and repaired. It's a pretty minor job to fix a stress crack like this one."
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,2,Tue Jul 14 14:15:44 2015 UTC,That crack is through and goes past the pins.  He needs a new bridge.
Luthier,3d94wg,Username_Used,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"It can definitely be fixed. Although a new bridge would be much better.  You could resurface both exposed parts of the crack, then glue with epoxy. But i would suggest getting a new bridge built out of rosewood instead of ebony.  Edit: You have to resurface the crack surfaces then glue in an identical shim."
Luthier,3d94wg,JuntaEx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:43 2015 UTC,I find that CA and hide glue sand much better and don't show up. Every type of epoxy I've used seems to be a bit waxy and I'm not happy with the results.  What brand are you using? The type I hate the least is the stew Mac.  I only really use it when I need to gap fill something.
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"We were taught that the only reliable way to glue ebony was with epoxy, since the oily nature of the wood makes other glue types react negatively. My understanding is that oily woods in general require epoxy for assembly.   We were taught to use West System epoxy. http://www.westsystem.com/ss/207-special-clear-hardener  This system never showed up on sanding (mind you i only use them for gluing the fretboard to the neck, and the bridge to the soundboard), and also can be used as pore-filler pre-finish."
Luthier,3d94wg,JuntaEx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:50 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I'm guessing you also do more building than repairing. So usually they are cured out a bit more by the time I see them.   I typically work mostly with rosewood since it's so much more prevalent. But CA has never let me down. :)
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, these days i'm doing mostly setups and minor repairs, but lutherie school here in Montreal is pretty exhaustive and comprehensive. I built a classical and an acoustic guitar. I definitely recommend it!  I will be working in my buddy's shop starting in September, where we will most likely fulfill acoustic and electric guitar orders. I can't wait!  Shameless publicity: http://www.guitaresbrousseau.com/ (Site is in French though)"
Luthier,3d94wg,JuntaEx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:00 2015 UTC,Cool!  I haven't gave epoxy a fair shot in years. I'll check that stuff out. Hide glue and CA have always served all my needs. Sometimes a bit of tightbond. I try to stick to hide glue when it makes sense.  I only ask because it seems like builders love epoxy the most. Haha.
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"When using epoxy make sure you get the catalyst to resin ratio just right. Always glue a test piece alongside your principal assembly with the same batch, this is a good indicator of poor mix or insufficient drying as it is easy to flex and pull on the joint. If it's anything but rock hard, no good.  Hide glue and cyanoacrylate are great but every glue used in lutherie has a specific purpose.   -Hide glue is used in traditional assembly since it all began, and is great for making joints that can be heated up and separated if need be.   -Cyanoacrylate is great for minor fixes, fills, it's transparent, strong and very useful but the quick drying action and superfluidity make it inadequate for major pressure points.  -Epoxy is amazing, bonds to any wood type, has the strongest resistance of any other glue. It takes a bit of know-how and experience however to get the mix right but when you do nothing comes close. However contrary to wood glue it doesn't it doesn't ''dry'' and retract, instead the chemical reaction occurs and hardens the mixture.  Do you build guitars?"
Luthier,3d94wg,JuntaEx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"Nah. No money in it. Haha. I've been repairing full time since 97.  I'm happy to fix all the problems with every other build. Haha.  I keep epoxy around but I rarely use it unless something else won't do the job. I'm sure if I got into it, it would be great.   I am always happy with bridges done in hide. I was taught in hide glue so once you get the tricks down, the gram strength is great. It is incredible when you get it right."
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:56 2015 UTC,How long have you been fixing?
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"Finished school in '10, been doing setup and repair work since then among much other work but i'm taking it more seriously now."
Luthier,3d94wg,JuntaEx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"A little CA and some dust and it's fine. I have fixed hundreds of these. There will be no evidence of the repair.   While I don't watch videos of people splitting rocks, I have fixed guitars everyday for nearly 20 years."
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"If it were a surface crack I would agree, but it's basically split into two pieces.  He needs a new bridge."
Luthier,3d94wg,Username_Used,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"I still disagree. Not anything wrong with this. Even broken in half, it's still the perfect replacement part right there. It just needs a talented touch and it will be strong and look like nothing ever happened."
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,2,Tue Jul 14 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"If the crack is coming from the saddle slot, I always make a new bridge. But bridge pin hole cracks like this are very simple to fix with CA, like everyone else has said. I just sand the top of the bridge a bit, in order to pack the crack full of dust, and wick glue down in there. Then, more sanding, and you're done."
Luthier,3d94wg,WillyTheDisk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:42 2015 UTC,"The guitar I began on had the bridge split completely in half there, and it took some wood from the top with it as the piece under the saddle let go and flew forward.  Sadness."
Luthier,3d94wg,xtemplarx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:29 2015 UTC,If you're a relatively competent woodworker you could look up a tutorial or take it to a trusted repair-er and have it done professionally.
Luthier,3d94wg,MattieTheSpud,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'll add that it isn't uncommon, what might have happened is you've got 6 in line holes with pressure from the strings pulling across the grain, creating a weak situation.  This is why some companies put their bridge pins in a staggered or semi circle configuration.  That way the pull is divided up.  Have it checked out, see if the actual bridge is loose and pulling away from the top.  Definitely check the bridge plate underneath.  If both of those things are fine, the crack can be filled and it will be good as new as long as the crack doesn't run through the whole bridge.  If it does, you might as well replace it since you'll be having it removed."
Luthier,3d94wg,pssychesun,2,Tue Jul 14 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're going to need a new bridge.  Don't push the pins in so hard."
Luthier,3d94wg,Username_Used,3,Tue Jul 14 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"Unless you are the hulk, this had nothing to do with pins. My guess is the glue loosened under the bridge a touch. Or the guitar started to belly slightly and the pressure gave there."
Luthier,3d94wg,theflyingb,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:25:20 2015 UTC,Of course it has to do with the pins.  You ever see them split rock with tiny wedges?
Luthier,3d94wg,Username_Used,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:44 2015 UTC,the rocks didnt have holes cut into them though
Luthier,3d94wg,SkaJamas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:59:05 2015 UTC,Yes they did.  That's how they get large rocks out of quarries.  Drill small holes and pound wedges into it.  Same principle as bridge pins.
Luthier,3d94wg,Username_Used,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:40 2015 UTC,tiny ones in comparison to the wedge. the bridge pins are fitted
Luthier,3d94wg,SkaJamas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"That crack is usually indicative of a failed bridge plate.  The bridge repair is relatively simple, but the underlying bridge plate problem can cause bad damage to the top and cause the bridge to crack again in the future."
Luthier,3d94wg,coffeefuelsme,0,Tue Jul 14 15:03:30 2015 UTC,Or shoving in the pins waaaaaay too hard.
Luthier,3dbnbl,person9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"Here's a photo jounral of how this guy fixes top or back plate seperations:  http://www.frensterguitars.com/peck_martin.shtml  You'll probably need 3 small bar clamps, and some titebond to fix something as small as a Uke.  I like to use wax paper between the clamps and wood during glue ups, it keeps the glue from sticking to your clamps, which can cause finish damage.    For that loose brace, stewmac sells a hand little tool that you can use to hold it in place when you glue it back:  http://www.stewmac.com/Luthier_Tools/Types_of_Tools/Clamps/Brace_Repair_Jack.html"
Luthier,3dbnbl,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:30 2015 UTC,Thanks!  That'll help a lot with the top seperation although I don't think it's bad enough to need a shim glued in.  I think glue and a clamp will do fine as it's only about an inch wide and barely visible.    Those jacks seem handy!  However that $20 shipping on a $10 item hurts!  Might see if there is a local seller that has something similar or if something can be made for around $10.  If not I'll bite the bullet or pick up some other supplies too.
Luthier,3dbnbl,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"One other idea is to take a thin and flexible piece of wood or a fiberglass rod about as long as the body is deep.  Put a piece of cork on one end, put it inside the body, and bend it so that the uncorked end is pressed up against the brace while the corked end is resting on the back.  The bent bar will hold the brace down while the glue is drying.  It's the same principle as a go-bar deck here:  http://www.stewmac.com/tradesecrets/newsletter/ts0044/ts0044gobars.gif  You can buy fiberglass rods or other things like it at a hobby parts store."
Luthier,3dbkmc,iinverno,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what that guy is talking about. The RG8 comes with humbuckers, not soap bars.  They should fit just fine."
Luthier,3dbkmc,GALACTICA-Actual,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:54:13 2015 UTC,Apparently it's because the guitar is routed for humbuckers with a soap bar style cover as opposed to an open set?
Luthier,3dbkmc,GALACTICA-Actual,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:13:45 2015 UTC,Can you post a pic of your guitar?
Luthier,3dbkmc,GALACTICA-Actual,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:42:18 2015 UTC,Sure thing: http://i.imgur.com/Ysjl3Dh.jpg    Here are the pickups I have ordered for your reference: https://bareknucklepickups.co.uk/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_127_219&products_id=543    edit: excuse the dust.
Luthier,3dbkmc,WillyTheDisk,0,Wed Jul 15 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand what he's talking about now.  That cover may pop off the pickup. If so, it may fit over the new pickups, and you can put them in. If not, email Bareknuckle and tell them the problem. They may have a solution. There are solutions to this, and none of it is major. They may or may not be ones you can do yourself, but worse case is that you have to take it to a shop.  The only way the new pickups don't work is if their size/measurements are different."
Luthier,3dbkmc,GALACTICA-Actual,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"Those covers won't come off. I usually glue wooden inserts into the pickup cavities, and then I'll mount the new pickups using trim rings. Or just flush mount, and deal with the unsightly gap."
Luthier,3dbkmc,WillyTheDisk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"That answers that then.  Hard mount it is, would be my bet."
Luthier,3dbkmc,juicymooseshoes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:13:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the dude doing the work said he didn't want to hard mount with a gap as it reflects poorly on his work etc.    I've emailed Bareknuckle to see if they can provide any advise. Unfortunately they don't sell pickup rings for an 8 string so I'm hoping they can at least point me in the right direction."
Luthier,3d96rf,Alizkat,3,Tue Jul 14 14:06:25 2015 UTC,"Pick up a copy of ""Build your own acoustic guitar"" by Jonathan Kinkead and give it a read.  It's very accessible and gives you a very clear picture of how to build an acoustic guitar and what tools you will need.  If you have the proper tools (bandsaw, router, side bending iron, etc.) or have the ability to build them, the LMII kits are a great value and allow you to customize your wood choices.  If you want the sides pre-bent and some parts done for you the Martin or Stewmac kits are great."
Luthier,3d96rf,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. I think you're right. I just need to slow down, and do some research."

Laminated sides? Solid Wood? Fiberglass? Thin? Thick? Steel or Nylon? 3 string strum stick?   In general, Youtube is a phenomenal place to find information and diy guitar projects."
Luthier,3d96rf,mogwi70,2,Tue Jul 14 21:09:00 2015 UTC,"I quite like the look of the Dreadnought body, on a steel string, all wood.  I have a romantic idea milling my own wood from drift wood. I am not sure how it would sound, but I don't know....it's an idea.  I think I might take a look at getting:  ""Build your own acoustic guitar"" by Jonathan Kinkead  like coffeefuelsme suggested. Thanks for the ideas."
Luthier,3d96rf,brandyrambler,2,Thu Jul 16 05:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'd echo the Kinkead book as a great place to start.  Since it's your first guitar, I'd also recommend avoiding a couple complications that really led to a lot of frustration for me personally.    Don't mess with the neck angle - shoot for a straight 90 degrees.  I kept hearing that the ideal neck angle was 89.5 degrees, and trying to hit that caused a lot of problems for me personally, but I hadn't done any woodworking before.  If you're going steel-string, which is what the Kinkead book is an instruction manual for, I'd also recommend going with a simple bolt and tenon neck joint, rather than a dovetail.  I'd also recommend not buying wood from LMI.  They're going to sell you nice wood, but at a premium, and for your first, just go down to the lumber yard and try to find a wide 5' long board of mahogany (this is assuming you've got a good quality bandsaw with a 6"" riser block).  With a 4 quarter board you can do a a stacked neck, and you'll probably have enough material for a couple back and side sets.  That'll leave top wood and and a fretboard, both of which I'd buy from a luthiery supplier.  Stewmac and LMI are great, but I tend to buy my wood from allenguitar.com.  He's got great quality, totally reasonable pricing, and good customer service.  Other than that man, just don't be afraid of it.  I'd never touched a table saw before I started working on my first guitar.  Building one is a totally achievable goal."

Luthier,3d75vc,blofly,5,Tue Jul 14 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"Looks easy enough to build, just cut a nut with a lower ledge, then cut a slot into the ledge.  Save $30."
Luthier,3d75vc,CamQTR,3,Tue Jul 14 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"Im not sure about guitars, but with violin family instruments less contact at the nut causes strings to fray and eventually break.  We put quite a bit of effort into matching the string groove radius with the radius of the bend that the string makes toward the tuners/pegs.  The small contact area with the string as it is tuned up or down puts a lot of stress on the string winding.  Just my 2 cents."
Luthier,3d75vc,Vonmule,3,Tue Jul 14 01:45:06 2015 UTC,"With nickle, steel, and bronze strings I think this is less of an issue. Lately I've been warming up to the idea of a 0fret and this looks like a solid implantation of it. But I have 0 glide expirence with them"
Luthier,3d75vc,blacksun2012,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Nickle, steel and bronze as opposed to what (violin family is my expertise, not guitars)?  I use a $200 tungsten wound C-string on my cello, and it will start to go if the nut isn't shaped properly."
Luthier,3d75vc,Vonmule,2,Tue Jul 14 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"What I guess I mean is that guitar strings are pretty robust in general, they take quite a bit if abuse and don't really fray, they just kind of snap, and at ~6 bucks a set when they GI its a cheap replacement"
Luthier,3d75vc,blacksun2012,3,Tue Jul 14 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"I've seen zero fret guitars that don't use a nut at all. Just a larger fret than what's being used on the rest of the fret board. Jumbo fret. Plus string trees to hold down the strings (or whatever they're called).  I don't see a need for the nut here, unless you're replacing an existing nut."
Luthier,3d75vc,captshady,3,Tue Jul 14 02:40:20 2015 UTC,Zero frets use something to dictate spacing. It has to have it or they slide around. More than a string tree.   There have been a few of these over the years. I'm not sure they beat a regular bone nut but it's something for people to tinker with.   I got sent a handful of these as a sample years ago from someone wanting me to be an installer for them. They didn't interest me much.
Luthier,3d75vc,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"I've seen it done with screws, to prevent them from sliding around.  I've seen pieces of slotted hardwood, and whatever those little metal pieces are to guide strings on Fenders."
Luthier,3d75vc,captshady,3,Tue Jul 14 19:40:45 2015 UTC,Weird with the screws. The slotted hardwood seems more like a nut. Ha. Just as long as the spacing is locked by something.
Luthier,3d75vc,theflyingb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure I completely understand either, but it seems the bone/nylon nut guides the string spacing, while the fret guide the action.  Had anyone had experience using this on a guitar? Either electric or acoustic?"
Luthier,3d75vc,mykinds,3,Tue Jul 14 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"I have a mosrite with a zero fret. It does not obviate the need for a nut, but it does make it somewhat less critical to have a perfectly cut nut. What it does do is give the open notes a more similar tone to the fretted notes."
Luthier,3d75vc,theflyingb,3,Tue Jul 14 03:18:46 2015 UTC,I had a few mosrites. The aluminum spacer should be lower than the zero fret and only set spacing. The zero fret sets the action.  Think of them like a capo.
Luthier,3d75vc,grodisattva,3,Tue Jul 14 19:38:43 2015 UTC,I build seller guitars which commonly use the zero fret. You can easily do it yourself for 98% cheaper than the ridiculous stewmac price of $30.
Luthier,3d75vc,WillyTheDisk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"Zero frets are dumb. This is far worse.  Cut a proper nut, it's not hard."
Luthier,3d75vc,TibbittsN,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"I love zero frets. I put one on my latest build and I don't think I'll go back to a nut. I've replaced nuts on my guitars from wearing out on guitars that the frets are still fine.   I guess it's just a preference thing. I use the same size frets as all the other frets and it is easier when it comes to setup for me. Plus it made my action super perfect.   I also build multiscale instruments so being able to use a zero fret makes it easier to fret the lowest string at the first fret. With a nut there, depending on the skew of the first few frets, your hand will inevitably run into it. I had issues with a nut on my first 8 string multiscale build and the zero fret was a world of difference as far as playability."
Luthier,3d75vc,catdumpling,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:35 2015 UTC,I can see absolutely no benefit to this over a regular nut. It also looks like it was made by a 15-year-old.

Their prices aren't the best but it's a one-stop shop for practically everything.

Luthier,3d2gly,Username_Used,4,Mon Jul 13 01:49:03 2015 UTC,"From how it looks, I'd say it's more likely to be ziricote. Either way a great find for the price. Not sure about the cut of the wood on the sides, you'll probably need to add in a few extra braces to stop them cupping."
Luthier,3d2gly,Clockwork_Monkey,3,Mon Jul 13 02:09:35 2015 UTC,"I've gotten confirmation from 3 really renowned luthiers in the states, and compared the end grain pores to that of indian rosewood lying around the shop. Also, it smells REALLY sweet when sanded. All this points to rosewood. The guy said his dad bought it in the 70's, so the dark color (why it looks like ziricote) is because it's some old growth stuff."
Luthier,3d2gly,WillyTheDisk,3,Mon Jul 13 02:21:59 2015 UTC,It looks an awful lot like Ziricote wood.

Luthier,3d2gly,guitarfixr,2,Mon Jul 13 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"Well ziricote is a type of rosewood, but if 3 luthiers reckon it's Brazilian that's good. Honestly though if I were you I would either save it or sell it. Over here a set of Brazilian rosewood can go for around £2k, that would give you all the materials for several guitars. While it is a very nice wood for back and sides, the cost is not proportionate to the difference in tone compared to other woods. The other option being to save it until you have a few more guitars under your belt."
Luthier,3d2gly,WillyTheDisk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt that's Brazilian, just from the photos."
Luthier,3d2gly,guitarfixr,3,Wed Jul 15 05:17:40 2015 UTC,"I would be very concerned about advertising that the instrument you build from this is made from Brazilian rosewood.  The Lacey Act is not something to mess around with and if you attract attention without proper documentation you could run into some heavy fines and the destruction of the instrument.    Here's a link to the regulations:  http://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/regulation-part23-use-after-import.pdf  If you can acquire some sort of receipt or bill of sale from the original buyer, however unlikely that may be, I would strongly encourage it."
Luthier,3d2gly,Clockwork_Monkey,2,Mon Jul 13 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"If I sell the instrument, I will be very clear with the buyer. More than likely it will be my own personal instrument."

Luthier,3d2gly,Username_Used,7,Mon Jul 13 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"I am 100% for sustainability, and regulations in place on brazilian rosewood. In fact, I'd go so far to say that I don't think it's a particularly special wood, it was just over-harvested because ""that's what luthiers use."" But in this instance, it was either going back to sitting in a barn, or being put to good use. This tree was cut down more than 50 years ago by the look of things, and I have no moral objection to using it.   I would never purchase this wood from a dealer, or anyone who was actively seeking/in contact with a supplier in south america. That's my $.02"
Luthier,3d2gly,rackmountrambo,3,Mon Jul 13 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really have any moral objection either, I was just wondering, as I had heard that it was illegal.  I used to own an original '64 P-bass, and someone told me that if shipped, it's possible (though remote) that it could be seized at the border due to the fingerboard.  I thought that was pretty crazy."

If you want a usable instrument, repair any structural damage, make a new soundpost, a good bridge and put decent strings on it, even this is quite a lot of work and money to put into a fleamarket instrument.  Refinishing it will do nothing to make it more usable, and doing a refinish that looks even halfway decent is a time consuming and difficult job, even for an experienced violinmaker."
Luthier,3d2m7h,RamblingMutt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:40:23 2015 UTC,"The thing is, to get it useable, you will need to repair that crack down the front. It might not be worth fixing, but there isn't some quick easy way to repair it to a working instrument."

Luthier,3d2m7h,idamay,-3,Mon Jul 13 20:03:33 2015 UTC,"Since it's cheap, sand it with 220 grit sand paper. Find a stain that is close in color and re stain it. Since it's cheap, it might not be an oil finish, so you might as well just lacquer it.   And put some cheap varnish on it. Don't stain it. I lied."
Luthier,3d2m7h,Vonmule,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"Don't stain it.  No violin is ever stained. I personally would just touch up the bad areas, but then again i do this for a living.  Apply an alcohol based tinted varnish.  You could use a spray gun as well, but you really don't want to stain it.  Violin finish should sit on top of the wood, not penetrate it."
Luthier,3d2m7h,Clockwork_Monkey,2,Mon Jul 13 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"french polished shellac. its a very traditional finish for stringed instruments and extremely cheap and cost effective. also non-toxic and pleasant to work with. to get a perfect finish with french polish takes quite a bit of skill and experience but i've found that even with no experience, if you go slow and take care, a perfectly suitable finish with a beautiful tinted quality that is perfect for a violin will result. plus if the french polishing goes awry, you can sand and polish out mistakes like any other finish. make sure you buy it in flakes though, not the pre-dissolved stuff in cans at the hardware store. otherwise, the remaining supplies are easy to get just about anywhere"
Luthier,3d2m7h,Vonmule,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yes,  this.  Although no proper violin would use shellac but for a cheap instrument is fine.  Most violin touch up varnishes are shellac based actually"
Luthier,3d2m7h,Luthier42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:55:19 2015 UTC,Many high end luthier made violins use shellac finish.
Luthier,3d2m7h,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:22:29 2015 UTC,"Some yes, but I would debate your use of the  term high end here if they aren't using oil varnish.  Also, resins like seedlac, copal, rosin and amber to name a few, are much more common.  Shellac is used sometimes, but as I said before, I would question their knowledge as a maker.  We do however use touch up varnish which commonly has shellac as an ingredient.  Mine actually is 50/50 shellac and seedlac dissolved in alcohol.  The properties of touch up varnish are very different from the original varnish.  Touch up varnish should be able to be removed easily by subsequent restorers without harming the original varnish."
Luthier,3d2m7h,Vonmule,2,Mon Jul 13 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's good to generalise oil varnish as good, and spirit varnish as bad, there are so many variations of each that it's difficult to generalise the properties of them very much.  Spirit varnish used to be much more common before the internet, and lots of high end makers have used spirit varnish at some point, or continue to use it, but it is less common now.    I think it's mostly less common because buyers are convinced that oil varnish is magical since the old italian instruments where varnished with something oil based.  I use oil varnish on my violins and shellac on my guitars, but spirit varnish on a violin is in no way an indication of an unskilled luthier or a low end instrument in my view."
Luthier,3d2cko,ShapeChangingIns,2,Sun Jul 12 23:31:56 2015 UTC,"If it's a brass screw you can drill it out. Be careful - use a drill press if you have one - and go slow. Use a drill bit size that is larger than the screw and a dimension that dowels come in (i.e. 1/4""). You want to drill out all of the brass and leave behind a nice clean hole. The hardest part is getting the bit started in the center of the broken screw. You can use a metal punch or a large nail, and bang a little cup-shaped dent into the center of the top of the broken screw that will help to center the tip of the drill bit and keep it from wandering off center.  Fill the hole with a hardwood dowel of the appropriate size (use Titebond or some other wood glue) and then redrill your pilot hole and try again with the screw.  You may want to try going one bit size larger for your pilot hole so it doesn't happen again."
Luthier,3d2cko,BrightGuitars,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I did the same thing when I mounted a Bigsby trem. The options are:   Use a dremel to cut a slot in the metal of the screw, then use a flathead screwdriver to get it out.  Try a screw extractor bit.  Dig some wood out so you can use needle nose pliers.  Use a StewMac screw extractor kit and fill the hole with a dowel, or make your own plug cutter.    Good luck!"
Luthier,3d2cko,wikisomnia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks to everybody for their awesome advice.  I tried the needle noise route, and cutting a slot, but with no luck. I'll stop by the woodshed later this week and try a screw extractor."
Luthier,3d2cko,catdumpling,2,Tue Jul 14 01:49:36 2015 UTC,"You can get broken screw extractor kits from Amazon or most hardware stores for $15 or less. For something you won't use very often, I don't think the StewMac kit (at $64!) is worth the price. You can also make a screw plug cutter with a piece of brass or aluminum tubing from a hobby shop: just cut a few inches off, then file some teeth into one end. Center the plug cutter around the broken screw, drill down the same depth as the amount of broken-off screw, then gently pop out the plug with a small chisel or other flat tool. Brass tubing is only a few dollars from most hobby stores, and I've even seen it at Michael's (it's usually near the model railroad section, sometimes the dollhouse aisle.)"

Luthier,3cyj13,piza305,3,Sat Jul 11 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"If you can afford the Warmoth (or a USACG), I'd pick that over the MightyMite. I've used MM necks, and while they're serviceable, the quality is really hit-or-miss. MM's tend to have less than stellar fretwork, and will require a lot more final fretwork than a better brand. If you really want something on a budget, I'd suggest getting a Squier Vintage Modified or Classic Vibe series neck instead: they're made in the same factory as the MightyMite necks, but they just seem to have better QC and fit and finish. There are a few sellers on eBay that have new Squier take-off necks.  If you can swing it, you'll probably be happier with a Warmoth, although I'd highly suggest looking at USA Custom Guitars too: their stuff is fantastic, and Tommy will do pretty much anything you want. One thing to note is that USACG does not have a Fender license, so you'd need to (very) slightly modify the headstock if you want a true Fender shape. Also look at Warmoth's ""Showcase"" and ""Screamin' Deals"" sections, as well as USACG's ""Web Specials"": you'll often find great necks with an additional discount (usually it's just stuff that was ordered, but then the customer changed their mind.)  One other good choice is Allparts. Their necks are made in the same Japanese factory that makes the MIJ Fender necks, and they can be had for about $20 more than a MightyMite (although they're much higher quality!) The only real downside to Allparts is that they have a fairly limited range, so you'll be kind of stuck with the handful of models they offer. But if you're going for a Thinline Deluxe, Allparts does make a large-headstock Strat neck with the bullet trussrod adjuster: those only come in a 7.25"" radius though.  At any rate, you should be able to get a really nice neck from Allparts, Warmoth or USACG within your budget, and I'd really suggest getting one of those over a MightyMite if you can afford it. You'll be happier in the long run."

Luthier,3cz25m,Shaun_Guitarist,3,Sun Jul 12 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's cheap, or there's kits that you don't have to worry about (as far as quality, neck pocket, hole alignment, etc is concerned.) The cheap kits out there are really hit-or-miss, and I've seen just as many decent ones as I have ones that have misaligned neck pockets, bad fretwork, etc. Most of the cheap kits (Albatross, Saga, etc) are all the same Chinese kits with different names, and most of them are bolt-on (although I've occasionally seen set-neck kits.)  If you plan on upgrading the hardware anyway, I'd suggest just spending a bit more and buying the neck and body from a good vendor, and get the (better) hardware later. You're still going to have to do some sanding, painting, gluing in the neck, etc, so you'll have time to start saving up for pickups and hardware. If you paint with acrylic or nitro lacquer, you're looking at a few weeks' worth of painting and drying time anyway.  GuitarFetish might be an okay option, although I have seen a LOT of their bodies with holes drilled in the wrong places (the wood quality isn't impressive either.) GFS also kinda sucks when it comes to customer service too, so if you have a problem don't expect too much from them.  The only high-quality set neck Explorer kit that I'm aware of is from Precision Guitar Kits. Their basic Explorer kit is $379, but that gets you a nicely-made limba (korina) body, quartersawn korina neck, rosewood fretboard and Jescar medium-jumbo frets already installed (FWIW, Jescar is my favorite fretwire and it's much nicer than the soft wire that typically comes on the cheap kits.) If you want to bump it up a notch and get some custom stuff thrown in, the Explorer customizer starts at $450.  Precision Guitar kits have kind of become the go-to for people that want to build nice Gibby-style guitars (lots of build threads of them on the MyLesPaul forums.) They're super high-quality, their customer service is fantastic, and the attention to detail is even better than most of the actual Gibsons these days (IMO, of course.) If you can swing it, I'd really suggest going with their $379 basic Explorer kit: you'll end up with a far nicer guitar and one you'll be proud to own and play, and you won't spend a bunch of time and money fighting with poorly-made parts that don't fit right. I actually think the really cheap kits are better for experienced builders, mostly because they usually require a hell of a lot more fiddly work (and reworking) to get them to go together, and that takes a certain amount of previous experience to make it less frustrating."

Luthier,3cyv1x,VikingWoodCraft,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:05:23 2015 UTC,Here is a wiring diagram for your bass:  http://i45.tinypic.com/m7f1g4.jpg  Does your wiring match up with this?
Luthier,3cxon2,Datwhiteass3564,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"I love Jazzmasters, but hate working on their wiring (I'm sure I don't have to explain why ;) .)  Since your ""rhythm"" circuit is working, you can eliminate those pots, the pickups and the jack as the problem. That narrows it down to either the main selector switch, the small rhythm circuit slide switch, or the main pots. The first thing I'd probably do is bypass the main tone pot, then see if it works. If not, bypass the main volume and tone and run directly from the main (lower) toggle directly to the output jack. If that works, it's one or both of your main pots. I'd then try both main pots individually to find the culprit, then swap it for a new pot.  If running from the main toggle directly to the output jack (ie, bypassing your main vol/tone pots), then you've narrowed it down to either the main toggle being wonky, or the rhythm circuit slide switch having a dodgy connection (although at that point I'd bet more on the main toggle switch being broken or wired wrong.)  If you have a multimeter and know how to use it properly, it can make finding the bad component much easier, especially on a guitar like the Jazzmaster. Otherwise you're basically just going to have to narrow it down via a process of elimination (but remember, we know your rhythm circuit and pickups work, and you've double-checked the wiring, so it's most likely either your main vol/tone pots, or the main toggle switch. Focus on those three things.) Normally I'd suggest disconnecting the solder points and soldering on some alligator clips instead, which makes rerouting the wiring a lot easier, but with a JM I don't think that's really going to save you any time."

Cracks between the top and kerfling/sides can spread relatively quickly, I'd remove the strings and get a repair quote.  Shouldn't be terribly expensive, probably an hours worth of work with whatever the repair guys bench rate is."
Luthier,3cvh1y,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yeah, I took the strings off as soon as I noticed it. Closest a reputable luthier near me is available is Monday so I'll have to sit on it for a couple of days worrying about it. But I'll definitely take it in and get it looked at."
Luthier,3cvh1y,catdumpling,2,Sat Jul 11 03:34:59 2015 UTC,"Getting a professional opinion in person is definitely a good idea. However, you could also wick some thin or medium CA (super glue) along the crack, press it together for a minute to clamp, and it would probably be sufficient (based on what I see in the photo, anyway.) In fact, that might be exactly what your luthier does.  Alternately, you could get a syringe and injected a smidge of thinned-out yellow wood glue, clamp for a few hours, and again that should be plenty. You can thin wood glue with up to 5% water (any more than that and the glue loses strength.) Wood glue takes longer to set up, but it's far easier to clean: after you clamp, just wipe up the squeeze-out with a damp rag. On the other hand, CA sets up wicked fast, so you need to be really careful to avoid the surrounding finish and be prepared to do a little scraping or sanding if it does get on the finish. If it's a poly finish, you can remove dried CA with a q-tip dipped in acetone, but do not do that on a nitro finish! Acetone will dissolve nitro instantly. Martin uses both types of finish, so it depends on the specific model you have.  Personally, I'd grab a syringe and a blunt 14 or 16-gauge needle, thin out a little Titebond and squidge it in there. You may have to gently pry the crack apart just a bit, but otherwise it should be a pretty simple fix as long as you take care of it now and don't let it get worse."
Luthier,3cvh1y,coffeefuelsme,2,Sat Jul 11 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"This is good advice, I personally would use titebond rather then CA glue for a structural repair."

Luthier,3cvh1y,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:41:16 2015 UTC,"I'll actually fourth my own suggestion for Titebond ;) . CA would probably be unnecessarily messy and just add more finish touch up work (although I'll add that if OP decides to go with CA, the thick/gel type would probably be the best option/least messy in this case.)"

I'm the kinda guy who'd rather pay to have it done right the first time than do it myself, save money, and possibly fuck up. Especially since I'm far from very crafty."
Luthier,3cvh1y,catdumpling,2,Sat Jul 11 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"Simple fix. Head over to Lowes and grab a bottle of Titebond I wood glue, put some glue in a Tupperware and dilute it with a little bit of water. Just enough to make it a little runny.   Then using your finger, rub some of your glue/water mix over the crack, working it in as best you can.   Then grab a clamp and tighten it down.  Don't crank down on it, tighten it just enough to close the crack. I would also use a cloth between the clamp and guitar body to protect the wood.  Allow it to stay clamped for 24 hours then remove the clamp and clean up any excess glue with a cloth and warm water."
Luthier,3cngbl,MisterVandemar,6,Thu Jul 9 07:10:10 2015 UTC,"I'm of the school of thought that the species of wood used in electric guitars makes virtually no tonal difference (at least not that I've ever experienced in my 27 years of playing.) Besides that, there have been a lot of guitars made with redwood, so I say go for it!  But (of course there is a ""but""), you need to be sure that that slab is properly dried, with a moisture content in the 5% range. If it's freshly cut, you're either going to need to find a place to kiln-dry it, or stick it somewhere for a couple years to dry out. Trying to build a guitar with wood that's too wet will be a disaster in the long run. Also, burls sometimes require stablizing, which is infusing the wood with something like an epoxy resin, CA, etc. That depends on your specific piece of wood though, it may not need it.  Do you have a pic? I'm sure a lot of us would like to check it out!"
Luthier,3cngbl,catdumpling,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:31:00 2015 UTC,"I'm just finishing an electric with an ash body and a redwood burl top. I've also done a redwood burl top on a walnut body. Both are sweet! It is definitely a soft wood which is why I combined it with a harder wood (ash, walnut). I definitely recommend using it and I recommend laminating it to something else for both strength and to add to the tonal range - softer woods and harder woods both have their advantages and disadvantages so putting them together evens things out.  You can either laminate the redwood to a body as a bookmatched top, or you can laminate 2 redwood wings to a hardwood core (like with a neck through design)."
Luthier,3cngbl,BrightGuitars,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:16:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely make sure it's dry. Even from there I've seen wood have it's way once it's moved into your shop. I personally try to let wood sit a month or two in my shop before I start using it. Changes in humidity and temperature will make some wood do all kinds of dumb stuff.   Other than that, I've never worked with redwood, it's a softer wood.  It's about as soft as most construction woods from this chart. I've seen guitar bodies made from construction lumber before and they seemed fine.   I would see if you could snag a piece that's mostly quartersawn and maybe consider a more substantial neck joint. If you go with a neck through, most the tensile loads will be on those woods.   It'll definitely work as a solid body with a bolt on neck but I think making some other considerations would be a good idea."
Luthier,3cmubp,wafflewrestler,2,Thu Jul 9 03:20:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look that bad in the video and it looks like it moves easily right into place when you press down. (What I cant quite tell from the vid is whether the binding goes back into place on it's ledge, but I think it does....) Tape may not do the job but I think a combination of clamps and tape probably would, from what I can see in the vid. The back isn't too badly warped and I think gluing it back to the sides and kerfing will get it back into shape pretty nicely. No need to remove the back. Get a whole bunch of glue in there (titebond or whatever wood glue you like) - make sure it gets onto every surface esp. the back and kerfing, and use clamps to hold it in place. Put a clamp maybe every 2 inches or so (use padded cauls on the back and the top so you dont damage them with the clamps). Leave enough space between clamps to get a couple pieces of tape on there and use the tape to hold the binding in place. Clamp, tape, clamp, tape, etc. all the way along the area to be fixed. Clamps hold the back down, tape holds the binding in place. Clean up whatever glue squeezes out and let dry. Then after you remove the tape and clamps you'll have a little more cleaning up to do which you can do with a wet paper towel or rag (just not too wet), rubbing over the dried glue until it is soft enough to remove.  As always, try a dry run with the clamps before you glue to make sure you have everything you need and that everything fits together properly. Nothing worse than having to run to the bandsaw/sander/etc. to make a quick call while glue is already setting up in your repair."

Luthier,3ckrpe,rofloma,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"It could be a number of things but since the guitar is used I have a hunch:  take out the neck pickup and pull on the humbucker cover while holding the baseplate.  Give it a wiggle and a tug, if it moves that's the source of your feedback.  If it doesn't move take a look at the baseplate of the pickup and see if the cover is soldered to the base plate.  I suggest this because sometimes folks will swap humbucker covers from Gold to Chrome or whatever and don't solder the cover to the baseplate.  When the cover gets all loose it vibrates against the bobbin causing feedback.  If this is he case you'll need a 35w soldering iron rather then the cheaper 15w pen ones that you can buy at the hardware store, some flux, and solder.  If you still have feedback issues you may need to report the pickup."

Luthier,3ckc69,HansJobb,2,Wed Jul 8 16:11:02 2015 UTC,Tru-oil is a great finish. It does take quite a while to apply. Generally speaking it seems like most people do about 15-18 coats. The issue is that you're confined to doing one application a day.   First coat goes on heavy. For what it's worth you can basically pour oil onto the guitar and use your fingers to apply it to the guitar. Definitely get some latex gloves because this stuff isn't fun to get off your skin.   If you've got a porous wood I've actually heard of applying a thick first coat and sanding with 400 grit to create a kind of slurry to help fill the pores. You'd have to sand while the oil is still wet of course.   The next day sand it flat and apply another heavy coat. You won't have to make a slurry the second time around. After that dries you'll want to hit it with some 00 steel wool just to the point that it takes the shine out. From here on out apply very thin finishes with a rag and use steel wool between each coat. Once it starts laying up nice and smooth between coats you can stop using the steel wool.

There are different techniques, I don't use the technique prescribed by the manufacturer, my process is more like TibbittsN's.  I do a really heavy soak coat, let it start to get a little tacky, then wipe off.  Then I wet sand with 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500 grit in successive coats to make the slurry he mentions, and then I wipe the slurry off across the grain. It will slowly fill and level, as well as become shiny if that's what you're going for.   I built a bass for a friend and he didn't want it shiny, so I just applied coats and then wiped them off.  I also used steel wool to dull it, but I'm sure it will wind up shinier as time goes on.  You can do a couple coats a day because the drying time is relatively short.  That being said, I'd let it cure for a few weeks before really using the instrument."

Excellent quality and you wouldn't need to upgrade, but still very affordable. StewMac has this one for $24, but you can probably find them elsewhere with free shipping or something."
Luthier,3cgkwx,Colinm478,8,Tue Jul 7 19:16:14 2015 UTC,1) Truss looks fine. You need to take the nut off before repairing.   2) Yes. You can use a small amount of bees wax to keep the squeeze out from bonding to the rod.   3) Use cauls between the clamps to prevent dents.   4) Titebond I.  5)  This break really should be repaired using wood splines. I'd strongly advise that you take this to a professional who has experience repairing neck breaks and have it repaired the correct way.
Luthier,3cgkwx,cromag5150,6,Tue Jul 7 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds good 1-4.  As for professional repair, I just don't have the money right now. As for the splines, I have read conflicting things. Many people say that they are unnecessary unless it is a very short break. Mine is at an angle and there is a lot of surface area for gluing.   There is ~3.0in2 of surface area for the gluing, and for a scarf joint, titebond has been shown to hold to ~73.6 lb/in2. This puts my joint at ~220.9lb.   Of course, this is not exact, and the test was not done on quarter sawn mahogany, and the break is in no way a scarf joint.... but I think I will be good. From what I have seen, in just about every case, the wood will break before the glue."
Luthier,3cgkwx,BrightGuitars,5,Tue Jul 7 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're lucky to have all that surface area. Give it a shot. If it doesn't hold up you can cross that bridge.  As for #3, do a dry clamping before you do it with glue. Make sure all your cauls are the right sizes, angles, padded in the right places, etc. and they hold the pieces together perfectly. This is the most important step to getting a good result. And remember glue is like a lubricant when it's wet and any pieces that want to move or slide will do so a lot easier with the glue in there."
Luthier,3cgkwx,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I didn't even think about the glue being a lube, so I'll have to mind that. For the cauls, should I give them contours to math the neck, or is flat fine?"
Luthier,3cgkwx,catdumpling,2,Tue Jul 7 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"For the back of the neck, which is curved, I would curve the caul to match and/or pad it sufficiently with leather, cork, etc. so you don't get a flat spot from the caul. And as for sliding, in your case you have a lot of texture (as opposed to 2 perfectly flat surfaces) so that helps a lot, but you'll still want to watch for movement. If it's just a little creeping, you can kind of nudge it back in place as you tighten the clamp, but if the clamp or the cauls aren't well seated, you'll have a tough time of it."
Luthier,3cgkwx,cromag5150,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:53:35 2015 UTC,"Just about what I assumed. I'll match the cauls' contours a bit on the drum sander, and then put a layer of leather or thin foam board to protect from scuffing/dents.  Thanks to both of you, I appreciate the help."
Luthier,3cgkwx,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"Do a dry run (or two) with clamps before you ever touch the glue. That way you'll figure out exactly how to clamp it up before the glue starts setting, and you can address any cauls or odd clamping techniques you might need to come up with. Giving cauls a slight contour might help, but it just depends on where you're putting them (back of the heastock/neck will probably benefit from a contour, front of headstock probably won't need it.)  As others mentioned Titebond I is fine (it's actually what Gibson uses at the factory), although any yellow wood glue should be fine. Gorilla Wood Glue (not the brown polyurethane stuff!!) works great too. Also DO NOT NOT NOT use epoxy!!! Epoxy is not designed to soak into wood grain and those types of headstock ""repairs"" often fail...except the epoxy makes another repair even more difficult, because it's hard to get all that epoxy off later. Yellow wood glue only!  Speaking of cleanup, look at both mating surfaces carefully and gently pick out any little loose bits of wood; those can interfere with getting the joint to mate together properly. Yours looks pretty clean, but there might be some splinters out of place, so give it a once-over before gluing it up (and do a dry run with clamps!)  I'd also suggest watching a few headstock repair videos on YT to get a feel for what needs to be done. It's not the end of the world, and in your case the break is fairly clean, so don't stress too much. Still, it can help to watch other people do it so you have a better idea of how to navigate the problem. Here's a video from Stew-Mac and Dan Erlewine that explains it really well (and it's short), but searching for ""broken headstock repair"" in YT will pull up loads of videos."

Luthier,3cgxbj,Hotdogcannon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:34 2015 UTC,What about when you touch the jack?   Do you have a continuity tester to confirm the bridge ground is connected properly to the rest of the circuit?
Luthier,3cgxbj,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"no to the tester, but i can get one. it goes silent when i touch the jack"
Luthier,3cgxbj,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the bridge ground isn't connected properly. I would explore that first. Can you see what it connects to inside of the electronics cavity? And if it is connected to something, is that something connected to everything else? Ideally all the pots and switches should be connected to ground somehow."
Luthier,3cgxbj,livebrains,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"You'll need to get a multimeter and test continuity from the jack sleeve to all the metal parts (bridge, strings, knobs, switches, etc.).  If something doesn't beep, out needs to be grounded.  The proper way to do the electronics is to have a solid control cavity ground, either with shielding paint or foil/tape, then all your pots and switches will be inherently grounded off that when mounted.  In your specific case, the pickup chassis may not be connecting, e.g. if you have a humbucker shield wire connected to the switch housing, but the switch housing isn't grounded.   You really just need to probe around with a meter and see what isn't connected."
Luthier,3cge1n,bobtheghost33,2,Tue Jul 7 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not a professional luthier but that looks like a nasty break to me.  Does the grain line up reasonably well when you try to dry-fit them back together?  ""Headstock broke off"" is a pretty standard guitar injury but like you said they're usually a lot 'cleaner' so they just glue and clamp and send you on your way.  I wonder what could be done with serious surgery routing out both the headstock and the neck and custom-fitting another piece of wood to fill that gap and gluing it all together with a double-dovetail joint or something crazy like that."
Luthier,3cge1n,thepensivepoet,2,Tue Jul 7 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yes you can! It will take some woodworking, and it's probably a $2-300 repair on a $100 guitar, but it should be fun and you can fix this. It will take a few steps, and the easiest way to describe it is this: google: headstock spline then google: headstock backstrap  First glue the head back on the neck as best you can. If any wood is preventing the pieces from mating back together just remove that problem wood until you get a good mating.  Then you'll want to install 2 or 3 splines (there's no truss rod up there so you could do 3). If you don't have a lot of experience with a router, the easiest way to make the spline pockets is with a drill. Draw a line that represents the center of the pocket, drill several holes of even depth (dont go through!) using this line as the center for your drill bit, then clean up the sides of the pocket wall with a chisel. Fit and glue in some splines - maple would be nice and strong.  Then you'll want to remove some meat from the back of the headstock and neck - you'll want to go up the neck a fair bit, at least to the 2nd or 3rd fret - and glue a new piece of mahogany, oversized, to cover this whole area. Then once that's dry carve it back to the original neck and headstock dimensions.  When it's all said and done it will be stronger than the original neck. If you want to do it quick and dirty you could probably get away with just the splines, but the backstrap adds a lot more strength and makes it look a lot nicer."
Luthier,3cge1n,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:14:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll give that a try
Luthier,3cge1n,TibbittsN,2,Wed Jul 8 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"Yikes. That's nasty.   Gluing end grain like that leads to weak joints. That is a very unique break. I can't say I've seen many break like that.   Considering what kind of guitar it is, I would consider it trashed. I feel like it'd be easier to reset that neck instead of trying to glue that break. Resetting a neck isn't exactly something a beginner should try to do either."

It might be the filter on the pics, but that body doesn't look smooth, it looks all scratched up. You need to ""work the grits."" Sand the whole guitar smooth with 150, being careful not to round over the edges. Then sand out all of the scratches with 220. Then sand out all of those scratches with 320. The chips can be filled with Bondo or 2 part epoxy. When the whole guitar is sanded to 320, then you can paint several thin coats of Krylon. Let it dry a few days before wet sanding 400, rubbing out,  and buffing. Decent low budget paint job just takes sandpaper and time. Don't rush. Watch some youtube vids on painting with Krylon."

Luthier,3cbmnu,slapspatula,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"awwwww you gave it away! ;)  Ok.. since we are being generous here is the order I set up a guitar. 1) Truss rod 2)nut slot depth 3) Action (bridge) 4) Pickup height 5) Intonation    Truss rod (relief) is a matter of taste but it is independant of the other factors. Nut is like truss rod (independant of the others, you could do nut depth first then trusrod but 9 out 10 the nut is close enough if the guitar has been set up before.. the trod usually gets adjusted a couple of times a year unless you live in the desert). Action next. I your trod is out then your action will be out when you fix the trod. Once you get your action set do you pickup height. If your pickups are too high it can mess with the intonation (and just sound horrible). When all else is done then do the intonation (intonation is the in-tune-ness of the guitar up the neck)"

If you have a spray gun you can tint or tone your topcoat with some of the stain (has to be compatible) this will also hide the grain a bit. If you sand it back down you could try all sorts of stuff. You could dilute India ink with water, rub it on, let it dry, and sand a bit off and stain over that. ( that would also give you an idea before you stain it what's going to be blotchy.)

It's not a particularly awesome grain in the first place though, sorry don't mean to diss you axe or anything, just not a really noteworthy piece of wood.  If it were mine, I'd probably sand it down to wood, use a dye rather than a stain, and maybe sunburst it with a spray gun - but that's quite a lot of work on top of what you've already put into it."

Luthier,3c73io,chrisjscott,2,Sun Jul 5 14:13:06 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have a router and a scroll saw/jigsaw or even a coping saw -    Make a pattern for the cavities by rubbing over (crayon, chalk, pencil lead, w/e works for you) on plain paper, cut it out with scissors, you want this ever so slightly oversized, so that you can file or sand the final pieces down. Glue your pattern to a piece of 1/4"" plywood and cut it out (scrollsaw would be ideal here). For the big square bit in the middle I think I'd just measure and cut (maybe 1/16"" or less oversized - it's easy to sand a long straight side smooth with a good sanding block or just a sheet of sandpaper stuck on a board or table), then round the corners over, but I have a pretty good collection of power sanders to work with. Test fit to your cavity and sand it to fit as precisely as you want it to. Obviously, bigger is better to allow you to sand your final filler for a snug fit, but too much bigger would be a pita because hardwood is pretty tough to sand. If it were me, I'd just go for a precise fit on the pattern, as you can just put a screw in it (the pattern) if it gets stuck in the cavity; you probably don't want to do that with the final material. You might want to chamfer the inner edges just a tad so that getting it in and out of the hole is easier; you do need a little room for glue anyway, so you don't need it so tight that you have to hammer it in. Use double-sided carpet tape or something else that is REALLY tacky to stick your pattern to your filler wood - you don't want ANY slippage here. I've also used hide glue for this bit, as you can just get it back off with a heat gun and a putty knife, but most woodworkers are content with the double-stick tape. User a router bit with a roller bearing to follow your pattern. Be safe, you're a player and you need your fingertips! A router table would be ideal, but then so would having a staff of servants to do all this for you. We make do with what we have, eh? Sand the filler piece to fit, glue and clamp in place. You probably want to think that out in advance, some sort of clamping cauls would let you squeeze the blocks in without actually putting too much pressure on the body itself. Basically just a couple of sticks that span the cavity and let you use a screw clamp on the sticks, rather than on the body, and the sticks distribute the pressure evenly.   You can make an excellent sanding block by buying sanding belts, and cutting a wood block to fit tightly inside.Nice flat surface, and a cheap tool that's good to have around.  edit: oops on the bit about the big square piece in the middle - I went off in the editor and just referred back to my mental image. Always a mistake there."

Luthier,3c73io,Luthier42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"I am not quite getting the idea of what you are trying to do here, are you trying to make a solid body guitar with no electronics?  If you want a better unplugged sound, more cavities in the direction of a thinline or semi-acoustic is where you want to go, not filling in the cavities, but for something like that It's easier to start with a blank body.  If you want the body to be heavier you can drill out holes and fill them with steel cylinders of the right size.  If you want to fill the cavities, make a template and rout a symetrical hole trough the entire center section of the guitar. This is much faster and easier to fit than using separate pieces for the front and back rout and worrying about the holes and different depths of the rout.  Use something that is not ebony.  Ebony splinters and shatters like nothing else if the grain is gnarly, it's not very stable unless the grain is straight and quartered and it's too expensive for what you get."

I'd be very careful with the  position markers on the guitar.  I always use lighter fluid because it's safe for everything but even there I would not do it. Just a damp rag and test them that even on the corners of one of the position markers. Remember water is the solvent. Kind of gross but Dan  erlewine Will use a little bit of saliva as a solvent when cleaning a delicate finish."

I'd avoid cleaning the whole fretboard with water, you'll likely raise the grain up and give yourself more work in refinishing it, it also appears to be stained, so you probably want to check what alcohol does to it before you begin to go crazy.

Luthier,3c1fsk,kent_eh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:24:58 2015 UTC,any suggestions for what bridge I should get?   Probably some variant on a tune-o-matic would be the best option.
Luthier,3c1fsk,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:02:58 2015 UTC,Cool. Know if there's any with height-adjustable saddles?
Luthier,3c1fsk,catdumpling,2,Sat Jul 4 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"The original bridge was probably a simple pre-radiused, pre-slotted bar with no adjustment other than overall height. Allparts still sells bridges like these, but you can probably find them cheaper elsewhere.  Gotoh makes a Tune-o-matic with individual height-adjustable saddles, but it's going to cost about 10x what you paid for the guitar. It may not fit that baseplate either, but you'll have to measure the post spacing (it's most likely metric.) I'd suggest measuring the fretboard radius instead and finding a budget Tuneomatic that matches (or gets close; a bridge with a slightly flatter radius usually still feels okay.) You can also use nut slotting files to file saddle slots deeper to match the radius."
Luthier,3c1fsk,kent_eh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll look into doing some of that. Do you happen to have a link for the Gotoh bridge you referenced? Sorry I took so long to reply."
Luthier,3c1fsk,EndlessOcean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"Here's the Allparts listing for that Gotoh bridge. Unfortunately it looks like Allparts is out of stock for the chrome version, but that part number can come in handy if you need to order it through an Allparts dealer (ie, pretty much any music store.) You can order directly from Allparts, but you'll get about a 20% discount if you go through an authorized Allparts dealer instead.  I found one seller on eBay who has it in stock, and they're a shop I've actually ordered several things from. Arkansas Musicworks has it for $51.99 w/ free shipping, so it's not too bad as far as price goes. AMW is pretty solid and they've done right by me when USPS broke a neck in shipping that I'd ordered from them, so I wouldn't hesitate to order from them (no affiliation on my part, aside from being a previous customer of theirs.)  Otherwise you can use either the Allparts part number (GB-2585-010) or the Gotoh model number (510BN) to see if anyone else has it in stock. As I mentioned before, any Allparts dealer can order it for you (assuming it's in stock at Allparts), and any Gotoh dealer can probably get it too. I don't know if they have it in stock, but MojoTone, Amplified Parts and Philadelphia Luthier Supplies all tend to stock quite a bit of Gotoh hardware compared to other places."
Luthier,3bwrix,liableAccount,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"The most thorough method is to pull the frets, strip the finish, re-fret, then re-spray.  With painted fretboards, you paint over the frets after you've beveled them and dressed the ends.  After paint, you level/crown/polish."
Luthier,3bwrix,livebrains,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't directly answer your question.  You can re-spray the fretboard depending on the initial height of your frets.  They will be shorter relative to the surface of the paint afterwards, but if you have tall frets to begin with it may not matter.    For a frame of reference, you can measure the current height with the little depth measurement stick on the end of most calipers.  Jumbo frets are usually .055-.060"" tall, and vintage fender style frets are around .035"".  A normal coat of poly finish in a factory setting will add .010-.015"" to the height of the fretboard.  So, if you currently have at least .045"" of fret height, you should be fine with a reasonably thick coat of paint.  Again, whichever way to decide to go, you'll paint over the frets, then remove the finish on the frets by leveling/crowning/polishing."
Luthier,3bwrix,livebrains,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! A very thorough answer! I have jumbo frets on at the minute and will replace them with another set of jumbo frets so I still have that height discrepancy.   Can I ask what crowning tool you use? I have a triangular dressing file that works well but these Hosco/Japanese crowning files look like they could be more effective.   Again, thanks for the answer, I'm going to spend some time on acheiving a good refret technique before I tackle this guitar!"
Luthier,3bwrix,livebrains,2,Sat Jul 4 12:14:54 2015 UTC,"I have one of those super expensive 320 diamond grit half round files with the tapered ends from Stew Mac.  I got it because we were all issued new files at work years ago, so I ganked my old one that didn't see a ton of use anyway.  But, you can get the same results with a standard steel half round.  Just wrap 320 grit (or whatever grit you want) sandpaper over the cutting edge.  Use the edge that's a size larger than the frets to account for the thickness of the sandpaper.  I also use a quarter round file in addition to the half round (sans sandpaper) to shape the fret ends.  But that's just because of the style I like to shape them.  The quarter round isn't a necessity.  If you're doing a re-fret, the most important thing is to level the fretboard before pressing in new frets.  So many people make the mistake of assuming they can just grind down the fret crowns to make it level.   While that can work, it's much more thorough and less time consuming in the long run to level the wood first."
Luthier,3bwrix,livebrains,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I think its time I spent a little on a decent file. May have a look around and see what I can get.   people make the mistake of assuming they can just grind down the fret crowns to make it level.    Pretty much my first assumption! Would it be any different if I went straight to radius sanding rather than levelling first? I have a lot of sandpaper and some time to spare here."
Luthier,3bwrix,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Sat Jul 4 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"I level the fretboard end to end first, then clean up the radius after.    I'll go between the two a few times until it's correct using 150 or 220, depending on how far off it is.  Then after both the radius and level are correct I'll start climbing the grits in the sanding schedule."

I would say though for under a thousand I generally like the Taylor guitars because i think their entry level guitars are a bit better quality over the Martins.  I would suggest checking out the Taylor 114e and see what you think,  it's a grand concert size so it's a little bit bigger but not much but you'll notice a completely didn't sound compared to the Martin.  The Taylor's will generally have a brighter ""twangier"" sound while the Martin's will be deeper and warmer sound,  it's all just dependant on your preference.    If you like the smaller size Taylor also has the gs mini that just has an amazing sound for a smaller guitar,  definitely worth checking out if you haven't.    There are a few different options in tone woods too for the mini,  you can get a mahogany or rosewood back and sides or all mahogany for a warmer sound.   Otherwise you can check out some parlor guitars from Alvarez, they have come out with a few models for around 500 that play and sound amazing for such a small guitar.     No matter which way you go I don't think you'll be disappointed,  your looking at pretty good guitars all around.   Good luck to you!"

Luthier,3btoe2,flekkzo,4,Sat Jul 4 17:14:12 2015 UTC,If you want a bit of adjustment put a piece of high density foam behind it before screwing it down.  Hard mounting it isn't bad at all but can cause some knock resonance i.e. hit the guitar and it will come through the amp more loudly than normal.
Luthier,3btoe2,wiredconcepts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:51:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I see tele neck pickups mounted like this. It's not uncommon Op.
Luthier,3btoe2,pain-and-panic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"Eddie either used wooden shims or nothing and just screw it down tight to the body. I've heard both stories, but based on pics of Franky and Eddie's early methods of hacking the shit out of modifying his guitars, I'm pretty sure it's just screwed down tight with no shims. The mounting tabs on some humbuckers are actually pretty tall, and I've seen some people have to bend or cut them to actually get the pickup low enough on their Franky builds.  Many manufacturers that direct-mount pickups (Jazzmasters and J basses being good examples) will put some foam under the pickup; this basically acts like a spring and pushes up on the pickup, which keeps it from flopping around. Sometimes you have to experiment with how thick to make the foam, but it's easy to dial in: you want enough foam to keep the pickup fairly rigid, but not so much foam that it's difficult to lower the pickup if necessary. If it's too tight, you can either strip the screw hole (not a big deal), or break off a screw in the body (a pain in the ass to fix.)  A good option for foam is the stuff that pickups are usually shipped with: it compresses easily, but is just dense enough that it works great for holding up direct-mounted pups."
Luthier,3btoe2,catdumpling,3,Thu Jul 2 06:56:12 2015 UTC,"Alternately, mousepad material works very well - two to three layers make the pickup fit snugly."
Luthier,3btoe2,stealthgunner385,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:20:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, that can work. Just grab a cheap mouse pad from Big Lots or a dollar store. That foam can be a bit dense, so it's not my favorite, but a lot of people use it. I tried it on my Jazzmaster once and it didn't compress very well, but JM's have very little space for pickup adjustment anyway, so it could just be the design of that guitar.  Another good source is foam weatherstripping, available at any hardware store. There are different densities and it's pretty cheap, plus a lot of it already has some light adhesive tape on one side, which is convenient."

I dunno, he says he ruined the tone when he cut that chunk out (he certainly didn't make it look any better! ;P) I always wondered what the hell he was going for when he cut up that Ibanez like that!  If you Google around, you'll find a few pictures of his guitar ""workshop"" above his garage (or 5150 studio, I forget.) It's absolutely packed with guitars, guitar bodies, necks, tools, etc. While I think Ed likes to take a little more credit than he deserves sometimes (no, Eddie, you did not invent wax-potting pickups), the guy definitely went way beyond the average tinkering that other players were doing back then. I've seen a recent photo of his workshop and he still has dozens of his old Kramer bodies stacked up in one corner!  Random fact: Eddie might have been the first instigator of the whole ""relicing"" thing. When he went to the Kramer shop to look at some guitars they were finishing up for him, he told them to beat up the guitars because ""they look too new."" He wanted them to all look like he'd played the hell out of them, even though they were brand new. Apparently Unk and the other guys at Kramer were a little stunned because they'd just finished all these nice striped paint jobs, but they did it for him anyway.

Luthier,3bsaz8,triplebaconator,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:51:40 2015 UTC,The luthier tried adjusting the bridge - this did not work and my understanding is that would affect all of the strings anyway.  He then tried adjusting the nut (I'm not sure how) but it came back the same.  It what way would the nut slots be cut improperly?  The nut looks parallel to the fingerboard and the fingerboard does not appear to be off center.  Thanks for your help!
Luthier,3bsaz8,BrightGuitars,3,Thu Jul 2 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"Here's a really interesting article on violin tuning problems: http://baylakeyes.com/2013/06/three-systems-of-intonation/  To sum up it says there is more than one way to tune a violin and they all require a bit of compromise.  I would add that if these violins in question are fractional size instruments, the shorter scale length would exacerbate the problem - the shorter scale length is even less forgiving.  And old, cheap, or otherwise crummy strings can also be problematic."
Luthier,3bsaz8,TibbittsN,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the article!  As mentioned, lots of string players tune using open fifths and adjust intonation using just/solo intonation.  This article recommends tuning the E string higher - that would exacerbate the issue.  The instruments are full sized, I should have mentioned that.  I'm glad you mentioned strings, that was my local luthier's next try."
Luthier,3bsaz8,TibbittsN,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:58:50 2015 UTC,"Since violins don't have frets, I'd suggest grabbing a tape measure and seeing if that's actually the case. Measure half way between the nut and bridge and see if that's an octave when you press the string there. I would also find and play the octave harmonic then press and compare the two notes.   If the octave is not directly in the center between the bridge and nut, you'll have to move the bridge to compensate. When you move the bridge you'll need to do the process again of measuring and pressing the note.   Generally if the note you press is sharp, the bridge needs moved back. If the note is flat, it needs moved towards the nut.  I'm a guitar guy, so take this with a grain of salt. The concepts of intonation are universal across all stringed/fingerboarded instruments."
Luthier,3bsaz8,TibbittsN,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:39:42 2015 UTC,Wouldn't moving the bridge mess with the ratios on the other strings?

Luthier,3bsaz8,sambooka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:57:03 2015 UTC,It's quite possible that you didn't put them in the correct space. Measure and remark where they should be. Do that or use a tuner to see if you're right.   Chances are your ear could be letting you down.
Luthier,3bsaz8,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"Even if they aren't, I have to put my 3rd finger higher than the other strings to be in tune, by almost a half step.  I am an orchestra teacher, freelance musician, private teacher and hold multiple degrees in music.  If I am wrong, it is not by a half step. I still appreciate your input, it's definitely a valid thought."
Luthier,3bsaz8,mattydean1976,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:44:44 2015 UTC,"Ha well that takes that out of the equation I suppose.   Do you have a picture of the instrument?   I would definitely measure out the scale length and compare to manufacturer specs. I'd get out a chromatic tuner and check just to make sure. You could check positions by harmonics too.   There's only 2 variables, without getting too incredibly specific, that matter when it comes to a string being in tune. You have the length of the string and the tension. When you bring the string to tension it remains that tension when you shorten the string by pressing it. The string does stretch when you press the string, but that's adjusted at the bridge to compensate for the extra tension. The variable that is having issues is the length of the string. The only way to change that would be to move the bridge or adjust the nut."

Luthier,3bt4y4,hoverfish,2,Wed Jul 1 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"Shimming a neck to adjust angle is acceptable.  Also, make sure your truss rod is adjusted properly / your neck doesn't have massive backbow"
Luthier,3bt4y4,rustyshackford,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:43:33 2015 UTC,Make sure to get the proper size so it matches your corner radius.
Luthier,3bt4y4,BrightGuitars,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"When you route the area of the pocket where there is no sidewall, start with the router out beyond the pocket (with the base firmly seated on the body of course) and move the router into the edge (as opposed to starting in the meat and moving the router outwards). The inward movement will make a clean cut and wont chip. The outward movement is where you tend to get chipping. Sorry, hard to explain without video.  As to the shim, it will feel weird and create high action up high. When you shim a neck backwards everything is OK because the more you pull it back the more you are pulling the strings into parallel with the fingerboard, creating nice low action. But when you shim it forward, you are actually creating a triangle (Fingerboard, body, and strings) and it raises the action dramatically up at the high frets."
Luthier,3bt4y4,catdumpling,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I'd go with a shim too (assuming everything else is setup properly.) For a more permanent solution that's easier than routing the neck pocket, you can sand down the neck heel a bit, making it thinner. You're somewhat limited in that you don't want it to be thinner than the neck itself (which would feel weird), but you may be able to take off enough to fix the problem. Usually it's preferable to modify the part that has the issue (the body, in this case), but considering it's Guitar Fetish parts and not some expensive custom stuff, I think modding the neck heel is acceptable.  Since a 1.5mm shim seems to be working, I'd start by sanding that much off of the entire heel, although you'll probably end up needing to take about 3mm off the entire heel to achieve the same height change (a shim in one end of the pocket kicks the neck out a lot more than taking the same, but even, amount off of the entire pocket or neck heel.) In other words, you can always take off more, but if you take off too much you'll just have to end up shimming in the other direction, which sort of defeats the whole excercise."
Luthier,3bt1qi,Scragly,5,Wed Jul 1 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the quality of the guitar, but I don't recommend it. That's actually quite an increase in tension. When I put on a new set I'll tune it up, pull on the strings from the middle (like a bow and arrow) lifting the string a few inches from the fingerboard, and retune. Doing this once with steel strings or 2 or 3 times with nylon strings generally does the job."
Luthier,3bt1qi,BrightGuitars,3,Wed Jul 1 22:51:35 2015 UTC,"I stretch the strings by pulling them away from the guitar (grabbing the string and yanking it until it is tight) once it's tuned, then retuning and repeating the process until it holds the tuning. They still take a little while to settle in after that, but it's less time and it won't be out of tune as much as without. I wouldn't leave a guitar over tuned for too long, while it will probably be fine, it's not really good for the guitar."
Luthier,3bt1qi,Clockwork_Monkey,3,Wed Jul 1 23:02:26 2015 UTC,this method is recommended for nylon strings on a classical guitar. I wouldn't do it on an electric.
Luthier,3bt1qi,dinsick500,2,Thu Jul 2 04:04:39 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it depends on the string guage. I don't know the difference between a .009 set overtuned and a .013 tuned E to e.  If you can figure out how much tension it adds you'd know how dangerous it would be. At least in theory:)

Luthier,3bq9ev,HillbillyMan,2,Wed Jul 1 07:41:56 2015 UTC,"Which Mark Knopfler sound? Stuff off Brothers in Arms or more like ""Sultans of Swing""?  For Brothers in Arms, I suggest a new humbucker, possibly a Pearly Gates or something similar. If you want the single coil sound like on Sultans of Swing, there are two or three options.  You could put a Gibson P-94 in, it's a p-90 (which is an oversized Single coil with a little more beef to it) that fits in humbucker cutouts. You could also go for a Seymour Duncan P-Rails with a new pickup ring (that I can't remember the name of, if I remember it I'll let you know) that allows for new switching patterns that the P-Rails can really take advantage of. Last choice would be Lace Sensor Gold Duallys with a coil splitting switch added. Lace Sensor Golds are silent single coils that are made to emulate 50s and 60s fender Single Coils, but in the Dually form they slap two together into a humbucker shape, but splitting it makes it back into a single coil that'll likely sound like what you're looking for."

Luthier,3bq9ev,jappiedurk,6,Wed Jul 1 10:56:17 2015 UTC,"He's talking about the pole-pieces - On most open humbuckers one coil has 6 slugs and the other has screws. You can remove the screws and get a single-coil sound. It's basically like a hum-cancelling single coil, where you have the main coil that picks up the sound, and the secondary 'dummy coil' that's just there to reduce noise.  I don't really recommend it, there are plenty of better options (coil-split or series/parallel wiring, alternative pickups, adapter-rings, etc) but if you dislike the pickups anyway it's probably worth a try - It doesn't cost anything, and is easily reversible just by putting the screws back in."

Luthier,3bp589,catdumpling,2,Wed Jul 1 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"It happens, even on regular Fenders. It's often caused by the neck getting jammed towards the bridge (like someone accidentally bumped the headstock right into a wall or something.) It's not structural, so some yellow wood glue and a clamp should be all you need. Depending on the glue squeezeout, you might need to redrill that hole for the pickguard screw if the hole gets clogged, but otherwise it should be a pretty easy fix.  Wood glue tends to dry in an hour or two, but because there's a pickguard screw right along the break, I'd suggest letting it set up overnight. If you try to force the screw in too soon, it might just re-break that piece out.  Also, you might want to try to wick a couple drops of CA (super glue) into that small crack on the other side of the neck pocket."

I print those templates to size and after putting masking tape on my fretboard, I spray adhesive the template to my fretboard. I cut all the fret slots by hand.   The stew mac saw has the depth gauge which is incredibly helpful. I usually cut my slots before I radius the neck then cut them again once it's radiused. The depth gauge is nice when it's radiused too.  My past 2 guitars I've built were both multiscales so the table saw blade would have been a pain in the ass. It usually takes me about 20-30 minutes to cut 24 frets by hand. I don't use a miter box for obvious reasons. I've just learned to use the fretsaw and it hasn't let me down.   I'm a fan of just using a fret saw. In my experience, using powered machinery leads to messing up really really fast. With a fret saw if you skip across the surface you can fix that. I tend to use as many hand tools as I possibly can. Being in a hurry to build an instrument will show in the final product."

I'd try to raise action first, if that's not an option than I'd go for tightening the truss a tad. Get proper relief and action and it should be good. If not your problem lies with neck angle.

Luthier,3bls7p,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"First, you need to check if the neck is straight, do not mess with the action until you make sure the neck is straight.  Take a straight edge, long one if you've got it and see if you have any gaps or rocking.  The thing with a fretless is that, unless your action is high, it will show up any issues with the board unevenness quicker than if it had frets.  If there are high spots, then you might have to do some leveling (sanding) but be sure first.  If not sure, take it to a tech.  Once you've got the neck sorted out and it still buzzes then raise up the action.    The fact that it plays ok up until the 5th fret and then it is consistently buzzing makes me think neck warp first.  Fretless' are less forgiving with that stuff."

Luthier,3bit2z,captshady,8,Mon Jun 29 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"It's a manufacturing thing. With a paddle head (Fender style) you can use one relatively thin piece of wood and there is no cutting and gluing required, so it's fast and efficient. (This was one of Leo's requirements, that his instruments be easy and efficient to manufacture.) The problems are: you don't get as steep a break angle at the nut, the break angle is inconsistent string-to-string (hence the need for string trees on the treble strings), and the paddle can actually warp forward under the string tension (you see this more commonly in Fender basses than guitars, but it can happen to both).  A scarf joint is definitely the stronger method, but it's more involved - you have to cut the wood at the angle, surface the joint and glue it up. More steps, more time, more cost.  Gibsons don't actually use a scarf joint - the headstock is angled but it's cut from one larger piece of mahogany (which is a weaker wood than maple) and due to the way it's cut it can be prone to having grain runout just beneath the nut which is where they tend to break."
Luthier,3bit2z,BrightGuitars,5,Mon Jun 29 19:03:14 2015 UTC,People associate them with cheap '80/'90s guitars because that is what is needed for the 14-16 degree angle unless you are wasting a bunch of wood like Gibson and using one big piece.  It is actually stronger because the glue is stronger than the wood.
Luthier,3bit2z,dejoblue,2,Mon Jun 29 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Not even necessarily ""cheap"" guitars, but ones in which weak glue (or poor gluing methods) was used. A lot of those tilt-back headstocks in the 80's were made before Titebond existed, but many factories (especially in Asia) weren't using hide glue. In fact, many of them used plain old white glue (and that's a direct quote from Paul Unkert, who was the main man at Kramer back in it's 80's heyday.) Some of the factories in Japan also used epoxy, but the problem with epoxy is that it's not designed to be clamped tight like wood glues are: it's gap-filling, and doesn't soak into wood grain like white or yellow glues do. Anything much beyond light clamping pressure to hold a piece in place, and you'll squeeze most of the epoxy out of the joint. This happened a lot with Ibanez back then, and is the main reason why a lot of DIY headstock repairs fail when they're done by players who don't know any better.  One of Gibson's biggest problems is that they use an unnecessarily severe tiltback angle. Most of the headstock wood ends up basically being short lengths of endgrain, which isn't strong at all. They could fix it by simply changing their headstock angle, which would eliminate a large portion of breaks, but they'd rather stick on weird nuts and robotic tuners (that nobody wants) instead (thanks Henry.) PRS virtually eliminated the broken headstock issue, simply by going with a less severe break angle and a slightly smaller headstock; you almost never see broken PRS headstocks, whether the neck is maple or mahogany.  Paul Unkert also explained that Eddie's hockey stick headstock started as either a Fender or ""beak"" headstock. They filled the original holes and glued on some extra wood at the tip with Elmer's school glue, painted the stripes over the front (and the red stinger on the back) and redrilled new tuner holes. There's a video on Youtube of Paul giving a talk, I think it's from a Kramer collector convention or something. Pretty cool info about how those guitars were made, and it applies to a lot of the 80's guitars from Japan (a lot of the Kramer parts were made by ESP.) Kramer didn't actually manufacture guitars for a long time, they simply assembled and painted them. Their parts were manufactured by LaSiDo/Godin in Canada, an American hunting decoy manufacturer called Sports, and the ESP factory in Japan.)"
Luthier,3bit2z,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:44:15 2015 UTC,Properly made and used hide glue is also stronger than the wood. Its downside is you need a pot to warm it in and tend to have a lot of waste as you have to warm up more than is needed.  The big up side is that you can take guitars apart and put them back together if you sue hide glue. Great for repairs and neck resets.
Luthier,3bit2z,dejoblue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"Regular Titebond (Titebond I) isn't too difficult to steam apart either, although it takes a little longer than hide glue and requires more cleanup of the joint before regluing. Titebond II and (especially) Titebond III are much more difficult, because they're designed as water-resistant or waterproof. Same with polyurethane glues: once that stuff sets up, it should be considered permanent and basically non-repairable without some serious woodworking. I don't like poly glue for guitar work though, since it doesn't bring extra strength over yellow wood glue and it tends to push joints apart because it foams up as it cures. It was designed primarily as a better glue for end grain, and it also sticks really well to all sorts of other materials besides wood (like metal, stone, etc. Great for outdoor projects!)  I'm not the biggest fan of hide glue, mostly because of the reasons you mentioned: it requires heat (and monitoring of the temperature), and it sets up a little too fast for my taste. Plus the smell of it makes me gag a little, so there's that ;) . I think it's a better option than yellow glue for gluing in frets though, specifically because it dries so quickly; I personally still prefer CA over both for fretwork, but hot hide glue is a close second and it's a lot easier to clean off a fretboard compared to CA!  Fun fact: you can use plain (unflavored) Knox gelatin from the grocery store as hide glue, since it's basically the same thing. I doubt it's got the same strength, so I wouldn't advise using it for something like a neck joint, but for smaller, non-critical joints it's a convenient alternative if you're out of hide glue pellets."
Luthier,3bit2z,catdumpling,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:22:06 2015 UTC,PRS is using superglue to glue in their frets what are your thoughts on that? I don't like it simply because frets are the one thing I expect to eventually have to replace on a guitar. It reminds me of Steinberger or Parker guitars...particularly that stainless frets have become much more available and PRS doesn't offer them.
Luthier,3bit2z,dejoblue,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"Most manufacturers use CA glue on their frets these days (it used to be white, yellow or hide, but frets have been glued in for a decades, if not longer.) I use CA to glue in fret slots too, although probably not as much as PRS (who admits they flood the slot.) It doesn't make it any more difficult to remove frets, assuming you're using a soldering iron to heat the fret up (which you should, to avoid chipping the wood), but it does take longer to clean up the slots before the new wire goes in. Some careful use of acetone can make it a little easier.  As long as someone doesn't epoxy their frets in, it's generally not a big deal. PRS uses Jescar fretwire (which is the same stuff I prefer), and it's fairly hard as far as regular nickel-silver fretwire goes (although I'm not entirely convinced PRS has a ""special hard alloy"" made just for them; I think they say that because Jescar happens to be a little harder than most other wires in my experience, but I'm just guessing.) However, Paul can say what he wants, but any guitar that's played will require a refret at some point in time, probably more than once if it's nickel-silver wire.  I don't really like stainless wire, mostly because it's such a pain in the ass to install. It's great to play on, but I won't install it: I don't repair full-time and I don't think it's worth it now that EVO wire exists. Luthiers and repair techs that will refret with stainless will often charge a good 50%-100% increase, just because SS wire tends to wreck tools and is far less forgiving as far as pre-radiusing and that kind of thing goes. EVO is a copper-based wire that falls right in the middle of hardness between nickel and stainless wire (although in reality it seems to last nearly as long as stainless!) It's also hypoallergenic, which is great for people with nickel sensitivities, and it's about as easy to work with as nickel wire. If there's any downside, it's that it's expensive (relatively speaking; we're still only talking about $20 retail for enough wire to do a guitar) and it's gold-colored. Some people don't like the gold color, although once it's polished up it's a pretty pale gold and doesn't look tacky or anything. Good stuff!  One of the reasons Parker was able to work with stainless so well is because they didn't slot their fretboards and the wire was precisely made for them to simply glue on. Instead of a slot, the fretboards had a couple very shallow grooves formed into the carbon fiber, which mated with small grooves on the bottom of the fret; they didn't require hammering or pressing in, and I'd bet a skilled person could fret an entire board in a minute or two. Given how accurate Parkers are (or at least were) manufactured, it probably required very little leveling and crowning. The huge downside to that is that you can't refret a Parker the normal way: you have to get that specially-made fretwire from them, and they don't like sending it out unless you're an authorized Parker repair shop (which is fair enough, given how unique their process is.)  Another downside to Parker's method (which also affects older carbon fiber Steinbergers), is heat: any material can move if it's subjected to extreme temperature fluctuations. Carbon fiber will move when it gets hot, and that's one of the main causes of Parker frets literally just falling off (and yet another reason why leaving a guitar in a hot car is the worst idea ever.) Because their frets had no tang to slot into, once the glue lets go there's nothing else holding them on. IIRC Steinbergers did slot their fretboards, but they discovered years later that carbon fiber will, in fact, move with temperature changes; the original 'Bergers that didn't have a truss rod can end up in a bad place because of this. That kind of guitar also requires some special know-how, and honestly it's better to send it off to someone like Jeff Babicz to repair: he was one of the original Steinberger employees and worked with Ned to develop a lot of those early guitars. He's since figured out methods to repair ones that have had problems with their necks over time, and he also specializes in refretting them. He also designs some pretty nifty replacement bridges for Strats and Teles and stuff, but that's beside the point ;) .  I have owned both a Parker (a 2nd gen Nitefly, when they changed from passive to active piezos) and a Steinberger (the square paddle one), and they were both great guitars. In fact I wish I had never sold them, but such is life I suppose! I don't think Parkers have been quite the same ever since Washburn bought them out, although some of their Korean-made imports are pretty nice for the money. The Steinberger was really cool, but I got sick of tracking down double-ball strings for it; that was before you could find any string you needed online, and I don't think anyone was making string adapters at that point (late 90's, used 'Bergers were pretty affordable back then because everyone dumped them when the 90's rolled around and stuff like Fender Jaguars became popular again.) Speaking of parent companies, Gibson hasn't done Steinberger very many favors either, but that's a whole other discussion!  Anyway, sorry for being so pedantic. I suppose the TL;DR answer to your question is: yes, I think it's fine to use CA to help hold frets in place, and it can keep you from having annoying lifting fret ends or dead spots where the fret doesn't contact the fretboard."
Luthier,3bit2z,catdumpling,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"Ah I didn't know that about most manufacturers using CA glue. I am speaking from a consumer point of view and I simply love the glass-like feel of stainless and have yet to see wear on a guitar I have played as my main for 6 years now.  I have heard about the Jescar being harder I will have to check them out. Sounds like a great solution, particularly the gold frets, I noticed that Carvin is using them now.  I figured CA was great as a glue but a PITA to remove, awesome to hear it works like normal with heat. I knew Parkers didn't have tangs and this is the reason for my misconception, i assumed it must be hella hard to get off if that is all that is holding it on. I guess all of the stories of their frets falling off should have been a clue about heat too, heh.  I always wondered if Steinberger used compression fretting of any sort and I always imagined that the epoxy holding together the fibers might move, hell you were advised to not leave it in a car to get too hot.  Pedantic is good, I am the same way. Thanks for all of the info and time you took to help me understand better! :)"
Luthier,3bit2z,dejoblue,-1,Wed Jul 1 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"While the glue is specifically stronger, it is still a weak spot. The fibers have been cut on a scarf joing, unlike a neck with no joint, and can therefore break much easier, making the neck weaker"
Luthier,3bit2z,RamblingMutt,7,Mon Jun 29 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"This is not a butt joint but a scarf joint involving a huge amount of surface area as well as three pieces of wood, the neck the headstock and the fretboard.  Furthermore there are two sets of wood grain, thus adding stability, the same stability gained with a multi stringer laminated neck.  Gibsons are notorious for broken headstocks because they use one piece of wood with one grain pattern and more importantly because they have built in runout as in this comparison image, scarf top, Gibson bottom.  See how the Gibson grain just runs out and ends into air? That is the weakness. Just behind the nut where the small grain lines are is where it will break.  An analogy is trying to tear a phonebook in two, seems impossible until you separate each individual page(grain of the wood) and tear them one by one. That is the bottom Gibson neck, the top scarf join is trying to tear the whole phonebook all pages (grains) at once, it aint gonna happen, not as easily anyway."
Luthier,3bit2z,dejoblue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, there seems to be a spot of miscommunication. A fender style neck is stronger than both a scarf joint and a Gibson neck. A scarf joint is still a weak joint, it still involved end grain and gluing perpendicular to the wood fiber. It is NOT the same as laminating a neck. If the scarf joint is set back before the angle, then it is stronger than a solid stock neck with an angled paddle, but still not as strong as a fender style, quarter sawn or a laminated neck.   I am pointing this out to avoid other misconceptions, I see a lot of people (and have repaired the necks of said people) who believe a scarf joint is the strongest neck joint available. A well done angled neck or a fender style neck are are both stronger. A quick google search will show you plenty of broken flatsawn angled necks and broken scarf joints, but not many laminate necks or fender necks: https://www.google.com/search?q=broken+guitar+neck&safe=off&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=kKmRVb2gHcP2oATwzK74Bg&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&biw=1100&bih=639"
Luthier,3bit2z,RamblingMutt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"This may be a semantic misunderstanding. There is more than one way to do a scarf joint (simply an angled joint) as shown here: http://www.cigarboxnation.com/forum/topics/neck-scarf-joint-question My preference is for the second one (no. 2). You are probably repairing the first one.  It's true I've never seen a broken paddle head, but they can and do warp, and the geometry is not ideal as far as nut break angle. I'll take a well executed scarf joint (the second example) any day."
Luthier,3bit2z,BrightGuitars,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"Woodworker here.  Fender style in maple is strong.  A well-made scarf joint in any wood is very strong.  A badly-made scarf joint in any wood is weak. Gibson style is strong enough, but the short grain in the headstock is a weak point and it's not unusual for them to split.  I know a lot of players who have broken gibson headstocks.  I know one who's broken a fender bass headstock.  I haven't personally seen a broken scarf-joint headstock.  Looking at RamblingMutt's link, I don't see broken scarfs.  I see split short-grain, Gibson-style, as the most common failure.  I actually prefer the first style scarf joint. The fretboard adds a massive glue surface area.  The second has comparative weaknesses - backward force could start an end-grain split in the longer piece, and there's a lot less surface area to glue, but it's still a perfectly reasonable option, especially if there's a good veneer on the face of the headstock.  The ""end grain"" glue is not a concern here - a scarf is cut at such an oblique angle that as far as the glue is concerned, it's an edge-grain joint and strong as can be.  The only disadvantage of the first style scarf joint is that it's more work to make it."
Luthier,3bit2z,blueandroid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:57:52 2015 UTC,"In 15 years of professional guitar repair and custom building, I've seen and fixed plenty of broken Gibson headstocks, and I've seen warped Fender headstocks, and I've seen scarf joint example number 1 break a few times. Never seen any problems with example number 2. Another observation, and this is just my personal experience, is when I see example number 1 it's usually a less expensive imported guitar, and example number 2 is what most custom builders (myself included) tend to use, if they use a scarf joint. But either way, the scarf joint is definitely better than a one-piece angled back headstock."
Luthier,3bit2z,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't fault anyone for choosing either scarf joint, they're both good ways to get an angled head with long grain where its needed.  If I was going to over-engineer something, I'd consider using an undersquinted and possibly cogged scarf. It could be made  to avoid the weakest parts of each of the common scarfs.  But that's a hard joint to fit, and too much overkill.  Easier to just stop dropping guitars on their heads."
Luthier,3bit2z,blueandroid,0,Tue Jun 30 09:02:36 2015 UTC,".I'm sorry, there seems to be a spot of miscommunication. A fender style neck is stronger than both a scarf joint and a Gibson neck.

If the scarf joint is set back before the angle, then it is stronger than a solid stock neck with an angled paddle, but still not as strong as a fender style, quarter sawn or a laminated neck.   I know this. What are you talking about a scarf joint behind the nut???  Gibsons break because they are flatsawn and the extreme angle places the headstock behind the body when laid flat.  Fenders do not have an angle.  A laminated neck gets its strength from having grain going several directions, ideally with the outer sides going opposite directions, being book matched.  A scarf join also ads some stability at the joint for this reason (wood is never perfectly flat or quarter sawn)  A quartersawn Gibson would be great, but also pretty damned rare and still susceptible to breakage simply from laying it down flat because the headstock is till behind the body, lower when laid flat.  It is about grain orientation. A quartersawn scarfed joint would not change the grain at all, only introduce the scarf.  Your google link showed a plethora of broken Gibsons, ALL of them broken exactly flat with their flatsawn wood grain. There are  a few Ibanez, but they too are flatsawn with no scarf and have locking nuts mounted through the wood at the nut which is a whole other issue that causes the exact kind of breaks each of them showed.  TLDR: Quartersawn>Scarf>Flatsawn"
Luthier,3bit2z,dejoblue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:46:45 2015 UTC,It's a lot of extra steps in the process.
Luthier,3bit2z,EndlessOcean,0,Tue Jun 30 07:29:52 2015 UTC,I think one reason is that the scarf joint can become a stress concentration point and be prone to breaking. This is pretty common on Gibsons with their large headstock angles

Luthier,3bjcnx,PierreLunaire,2,Mon Jun 29 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"It's a tough mod but doable. Use a STRAIGHT sanding block so both edges of the neck are truly straight from the nut to the end of the neck. There's nothing worse than eyeballing down the side of a neck and seeing humps and dips. Also if the fret job is really good you may be able to get away with keeping the frets in and just filing/sanding them along with the wood - nickel-silver is pretty forgiving. If they don't look great (or if they happen to be stainless steel, which is much harder to work) then yes I would remove them. Good luck."
Luthier,3bjcnx,BrightGuitars,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I was thinking of marking a straight line down the front of the neck so I know where to stop sanding. Regardless, a straight sanding block is definitely in order.  I have a large piece of walnut that has been milled flat that I tape sandpaper to which I use as a large sanding block.  Good tip on the frets.  If I can get away without re-fretting then it would save me a bunch of work.

It may work if you're very skilled with this method, but it's way too easy to just burn through the finish and make everything look worse.  I learned this the hard way so just a word of caution.

Try the paint department of your hardware store or an auto body supply and tell them you're looking to get a gloss on a polyurethane finish.  And by the way you can use superglue to fill it and build it up. Then you would want to level it (I use a razor blade held perpendicular to the surface as a scraper) and then use some very fine sand papers, then the buffer."

Luthier,3bh792,TibbittsN,2,Mon Jun 29 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"If they don't buzz with that kind of gap they might buzz if you glue the ends down. The ends should have been glued down during a refret. Even if he is your friend, that's not how you do a fret job on any guitar.   On my guitars that I build I glue down all the fret ends that stick up like that. I take some medium or thin CA glue and put a drop in the fret slot in the end and clamp it down. I try and apply wax around the fret so the CA glue won't bind to the board. Otherwise you've got to clean a ton of glue off your fingerboard. Masking tape could work too.  I use spring clamps for this kind of job. I put a flat board behind the neck so I've got a flat surface to clamp to. The slot depth should be fine but definitely make sure there's room below the tang to press the fret down flat.   The biggest issue I could see is that this should have been done before the frets were leveled and crowned. If you end up gluing the frets down and have height issues, you're going to have to relevel and recrown the frets. Since they've been leveled and dressed, you're kind of doing a step back."

You can literally make the body out of papier mache and it will sound good, the woods you use for the body are almost entirely cosmetic.  If youre making an electric just use whatever the hell timber you want, the sound is in the hardware."

Luthier,3becs9,idamay,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"not really true.  You're paying for high quality very well quartered wood (depending on your source I suppose) when you buy higher grade. This usually means tight grain, but not always. The money saved on a cheap top simply isn't worth it considering the amount of time and effort that you need to put in to the guitar. This is even more true if you're buying online and don't have a chance to examine the top before you buy. Most serious luthiers will hand pick tops."
Luthier,3becs9,Clockwork_Monkey,2,Sun Jun 28 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest for a beginning luthier, even if they are a skilled woodworker, the money spent on a very high quality top is unlikely  to be realized in acoustic performance; you will likely need to build several instruments before build quality will showcase the differences (and suggest that as many things in lutherie these differences and what makes them are often hotly debated). The lowest grade that LMII sell isn't that bad - there are several levels below that commonly used in (factory) guitars. The differentiation between the top couple grades (eg between master and 3A is almost wholly cosmetic - which players and purchasers will pay more for but where debate on the acoustic merits is often unresolved. for some producers the differences in these grades is mostly color).  To the OP - to better answer the question - what do you want your guitar to do, e.g. how do you want it to sound? Steel String dreadnought, parlor, classical, archtop, electrical? Every manner of wood has been used in guitars - and some are better than others to replicate a certain sound - the ""typical"" US dreadnought is/was adirondack or sitka spruce w/rosewood back and a mahogany neck. A classical guitar might be European Spruce or Western Red Cedar and a rosewood back/sides. A flamenco might have a european top and a cypress or yellow cedar back/sides. There are all mahogany or all koa guitars for some sounds. maple back/sides have been used in many guitars both classical (Torres used it) or for modern Archtops and many places in between. Because the preferred Rosewood - brasilian - is now hard to find there are all manner of substitutes proposed and used like Bubinga."

Luthier,3becs9,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"I worked for several years in the shop of a floor company, I made several guitars from wood they had discarded, usually because of sapwood, which looks cool on the back of a guitar.   All of those woods are excellent for neck, sides, and body.  They each add some different character to the sound, but the sound mostly depends on the top.  Stick with spruce or cedar for the top.  Martin has made, (in past, not sure if they still make them) guitars entirely from some kind of mahogany.  They are generally not the most highly esteemed Martins.  I think Koa can also be used for tops as well as sides/back."

Luthier,3becs9,idamay,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:33:05 2015 UTC,"the biggest issue with the top is that it should be quartersawn. this gives it the strength and tonal qualities that make it good for stringed instrument tops. since it's rare to find wide pieces of quartersawn softwood in any circles other than luthiery, it's hard to stray from the luthier suppliers. that being said, there's a famous example of bob taylor making a guitar from a pallet, in which case he joined many sections of softwood that had quartersawn grain that were cut from ordinary flatsawn 2x4s"
Luthier,3becs9,BrightGuitars,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"If you want to use all the same wood for the body, I would use (from your list) Mahogany or Sapele. They are some of the softer back/side woods so they work well for tops too (which you want to vibrate a lot). If you go with a Spruce top, you certainly don't need to get the best AAAAA grade tops. It's much more about how you brace and voice it than the ""A"" rating. AA would be fine. The Taylor Pallet guitar is a great example. If your methods are sound, you can get great results from just about anything. Do your research, ask questions, and have fun. And remember, there is no ""right"" sound, and bad for you might be good for me."
Luthier,3becs9,blueandroid,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"The stiffness-to-weight ratio of the top is really important for volume.  You want most of the top surface of the instrument to vibrate back and forth to produce sound. It has to be light or the vibration of the string won't move it very far, and the sounds will be quiet.  It should be stiff except around the edges. If it's not stiff, it will deform under string tension, and if you somehow stave off that problem, the vibration won't carry as far.  Spruce and Cedar and other softwoods are used for tops because of the stiffness to weight ratio.  Quartersawn pieces with no runout are chosen because of stiffness.  Grain goes parallel to strings for a bunch of reasons, but one of them is that it's stiffer in the direction that needs to resist string tension. Braces are stiff in the center and flexible near the edges to maintain top stiffness while still allowing it to move. You could make an acoustic with a maple top, and it will work, but for it to be stiff enough, it will probably need to be heavier than an equivalent piece of spruce, so it'll be relatively quiet."
Luthier,3becs9,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"Maple and mahogany are both used occasionally for steel string tops, but it's not something I'd do.   For the back and sides it's not going to make or break the guitar, but it will make a subtle difference to the sound of the guitar. 85% top and 15% back and sides is about right for ""tone production"".  If you're building for yourself, I'd probably go with the maple or mahogany. The extra weight and hardness of rosewood makes for a great sounding instrument as sound is focused onto the top, but there will be less sound coming through to the player, with a softer wood, you'll get a bit more sound resonating through the back and sides giving the guitar a slightly warmer sound and giving the player more feedback."
Luthier,3becs9,juliankoster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:21:28 2015 UTC,The all mahogany (0-sized)  guitar I built sounded great. I've wanted to try sapele for a while too.
Luthier,3bd66r,Sir_Baconhamo,4,Sun Jun 28 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"Technically you should be able to yeah, but you'd probably have to move the bridge to account for the scale length of the neck, and possibly widen the neck pocket for the new neck in question to fit."
Luthier,3bd66r,mrthrowawaywild,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"And even then, the pickup might not be in the ideal place.  Long story short: it won't be as easy as swapping necks to make it good sounding, playable guitar. Unless you're doing it for fun, it's probably not worth the effort."
Luthier,3bd66r,IndependentBoof,3,Sun Jun 28 06:15:13 2015 UTC,"If you can find a neck that matches the neck pocket (or the neck pocket can be modified to accept the neck) and when attached the distance from the nut to the 12th fret is slightly less than the distance from the 12th fret to the bridge, then yes.  If you can move the bridge to make that true, then yes.  Otherwise, no -- it won't intonate correctly."

Luthier,3bd66r,wdmcarth,2,Sun Jun 28 08:03:58 2015 UTC,As others said you'll need to make sure the neck is the correct length and might have to move the bridge which will leave a couple of holes in your guita and change the sound. Also a longer neck will change the sound and feel of your instrument
Luthier,3bd66r,tommytickturd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"Likely not, unless you want to put on a neck with a similar scale length. The length between the nut and the 12th fret must be the same as the length between the 12th fret and the bridge. You don't have much play behind the bridge to move it back to account for a larger scale length."

Luthier,3bdmny,piza305,2,Sun Jun 28 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"That's a fairly difficult repair to execute, even in a professional shop setting.  Typically, I would razor all the cracks off with a curved x-acto blade, build up the divot with cyano glue, touch up the white with the original paint,  build up the top coat with more cyano, then sand and buff.    Most of the time, it doesn't turn out flawless and looking new.  You can usually see some anomaly in at least one layer.  I'm guessing that you're concerned with how it feels more than how it looks.  If that's the case, you can fill the dent with cyano glue, sand it level, and buff it out.  You'll still see the cracks, but you won't feel it when you play (assuming you do it right).  I'm sure there's a Stew Mac video of the process that makes it look way too easy.  But, you'll at least get an idea of the method.    One tip I can give you is to find Glu Boost brand accelerant.  It's by far the best stuff I've used and is a major factor in how the glue cures.    The glue itself can be any brand; I haven't found any major differences between them.  Any thin viscosity cyano glue carried at a hobby store and not at Home Depot will work."

Luthier,3be14j,headjuice,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:43:07 2015 UTC,When you say metallic sound are you referring to the way a sitar sounds? If the strings are making a sitar sound then the nut slots are either too deep or filed at the wrong angle.
Luthier,3be14j,mdg777,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:42:08 2015 UTC,I think so! If I were to replace the nut do you think it could possibly fix the problem ?
Luthier,3be14j,mdg777,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:14:09 2015 UTC,If I had to put money on it I would say that problem is the nut. And replacing it with a properly filed nut should solve this issue.

If the shop you took it to didn't fix it the first time then I'd suggest taking it back and having them complete the job. If they are incapable then politely take it to a luthier or tech who can.
Luthier,3be14j,EndlessOcean,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Have a look at your saddles and/or nut. Grab some sandpaper, 400 grit or so. Fold it in half and sand the slots at the bridge and the nut. Their could be some burrs, crud, dirt, anything else in there which is causing a problem. Sand it out. It's worth a go."

Luthier,3be14j,shredtilldeth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:10:36 2015 UTC,something is amiss if the shop didn't say anything to you if it plays like that after they set it up. either the set up should have fixed it or they would have noticed some other sort of problem and brought it up to you before just handing you the guitar back.

Luthier,3be14j,lightsource1808,0,Sun Jun 28 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"Playing style and technique have a lot to do with how buzzy a guitar can be. My bass has everything nice and level and I still get buzzes on it because I have a heavy right hand. The epiphone didn't really sound that bad from what I could hear, though the recording wasn't very clear to me. Concentrate on your technique a little and see if that clears things up. It could save you some $ and you'll be better for it.  Things like this are only really important if it happens when playing through an amp. If it's not that bad then, it's probably something subtle. The epiphone is probably a shorter scale, which means the strings will be slightly looser (floppier? bendier?). Maybe being unfamiliar with how the strings respond at that scale length is causing the buzzes. Maybe you should use higher action for a while until you know this guitar a little better. I'm done rambling for now. This may or may not be helpful...."
Luthier,3becb6,bokuwa,3,Sun Jun 28 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"That block is more than likely made of pot metal (which is shit). The block is what the bar actually screws into. If you replaced it with a better material (brass, steel) block you shouldn't have to worry anymore about it."
Luthier,3becb6,shredtilldeth,3,Sun Jun 28 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"This is correct. A lot of MIM Fenders have zinc blocks, which are soft (as far as metal goes.) They're notorious for stripping out.  There are lots of places that sell upgrade blocks, but you'll just need to make sure they fit an MIM Strat, which is a slightly different size than an MIA bridge would take. I personally don't think brass is a good idea for screw-in arms, because it's also a relatively soft metal (although not nearly as much as zinc) and will end up stripping out too. Steel is going to be your best bet, with Callaham probably being the nicest ones available (although not cheap, IIRC they're around $60 just for the block!)  I thought Fender was making steel blocks to retrofit MIM bridges, but I could be wrong. At any rate, Google ""mim strat trem block upgrade"" should pull up quite a few sellers, and prices usually range from about $20 up."

Luthier,3bc61d,XxSCRAPOxX,-2,Sun Jun 28 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"Homestly, I see why your mad, but the guitar basically could use a new nut. Those gouges.... I mean they didn't really hurt anything.

Make him buy you a new neck, not that big a deal, probably costs about what you paid for the repair. Should have just swapped from the beginning IMO."

Luthier,3bc61d,PluckyMann,7,Sun Jun 28 04:51:19 2015 UTC,"The fretboard damage could be filled with sawdust, preferably rosewood and superglue. Build it up then scrape flat with a razorblade and sand maybe starting at 220 and go up to maybe 1200-1500. Finishing with linseed oil to shine.  The nut can be replaced or if the nut height is at a good spot you can file the nut down from the top to get the string depth right. Then polished. Or take it to a reputable shop."
Luthier,3bc61d,watteva,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I figured it could be something like that.  This is a Tusq nut, that was pre-slotted when new.  Is it appropriate to file/polish those down from the top?  What is the preferred technique for fitting at the nut?"
Luthier,3bc61d,legolili,2,Sun Jun 28 03:11:15 2015 UTC,"You're probably better off replacing the nut, from the pic it looks like he might have put some weird angle on the slots judging by the damage caused. You want a back angle but not that steep, its hard to tell from the pic alone though. But to sand it down I use a file to get it close then finish with sandpaper and then micromesh to polish. Like you said string should be 1/2 to 1/3 in slot depth. And tusq works quite easily, its like bone but more dense and consistent."
Luthier,3bc61d,Clockwork_Monkey,2,Sun Jun 28 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"You can lower the nut height by either sanding the bottom or deepening the slots then sand the top so the strings protrude a little.  At this point you need a new nut, this one is junk now."
Luthier,3bc61d,watteva,7,Sun Jun 28 11:41:22 2015 UTC,"How the hell does that even happen? Sure, they might make an honest mistake once. Lose concentration (not a great excuse when working on someone elses guitar), slip with the saw (not the right tool for the job anyway). ONCE. Who cuts the first one, sees the huge gouge behind the nut and thinks ""yep, just like the textbook says. Let's do that 4 more times!"". This boggles my mind. I am boggled.   I also think you're being far too charitable referring to the guy as a 'tech'. I'd maybe call him 'guy who's read a couple forum pages', or 'guy who hates guitars'."

It's all fixable, with a little work, the fretboard repairs would look close to invisible. It will need a new nut, and I'd be surprised if the frets were properly crowned, so you might as well add a full setup to the list.  If it's possible to leave feedback where you got his details from, warn others."
Luthier,3bc61d,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:46:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I'm hoping it can be fixed to the point of not being noticeable.

Luthier,3bc61d,shredtilldeth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:12:55 2015 UTC,"It's a good job he didn't, fretwork takes even more precision than a nut setup. You'd be looking at a refret or a new neck if he's attempted it."

Luthier,3bc61d,WillyTheDisk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:48:53 2015 UTC,The scratch on the back is the most complicated to get gone. The fretboard gouges are actually pretty easy to fix and a new nut and setup isn't that expensive.
Luthier,3bc61d,Butthooker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"Getting fretboard leveled? Costs 200$ by me.  New nut 30-50$   The scratch on the back you can fill with a wax pencil and buff, literally invisible.   If that were my guitar, of which I have a lot of sentimental value as I'm sure op does as well, I would have beat the brakes off the guy who did that unless he showed up with it fully repaired , had all my money, and was offering to buy me a new guitar."
Luthier,3bdcx9,ozone_00,2,Sun Jun 28 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"That uh...is a pretty wide open question. Without knowing anything about the place or the boards it's made out of, the best advice I can offer is, keep an eye out for old nails, screws, and staples stuck in the wood. They can potentially ruin the tools you use. Also be careful about mold, fungus, and rot. While spalted wood looks cool, it can potentially be hazardous to your health (especially the sawdust) and rotten wood might not be strong enough to use in the first place. Other than that, I guess grab the thickest and straightest pieces you can."
Luthier,3bdcx9,agentjones,0,Sun Jun 28 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm... well it's an old farm house in Northwest Ohio, and is probably at least 100 years old (county auditor's site says 1900, but I think that's just a guestimation). The floors are some kind of hardwood, but I don't know about the framing. Do I have to worry if the boards/beams are or quarter sawn?"
Luthier,3bdcx9,legolili,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"The short answer is - Grab whatever you want, and whatever you think will look good.   Long answer - Obviously you want to avoid any treated timber, since you don't want to be breathing in that dust while you work with it. Any pine decking or verandah timber will likely be treated, as will anything that comes in contact with the ground. You can usually tell by the colour. Treated pine will have a blue or greenish tinge, and should have stamps listing what it's treated with. It might also be worth investing in a small metal detector. You can get handheld ones for pretty cheap. It'll help you find any stray nails or staples that aren't visible by eye. Nothing worse than hitting a bit of metal and leaving a big chip in the blade of your plane/thicknesser/jointer. Apart from that, it really comes down to aesthetics and weight.  You could come up with some really unique designs by using material with nail holes and cracks and filling the gaps with clear resin.   Don't overthink it. If you can find some material that you can clean up and laminate together to make a guitar-body sized piece, then you're good. Maybe you'll find some oregon pine weatherboards, alternate that light material with strips of dark hardwood, and use that as a top piece over a body of plain pine to minimize weight. It's a very cool idea."
Luthier,3bdkxp,stuckenthemud,2,Sun Jun 28 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"Pulling the frets without tearing the edges of the slots to bits requires 30 dollar fret pullers or wire cutters ground down to squeeze under the fret. Or save the bits and glue the wood back after it's torn up.  You should also heat the frets with a soldering iron to weaken the glue used to hold them in place. Again, this helps avoid tearing up the slots.  Fill the slots well as the gaps weaken the neck and affect your setup and straightness, and most any missing bits of wood will harm the playing surface.  The slots can be filled with wood putty (5-10 dollars), epoxy+sawdust (5-10 dollars), or similarly sized veneer and superglue(10-30 dollars). You can oil the fingerboard for a woody tone with less sustain, like an upright bass, or pour on hard 2-part marine grade epoxy like Jaco for more ""mwah"" and sustain.   Release the truss rod and flat-sand from the nut up to the 17th/19th fretline or so, then put a 1/16th inch stack of masking tape at the 12th fret so you can tilt your sanding block a little and sand a slight ""ramp"" from the neck joint down to the end of the fingerboard. The fingerboard needs to slope slightly after the neck joint because there is always a kink in the playing surface caused by the change in the thickness/rigidity of the neck where it bolts/glues to the body.  Make sure you get nut files (60-120 dollars) and deepen the string slots (to compensate for fret removal), and have what tools you need to adjust the truss rod and bridge for less bow in the neck, lower saddles, and possibly different intonation."
Luthier,3bdkxp,nonoahah,2,Sun Jun 28 08:51:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of this sounds great. For the nut, you can also remove it and sand the underside down, correct? Two different approaches, but this way doesn't require buying but files. Obviously not perfect, but should get OP 90-95% of the way there."
Luthier,3bdkxp,tonylowe,2,Sun Jun 28 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"If the nut is already slotted correctly, then yes, you can sand the bottom of the nut to lower its overall height. You'd need to be careful and check it often, to make sure you're not sanding the bass or treble side too much, but it'll work."
Luthier,3bdkxp,catdumpling,2,Mon Jun 29 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, sanding a frets-worth off the bottom of the nut obviates the need for nut files. Not easy if it's a radius-bottom nut though."

Luthier,3bdkxp,tonylowe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"not sure who uses it, i'm a plate glass sanding block user personally, radiused blocks seem limiting if you want a conical or nonstandard radius."
Luthier,3bdkxp,nonoahah,2,Mon Jun 29 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"I would avoid wood putty (because it's usually not very hard and tends to shrink a lot when it dries), and probably epoxy too (because it's not actually as hard as some people think it is.) Birch veneer with Titebond or Gorilla wood glue (not the polyurethane stuff!) would be a good option and not terribly expensive. Epoxy should be okay with veneer strips, which will take up the bulk of the slot. Birch veneer can be bought from Woodcraft for under $20 a sheet, which will be way more than enough for one bass neck; they even sell it pre-dyed in various colors, if OP wants to match the fretboard wood.  Another option for filling the fret slots is PVC or ABS plastic strips, the same stuff used for binding. That may require the use of a plastic solvent adhesive instead, but it would be cheaper than wood veneer and just as easy to work with. OP would need to measure the width of the fret slots with feeler gauges, and buy binding that was the same thickness, or slightly thinner.  I'd also suggest a radius sanding block, which will make life a lot easier as far as leveling the filler strips and making sure the fretboard radius is even. StewMac has radius sanding blocks, but they can be had cheaper at several other places. OP will need to know the radius of his fretboard though (unless he doesn't mind changing it, in which case any radius in the 9.5"" to 14"" range should work nicely.)  Fret pullers can be made pretty easily with a pair of $4 small end nippers and a grinder (or a Dremel with grinding stone), plus a file to smooth the face. This is one time when the cheap Harbor Freight stuff comes in handy: their cutters are often made of metal that hasn't been heat-treated (at least not properly), so it's easy to grind the face of some end nippers flush. Unless OP plans on doing a lot more fretwork, this will be perfectly adequate and will only cost a few bucks and a little free time to grind the face of the nippers flush.  One more suggestion for OP: if you're looking for more ""mwah"", you might consider trying flat-wound or half-wound strings and see if that gets you somewhere. It wouldn't require any work besides changing a set of strings, and you might be happy to leave it at that. Just a suggestion.  Lastly, Jaco claimed that he did the conversion on his bass...except it's now accepted that he may very well have bought that bass with the conversion already done. Jaco was a great player, but he also had an ego and was known to embellish stories to make himself look better. If the previous owner was indeed the one that did the fretless conversion, then Jaco would probably have had no idea what was used on the fretboard and it could've been anything from epoxy to varnish. Obviously if Jaco had had the fretboard refinished while he owned the bass then he would've known, though, so take that for what you will."

Luthier,3bdkxp,nonoahah,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"Strings should be low enough that the can be fingered easilly but not buzz. if you go too low get a shim for the nut.   You can't sand the fingerboard level from end to end because the neck bows unevenly, specifically only up to the neck joint. If there is fingerboard past the neck joint, then that area will stay flat while the rest if the neck bows under string tension. So after the neck joint you need to ""sand some relief"" so the strings dont buzz where the fingerboard suddenly stops bowing.   Hope that helps."

Luthier,3bdkxp,cpeck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"right. sanding the whole fingerboard with a bit of bow in the neck will effectively sand the ramp, but could also lower the fingerboard at the nut and mess with the action there. I like to flatten the fingerboard with no tension in the truss rod so that I have a fixed reference point."
Luthier,3bdkxp,HighStu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:58:09 2015 UTC,"It's really not too expensive, just pull out the frets and fill them with a hard epoxy. Let the epoxy dry and then sand the neck smooth, refinish the wood and you're done."
Luthier,3bdkxp,cpeck,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:02:49 2015 UTC,Hmm... You are forgetting an extensive setup to have it playing right... IF you can even use the same bridge.
Luthier,3bdkxp,catdumpling,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:18:18 2015 UTC,I did it to my old zz ryder and it plays great with the same bridge.. we also did it with an old mock strat except we put a mirror the finger board to help the smaller strings not be muffled. We still used the same bridge and it was great.
Luthier,3bc1l8,beamerweb,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"Now that the neck is on, we tackle flushing the bout up with the body. After that, it's time to take care of that little issue with the body being just slightly too narrow for the fretboard."
Luthier,3bcrv1,TheWordFromMars,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:07:12 2015 UTC,I'm getting one of these this week. I'm planning on fitting it in my drill press to press my frets in. If it works out I could let you know!
Luthier,3bcrv1,subutai09,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:51:10 2015 UTC,I bought a skil drill press on amazon for $120 and I use that with the stewmac fret press caul. Some thin CA glue will wick right in.
Luthier,3bcrv1,subutai09,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:38:06 2015 UTC,Is it normal for a hammer to not work well?
Luthier,3bcrv1,subutai09,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:26:59 2015 UTC,"I've had good results with a hammer in the past, but I was re fretting a guitar with an ebony fretboard and it wasn't working very well so I got the press. It probably has something to do with the width/depth of the fret slot and the size of the fret tang. Maybe the type of wood matters too. I like the consistency of the press. There are no gaps under any of the frets, and minimal fretwork to do later on."
Luthier,3bcrv1,EndlessOcean,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:41:45 2015 UTC,The 2 necks I tried were maple and rosewood. Would a small bench like press suffice? I don't even know if they exist but I'm going to look around. I wonder if some kind of vice setup might work?
Luthier,3bcrv1,Belou84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"I bet you could make it work in a vice if you made a clamping caul to protect the back of the neck and another one the same radius as the fretboard. See if you can get the fret to go back down and if it does, then wick the thin superglue in."

Luthier,3baprt,EndlessOcean,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"Hey man  A new bridge will not make a difference, it is the neck position  You will probably get away with taking the neck off, filling the holes and refitting it properly  When you re fit it, before you clamp it use an old string and place it on the nut and bridge on either e to make sure that they run true down the neck - once you are happy it is straight and centred, clamp it and off you go  If it still doesn't line up over the pickup, measure your string spacing and get a new pickup"

Luthier,3b8qpf,xoarar,2,Fri Jun 26 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean, exactly, but there are loads of acoustic pickup preamps that have built-in tuners, as well as sound hole tuners."
Luthier,3b8qpf,catdumpling,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:29:47 2015 UTC,"I bought a lower end martin that has a preamp but not a tuner, and the onboard tuner was one of the things that I find most useful in an acoustic guitar. I was wondering if anyone has tried to buy just the digital tuner and install it themselves.  Something like this would be great, except it's not meant to stay on the guitar. I was thinking maybe some sort of clip on tuner but mounted permanently just inside the sound hole so that you could look down at it would be great."
Luthier,3b8qpf,catdumpling,2,Fri Jun 26 22:41:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the Rim Pitch isn't any less ""permanent"" than jimmy-rigging a clip on tuner into the soundhole. It's meant to stay in the soundhole, it's just not mounted with a ""permanent"" adhesive or screws (which you wouldn't really want to do anyway, because that area tends to be thin and somewhat vunerable.)  I dunno, maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're after, because the Rim Pitch seems to be exactly what you're looking for."
Luthier,3b8qpf,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:24:32 2015 UTC,"I guess I thought that sound hole tuner like the Rim Pitch were temporary, to be taken out once the guitar is tuned up. mainly i don't want anything to be visible to anyone except me, which the Rim Pitch doesn't really offer."
Luthier,3b8qpf,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:29:32 2015 UTC,"Soundhole tuners like the Rim Pitch are meant to be left in. They go inside the soundhole, so nobody else will really notice it. The Shadow Sonic Tuner is less noticeable (there's no lip that hangs outside the soundhole) and would be invisible to everyone but you, although it's twice as much as the Rim Pitch. The pic on the MF website isn't great, but if you do a Google search for photos, you can see the Sonic Tuner is pretty stealthy."
Luthier,3b725r,cmasc966,12,Fri Jun 26 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"Those look to be just finish cracks, probably nothing to worry about if you don't care how it looks. As long as the guitar plays the same as it did before you dropped it I wouldn't think twice about it."

Luthier,3b725r,catdumpling,3,Fri Jun 26 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that those just look like finish cracks. If you want to try to hide them, you could wick a little bit of thin CA glue into the cracks, but that stuff is ridiculously messy and you'll probably still have a lot to cleanup. Honestly, if they don't bother you to look at, I'd just leave them alone unless you start having problems.  Gibsons (and Epis) tend to have weak headstock joints, so just keep an eye on that area for a little while to make sure the crack isn't in the wood and getting bigger. Next time you change strings, carefully flex the headstock back just a bit and look to see if the crack is in the wood. I doubt it is, but better to find out sooner rather than later and get that fixed if it's the case."
Luthier,3b725r,MattieTheSpud,3,Fri Jun 26 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"Would, however, recommend taking the nut off just to make sure they're only finish cracks."
Luthier,3b7r2k,holladaddy,4,Fri Jun 26 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"The router bit they use on the machine that makes these neck pockets has a larger radius than the neck heel's corners. They route a little into the body to give enough room in the neck pocket for a neck without having to change bits. It's a sacrifice to make the routing process cheaper and faster, and arguably doesn't affect the quality of the finished instrument."
Luthier,3b7r2k,ringolio,2,Sat Jun 27 03:08:03 2015 UTC,They're removing material that isn't necessary to do so. It is shoddy workmanship at best.
Luthier,3b7r2k,shredtilldeth,3,Sat Jun 27 04:41:09 2015 UTC,Normal. You'll see these on import Fenders.
Luthier,3b7r2k,wdmcarth,2,Fri Jun 26 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"Can't believe they never even brushed the sawdust away from the pickguard holes before the picture.  The neck pocket may be routed that way so you can fit a 22 fret neck that doesn't use an overhang, simply by routing that centre tongue out."
Luthier,3b7r2k,Mark_McQ,3,Fri Jun 26 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"You don't need to route anything for a neck with an overhang because it, well, overhangs. The extra fretboard is an extension, past where the neck heel stops.  The reason Fender makes their neck pockets like this is to allow easier neck fitting at the factory. By removing the corner areas, there's a lot less to worry about as far as inconsistencies with contact go...if that makes sense?  Also, they can use larger router bits on the CNC machines, which allows faster cutting and less risk of breaking (very expensive) CNC bits."
Luthier,3b7r2k,catdumpling,3,Fri Jun 26 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"You don't need to route anything for a neck with an overhang because it, well, overhangs. The extra fretboard is an extension, past where the neck heel stops.   That would be why I mentioned a 22 fretboard ""that doesn't use an overhang""."
Luthier,3b7r2k,Mark_McQ,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"You can't have a 22-fret neck without an overhang and still be in Fender spec, the math won't work out. In other words, if you have a 22-fret neck without an overhang, then it would throw off the scale length measurements and at the very least a Fender bridge would be in the wrong place."
Luthier,3b7r2k,catdumpling,2,Fri Jun 26 22:34:30 2015 UTC,That's why I had suggested perhaps the centre piece may have been to accomodate such necks. Many companies do 22 fret necks with a Fender heel and no overhang.
Luthier,3b7r2k,Mark_McQ,-1,Fri Jun 26 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"Although they may have the same measurements as a Fender heel, those types of 22-fret necks wouldn't be a drop-in fit on a Fender body as far as the bridge is concerned. All drop-in necks with 22 (or 24) frets, from companies like Warmoth and USACG, have an overhang. Fender didn't make that spot in the pocket for that type of thing, and typically modifying the neck pocket is the least-preferred option as far as swapping necks is concerned."
Luthier,3b7r2k,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:21:49 2015 UTC,That seems to make the most sense. It just would make me nervous throwing my 21 fret neck on there and not having it fit snugly.   I'm surprised how little discussion there is around these neck pockets. I see a lot of listings on eBay that have it. Mostly from Stratosphere.
Luthier,3b7r2k,HighStu,2,Fri Jun 26 19:13:15 2015 UTC,I've seen some like this before. Its meant for a neck with an overhanging fretboard. I believe they do that for a more 1-size-fits-all neck pocket so the corner of the neck don't bind up against the body.
Luthier,3b7r2k,shredtilldeth,2,Fri Jun 26 19:14:08 2015 UTC,Hm. Yeah that would make sense too. I just feel like it'd be unstable. None of these listings seem to specify that unfortunately.
Luthier,3b7r2k,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Fri Jun 26 19:27:11 2015 UTC,Oh while I'm at it  http://i.imgur.com/fZYIGJG.jpg  Do the holes drilled where the pickguard would go serve a purpose? I see them in a ton of listings.
Luthier,3b7r2k,arakele,2,Fri Jun 26 17:32:34 2015 UTC,"That is a ""router pin locating hole."" The other one is usually in the neck pocket.  Basically it allows a machine to come down and clamp it while the cnc does it's routing. It is unnecessary and I consider it hackery. Anytime you remove wood unnecessarily you've sacrificed a bit of the quality of the entire job."
Luthier,3b7r2k,XxSCRAPOxX,-1,Sat Jun 27 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"Predrilled holes for the pick guard to avoid wood splitting. This body is used however. I'm sure t would work, but no, that's not how the neck pocket should look. Idk why it's like that. Terrible routing?"
Luthier,3b7r2k,shredtilldeth,2,Fri Jun 26 18:22:53 2015 UTC,Those are MIM crop circles for the CNC machine. Also the neck pocket is a universal CNC neck pocket used on a lot of fender bodies. It allows the use of tele or strat heels and flush or overhang fretboards. Fender has been doing this on all MIM standard bodies and some AM Std for years.
Luthier,3b7r2k,XxSCRAPOxX,-2,Fri Jun 26 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"Odd, have worked on maybe hundreds. Never seen anything like it. The tightness of the pocket is what connects the neck to the body. I wouldn't buy a guitar that was this poorly made. Good thing I don't have any fenders anymore I guess. Never liked em anyway. Uncomfortable, and sound like shit."
Luthier,3b7r2k,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that every Fender sounds like shit, but yes, their workmanship is overall very disappointing."
Luthier,3b7r2k,MattieTheSpud,-2,Sat Jun 27 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I take it back. My uncles Mia sounds beautiful. I'm a metal head, the single coils aren't great for it, but they work for punk. I don't like the tele twang either, but it's all just personal bs anyway.   Fenders started to give me carpal tunnel this year, I got rid of all mine, the gibsons don't do it, I have no idea why.  And he weird part is it was in my strumming hand which is really uncommon. Something about the body shape and how my arm rested over it I think. But after all these years I can even get through a song in one without pain and losing feeling in half my hand. Random as fuck, 30 years no issues then one day it was like I got struck by lightning in the hand."
Luthier,3b7r2k,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"Oh no I get that, I was referring to the much larger hole that's gouged out of the body. Some of these listings have several of these."
Luthier,3b7r2k,WhitzEnd00,3,Fri Jun 26 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"You'll see those on pretty much all MIM Fender bodies, they've always been that way. Lots of people have asked Fender why they're there, and Fender has given slightly different answers over the years (with ""that's how the CNC holds the body down"" being the most common.) Personally, I think they're purposely put there simply to prove that it's a Mexico-made body, rather than a US-made one (which don't have those holes.) In other words, a way to keep a shady person from trying to pass the body off as US-made when it's not."
Luthier,3b6kcv,SmilinDreamer,2,Fri Jun 26 11:25:40 2015 UTC,1) It's a sound chamber so it makes sound. It helps the guitar produce louder sound acoustically/unplugged. 2) Very good way of cutting down weight from a solid body guitar. This makes for happy shoulders. 3)  Soundholes on an electric guitar just look badass.
Luthier,3b6kcv,bassmakingdude,2,Fri Jun 26 13:04:40 2015 UTC,"bassmakingdude nailed it. In my experience and opinion #2 - weight reduction - is the biggest benefit.  I would just add for clarification, based on the way you worded your question, that you don't just carve the hole into the body. You chamber the body (different models are chambered differently as far as how much meat is removed where and how thin the back and sides end up) and then you glue the top on over this chambered body. The sound hole is cut out of the top and reveals the chambered area."
Luthier,3b31ml,BigDGuitars,2,Thu Jun 25 15:48:18 2015 UTC,What kind of clearcoat was on that thing? The stripper seemed to make really good work of it. I'm asking for future reference. I've got an old SG I'm thinking of breathing life back into.

Luthier,3b51vy,Kingmezs23,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"I kinda butted my way into his shop. In exchange for emptying the vacuum, rough re-sawing and thickness sanding, he advised me on projects and let me use parts of his shop. I put in maybe 10 hours a week while I was at college. I'm sure I wasted a bunch of his time and money, even though I wasn't paid.  I studied with Fred Carlson as well, who charges an hourly tutelage fee that is well worth it."
Luthier,3b18yl,DrBobMoog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"For the nut - just make sure it doesn't move at all and is nice and snug. Glue it, wedge it in with shims, or both. Any movement translates to loss of vibrational energy, which decreases volume and sustain.  How thick is the headstock? I generally go for about 0.55"" headstock thickness for standard tuners. You do have to be careful with one-piece mahogany necks that you don't weaken them, especially directly under the nut which is generally the weakest point, but you should be able to get away with removing a little meat. Just stop as soon as you can and as far from the nut as you can."
Luthier,3b18yl,BrightGuitars,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"Your nut should be snug up against the fretboard or it may be very difficult to intonate.  For this particular guitar, planing a few mm off the back would probably be fine if you know what you're doing."
Luthier,3b18yl,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:09:54 2015 UTC,I would carefully plane and sand the top of the headstock down until it is level with the nut base to start with. It looks like only one or two millimeters from the photo. Then remove enough material on the back of the headstock to fit your tuners.
Luthier,3b18yl,ShutUpTurkey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a photo of what the other side of the nut should look like after sanding for machineheads but keeping some material under the nut, on a 3x3 style neck:  http://static.musicbusiness.fr/media/catalog/product/cache/7/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/p/epiphone-les-paul-ace-frehley-budokan-custom-enaffcnh1-4_1.jpg"
Luthier,3b09fm,thefranchise23,3,Wed Jun 24 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"Warmoth is a very good neck. You could probably get a good neck from StewMac or even Amazon and probably be happy with it.   Everything you need? Tell me what you want to build, and I can give you a list."
Luthier,3b09fm,RamblingMutt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll make a list of what I have planned:  -Prs custom 24 body shape, hopefully a curly maple top with mahogany body.  thinking about trying to make it look like this (same finish and natural back, but prs body shape)-http://www.themusiczoo.com/images/6-09-14/19757_Les_Paul_Classic_SFG_2014_140070818_1.jpg  -Warmoth maple neck (do you think it would be better to get one from stewmac or amazon?)  -pickups - not 100% sure yet, but seymour duncan P-rails look cool.. they supposedly can get p90, normal single coil, and humbucker sounds.  -Bridge and tailpiece - I don't need a tremolo, so I was planning on getting an adjustable bridge like my les paul studio.  I don't know if something else would be better.  -Knobs/switches - If I do get P-rails, then I need toggle switches for the pickups as well as a pickup selector switch.  Alternatively, I could possibly get these for the p-rails: http://www.seymourduncan.com/products/accessories/triple-shot-mou/triple_shot_swi//  I like the 4-knob layout on my les paul, but I'm not sure if I actually need that many knobs.     I'm probably forgetting things but this is what I though of"
Luthier,3b09fm,RamblingMutt,2,Thu Jun 25 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"Necks: It really depends on the quality you have to have. Is it your first guitar build? Are you an experienced player? If you go to a guitar shop, do you notice a difference between the necks on high end vs low end guitars? Warmoth is amazing because you can customize almost every aspect of the neck to your liking, including inlays, etc. It that is important to you, there's no substitute save paying someone like me lots more money to build you a custom neck. StewMac makes excellent necks, but there is not much you can customize. Amazon sells reproduction necks, so if you love the feel of a mexican strat, you can get a mexican strat neck. I just used one on a Jazzmaster, I had zero issues. But they come in either maple or rosewood, and only fit fender guitars sort of thing.   Pickups- Have you played a guitar with those pickups yet? I'll be honest, they seem kind of gimicky to me. A p90 has a much hotter output than a small single coil, so it's going to be the dominant sound when mixed, and it's going to screw with your volumes when you switch to the single coil. But they do seem cool if you like to mess with your tone all the time.   So, the list:   Neck-  If it comes with tuners and a nut, you just need the neck. But you may want string retainers, depending on head style, different tuners, etc.   Body:   Bridge-  Here is something you must think about. PRS uses tremolo bridges, the saddles are very close to the body meaning the fretboard is very close to the body, and the body and neck are parallel. A fixed fender style bridge will have the same effect, like a Tele or hartail strat.   A stop piece and tun-o-matic, or wrap around, or anything that puts the bridge up on posts, will raise the saddles much higher off the body than the prs bridges, meaning you either have to angle the neck, like gibson, or use a thicker neck, which is what the old fender hollow bodys.   Knobs- You will need, wire, switches, pots and an output jack, whatever it is to your liking. StewMac has entire wiring kits that are a great deal. I believe Warmoth does as well.   Misc:   Strap Buttons!   Pickup Mounting Hardware (If you just buy pickups, they usually don't come with the hardware to mount them)   Misc screws and things.   Everything you need to attach the neck. If it's bolt on, bolts and plate.   Knobs. Pots look silly without them. Switch cover depending on the switch.   Finishing Supplies:   Depending on the wood you use, you may need wood filler. You will need a sealer, the stain (blue dye, in the case of youre picture) and applicators.   Sand paper (probably 300, 600 and 800)   Bindings (that guitar you posted is bound with white, something you can buy from any of the big luthier shops online)   Tools:   I don't know what you have. At minimum, you need a Router with a few diameters of End Mill bits. A saw of some sort to make templates (scroll, band, coping) and I would really suggest something that can remove a lot of stock, whether it's an Angle Grinder or a belt sander. Drill, screwdriver set, and an adjustable wrench. And accurate rulers that double as a strait edge.   Oh, and some luck, which I will bestow right now. Good luck!"

So if I got a warmoth neck or a fender style neck, I don't want to be using a tune-o-matic bridge?  Could you possibly recommend something else I could use?  I wouldn't mind a tremolo, but I think it would be nice if it was adjustable like a tune o matic.    Thanks for this post by the way, it's really helpful!"
Luthier,3b09fm,RamblingMutt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Warmoth sells both strait and angled necks. That's the advantage of warmoth, you can get any neck you want.   I have a question for you, and be honest, how experienced with guitars are you? Do you have woodworking experience? A lot of guitar playing? What kind of guitars have you played?   There are a lot of bridge options that are fixed. You could use a tune o matic and feed the strings through the body instead of using a stop piece. You could do the same with a fixed fender style bridge. There are Wrap around bridges, fixed floyd rose style bridges, telecaster bridges, really cheap non adjustable bridges.   What you really need to do is decide what is most important to you. Is having a tune-o-matic important? Than get an angled neck. Is having a bolt on fender-style neck really important? Then get a fixed fender style bridge.   I really suggest you go to Stewart Macdonald http://www.stewmac.com/Hardware_and_Parts/Bridges_and_Tailpieces/Electric_Guitar/   And really look around. Go to a guitar shop and see what you really like. It is very, very hard to give advice and even plan for parts when so little is known about what the end result is going to be."
Luthier,3b09fm,RamblingMutt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:17:14 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks.  I don't have much woodworking experience.  I have been playing guitar for round five years, I play pretty much everyday and I have a cheap classical guitar and a Gibson les Paul studio.  I played an Ibanez hollow body for a year in my high school jazz band a couple years ago and several other guitars in music stores.    I'm not really very experienced with guitars outside of playing them.  I thought this would be a cool project to learn about it.  And thanks again for the the help"
Luthier,3b09fm,RamblingMutt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:27:24 2015 UTC,"I've thought about it for a bit, and I have a suggestion for you to consider.   Get a kit. Buy a cheaper kit off of ebay or get a nicer kit from crimson or wherever. Build it, think about it, and then build a new body for it. You'll have a 1:1 template for the new body, swap over the neck and the electronics and mess with it. Hone in what you want from a guitar. Buy new pickups, slowly make the guitar exactly what you want, and when you have it dialed in, then go dump 300 dollars on a neck from Warmoth. It will give you a really good understanding of what you want from a guitar, and you will know what you need to build the guitar you want."
Luthier,3b09fm,RamblingMutt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"I wanted to build it without a kit, and buying something with the intention of replacing everything seems kind of like a waste of money to me....  But you're probably right and maybe it's the better idea.  I still have quite a bit of research to do and I was planning to try to play a lot of different guitars and figure out what I actually want, like you mentioned before.    Do you think it would be a bad idea for me to try to build a guitar without a kit first?  Even with all the tutorials on the internet and help from people in places like this?  I would rather not go with a kit, but I would be willing to if it's really necessary."
Luthier,3b09fm,AntiFIanders,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt in my mind that you cold build a body without building a kit first. In fact, I really suggest this site (a site that continues to provide me with inspiration): http://behindthetone.com/johnfisher/lpc/cvr/cover.htm  I do believe that putting together a kit would help a lot with all the pitfalls you are going to encounter along the way. Look at it this way. You buy a cheap as heck kit off ebay for 50 bucks, and put it together. You mess up a lot, and end up with something that is OK, but not to great. Then when you spend 500 bucks getting a custom neck, electronics and body blanks, you already made some of the mistakes. You aren't making those mistakes on the 70$ body blank.   Perhaps as an alternate route, instead of a kit, plan on building a body out of something like MDF first, before you build one out of geed timber."

Luthier,3b09fm,lee1282,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"I have another question, this time about body blanks.  Every body blank I've found on the Internet is about 1 3/4 inches thick.  That's too thick if I want to put a 1/2 to 3/4 inch maple top on, isn't it?  I would just use a very thin piece of maple, but I was planning on carving the top like a typical prs style guitar.  Do you know where I can find different thickness body blanks?"
Luthier,3az4kc,ProgAlex,9,Wed Jun 24 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you have at your disposal but you could always try something like a coping saw. Shouldn't take too long to cut since pick guards aren't that big and the wood is only 1/8th inch thick.  If you don't have a coping saw but do have a regular basic hand saw, you could cut most of the excess away with that and then use a Dremel to get most of the rest of the way in.  Either way, just make sure you hold or clamp the piece in such a way that you don't crack it while you're sawing. Super easy to screw up thin boards with a rough-tooth saw. When in doubt, do it the slow, careful way."
Luthier,3az4kc,slimindie,2,Wed Jun 24 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"probably the cheapest option (coping saw), and the first thing that came to mind. 1/8"" is kindof thick, but you could probably also use sidecutters or what I call ""catfish pliers"" (end nippers) to rough it out and dremel, whittle, or sand the rest. If you're really really a glutton for punishment, you can cut veneer with an xacto or utility knife, but it'll take a while, particularly on a wood as hard as walnut."
Luthier,3az4kc,lightsource1808,2,Wed Jun 24 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"Another vote for coping saw, they come in very handy and they're cheap. Either a medium or fine blade should do the trick. For something like this, I'd hang just the part being cut over the edge of a table, so that most of it is backed by a solid surface; that'll help prevent cracking. Drilling a few holes around the perimeter might help too, maybe a couple relief cuts straight in from the sides."
Luthier,3az4kc,catdumpling,5,Thu Jun 25 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"You could pick up a very cheap used scroll saw that would work wonders on that. Otherwise, a coping saw, or a drill with some drill bits and a small handsaw. You drill out the corners with a medium sized bit so you can get he small saw in to do the cuttouts. Finish the final shaping with gold old sand paper.   With 1/8"" stuff, a sharp chisel will do almost everything as well. Draw out the guard and use a hammer to punch out squared off cuttouts and things with the chisel. Then clean it up with sand paper.   Do you have a template? I'd be happy to make you a CAD drawing of it so you can print it and trace the design out with drill points for starting the cuts."
Luthier,3az4kc,RamblingMutt,2,Wed Jun 24 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"If your just looking for aesthetics, pick up a single ply, cheap guard and go to a lumber shop and see if they have any laminates. Glue it on the cheap pg, and there ya have it."
Luthier,3az4kc,well_glory,2,Wed Jun 24 18:00:58 2015 UTC,If you have a dremel you could rough it out with one of their cutting bits or a cutoff wheel and then finish with a sanding drum.  Just be sure to clamp your veneer down and to go slow and steady (with both hands) as the dremel can sometimes get away from you as the grain direction changes.
Luthier,3az4kc,coffeefuelsme,2,Wed Jun 24 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"1/8"" veneer is pretty thin, and walnut doesn't have a particularly tight grain structure, so my recommendation would be to back it with a couple other sheets of veneer, or as /u/well_glory pointed out, buy a cheap pickguard to back it with which would work as a template as well.  If you sandwich veneer, be sure to glue them cross-grain with each layer.  The coping saw is your best bet.  You can buy one for under $10, it's super useful to have around, and does basically the same thing as the band saw at this scale.  Just be prepared to do a lot of sanding to get your edges right.  Also, post pictures when you're done!"
Luthier,3az4kc,blakemake,2,Wed Jun 24 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"Not a woodworker, but an aircraft mechanic. In school we were taught how to make stuff on the flightline in case of an emergency.   The other guys are on point about tools you can buy. The coping saw would definitely be a good one. The dremel is also another good option  Having said that, if you don't want to buy those tools but own a drill with drill bits....drill that motherfucker out. Drill holes all around the outline then use a file to shape it. We had to do aluminum, which shapes easily with a file. Wood splits and stuff, so, I don't know how well it will turn out. Just giving you another idea of a way to get it made."
Luthier,3azkiu,AddictedToProgress,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"Fishman makes one http://www.fishman.com/products/view/archtop-guitar-pickup-1 - as do many other pickup/transducer companies. Just search for an archtop guitar piezo and see what you find. The base/feet of the pickups will be arched for an archtop, but you can modify (flatten) or even replace the feet because usually the piezo elements are embedded in the upper part of the bridge.  I don't know how the map guitars are wired, sorry, or if they use a preamp for the piezo. Most times it's recommended to use a preamp with these piezos, but not mandatory."
Luthier,3azkiu,BrightGuitars,2,Wed Jun 24 20:58:18 2015 UTC,Also thankyou!
Luthier,3azkiu,BrightGuitars,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"The short answer to your question is I don't know, sorry.  What I do know is that magnetic and piezo pickups are very different technologies. You almost never see Piezos these days without a preamp, either onboard or external. This is partly due to the low overall signal, which the preamp boosts, and also to the wide dynamic range of the piezo pickups. I believe that it is a logarithmic function where when you play twice as loud the output is 4 times higher. Strum half as hard and it is 4 times quieter. The preamps have some sort of buffer or compressor that accounts for this.   The 500k pots setup would be a fun and inexpensive experiment and I would love to know if it works, but like I said I've never seen it or tried it myself. I think I may have seen an old Ovation (they were among the first to use under-saddle piezos) with a passive volume and tone (i.e. no powered preamp) and I think it used 25k pots (that's 25, not 250). Maybe someone else here knows more about it...."

Luthier,3ax0o4,dejoblue,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:11:09 2015 UTC,Why is Walnut considered harder to work and more stable for gunstock compared to maple when this list shows maple having slightly harder numbers?  Also I have a guitar with a maple neck and ebony fretboard and one with a walnut neck and ebony fretboard.   I can easily bend the maple neck but can only get about 3 cents of tuning movement with the walnut one (This means I cannot bend the walnut neck on a song like Sweet Child o Mine where the lead guitar does so at the end).  Am I reading something wrong?  Is it the ratio?  Individual pieces?  Thanks  Cheers!
Luthier,3ax0o4,crazyglueismyfriend,2,Wed Jun 24 11:09:46 2015 UTC,"Individual thickness and dimension differences in the necks, truss rod rout, fingerboard thickness and so on will make a big difference in how easy the neck is to bend, much more so than the difference between walnut and maple."
Luthier,3ax0o4,dejoblue,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:04:11 2015 UTC,"Very true, beat me to it! Truss rods in particular mess with a fair amount of neck suitability. I'm curious if any studies have been done on required MOE/R, neck thickness, and string tension for truss rod-less necks..."
Luthier,3ax0o4,PJteleman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:08:00 2015 UTC,Grain orientation could account for that. The difference between Maple and Walnut's general stiffness would be way less a factor than if one was quartersawn and one was flatsawn.
Luthier,3ax0o4,BrightGuitars,2,Thu Jun 25 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"The maple neck is a three piece with the center section quartersawn and a standard truss rod.  The walnut neck is a 5 piece, two walnut sides, rift sawn with their respective grains opposite of each other with two maple and one walnut stringers. This has a dual action truss rod. Perhaps it is the double action rod? I know that I go through the point where there is no tension from the rod, depending on the humidity/weather. I actually, currently, have to give it forward bow because completely loose the strings do not pull it down to give me enough action (0.009"") it sits at about half that.  Anyway, just a curiosity."
Luthier,3ax0o4,BrightGuitars,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow! Ya, every lamination adds further strength to the neck, so add another truss rod and ya, your Walnut lam guitar is balls out strong. It also sounds like the neck was ""preloaded"" for string tension when the fretboard was leveled, so that it is dead straight, or even slightly back bowed when tension is off. With the double action truss rod, there are no worries about that. All those things play a bigger factor in the strength than the material."

Luthier,3atjbe,Clockwork_Monkey,2,Wed Jun 24 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"I have looked into this a little bit and I've found it depends on not just experience and competition but also location. If you are in a smaller, less expensive town, $40-$60/hour is pretty typical. In larger towns and cities it can be as high as $$100-125/hour for the best luthiers in the largest (most expensive) cities. I also noticed that while some people price by the job and others price by the hour, hourly rate and setup flat rate tend to be about the same. In other words someone charging $50/hour would charge about $50 for a setup. Someone charging $80 for a setup is probably billing at about $80/hour.  And of course none of this is a rule, just general observation."

But I want to offer you another insight.  You say it's your 3rd guitar. That seems like a pattern to me. And I suspect it won't be your last. So any skill your learn will be valuable for your future builds. So I think it's worth learning. If I were in your shoes, I'd want to learn.   Also, the ruining part isn't so likely. What's the worst that can happen? You botch the paint job? Big deal! Sand it off and start over. This might be trickier if you are building acoustics instead of electrics, but still. In most cases, you can sand everything flat, spray another layer and continue ... There are plenty of resources that explain every step of the way. If you can get to the end of a build, you surely can see the finish through.  Just my €0.02"
Luthier,3aux55,Belenar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I am building an electric, so hopefully I have an easier road ahead of me.

I am about to start medical school... and then residency, fellowship, etc., etc. so I may not be able to do this again for many, many years. I will do more research though! I would like to learn... I think I am more hesitant to buy all of the proper equipment if I am likely to use it only once (at least until I retire in 30 years)."
Luthier,3aux55,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"My only experience with farming out this work comes second-hand from other luthiers  (I do my own finishing). It depends who you go with, but the more experienced they are the longer you  can expect to wait. Experienced guitar finishers tend to have many clients, many of whom are big name custom builders who will undoubtedly get priority over you. If you are prepared to wait months, or even more, go for it. Another option could be to go to a cabinet maker or auto body shop. Both of these places would have experienced painters and good equipment and if you tell them what colors and materials to use you could get a great result."
Luthier,3aux55,cromag5150,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:41:24 2015 UTC,I agree with Belenar. It never hurts to learn and acquire a new skill. Give it a shot. Its not as hard as one might think. If you're not going to be building another for a long period of time and don't want to invest in a complete spray rig an alternative might be to use rattle cans. Belen stringed instrument lacquer is a good choice as well as ReRanch. Just practice on a seperate piece before you commit to finishing your build and you'll be fine. Lacquer is pretty forgiving stuff.
Luthier,3aux55,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"My guitar has a quilted maple top, and I really want to bring the figure out. I don't want to dye the wood though.

I'm about to rip my hair out."
Luthier,3aux55,BrightGuitars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"When I want to make figure pop, here's my recipe. 1. Tung oil on the bare wood. This gives it a permanent wet look. Really work it in then wipe off the excess and let it dry. (Make sure it's 100% Tung Oil, not a ""Tung Oil Finish"") 2. Shellac sealer coat over the tung oil. I mix my own shellac with flakes and alcohol. If you buy off the shelf shellac, try to find something without added wax. 3. Lacquer - several thin coats, applying 3 or 4 per day for 3 or 4 days. Cure, level, buff...."
Luthier,3aux55,cromag5150,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:15:32 2015 UTC,I've been looking far and wide for this kind of info. Thanks! A few questions... does the tung oil add an amber tint to the wood? I've used truoil before and it does. How many coats of tung oil and shellac? Do you sand between lacquer coats?
Luthier,3aux55,-tacoTime-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:21:03 2015 UTC,"Just feed it as much Tung oil as it will drink. I generally just do one heavy coat (wipe up the excess) then a second coat for good measure. I've never noticed any tinting from the oil.  I usually do 2 or 3 shellac coats, wiping them on very thin. If you use a spray shellac, one coat should be fine. (If you are using it as a filler as well you can do more coats.) It's just something to seal the wood and it also helps the lacquer stick. I don't sand after the shellac because I would sand through, and I wipe it on evenly and cleanly so it doesn't need it.  I sand at the start of each lacquer day after the first- so if I'm doing 3 coats per day I will gently sand with 320 on the second day before spraying the 4th coat, then the next day before the 7th coat, etc.  People may do it slightly differently, but this is a fairly standard recipe. (Also, if you're not worried about the grain popping then you can skip the tung oil)."
Luthier,3aux55,Jewishjay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:16:18 2015 UTC,Lacquer will bring out the figure just fine on its own.  Can I ask as to what kind of final look you are going after? (Emples are worth a thousand words if you can reference something you're trying to replicate). Are you looking for chatoyance or are you looking for deep contrast in the figure? Are you wanting color in your finish or just the natural beauty of the timber?

If the springs extend outside the route, they're likely to catch on clothes and cause unpredictable problems while playing."
Luthier,3aswcf,coffeefuelsme,3,Tue Jun 23 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"That means the block on your FRS is slightly longer (probably came with a 42mm block instead of the shorter 37mm.) As others have suggestion, you can shim the back cover if you want, or you can buy a shorter block. There are lots of ""big block"" upgrades for Floyds if you want to go that route, but some of them are ridiculously overpriced (cough FUTone cough).  The most affordable I've found (that are still great quality) are made by a place called Orange County Guitar Works. They've got brass big blocks for $19 (plus a couple dollars for shipping), and they come in 32mm, 37mm, (sometimes) 40mm, and 42mm. For the price of a ""normal"" (thin) Floyd block, you can get a big block upgrade and fix your spring issue. Here's a link to their eBay store, it doesn't look like they've got the 40mm brass blocks right now, but they have the other three most common sizes. There are lots of Floyd block sellers (including Floyd Rose themselves, although you'll pay a little extra for the name), so you can order from whoever you want.  Note: make sure you measure your block before ordering a new one! You'll just need a ruler with metric measurements. Measure the height of the block from the bottom of the baseplate to the end (where the springs hook in), it will either be 32mm, 37mm, or 42mm. You'll want the next size down (so if it's 42mm, you'll want to order a 37mm block.) If it's 32mm you've got a problem, but I doubt it came with that size."
Luthier,3aswcf,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:39:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. My floyd came with a 37mm block so I will be going to a 32mm.
Luthier,3aswcf,catdumpling,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"NP. Another good block maker/seller on eBay is a user named ""hoockey"" (or something like that, you'll know him if you find him). Couple dollars more than the OC blocks, but he's been making big brass blocks for a long time and lots of people go with them. Either way, there's no reason to pay $50+ for a FU-Tone or KGC block.  Installing a new block is easy, but you have to take the inner four saddles off to get to the screws, so it's a little fiddly. If you get a new block, do a Google search for ""how to install a new Floyd Rose block"", because there are a couple things you'll need to pay attention to. Floyd blocks need to go in a certain way, even though they look like they can go in either direction. Also, if you have calipers, it helps to measure where your saddles are and write it down, so you don't have to deal with re-intonating after you install the new block.  EDIT: By the way, the Floyd Specials come with a zinc block, so a new block will be an upgrade from a material standpoint as well. In my experience, zinc blocks tend to make trems sound a little lifeless, so a brass block should ""open up"" the sound a bit."

Luthier,3asayg,ThexLizardxKing,6,Tue Jun 23 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Pickups come in two flavors.    4-wire, with the green, red, white & black you refer to and 2 wire.  Which is what you have now.  4-wire pickups have each coil wired separately so that they can be split. 2-wire pickups, do not.  The strands covered by the black material need to be twisted together.  They are ""hot"".  The braided metal covering is the ground.  You can pull a bit of that off and twist it together to solder to the back of the pot.    What you don't want is for those two, the hot and the ground, to touch in any way."
Luthier,3asayg,MojoMonster,2,Tue Jun 23 04:24:21 2015 UTC,But I don't see any colored plastic coating on any of the wires. They're all just bare. And it's like this on both pickups
Luthier,3asayg,MojoMonster,3,Tue Jun 23 04:43:05 2015 UTC,There are two kinds of pickup.  You do not have the kind with 4 colored plastic wires.

Luthier,3asayg,Drinkos,3,Tue Jun 23 13:22:27 2015 UTC,"No problems.    So to explain a bit more; a humbucker is two single coils stuck together on a baseplate.  Each coil is wrapped with a copper wire which has 2 ends.  On early humbucker designs, like what you have, the pairs of wires from each coil were soldered to the corresponding pair of the other and joined into one single ""hot"" and one single ""ground"" wire.    In your case, the hot is the center part of the wire covered with a black cloth and the ground is the braided wire on the outside.  The other design pulls each of those 4 wires out into a single black wire cover, typically plastic.  To make those easier to use they are color coded.    Not all manufacturers use the same color codes, however, so be aware."
Luthier,3asayg,drtheremin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:47:15 2015 UTC,"The black cloth IS the plastic coating in your case. So like mojomonster said, just solder the metal braid to the back of a pot and the metal wire that's coming out of the black cloth goes to your live connection (usually the lug on the pot or to the switch)."
Luthier,3arhnb,Drogbaaargghh,8,Mon Jun 22 22:34:43 2015 UTC,Wet sanding reduces clogging when using finer grits. Water also acts as a lubricant. Wet sanding is usually used with finishes before buffing.
Luthier,3arhnb,cromag5150,5,Mon Jun 22 23:41:37 2015 UTC,You don't want to swell up the grain and loosen the bracing. Many glues are soluble in water. Plus the expansion and contraction due to the swelling can run some nasty cracks on the soundboard and back. Wet polishing is ok on a FINISH or on sealers. There it will be more economical than the non-wet paper.
Luthier,3arhnb,KendleC,3,Tue Jun 23 01:48:13 2015 UTC,"I wet sand before the final coat of clear and wax.  Wet sanding raw wood isn't a good idea, it raises the grain and can cause cracks/warping.  I learned this the hard way and had to scrap my first violin because wet sanding caused the back plates to warp and separate."
Luthier,3aput9,WillyTheDisk,9,Mon Jun 22 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"Personally,  I wouldn't go lower than about .035"". However, its really up to personal preference. I had a customer recently request that I dress the frets on his Les Paul down to next to nothing, as he was pushing down so hard that he was bending strings sharp. He also claimed that they felt like speed bumps. After a great deal of deliberation, I dressed them down to close to .020"". I thought it played like shit, but he couldn't have been happier with it.  Take your calipers to a guitar shop and see what's out there. It's mostly a matter of personal preference."

Luthier,3aput9,pennradio,3,Mon Jun 22 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"They can go to 0. Fretless for the win!  In reality, frets are a very case-by-case thing because multiple factors can affect their alignment, such as curvature of the neck wood, curvature of the truss rod, and fret damage. I'll always adjust a guitar's truss rod and general action before taking a look at the frets. I have a very handy tool i got from stewmac, it's a fret rocker composed of 4 uneven length but very flat surfaces that can be used to verify fret discrepancies over 3, 5, or even 7 frets. This allows you to pinpoint exactly which fret is causing the issue.  To strictly answer your question though you can tell one fret is higher than the other through ''fret buzz''. They hardly ever need to be replaced however, usually a proper levelling and dressing job should do the trick, unless they are extremely worn out like on old guitars.  Hope this helps!"

Luthier,3aput9,whomad1215,2,Mon Jun 22 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily the low height in and of itself that's a problem, it's the fact that at some point the wire can't be recrowned properly anymore. That's because of the profile of fretwire, which is usually sort of a rounded pyramid shape: once it gets closer to the bottom, it's really wide and you can't put a crown on it without taking a ton of material off. Some people are okay with flat fretwire, but it can cause buzzing and intonation issues, which is why it's not a standard thing."

Looks like a good idea to me. And if you've never milled or dried wood before, definitely do some research before hand so you end up with some nice useable lumber. r/woodworking has posts about it every once in a while."
Luthier,3as7dj,penguinbass1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:00:34 2015 UTC,"You can make an electric guitar out of most hardwoods, so you shouldn't have any issues.  Milling and drying the wood is going to be an issue if you don't have the proper tools.  Try to find a lumberyard with a kiln drying service, you can have your wood milled and dried in a couple of weeks rather then a year of waiting for it to air dry.  It might be expensive, but it can save you a lot of time waiting for your wood to season."
Luthier,3ardfp,Collin_C,2,Mon Jun 22 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts:  I wouldn't try to sand through that top ply layer.  With laminates, you have odd layers alternating in grain and when you remove a layer the top can become unstable and warp more.  Refinishing a guitar like this is a lot of work and I personally thing you should focus on the structural problems rather then attempt something that most luthiers wouldn't do  (I personally would pass on this job if someone requested it).    Sanding out a belly in the top is a really bad idea.  If you do that you're removing wood in the part of the top under the most tension and it will cause bad issues down the road.  Use something like a JLD bridge doctor to pull the top back down, or do some research on MIMF on how to flatten out a top with clamps.    If you remove the bridge you're going to have a big ugly patch that won't look good even if you attempt to refinish it (unless you apply a darker color).  Why not keep the original bridge, and carve some ramps into the bridge so the strings don't rest on the back of it?  That could be a good compromise.  One of the reasons that a floating bridge is not ideal on a flat top is that the break angle is very shallow and doesn't transmit a ton of energy to the top.  You can get around this by resetting the neck and shimming it with a steeper angle and installing a taller saddle.    That may not be what you wanted to hear, but that's what I think.  If you bought this to experiment on and learn, then go with your original plan.  It may not turn out great, but you may learn some good lessons."
Luthier,3ardfp,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response, but I think what I'll do is flatten it out with the $22 JLD BD, but still have a tailpiece. I'll restain the bridge after sanding it for clearance with a tailpiece and fulling in the string holes. I was thinking about seeing if a could plug it with something, or just put a plate under it temporarily so I can use something like woodfiller. Would this be possible and not make the guitar sound like complete crap?"
Luthier,3ardfp,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"The guitar is braced for a pin bridge and you'll be adding a floating bridge to it.  It most likely won't sound great due to the shallow string angle over the bridge, you'll need to shim and reset the neck to fix that."

Luthier,3amz6x,Bruione,5,Sun Jun 21 20:32:08 2015 UTC,You're better off making a new nut. Keep the old one for if you want to switch back. Probably cheaper to take it to a luthier/tech to fit than to buy the files/materials yourself.
Luthier,3amz6x,Clockwork_Monkey,0,Sun Jun 21 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.  Two nuts is the way to go.  If you get into Nashville tuning as a baritone, make a third nut."
Luthier,3amz6x,Username_Used,2,Sun Jun 21 23:57:51 2015 UTC,Filing nut slots is not really a DIY thing... it takes skill/experience and the right files for the job are expensive. Take it to a pro.
Luthier,3amz6x,ringolio,2,Mon Jun 22 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"Nut files are what you need ;)  But the good ones aren't cheap. If you're tenacious you can use a string itself as a file but you'll be there all day. There's also something called abrasive cord which would do the job a lot quicker.  If you go back to a thinner string, yes it will rattle around."
Luthier,3amz6x,EndlessOcean,2,Mon Jun 22 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"If you want the option of going back, you're better off with having another nut made. Considering how expensive nut files are (around $12 per string gauge, and it's not something you'd really use for much else), I'll throw in another vote for having a luthier make a new one. You can get a new nut installed and slotted for around $40, which isn't expensive when you consider the cost of nut files and a new nut blank ($12 for the file, about $10 for material if they're using purchased bone or TUSQ nut blanks.) Plus, and experienced luthier or repair tech can install and slot a nut in half an hour to an hour, which is much less time than it'll take you since you've never done it before.  Installing and slotting nuts isn't hard per say, it's just something that takes practice and you're not going to get it right the first time out. But if it's something you want to learn, go for it! It'll come in handy in the future, since you'll be able to tweak and replace your own nuts (hehe) without having to pay someone else. A good set of Japanese-made Hosco or Hiroshima nut files costs around $110 for a six-string set (plus add another $10-$12 per extra file that you need), but one set should last you the rest of your life if you're not running a repair shop."
Luthier,3amz6x,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how to help but that title out of context is hilarious   Edit: just actually read this. If you file the nut, I've been told by shops that the nut would need to be replaced for a smaller gauge string to work correctly. Also, my experience with acoustics especially is that a setup is needed any time you change string gauges. If it were me I'd probably go to a shop and tell them what you want. I doubt it would be more than $20 on top of a normal setup to mess with the nut a bit"

They make really high-quality parts and are popular with people who want to do Gibson-style builds, but they'll do fully custom CNC programming for anything you want, too. It's not cheap though: CNC programming for the full guitar (neck and body) runs about $850 US.  If you're willing to go bolt-on, you can probably save quite a bit by finding someone who makes custom bodies. USA Custom Guitar will, but I have no idea what their prices are. Another option would be a Warmoth routed body blank: they'll route the neck pocket, pickup routes and control cavity into an oversized square blank, leaving you to cut out the actual body shape.  The body size itself doesn't have too much to do with the hardware. If you want a trem, you'll have to have it routed for that. Otherwise, as long as it's routed for whatever size pickups you choose (single coils, humbuckers, etc) then you can stick whatever you want in it. The body size and shape is mostly cosmetic."

I'm in New Brunswick and found a local supplier of lumber. An Ash body (2 8"" wide, 2"" thick, 20"" long blocks) and a Padauk top (one 10"" wide, 1"" thick, 20"" long) cost me $60 total. I just have to plane, joint, sand and glue. It's all part of the process of learning"
Luthier,3aj4m4,EndlessOcean,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:48:06 2015 UTC,"A body blank for $100 is a stupidly high price. Check your local timber dealers and it'll be like $20-30. The only difference is marketing.  I bought 1200mm of 350x50mm mahogany for $32 from my timber yard, that was enough for 2 one piece bodies."

Luthier,3aijqo,tommytickturd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"You can make a basic bow quite easily, but beginner bows are so cheap that there is no point in making a bow unless you plan to put in the effort and make a good one.  Rosin is dirt cheap, no reason to make it yourself.  Boiling pine resins can also be quite dangerous, and it's not something that can be easily done in a very small batch, it's much more expensive to make rosin than it is to buy it on a small scale."
Luthier,3aijqo,Luthier42,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:50:41 2015 UTC,"My little sister used to make fake horse tails out of rope. She unbraided it all the way and then brushed it out. Perhaps you could unwind some nylon rope? Also, you could go to the thrift store and get the longest wig or hair extension you can find. There's lots of bow making supplies, mostly from china on Ebay."
Luthier,3aijqo,KendleC,2,Sat Jun 20 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"Nylon won't work well, the reason real hair works so well for bows is because it is full of tiny ridges that will hold the rosin and let the rosin grip the string when you pull it across, nylon is too smooth.  Non horse hair will work, but it will break very easily."

Luthier,3ahfvs,HiderJohnson,2,Sat Jun 20 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"Probably either humidity (the wood expanded or contracted enough to cause them to pop out), or they just weren't glued in very well to begin with. As long as your frets aren't showing any signs of raising out of their slots and the neck isn't bowing an unusual amount, there's not a whole lot to worry about. Also check your fret ends and see if you're getting ""fret sprout"", which is a sign your guitar's fretboard is dry. You may want to lightly condition your fretboard if it's been a while, but there's not much else to do.  For future reference, just try to be mindful of the humidity and don't keep your guitar near something like a sunny window, heater vent/radiator, that sort of thing. If it really bothers you, you can get a hygrometer to keep track of the ambient humidity in your home; if it's really dry, you may want to consider a small humidifier for your guitar room."
Luthier,3ahfvs,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"That's what i figured but wanted to make sure that was the issue. It got very hot and humid, very quick this year so that would probably explain it.  I went and checked the frets and no change in them at all so no issues there.  As far as conditioning/oiling it goes, i generally condition the fret board about every other month and this was on the month i needed to do it.   Thanks for the info and tips, ill definitely keep them in mind."
Luthier,3ahfvs,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"A sudden change in temp/humidity will do it. If the frets are good, then you shouldn't have anything to worry about.  I should mention that you're over-treating your fretboard, and there's a slight chance that could've been the issue. Fretboards shouldn't be oiled more than once a year at most, and even then it should be very sparingly. If you oil/treat the fretboard too much you can potentially cause issues like loose frets (or loose inlays), because too much oil is getting where it shouldn't be and causing the glue to lose its grip on the wood and/or inlays and frets."

Luthier,3aeq43,pleinairrider,3,Fri Jun 19 14:59:29 2015 UTC,Does the bridge only have 4 holes or 6 and only 4 screws are being used? If it has 6 I would move the screw over and drill a new hole for it. As for the crack you could dilute some wood glue and inject it in the crack with a syringe. I'd probably fill the hole too with a small piece of wooden dowel.
Luthier,3aeq43,slapspatula,2,Fri Jun 19 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"Can you pull down on the edges and have it open up more? If so, I would just take some watered down wood glue, and inject it in there and clamp it back shut nice and tight.  I would not route out the area and put splines in it, as the crack does not appear to be too major."
Luthier,3aeq43,forrealimadetective,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"Not at all. The crack is ""static."""
Luthier,3aeq43,forrealimadetective,3,Sat Jun 20 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"I would not use splines at all.  Can you apply pressure to make the gap close at all, or is it completely frozen in place? If so, what I said still applies, and put some watered down glue in there and clamp it completely shut.  Also, has the guitar been repaired previously for this issue? If so, and the crack is static, there is likely some epoxy or glue already in there.  If that is the case, clean it out after heating it, and then use the glue mentioned.  If none of this is the case, and you feel like a refinish, I'd strip it all the way down, use some wood filler, and then relacquer it."
Luthier,3aeq43,grandpaslab,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:46:06 2015 UTC,"The best way to deal with a crack is to rout out some material perpendicular to the direction of the crack, then glue in a splint or two.

If you are starting from bare wood, or sealed wood, it will take several, if not many, cans. Even for a one-off job it's probably more cost effective to pick up a small compressor, spray-gun, some nitro and some thinners. You are probably going to want to practice on something that's not an expensive guitar too."

Luthier,3ae2mj,cogito_ergo_doleo,2,Fri Jun 19 10:54:26 2015 UTC,Both ways will work but grain filler will get it done quicker. Depending on the viscosity of the finish you might need 10+ coats to fill the grain. You'd actually probably want really heavy coats as oppose to thin and light.  I'd grain fill. It's quick and easy. If you want a solid finish that is. If it were a semi-solid finish I'd leave the grain unfilled.

Wasn't a hard install either, all the complicated stuff is predone.  Some of the sounds outside of the classic combinations were pretty good, some not so much but you can be the judge on that.

I use one in the neck of my main guitar, best humbucker sound in the neck I have ever heard and the single coils sounds are fantastic. I love the parallel mode, it is very useful and not as phased out because of the coil mismatch but I can still get some quack going for ""Sultans of Swing"" type pickin.

For other schemes checkout Seymour Duncan:  http://www.seymourduncan.com/support/wiring-diagrams/  Also, I'll give another shout out for P-Rails. I have one in the neck of my guitar and it is dreamy, creamy, awesome. Two fantastic single coil sounds and an amazing humbucker sound."
Luthier,3acevz,dejoblue,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:41:50 2015 UTC,"Seymour Duncan Triple Shot pickup rings are the easiest way to get coil selection and coil series/parallel for a humbucker.  3-on/off switches will be the best way to pickup select.  Doing series/parallel and/or phase would get tricky but would probably be best wired as 3 separate on/off switches as well.  Think Brian May's Red Special.  From my experience, all of that switching is rarely worth the effort unless you actually play an extremely wide range of styles and need that one particular sound."
Luthier,3ac4t2,hiimgth,2,Thu Jun 18 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah man it can be done. One thing that makes neck thru builds a lot easier is to route a channel into the side of the neck blank for the wiring, so when your wings are glued on there's a channel already inside the guitar for your wiring. Otherwise drilling the wiring channels is a pain in the balls, especially between the 2 humbuckers.  As for woods: there's some awesome shit out there and you're gonna get screwed for shipping frmo StewMac. I can't recall though: are they shaped, fretted, and the truss rod installed or is it literally just a plank of wood. If the former, it'll make things easier but you pay for it. If the latter, you're better off buying your wood localy/domestically. Ebay.co.uk is a great source of timber. I scored some iroko and some idigbo from some dude in Slough and it was great.  The only difference between a ""neck blank"" and a plank of wood is marketing.  I'd be tempted to use matching woods for the top and back. If you find a thick enough piece you could saw it down the middle to have a matching set perhaps.   If you're having the Les Paul bridge on there as well you'll need to incorporate a neck angle, or recess the bridge to accommodate. If you do recess the bridge go with a taller fingerboard, a couple of mm higher than you need otherwise you might not have any room for adjustment."

Luthier,3ac4t2,KendleC,0,Fri Jun 19 10:15:32 2015 UTC,"I'd have a piece of wood going from the neck pocket to the heel and mount the pickups into that, this reduces feedback but you still get to build a lighter guitar. Sometimes the neck weight unbalances the guitar so you end up holding it up as you play. My suggestion brings the center of gravity back toward the heel a little, also I've never thought the sound of a thin hollow body does any justice to the bass notes, so little is lost there. You could always go with a piezo conductor pickup if you want some (amplified) acoustic sound to blend."

I'm not sure if this is against your design aesthetic or something, but with such a simple bridge and the p90s, a two-knob setup would look really good on one of those. It does mean less control (it would mean you couldn't mix the pickups anymore) but it would look really good. One would be the master volume, and the other could be a center-detente knob that's a bass cut one way and a treble cut the other way. Or maybe I'm just really weird..."

Luthier,3a72sb,Mark_McQ,3,Wed Jun 17 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"The most success I've had (short of a router or Dremel in router base) has actually been with chisels: it cuts through pickguard material cleanly, and leaves much straighter lines than an Xacto will. For something like a JM slide switch, a 1/4"" chisel should work pretty well. What you may want to do is use a drill bit of the width that you want for your switch hole, then drill two or three holes inline to get most of the material out; after that, clean and square it up with a small chisel. Xactos tend to catch and drag in pickguard material, which can leave a ratty looking hole.  The one caveat is that your chisel needs to be really sharp, otherwise it's easy to slip and cut something (including yourself.) Most chisels are fairly sharp out of the box, but they're always meant to be finish-honed after purchase (and before you use them for the first time.) That being said, the Buck Bros chisels that Home Depot carries are pretty damn sharp and would probably work fine as they come, at least for this project. Plus, the 1/4"" size shouldn't cost more than about $6-$7. You may find the 1/8"" size to be better, so if you think about going this route, just look at both sizes and figure out which one you think would work better.  FWIW, I still like using a sharp chisel to widen pickguard cutouts for Floyd upgrades (Floyds have a much wider baseplate.) It only takes a couple minutes, and leaves a nice crisp, straight edge."

Luthier,3a77uu,pssychesun,2,Wed Jun 17 19:43:28 2015 UTC,Since you already have a pickup installed I'd say a 4 since you've got the endpin drilled out.
Luthier,3a77uu,catdumpling,3,Thu Jun 18 02:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say about a 4 too. Drilling out the endpin jack is one of the more fiddly parts of a pickup, especially if you don't want to blow out the finish around the hole.  It shouldn't be too difficult outside of having to work blind with your arm inside the soundhole. There's not a whole lot you can do about that, it's just annoying. But, if you have one of those little inspection mirrors on a telescoping rod (or any mirror that fits into the soundhole), it helps to stick that and a flashlight into the body to see what you're dealing with first. Get an idea of where everything is at, and then have...fun? Sorry,I guess it's not really fun, but it's not that hard either.  If it makes you feel any better, I happen to like LR Baggs stuff and they're pretty good about making installation as easy as possible. Follow the instructions, take your time, and you shouldn't run into too many problems.  One question: which Anthem setup did you get? Does it have the soundhole volume control, or the side-mount volume/EQ module?"
Luthier,3a77uu,catdumpling,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:02:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Yeah, I'm anticipating having to work blind, and since I don't have a telescoping mirror (are they called engineer's mirrors?) I was considering using the video on my phone with the flash on.   As for my Anthem setup, I got the one with the full soundhole volume control, that way I won't have to cut out a block on the side for the module."
Luthier,3a77uu,catdumpling,2,Thu Jun 18 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"I always just called them ""inspection mirrors"", but I know a lot of machinists use them too. Any mirror that fits in the soundhole will work, but the inspection mirrors let you keep your arm out of the soundhole so it's a little easier to see things. I have a couple (mirrors, although arms too ;) ), I think I got mine from Harbor Freight for a couple bucks each. I've seen them at Home Depot and Lowe's too, so most any hardware store should carry them.  Since you got the pickup with the soundhole controls, that makes things a lot easier and pretty noninvasive. You'll already have a small hole in the saddle slot for the piezo element, so that should mostly just be a straight swap for the old pickup; just be careful not to bend or kink the piezo (they're somewhat flexible, but putting a sharp bend or kink risks damaging the element.) The transducer should have a piece of double-sided adhesive on it, so you'll just have to look at the bridge plate, center the transducer on the plate as much as possible, and stick it on.  The adhesive LR Baggs uses is strong, but it doesn't do well if you keep moving it around; it's mostly a ""stick once and leave it alone"" situation, so make sure you know where you want everything to go. Otherwise, the install should be pretty straightforward."

Luthier,3a63ta,USMarty,2,Wed Jun 17 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"1.a.  Typically this would mean long shafts, yes - measure it.  Any good supplier will also list the length of the shaft the pots you are looking at. 1.b. CTS is a brand, not necessarily the uncontested best, but easily the most commonly used ""name brand"" pot. 1.c. I will defer to those more experienced with coil splitting.  You should note that the resistance of your pots should be based on several things though, including output of your new pups, desired tone, as well as use(s) and how you end up wiring it all together. 1.d. I like to buy from Mouser Electronics - they charge a fraction of the cost of buying pots from a guitar oriented seller.  HOWEVER, if you do not know exactly what you are looking for, it can be difficult to find through Mouser.  Guitar related vendors mostly run very similar pricing on items like pots (at least in my experience).  Stewmac & guitarpartsresource are both good vendors. The best way to save money on electronics for a project this small (if you already have the pups that is) is to find a single supplier that has everything you want, and whoever has the cheapest total is who you go with so you only pay shipping once. 1.e. Yes, Volume control needs an Audio taper Pot; typically the tone is a linear taper. 2.. Look at the wiring options and offerings on stewmac's website.  They have a tremendous number of free diagrams and wiring ""how to's"" on their website - each is linked with the various pre-wired harness you can buy, find one that matches what you are looking for and take note of the wire type and gauge.  The different wires running to/from different things have different requirements/best scenarios.  Generally speaking though, you want something insulated at the least (except for ground wire I suppose). Also, Google wiring diagrams.  There is an obscene amount of info out there on how to do this part of it that will be far more descriptive than a reddit comment!  (or at least, my reddit comment). *edit:  My apologies for formatting.  One of these days I need to actual figure out how to get things to line up.  :/"
Luthier,3a63ta,Durateus_Cithara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"This is great thank you! I have never done this before so I'm trying to just understand what the base ideas are and what would be appropriate to buy. I wasn't aware that guitars use different gauge wires in their set-ups depending on what that was. I was just under the impression insulated copper wire can connect everything for the most part.   For grounding, (I just thought of this) could I just screw a screw into the battery area now sine itll be unoccupied and run a wire to that? That way I wouldn't have to drill to the post or anything too drastic..."
Luthier,3a63ta,Durateus_Cithara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"I have read in several places that a screw (must be made of a material that conducts well) works for grounding.  I tried it once in a bass I was rewiring upgraded pups in... it did not work very well for me (lots of noise).  Perhaps I did something wrong, I am really not certain (simply moving my ground wire to the bridge fixed the issue).  It makes logical sense to me, and that it should work...  Thus far grounding to bridge has been the most effective method for me though."
Luthier,3a63ta,shredtilldeth,2,Mon Jun 22 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"Guitar tech here. I rewire guitars all day long.   You do not necessarily need a long shaft pot. In fact, more often than not you do not need long shaft but it's impossible for me to tell for sure without a test fit. CTS is my highly preferred brand over everything else. It's not even like they're expensive. You'll see them for $7 a pot MAX. 500k is the most commonly used but I prefer 1meg pots for volume, 500k for tone. Basically the lower the value of the pot the more treble it cuts, the higher the value the closer to ""pure"" output you'll get. If you don't like how much treble is coming through you should EQ that at the amp instead of at the guitar via pots. Your tone will be more clear that way. Regarding coil splitting, I don't usually recommend it. I've yet to find a push / pull pot with a high quality design. They ALWAYS fuck up and I'm replacing them constantly. Often with regular ass pots instead of push pull. If you still want to go that way just keep in mind the wiring is more difficult and the parts are smaller and more of a pain in the ass to work with. Don't bother with coax / shielded wire. Instead, twist your hots and grounds together. I've been known to use 18 gauge wire but that's overkill, and often a pain in the ass to work with. 20 or 22 gauge is just fine. HERE is where you're going to run into problems. Your current setup does not have any sort of bridge ground since the pickups are active. With passive pickups you HAVE to have a bridge ground lest you want to use your rig to listen to the radio. Normally, with a hard tail bridge like yours there would be a wire running from the height adjustment insert on the treble side, with a hole drilled to the control cavity. You don't have that. So, in order to rewire your guitar you will have to pull the bridge off, pull the insert out, drill a hole, and put it all back. HUGE pain in the ass, especially if you've never done it. Or, you will have to figure out some sort of alternative way to ground the bridge. I can't think of a good alternative solution right now. Does not have to be. You can use your current stereo jack just fine. You just won't have anything connected to the short clip.   Also, I would DEFINITELY replace that switch. That thing is a cheap plastic piece of shit."
Luthier,3a63ta,shredtilldeth,2,Wed Jun 17 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"you HAVE to have a bridge ground lest you want to use your rig to listen to the radio   lol. I was wondering about this as an alt solution: Since the battery cavity is now not being used, could I potentially just screw a screw into the body there and attach the wire? Or does it have the be the bridge specifically?  Sounds like I'll just go regular pots no push pull, and try your 1meg advice.   Sorry but I'm retarded when it comes to stuff like this, I know what you meant by this ""Instead, twist your hots and grounds together"", but can you expand please?  And, finally, ""That thing is a cheap plastic piece of shit"" - NOTED.  Thanks man."

Not even kidding, it will probably cost over 300$ probably a lot more honestly, you're looking at probably 16 hours shop time @ 30-100$/hr depending on who you can find that would even be willing to bother with this.

When it's all nice and clean you can use a good fretboard conditioner. I'd recommend something like Fret doctor or Guitar honey although you can use some lemon or bore oil.

Luthier,3a2aw9,baldylox,2,Thu Jun 18 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"You can also use mineral oil to treat the fretboard (a very small amount!) Virtually all ""lemon oil"" and other fretboard treatments are nothing more than mineral oil that's been thinned a bit, with a little lemon scent added. Oh, and an 800% cost markup ;) .  You can find pure USP-grade mineral oil at any pharmacy or pharmacy section of your grocery store. It's sold as a laxative, but whether or not you want to ever test its usefulness as such is totally up to you. At any rate, it's also the same thing used to treat wooden cutting boards.  One thing to note: pure mineral oil is fairly thick, and I usually pour a little out into a cup and apply it with my fingertips. You don't need much at all, and a $2 bottle will probably last the rest of your life. Do not ""flood"" the fretboard with mineral oil or any fretboard treatment! That's a recipe for loose frets and all sorts of other future issues. Just a light coat, let it sit for a minute, and buff off the excess with clean cloth or paper towel. You shouldn't treat your fretboard more than once a year in most cases: doing so can actually cause it attract more dirt and grime and generally doesn't help anything."

Shave and polish the plate, the blocky heel, get shorter screws, using rasps and drawknives and then sanding, and refinishing, drying times, sanding, spraying buffing. You reassemble, everything seems to line up, feels great. One day later you pull the guitar from the case and the strings are 1/2 inch above the 16th fret. You adjust the truss rod, it doesn't work, you shim the neck and now it has a gap under it and the sustain is not so good, you develop a wolf tone at certain frequencies.

Luthier,3a0p2x,MrGrebgnet,5,Tue Jun 16 08:52:44 2015 UTC,"You could do that, but why ?  Plywood is more difficult to work with than solid wood, more expensive than solid pine, offers no strength advantage for a neck due to the directions the ply is oriented, and it can have unexpected voids.  It would be better to make a neck from solid pine, or even better a laminated 3 piece neck that you laminate yourself from solid pine that can be bought pretty much anywhere , or construction grade maple if you can find that.  Framus made necks with plywood construction  back in the 60s, but they would have laminated it orienting all of the plys lengthwise. This makes for a very strong neck, but you won't get the same effect from construction type plywood that is designed to have uniform strength as a big sheet."
Luthier,3a0p2x,Luthier42,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"The reason why I wan't to do this is because where I live, there is absolutely no retailer or any other way for me to get any hardwood.

Luthier,3a0p2x,Luthier42,2,Tue Jun 16 13:02:54 2015 UTC,"The thing about construction plywood is that the grain is oriented 90degrees to the previous sheet in each layer.   This is great if you want a strong sheet of material without any crossgrain weakness.    But in something long and thin like a neck, stiffness lengthwise is much more important.  For simple comparison, take a piece of plywood and a plank of pine of the same thickness and width.  The pine plank, unless it has major defects, will be far stronger than the plywood lengthwise."

Luthier,39za6y,neptunetiger,2,Tue Jun 16 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"It is easier to replace your current pickup switch than it is to add one, and as far as surgery goes it is a minor operation. There are a couple reasons your pickups start to cut out, and more often than not it is a switch, jack or pot issue. Luckily these parts are all cheap and pickups tend to stay magnetized, so this won't hurt too bad. Hell, even if the pickup did lose its  charge you could recharge it if you had to have that exact pup. Older Gibson and Fender guitars sound the way they do because they've lost a slight magnetic charge in the pickups over time. On a solid body guitar tone has absolutely nothing to do with the age of the wood.   If you want to learn how to work on guitars this is a fantastic place to start. If you aren't interested in that and just want it to be a functioning guitar take it into the shop they will know what to do. They will even tell you what they're doing if you want to take notes. On top of that, you get an entire 30 point inspection with a complete setup, and it will feel nice to have your guitar tweaked the way that it was intended to be.  It's important to take wiring seriously and to follow the blueprint of how a standard Les Paul should be set up , so I think it would be really good for you to do this with someone that has already done it at least on your first go around. I think if you follow the instructions step by step you should have no trouble with this whatsoever."

Luthier,39za6y,pssychesun,2,Tue Jun 16 00:24:39 2015 UTC,I would check for other issues first. Of course it is hard to tell but the wiring looks OK and generally if the switch is bad it would either not work or sound scratchy. Try cleaning the switch with some contact cleaner and see what happens.
Luthier,39za6y,Luthier42,2,Tue Jun 16 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"I will definitely give contact cleaner a go, if that doesn't work, I'll bring it to a expert."
Luthier,39za6y,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Tue Jun 16 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"One of the switch contacts is probably corroded, or dirty causing bad contact, common issue with this type of switch.  Contact cleaner will probably solve your problem for a good amount of time.  Epiphone switches are particularly bad, but most les paul type switches end up having issues like this, it's just not a good switch design In my opinion.  Open construction with nothing sliding over the contacts to keep them clean means that dirt or corrosion will build up over time."
Luthier,39za6y,JustinM16,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:56:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips!
Luthier,39za6y,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"Mines 35 years old. Never had an issue. I think some people just leave their guitars in shitty conditions and cause corrosion. I wouldn't blame the switch. I have three guitars with these switches, the newest being over ten years old. Never an issue with any of them. Of course I won't play them out doors in iffy weather..."
Luthier,39za6y,refotsirk,2,Tue Jun 16 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"It isn't just from crappy conditions. I've got this problem with my Epiphone Les Paul and I've always taken great care for it. It doesn't really leave the room and it spends much of its time in the case. Mind you it isn't kept in a climate controlled room, but you can't really expect the average electric guitar to be stored in one. Either way it doesn't see any extreme temperatures or humidity, and here I am with a switch that craps out."
Luthier,39za6y,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Tue Jun 16 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"Could just be a bad ground, which is what the symptoms sound like to me. Could just be dust in the switch but seems more like a cracked wire or bad ground. I'd bring it into the shop. Buying electronic soldier and a soldiering iron will cost almost as much as a repair.  Also rewiring all the electronics is harder and more time consuming than it looks.   I wouldn't think anyone normal would have climate control either, I was just trying to make the point that there's nothing wrong with the design. People have switch problems, I've gotten them on my strats but never my lps. The lp is more of a sealed off system, the strat 5 way has a big gaping hole in the top."
Luthier,3a1s3x,dwiggitypoo,2,Tue Jun 16 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"Just drop them in there as is. 250k pots bleed off more treble, so they are the typical choice for an already-bright single coil. Humbuckers tend to be warmer pickups, so we use 500k pots for them because 500k lets more highs through, thereby brightening up a warmer pickup. Your Holy Grails are pretty hot for single coils - 10/11k is actually more typical for a humbucker which may be why someone recommended going with 500k pots, but I'll bet they are plenty bright and will be a good match for the 250k pots already in the guitar.  On your Strat, all 3 ground wires usually go to the back of the volume pot. Pay attention to where the 3 hot leads go on the 5-way switch - make a sketch - and that's all there is to it. Sometimes it's easiest to swap one pickup at a time so you don't get confused which lead goes where on the switch."

Luthier,3a0djj,PAF_67,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:59:48 2015 UTC,Very nice.  I haven't had a ton of luck with antique malls.  Often times they're really overpriced even if something is broken.  Really fun to look through though!  Though I did find an old acoustic for $20 at goodwill once.  I still have it but it needs a neck reset before I sell it.  It's currently on the backburner as I'd like to get some more fretting experience first and still have to build a little steam injection system.  I also have an old tiesco looking guitar but someone repainted it and it has NO hardware.  Once I buy some fretwire it's first in line to have a try at a refret and after that it'll probably sit until I find some cheap parts that fit.

Luthier,39xjx4,xprt76,5,Mon Jun 15 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"The crack by the volume and tone controls looks like it needs to be cleated. The finish cracks can be re-amalgamated. It needs to be tested as to whether it is shellac or lacquer. The guitar was and is very desirable for the people who grew up in the 60's. Everything can and should be fixed. In the future it must be kept in a humidity controlled environment, best in a purpose built display case."
Luthier,39xjx4,KendleC,3,Mon Jun 15 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"Are the cracks just in the finish, or are there any cracks in the wood?"

Luthier,39y9ss,WyattFlem,3,Mon Jun 15 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"Just thought I'd chime in here. The materials on that neck all look entirely too new to be more than 10-20 years old (at best). Have a look at a 50 year old neck: http://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-ORIGINAL-1965-FENDER-MUSTANG-GUITAR-NECK-8-DEC-65-B-/161720348410?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item25a748aefa    The most important thing is, how does it sound and feel when you play it? That's a pretty unique guitar you've got now. If you dig how it sounds, don't worry about where the neck came from.  The nut material also isn't consistent with the plastics (in my opinion) that were used on cheap copies back then. Just seems like a newer neck that somebody stamped a date on. I could easily be wrong. Find that GG logo somewhere and you've probably got the key to your question."
Luthier,39y9ss,tonylowe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:08:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds and feels incredible that's why I'm skeptical about it being a ""cheap Chinese""  neck like everyone seems to think but I guess it doesn't really matter. It plays and sounds better than the majority of guitars I've played so I'm definitely happy with the neck"
Luthier,39y9ss,tonylowe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"One of my current favorite guitars is out of China. The gap in fabrication equipment, experience and quality control has mostly been bridged. ""Cheap"" is too often associated with poor quality. But to their point, a lot of the necks that are purchased as a neck only are seconds from the same factories or extra shift of production with material of dubious origin. It's entirely possible that neck came off a production guitar and had nothing wrong with it, found it's way onto your guitar and now you've got an awesome beast. Makes me want to pull out my 76 Mustang and give her some attention."
Luthier,39y9ss,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"And the consensus seemed to be that the GG logo was custom and it's not actually a logo for any company, no t one I could find any info about anyway"
Luthier,39xdse,7SevenEleven11,2,Mon Jun 15 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"If it a bound neck, absolutely not. The binding will lift or melt. If it has a skunk stripe it may melt the glue there and as well as the glue that holds on the fretboard. The video is astonishing though. If it was a junker, you might see what happens. I'll bet that finish was UV cured and your might not be?"
Luthier,39xdse,KendleC,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:07:52 2015 UTC,I can't imagine it'd be good for the fret board glue. I'd sand it.

Luthier,39xdse,tommytickturd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"I'd never use a heat gun on a neck! There's a good chance you'll cause the neck wood to twist, warp or otherwise go out of whack, and it may ruin the neck entirely.  The poly applied to most necks is pretty thin, and your safest option is to use sandpaper and/or cabinet scrapers. Even with that kind of hand work, it still shouldn't take very long to strip a neck of a poly finish."

VERY big milestone! :)"
Luthier,39u7mb,fowlrock,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:34:25 2015 UTC,Butterflies in my stomach while you were radius sanding but turned out nice. Can't wait to see the body stained
Luthier,39u8o0,Liamosaurus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:42:39 2015 UTC,It is indeed ash. Should I sand off as much of the primer as I can and do a sealer after?
Luthier,39u8o0,catdumpling,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:45:14 2015 UTC,Better to know now than after 5 coats of colour. Thanks!
Luthier,39u8o0,catdumpling,2,Sun Jun 14 22:43:34 2015 UTC,"What kind of primer did you use? Some (many, in fact) primers are ""primer-sealers"" and do both with one product. It may be as simply as just doing a couple extra coats of primer before you start paint."
Luthier,39u8o0,gbuck97,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:09:27 2015 UTC,Looks like it's just a primer. http://i.imgur.com/mOo4AAv.jpg
Luthier,39u8o0,USMarty,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:34:45 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well, you could try a couple things, depending on how much work you want to do. First, you could try just a couple extra primer coats, which will probably be sufficient. Maybe.  Otherwise, if you're up to it, you might want to sand back to bare wood, apply a sealer, then reprime. You're probably never going to get all of the primer out of the grain, so don't be too concerned with that.  Personally, if it were almost another other wood besides ash, I'd probably just shoot a couple more coats of primer and call it good. But ash has really open grain, and I'd be concerned about the finish sinking into the wood pores over time (which some people find ugly.) But I also hate sanding with a passion, so I'd probably go to the hardware store and buy a small can of paint stripper rather than sanding all of it off. If I had no sealer, I'd also take that opportunity to pick up some Zinnser Bullseye SealCoat sanding sealer ;) ."
Luthier,39u7mi,Halyon,6,Sun Jun 14 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"To prevent a major fuck up, simply ask here or any other luthier forum for advice.  Have a set plan, get a good set of measurement tools.  What country are you from ?"

Luthier,39u7mi,ringolio,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"Forget the slotted straight edge. Get a good normal straight edge instead... it's cheaper and can be used for any project, including leveling a neck with any scale length.   Oh, and don't expect perfection or you will be sorely disappointed."
Luthier,39u7mi,ringolio,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"Even with the frets in the way? I'm not expecting perfection (one of the reasons I intend to do a painted finish, I am almost certainly going to need to fill some sort of mistake in the wood), but I am aiming to get something which stays in tune and intonates fairly well.  Would you recommend only putting the bridge in once the fretboard is in and the nut position is known?"
Luthier,39u7mi,Luthier42,0,Mon Jun 15 07:52:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, but the frets aren't in the way... the frets and their relative position are actually the important bit. Think of it this way: for good playability, the plane defined by the fretboard doesn't really matter; it's the plane defined by the top of the frets that matters. A notched straightedge kind of ignores this fact and focuses solely on the fretboard where it's not needed IMO... You can have the straightest fretboard on the planet but if you have a couple of high and low frets the guitar will not play well.  And yes, putting the bridge on after the neck is attached and the nut defined is usually the way to go."
Luthier,39u7mi,Luthier42,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, the neck material is essentially there only to hold the instrument together and the frets in place (thinking about it, people sometimes have scalloped fretboards which are very much not straight!)  Cool, thanks, neck angle and bridge placement are my two largest concerns at the minute"
Luthier,39u7mi,Hotdogcannon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:48:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need a slotted straight edge on a new build, it's more of a tool for adjusting older instruments.  Slotted straigth edges can be useful when you have to adjust a neck with something wierd going on, distortions and bumps in the fretboard or very uneven frets.  Compound radius boards are slightly more difficult to fret and level,  when leveling the frets try to think of the fretboard as a cone shape, and don't just go parallel to the centerline."
Luthier,39u7mi,BrightGuitars,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:25:39 2015 UTC,I've seen people penning permanent marker on to the frets and filing it off until it comes off evenly - do you reckon I could trace lines along the frets from nut slots to saddles (i.e: along the natural fanning lines of the strings) and file along those lines instead to achieve the conical surface?
Luthier,39u7mi,MattieTheSpud,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"Marking the tops of the frets can be a good help in seeing how far you have come.   I don't think you need to mark lines along the fretboard, just be concious of not going parallel to the center."
Luthier,39u7mi,MattieTheSpud,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:16:02 2015 UTC,"Careful with those fretboards! Ebony is very brittle. I have broken 4 of them. Never do anything to them with force, and if using a router, take small, small passes."
Luthier,39u7mi,SilverwoodGuitars,3,Mon Jun 15 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"2 comments:   Fretwork takes a long time to get good at, and it's probably the trickiest part of a first time electric build because really the quality of the guitar rests on the fret job and the setup. Other parts like pickups and hardware are important, but they are easily adjusted after the fact, whereas the fret job is fairly permanent and expensive to replace, and a bad fret job will keep you from wanting to play the guitar. If you are doing this for practice and experience, by all means do the frets yourself (and be prepared to pull them out and do it again). If you want to get a great-playing fingerboard that begs to be played, on the first try, have an experienced luthier do it for you or at least help you out with this particular process. (Or buy a fretted neck.) Have fun."
Luthier,39v22l,methhead86,2,Mon Jun 15 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"Really hard to diagnose over the internet with no pictures, BUT I would guess the tuners are garbage and replacing them would help a lot."

Luthier,39v22l,Luthier42,2,Mon Jun 15 05:31:53 2015 UTC,"What strings are on it ?  Putting too heavy strings on old acoustic guitars is a common source of problems.  Bad string winding at the tuners will cause slipping.  Poor tuners  can make tuning it a chore, but tuners will not cause tuning instability unless they are physicaly broken.  Strings not fitting properly in the nut and bridge slots can cause the strings to stick and skip over the slots giving tuning issues.  Loose neck joint can happen on older instruments, the neck will still stay attached, but it's not firmly stuck at the heel and the neck slowly tilts."
Luthier,39v22l,bbrandann,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:45:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm okay, the strings are nickel plated and I believe they are starting at .10 maybe.  They came with them on, I read to use lighter strings so I was going to switch .10 - .46 bronze strings.  The tuning legs aren't actually broken.  They are old and worn and some of the actual plastic knobs are cracked.  I'll have to look into to the other things you've mentioned.  Thanks"
Luthier,39u7u9,ProgAlex,2,Sun Jun 14 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Chemical stripper has been working fine for me. Leave it on until it bubbles then scrape. If it doesn't look like anything is coming off then you're probably still on the clear coat above the paint. Scrape and repeat.   Sanding works but it makes a huge mess.  Edit: To clarify, the most recent body I stripped took ~6 scrapings to get through the thickest finished areas."
Luthier,39u4jv,asatyr55,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:08:47 2015 UTC,Fill the chip with wood glue. Let dry for 24 hours. Smooth over with a razor blade. You can then paint over it.   Wood glue is very strong stuff as long as it can be absorbed into the wood.
Luthier,39u4jv,mrquandary,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:32:22 2015 UTC,Does the glue settle? Do I need to apply layer after layer? And can there be a reaction with the finish?
Luthier,39u4jv,mrquandary,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:51:08 2015 UTC,"The glue may shrink a bit as it dries. put on more than you need and cut it back, rather than putting on too little and needing to apply more.  Wood glue will not stick to surfaces that will not absorb it, so it will not bond to the paint.   You could use superglue instead; this will stick to the paint.  I made you an album detailing a chip repair I did a short while ago here."

I went to lowes and explained to someone what I was doing and they took me to the fittings section with hinges etc and they had a package of brass flats that was like $3. 4"" x 1/2"" x 1/64"" (~.3mm) thick.  It is cut-able with scissors, being that thin. I would try to get thinner if possible.  Wood is another option but thin and reliable pieces have been difficult for me to find.  If all else fails you can get some brass washers and cut them to suit.  Or steel if you prefer."
Luthier,39rmm9,dejoblue,2,Sun Jun 14 04:15:30 2015 UTC,"I'll check today, then. Hopefully my local places will carry something that thin. That size is perfect, thought. I forgot to mention that this Harmony has a copy of the horrid Gibson adjustable saddle, but it was a much cheaper copy, so the Graph Tech was tall enough before I sanded it too much, forgetting the neck should be reset. Picture just 'cuz"
Luthier,39rmm9,catdumpling,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:41:59 2015 UTC,"+1 for brass or copper shim stock (or even aluminum, if you can find it that thin.) All three are easy to cut when they're that thin but be careful! They'll slice the crap out of you if you're not paying attention to the edges...ask how I know ;) . For a quick fix, you can even cut up an aluminum soda can and use some of that: not the most elegant fix, but it's still better than paper or card stock. I've used Coke can shims to change the radius of a Floyd, and it actually works very well."
Luthier,39rmm9,Clockwork_Monkey,2,Sun Jun 14 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"With something as critical to the sound of the guitar as the nut/saddle, putting shims in is not worth it. Make a new nut and saddle from bone."
Luthier,39rmm9,estone,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:21:15 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I like to super glue paper to the old saddle to find the correct height and then make a new one based on those measurements.
Luthier,39rmm9,syngts23,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"bone, ivory, tusq, corian  because they are dense and hard materials, they will transfer the vibration well.  cardstock/cardboard are weak and flexible materials, it will dampen vibrations, you might not hear the difference in the note and lower harmonics but it will reduce greatly the higher harmonics of the string."
Luthier,39rmm9,BrightGuitars,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:52:33 2015 UTC,"Nay on the cardstock.  The harder and denser the material the better energy transfer you will get from the strings through the saddle and into the bridge.

I ended up building a case after asking for advice here and getting a lot of ""If you can build a guitar you can build a case"". I did a decent job, but it's not going to last forever, and it doesn't look perfect.  I used velvet for the lining, and I absolutely do not recommend. Get something with a significant amount of stretch in it so that you can conform it to the contours on the inside and fit it right into the corners without needing to cut out different pieces and join them together."
Luthier,39oacy,estone,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:55:26 2015 UTC,It's more if you can build an acoustic and have the patience to fuck up the fabric a couple times before you get it right you can make a case.

Luthier,39moqo,Thuat_Squared_2,6,Fri Jun 12 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"1) Sure. If you've got the time and knowledge (or money to pay someone else), there's no reason it should be anymore difficult that scalloping a ""normal"" neck.  2) Scalloping removes wood, which can make the neck weaker. If it's done properly, on a well-made neck with good wood, it probably won't cause any issues beyond maybe having to adjust the trussrod slightly more often. If you just start whacking chunks of wood out of your fretboard, there's a real good chance you'll ruin the neck: if that happens, your only choice is to have a new fretboard glued on (not cheap), or buy a new neck (even more not cheap.)  Scalloping has no effect on tone: your strings are still vibrating off the fret, not the fretboard. It may allow for a slight additional amount of sustain, but that's debatable. The most noticeable effect will be on playability, and that can be very negative for a lot of people: when you take away the fretboard, you have no reference of when to ""stop"" pressing the string, so it's incredibly easy to press notes sharp when you don't intend to. You have to completely rethink the way you fret notes, and if you can't train yourself to have a much lighter touch, you're going to be in trouble.  Scalloped fretboards are a very ""love it or hate it"" thing, and most musicians don't like it. I would highly, highly recommend playing a scalloped neck before you commit to buying one or having yours scalloped (both of which are going to be expensive options, by the way.) And even if you love the way it feels and have it expertly done, you're still increasing the risk of your neck irreparably warping or twisting (especially if you have the whole fretboard scalloped.) It's not something to be taken lightly, for all sorts of reasons."
Luthier,39moqo,catdumpling,2,Sat Jun 13 11:23:53 2015 UTC,I have a question regarding fanned frets... how does it affect bending? I would assume you would have to relearn where you are bending to since as you bend across the fret it changes the fretting location.
Luthier,39moqo,MouthyMike,2,Sat Jun 13 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"I've not played a fanned fret instrument yet, so I can't say for sure; but I don't think the scale length differences from string to string are big enough to have to relearn how to bend entirely. Maybe just some slight adjustments is all I'm thinking.  As /u/catdumpling said, adjusting for how to bend/feet is really more a result of scalloping the neck."

Luthier,39oedf,catdumpling,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:45:04 2015 UTC,"A strat neck will in fact fit a tele body without any modifications   Only if you're ""lucky"" and the pocket is cut oversized (which it shouldn't be, but it happens.) A Strat neck has a curved heel that technically ""overhangs"" the end of a Tele pocket, which is straight. An MIM Tele probably won't have an oversized pocket, in which case OP would have to plane or sand the end of the Strat neck flat to get it to fit correctly, or modify the Tele neck pocket to fit the curved heel of the Strat neck. Modifying the new neck is easier and the preferred solution.  Some people will also force a Strat neck into a Tele pocket, in which case the neck is actually too far from the bridge and it often results in intonation problems. Historically, Strat necks are not a drop-in fit on Tele's (although Tele necks will drop into a Strat and intonate fine, but there will be a slight gap at the end of the neck pocket. This is usually covered by the pickguard, assuming the pickguard has been cut for a Tele neck heel.)"

The former isn't all that difficult to do yourself, but the latter requires a bit more practice. Both require at least a couple tools you'll probably need to buy.  As far as the replacement neck goes, if it's brand new it'll probably need a level and crown too. Almost every new neck, no matter who made it, will require at least some fretwork (cheaper necks usually require a fair bit more than something like Warmoth or USACG, but even those usually need a little something.) If you're going to have to do a little fret work anyway, I'd suggest saving the $45 and putting it towards a crowning file, and learning how to level and crown your frets yourself. It's not all that difficult, and it'll save you a lot of money in the long run if you can do it yourself."

Luthier,39isci,StudMuffin9980,2,Fri Jun 12 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"I'll answer in the order that you posted:   That Zero Glide nut probably won't work. That one is designed for Fender-style instruments, where the nut is slotted into the fingerboard. Epiphones have their nuts at the end of the fretboard, and they're taller and thicker. That one also specifies a 9.5"" fretboard radius, whereas Epiphones use the standard Gibson radius of 12""; even if you could somehow get it to stay in place, it would feel awful because the curvature (radius) of the strings wouldn't match. Honestly I don't really understand the point of the Zero Glide nut, because it doesn't do anything that any other nut does and it's kind of a bodged-together...solution? I dunno, it doesn't solve a problem anybody was complaining about.   I'd suggest either getting a Graphtech TUSQ nut, or a bone nut. I'm partial to TUSQ, but either one will be an upgrade to the stock Epi nut. You can get pre-slotted ones, which will save quite a bit of work (you'll still have to sand the bottom to get the height right.) StewMac has pre-slotted bone nuts, although I'd look elsewhere for preslotted TUSQ: it's available from lots of sellers on Amazon who have a bigger selection and better prices than StewMac.   That trem should fit, but measure your guitar just to double-check before you order (GF is kind of notorious for being a pain in the ass to work with if you have to send something back for an exchange or refund.) The thickness should be fine, but make sure you have enough room from the back of the guitar to about where the current tailpiece is: according to the GF website, you'll need at least 6.75"" between the tailpiece and end of the guitar. Otherwise, their short version will work. Wiring depends. If it currently works and the pots function properly, there's really no reason to swap it out unless you want to ""just because"". It won't affect the tone at all. BTW, if you're thinking of buying the pots from GuitarFetish, you won't really be upgrading anything: GF sells the basic Alpha pots, which are fine, but they're also what are usually put into almost ever budget guitar ever. Unless you're going to spend extra on Bourns, CTS or brass-shafted Alphas, you'll most likely just be swapping like-for-like. Can't really help you with chalkboard finishes, but I'd recommend scuff-sanding the old finish and using that as a base. It'll save you a lot of work, and give you something reasonably flat to start with. Just scuff-sand, spray a coat or two of primer, and then use whatever chalkboard paint you decide to go with. I hate hate hate the feel of chalkboards though (and just thinking about it gives me the willies!), so you're kind of on your own after the primer part! The tuners that GF sells probably aren't going to be much of an upgrade. They're okay, but GuitarFetish in general sells ""budget"" hardware, much of which is made in the exact same factories as the hardware that comes on guitars like less-expensive Epiphones. If you want to get something nicer that isn't too expensive, look at either Gotoh or Grover: both brands can be had for around $35 a set if you shop around."

Use Frank Ford's method for establishing the new neck angle. Consider whether those holes in the neck block are too large. If so. Dowel and drill again. It is actually harder to establish the neck angle with a bolt neck, I've found, because the bolts on tightening will over-ride the changes to the neck face. Sometimes oversized washers, even custom made, possible angled and rotate-able so that, when tightened it works with rather than fights the new angle.    Please check all the bracing before you put the neck back on. It would be easier now to remove the back and glue/repair braces."

You start off by taping down the neck to protect the parts of the finish you don't want to damage with sandpaper. You then use your wet paper, starting with the lower grit and sanding up and down the neck. Make sure that you're sanding up and down the neck, and not across it. This is very important. After the first pass, wipe it down and check for areas that needs work. Look for inconsistencies in your work. Then using the higher grit sandpaper, continue sanding down your neck. You don't need to apply much pressure. Just let the sandpaper do the work. Be gentle but firm. Start with about 1200 grit paper and keep working to about 2-3K grit sand paper. You'll have a nice, smooth, and fast playing neck in no time."

The glossy finish gets sticky and uncomfortable to play, specially on humid days. This is what the sanding down process addresses. By removing that gloss finish the length of the neck, you'll have a faster more comfortable neck to play on. Sanding it down length-wise instead of across, also helps make the neck smoother, therefore faster, to play. Though if you'd like to keep things uniform, you could take out the strings and machine heads to sand down the entire neck, headstock and all. Then apply a new decal perhaps? I just see if unnecessary, but if looks matter to you, that's up to you."

Luthier,39eq9q,spigotface,2,Thu Jun 11 09:11:38 2015 UTC,I have a 17 year old strat that still sticks because of the gloss on the neck. Some finishes just don't wear off that easily.

I just graduated from college and am looking for something to take the place of my Godin LG Signature that I've played for the past 12 years, a new main beast, and I'm comfortable with paying serious money for a serious instrument. I'm amazed at how many high end guitars still have a glossy finish on the neck. Total dealbreaker. I played a $2000+ Music Man JP13 at Guitar Center a few weeks ago and it was amazing with the exception of the glossy neck (yes, I know the JP15 has a neck finished with only gunstock oil).  Some manufacturers make it a point to shy away from glossy necks  completely, though. I know Legator uses satin finishes on their necks across their entire line, even their entry-level stuff. Pretty sure Chapman does as well, although I could be mistaken."

Luthier,39eq9q,person9,2,Thu Jun 11 11:30:04 2015 UTC,"Sanding off the finish will unseal the wood. It will be more susceptible to climate after. This means more time spent on the truss. Worth it IMO. But also your hands will mess the wood up, so after you sand finish off replace it with tung oil or true oil or something like that. And you will have a reletively well sealed neck, but it will still be a little more finicky than a sprayed neck"
Luthier,39blx4,pssychesun,2,Wed Jun 10 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"You really can't tell much by your pictures.  If your neck pitch is bad, a reset is the way usually.  Lowering the saddle will only get you so far and you have to be careful of having too low of a saddle that your strings come out of the holes too shallow and don't make strong contact with the saddle.  A truly bad neck pitch can not be overcome with hydrating, neck adjusting, saddle lowering.  The bad part is, if you need it done it can be expensive and difficult and the guitar may not be worth it."
Luthier,39blx4,pssychesun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:28:29 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the straight edge measurement show how much it's off? The first pic? My understanding is that the straight edge along should reach the top of the saddle. How else would you know what's wrong?

Luthier,39blx4,pssychesun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"At this point it's either that or a neck reset. I'm willing to try either/or for practice because the guitar is useless as is. Anyways, thanks for your input."
Luthier,39blx4,pssychesun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:50:32 2015 UTC,"The straight edge in the first picture is perfect as it should land on the top of the bridge not the saddle. The problem may be ""belly"" wherein the top behind raises under tension raising the bridge with it: check the braces on the top. Saddle shaving ruins the ""break angle"" eventually. Don't be afraid of a neck reset. It's one of the most exciting things you can do by yourself. Suspense and drama included."

Luthier,39aynl,catdumpling,2,Wed Jun 10 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"That's an expensive glue up. Why quartersawn, and I assume this is for a neck-thru? Did you factor the head into the measurement?   To clarify, this piece would be 42"" long, 3"" wide and 4"" thick with the block made of {3/4"" (4 piece)/5/8"" (5 piece)} by 4"" strips."
Luthier,39aynl,RamblingMutt,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"You're correct this would be for a neck through, from the but a research of done on neck building 5 piece quarter sawn seems to be the most stable and least likely to twist because of the orientation of the grain, and yes those dimensions are correct. If you think this is something you can do shoot me a pm please"
Luthier,39aynl,catdumpling,2,Wed Jun 10 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'll shoot you a pm when I get home, just wanted to clarify something.  A 5 piece laminated neck uses flatsawn pieces glued together so that the grain runs perpendicular to the fretboard.   A quartersawn neck uses one piece of quartersawn so that the grain runs perpendicular to the fretboard.   A flatsawn neck uses one piece of flatsawn so that the grain is parallel with the fretboard.   When gluing quartersawn material into a laminate, you should chose even numbers since the grain will run at a 45 degree angle to the fretboard, that way it will make a ""V"" shape along the center axis.   Though I think you may simply mean you want a laminated 5 piece neck, not necesarrily quartersawn."

Luthier,397ims,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"An alternate approach that may be to your liking if you plan to ditch the pick guard. Pick up some Side Dots, drill and glue them in. Will make it a little decorative and flashy while retaining the original indication of the original look. You can always go back later and take the other suggestions if you wish to replace the pick guard at a later time. Just drill out the dots and you are back to filler."
Luthier,397ims,misrepresentedentity,0,Wed Jun 10 11:00:10 2015 UTC,I would pound some toothpicks into the holes then cut em off and sand the remaining material off if you are going to be painting it an opaque color. If you are concerned about matching the wood then drill it out slightly and insert a carefully trimmed dowel insert.
Luthier,397ims,skrunkle,2,Tue Jun 9 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with this, is that the finish will dip and pucker around the spaces between the toothpicks.  I've attempted this method many years ago and didn't get good results.  If you plugged with toothpicks and applied some sawdust mixed with titebond, let it dry and then planed/sanded flat I think it would work great."
Luthier,3975wl,teabears,2,Tue Jun 9 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, no.  Never refinish a vintage guitar, you'll cut the value in half at the very least and kill whatever mojo it has.  Seriously, beat up original always trumps shiny new looking non original.  As for tone, you'll probably negatively affect the sound (certainly the tone associated with a vintage piece) unless you are really good at refinishing."
Luthier,3975wl,pssychesun,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"Refinishing acoustic guitars is tricky and almost always doesn't look great.  The main reason is that it's tough to remove/apply finish around the fretboard extension and bridge.  If you remove the neck and bridge, then it's super easy, but most of the bad refinish jobs I've seen have had pooling or wood damage around the bridge and neck.  A refinish will effect the tone of the guitar in a relatively unpredictable way."
Luthier,3975wl,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:08:52 2015 UTC,While most would say don't do it. Frank Ford at Frets.com does have a couple of tutorials on re-amalgamiting an old finish: this is where you use the appropriate solvent to melt the original finish and spread it around the top. I've done it to a vintage Baumann and several Schmidt Stellas. Those are all shellac finishes. Basically you do like a french polish with a lot more denatured alcohol than a new finish. Frank Ford does it on a lacquer finish that has lifted and flaked with amazing results.
Luthier,3975wl,KendleC,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you!

Luthier,393o35,catdumpling,3,Tue Jun 9 03:36:53 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned, you'll never get it intonated properly. It'll fit, as far as the neck pocket goes, but the intonation will be way out.  If you don't want to spend a bunch on a new neck, search eBay for a Squier Vintage Modified Mustang neck. There are a few sellers that part out new Fenders and Squiers, and Squier necks typically sell in the $100 range (a little more if they include tuners.) Not Warmoth quality, but very usable and I find the current Squier necks to have a great feel; it may just need a bit of fretwork."
Luthier,393o35,coffeefuelsme,2,Tue Jun 9 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"Scale length is the distance between the nut and twelth fret multiplied times two.  If the neck is intact, do your best to measure the scale length from that.  All MIJ Mustang's I've worked on have had 24"" scale necks.  This would be impossible to intonate if you added a 25.5"" scale neck.    A maple/maple warmoth neck would be economical and a great fit for your guitar:  http://www.warmoth.com/Guitar/Necks/CBS_MustangNeck.aspx  In my experience, Fender has been very good at providing a replacement headstock decal, provided that the instrument is authentic.  A link to the process is here:  http://www2.fender.com/support/articles/fender-instrument-replacement-decal/  Hope that's helpful.  I'm a big fan of short scale fenders, they definitely have their own sound.  Good luck on your project."

Luthier,392w21,ohdaniels,2,Mon Jun 8 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that the soundboard on the upper bout is very active tonally, so I wouldn't expect a huge change from a floating fingerboard. Moving the soundhole will probably have a more profound change in the sound, but I couldn't say exactly what that would be.  It's also worth thinking that if you increase the amount of soundboard that is active you're still going to be putting the same amount of power in when playing.  I think a better way would be to make the back and sides thicker, reducing the energy lost in them an focusing it on the soundboard."
Luthier,392w21,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"If there was no soundhole, and more of the top was being employed in the vibration, then a floating fingerboard may yield some results. But yeah, in a typical design, the transverse brace kills the sound in the upper bout, before it gets close to the fingerboard like you said."
Luthier,392w21,bruddatim,2,Tue Jun 9 02:15:59 2015 UTC,"One possible advantage to a floating fretboard is that you may avoid the hump in the fretboard where the neck joins the body that you get in many guitars over time. Strong bracing under the floating part ( carbon fiber is sometimes used ) to stop the fingerboard from twisting may be nessecary.  I think that most full size flattop guitars are by necessity so heavily braced between the neck and soundhole that a floating fingerboard won't make much of a difference to the soundboard.  Soundhole location is pretty much decided by the type of bracing used, or vice versa, so an offset soundhole will have a significant effect as you can't change one without the other. But it can be difficult to predict specific tonal changes when many factors are changed at once.  As for sustain, I am inclined to not care about sustain in the build process and care more in the setup, bad nut/saddle slots and fretbuzz will reduce sustain pretty quickly for instance.  In general you get more sustain and less acoustic volume on heavy built instruments, and vice versa with light, but the changes in tone are far greater than the change you get in sustain for any change that would give a significant increase in sustain on an acoustic guitar."
Luthier,392w21,Luthier42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"Why not build a Benedetto type archtop? He floats the neck, relies on two transverse braces and (this part is critical) uses a tailpiece. At least you might gather some insight there on your adventure. Are you thinking of a dreadnought with a floating fretboard and a fixed bridge? You could spend years just testing sound hole  configurations.    There was a French researcher who built a stationery plaster of paris guitar body and tested multiple top configurations. A floating neck would make it possible to add differently configured tops like  modules, experiment with sound holes, bracing, thickness, etc. ie. a testbed guitar. I think he used moire patterns to check the nodes. Check out Helmholtz."

Luthier,38yqg9,Luthier42,2,Mon Jun 8 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen one in person, but looking at photos I think your only two areas of concern are going to be the nut and bridge: they'll need to be swapped for left-handed ones. The nut shouldn't be any more difficult to make than any other nut, although I don't know what material it's made of (I'm assuming either graphite or ebony.)  The bridge has a piezo element in it, which may or may not be problematic, depending on how the wiring is routed. You might be able to simply disconnect the element, flip the bridge, and connect it back to the wiring. But, that assumes Warwick thought ahead and left a hole on the other side to route the wire (or at least made it fairly easy to drill another one. It's hard to say without having taken that bridge apart.) Otherwise, you may need to contact Warwick and see if they either have a left-handed replacement bridge available, or perhaps a ""universal"" one that's shaped after installation. You might also want to see if they have a lefty nut or unslotted nut blank for that bass while you're at it, which could save a little time as far as that goes.  If you're able to take the bridge off and spread the pieces a little bit, then post a photo here, we might be able to help a little more."
Luthier,38y268,7SevenEleven11,3,Sun Jun 7 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"I would suggest against doing it.  There will be no noticeable benefit.  Not to mention nitro can be difficult :edit: (time consuming), and your chances of doing it correctly on your first go, are slim.    Sorry to take the wind out of your sails, but unless you are doing it to learn how to do it, I would suggest not doing it, or leaving it in the hands of a pro."
Luthier,38y268,These_defaults_suck,2,Mon Jun 8 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I just realized OP wants to do a transparent dye color. Sorry, but that's probably a little out of the realm of what's reasonable. The factory finish will need to be completely stripped (a tough job in itself), and a flame maple veneer most likely glued on. This is complicated by the fact that the Sheraton is an arched top instrument, and you'd need to do veneering in a vacuum bag setup. It can be done, of course, but the entire job would end up costing more than the Sheraton itself does. If the Sheraton had a nitro finish from the factory it would be quite a bit easier, but they're sprayed with a 2k poly that's designed to basically last forever; it's really hard to strip.   Nitro isn't any more difficult to do correctly than any other 1-part paint, and in fact it's very forgiving, which is one reason why hobby builders still like using it. It doesn't require any sanding between coats (unlike poly), it's easy to touchup, and it's easy to polish to a high shine.  But that aside, I agree that this probably isn't a good refinish job for a newbie. Factory poly finishes are very difficult to strip, and often require the use of a heat gun. That can be a problem with semi-hollow guitars like the Sheraton, because you can cause delamination if you're not careful, as well as easily melt the binding. Stripping can be done with nothing but sandpaper, but it's a tough job and being archtop makes it even more difficult to do without accidentally damaging something; it'll require a ton of sandpaper and a good quality random orbital sander, at the very least.  If OP wants to refinish it himself, the ""safest"" bet would be to sand down the factory finish slightly, then primer and paint directly over that. The factory finish will be an excellent base for other paint to stick to, and that'll minimize the chance for damage. Nitro can be applied over it, but a less expensive (and less toxic) option would be acrylic lacquers, such as Dupli-Color or Plastikote: their colors work great and don't cost a lot, although the clears sometimes having drying issues. A nitro clear can be applied over acrylic colors as long as the colors have had a good 4-6 weeks to thoroughly dry and off-gas. I have heard of people using the DupliColor clear for wheels with much better success than their regular clear acrylic lacquer, so that might be worth experimenting with.  Otherwise if OP is intent on using nitro, ReRanch is about the best bet in the US for colors (unless he's willing to have it custom-mixed by someone like Sherwin-Williams.) Minwax spray-on lacquer is nitro and is available at a lot of hardware stores, so a lot of people use ReRanch for colors and Minwax for clear to save some cash (ReRanch ain't cheap.)"

Luthier,38y268,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"Not using a veneer would definitely be easier, but stripping the factory finish isn't going to be easy. The fact that ES-3xx type instruments are made of laminated veneers complicates things: even if you want to keep your current top, you'd have to be very careful that you don't sand through the top wood layer. Even if you think you've gotten all the factory finish off and you haven't burned through the top wood layer, there's a good chance you may run into some kind of sanding sealer, which could very well cause any stain to be really blotchy.  If you get through the factory finish and keep your top layer intact, your best bet would be a tinted clearcoat, rather than directly staining or dyeing the wood. You'd have to use something like TransTint to tint the lacquer (or whatever clear you're spraying), which means no spraycans: you'd have to mix lacquer yourself, and either spray it from a spray gun setup, or a PreVal sprayer (the latter of which is going to be expensive, because you'll most likely go through several PreVal cans to finish a guitar that size.)"

Luthier,38y268,catdumpling,2,Mon Jun 8 02:06:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, lacquer in general is very time-consuming to do properly, which is one of its major downsides (that, and it's not a very durable finish, technically speaking.) The dry times are a PITA, but spraying and finish-sanding/buffing are easy, as are touchups if they're needed.  The dry time is one of the big reasons most manufacturers went to 2k (catalyzed) polyester or polyurethane finish: it goes on thick, and they could spray just a couple coats, let it cure overnight, and it was rock hard the next day. Then UV-cured stuff came along, and you can now spray a finish, sending it through a UV curing ""oven"", and 20 minutes later it's ready for final buffing and polishing. It literally took finishing from a 4-6 week process, down to less than half a day from raw wood to showroom shine, with the added benefit that it's way more durable (although that last part bugs people who like the way nitro ages. To each their own, I personally don't really care one way or the other as far as looks go.)  If modern 2k poly's have a major downside, it's that they're much harder to repair/touch up, because new coats don't ""melt"" into previous layers; once a 2k finish has cured, it's gone through a chemical change and is a different chemical from the liquid it started as. OTOH, lacquer is solvent-based and dries by evaporation: if you apply thinner to it (or a new layer of lacquer, which contains that solvent/thinner), the solvent reactivates the previous layer. Once the solvent from that new layer evaporates, the new lacquer has physically become part of the previous lacquer.  You can actually get 2k poly in spray cans now, but it's expensive. The can has a small plunger on the bottom, and when you're ready to spray you push the plunger up; this punctures an inner cylinder of catalyst and mixes it with the poly. Downside is that once you've punctured that cylinder, you've started the chemical process and you better be ready to do all of your spraying within about 18 hours. Most of those 2k spray cans fully cure in 24 hours, and anything left in the can after that is hardened and useless. But with 2k, you only need a few coats at most and the recoat window is only an hour, so you can easily clear a whole guitar in an afternoon and it'll be ready for final polishing in a day or two."

Luthier,38y268,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"Can I do two part poly safely without a respirator?    NO! 2k poly is nasty stuff, as far as toxicity goes (2k generally contains isocyanates, which shouldn't be taken lightly!) Nitro is pretty toxic too, but 2k is especially insidious because particles of it will harden in your lungs: it doesn't take much to send you to the hospital, or cause some serious health issues.  3M has some replaceable-cartridge respirators that run about $40, and I'd highly recommend one of those (as well as plenty of ventilation, or even spray outdoors if at all possible...unless you have a professional spray booth, but we probably wouldn't be having this conversation if you did ;) .)"

I've seen it cost anywhere from $20-$30 per can, so I'd say just check several websites and see who has the best price. If you have a local auto paint supply shop, they can probably get it for you too."

I've found it easier than other sprayed finished to get correct because it melts into the previous layer. Both the guitars I've finished in Nitro were easy and turned out perfect.  That said, in this situation I highly suggest the OP does not try to refinish the guitar, stripping poly can be almost impossible sometimes and it's really easy to mess up. Better to just leave the guitar as is."
Luthier,38za5q,person9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"As far as the 12 string, you might have a neck twist issue. The fact that it's a 12-string means there's more tension on the neck than would be with a 6-string, but it may not be apparent when it was taken apart. If the twist is slight, you can often fudge adjustments or get creative with fret leveling to offset it. If it's a major twist, the fix would be to put the neck under string tension (without the strings, so in a neck jig), then sand the fretboard with the appropriate radius block. Obviously that would require another refret, so it's generally reserved for higher-quality or sentimental instruments. The only other repair beyond that is to remove the fretboard, try to get the neck untwisted (either with heat and clamps, or planing), then new fretboard/fret slots/fret job...again, that's a last-resort kind of fix and obviously not a cheap one!  The Martin should be much easier, and removing nuts on a Fender-style neck isn't that difficult. First, if it's got a maple fretboard that has a clear finish, score around the nut with a sharp (new) Xacto; that'll keep finish from chipping off, as well as make the nut easier to remove if some finish was holding it in place. Then, I take a small block of wood and a hammer (I have a tiny 4oz ball peen that I use for stuff like this), and put the block of wood against the fretboard side of the nut; give the block a few gentle taps, towards the headstock (just not so hard that you risk shearing off that piece of fretboard behind the nut.) You can alternate tapping from the front and back of the nut, although I try to avoid tapping towards the bridge (behind the nut), just to avoid damaging the leading edge of the fretboard, which could theoretically cause intonation issues if you get carried away with it.  Once I've tapped the nut a couple times that way, I'll take a small punch or piece of brass rod (even a small piece of hardwood dowel works fine), and tap the side of the nut. Usually at that point it'll pop free and you can slide it out, but sometimes you need to go back and forth a bit on each side to free it up. Again, you usually don't need to whack at it really hard: doing that usually ends up with your punch slipping and poking right into the neck or scraping across the fretboard. I'm one of those people that uses CA glue to hold in nuts (just two small drops), and it never takes me more than a couple taps to pop a nut loose that I've installed.   Bone nuts can sometimes be a little harder to pop loose, because bone is porous and certain glues tend to stick pretty well to it. Plastics and graphite/Corian/TUSQ usually pop loose easily because they're smooth and glue often doesn't hold as tenaciously to them. As long as the nut isn't epoxied in (which is the worst thing anyone can do with a nut!), it'll come loose; sometimes it just takes a few more minutes of tapping to break the glue loose. If it's epoxied...well, good luck with that! FWIW, most factories use small amount of either white (Elmer's) or yellow (wood) glues, or CA, so it's not usually an issue: difficult-to-remove nuts are more often the result of a misguided DIY attempt that went heavy on the adhesives. One glaring exception: for a while now, Gibson has been epoxying their Corian nuts in (because they want you to send it back for warranty repair, which you have to pay for, of course.) They basically shave off the top half of a worn nut, and adhesive-weld a new piece of Corian on that, then send it through the PLEK machine. It's stupid and ridiculously difficult to repair if you don't happen to be in the Gibson factory. Thanks Henry, you fu....! /s  Anyway, the nut should be fairly simple, and there are plenty of pre-slotted replacement nuts that can save some time. The 12-string neck might be a little more complicated, and I'd suggest really checking it out with a notched straightedge to see if it's warped or has a gradual hump in the fretboard or something."
Luthier,38za5q,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:20:22 2015 UTC,"Luckily I'm doing this as a learning experience mostly.  I have a few items sitting in the closet waiting for more advanced repairs such as a little no name acoustic that needs a neck reset, a first act body that is cracked so I might try gluing, a few misc necks that need to find mates, a LP body that happens to be a different scale length then the necks I have, and a little tiesco that needs a full refret.  Anyways I've checked before to see if the neck is twisted but I'll check again to make sure I didn't miss a very minor twist and go over with the slotted straight edge I made.  Little light duty but gets the job done for now.  I'd rather not have to do a full refret but I'll most likely chase issues until I'm happy with it and then sell it to make back something.  It was a plastic nut.  I took it off last night.  I used a small piece of wood and a soft faced hammer.  I tapped it from the front a dozen times and then tried to tap from the side....and nothing.  A few more light taps and it blew up into a dozen pieces.  Kinda hoping that one was already fractured due to all the abused it'd seen but maybe I was a bit too forceful.    Ha, Gibson is going nuts...   I ordered a non-preslotted replacement as I need more practice slotting nuts and have the proper files and a new string spacing ruler.  I have a feeler gauge set that I always use to make sure I don't go too far down.  Plus if I bend them it's $6 to replace instead of the $30 at Stew Mac(nothing against them just some things are a bit silly).  I'll probably see what I can get done with the 12 string but now I'm a bit concerned.  If it gets REALLY bad I'll see if one of my misc necks fits the body as it's a kit and sell that to pay to learn to fix the neck.  Though I suppose that would fix the fact that guitar has a terrible bridge for a 12 string....Hopefully it won't come to that!"
Luthier,38za5q,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"Just thought I'd give you an update.  I checked the neck and it seems pretty fine.  I got the relief to measure .014"" with the feeler gauge which is probably good for the 12 string I would think.  The only true buzz is the low strings open and the first few frets...but I quickly discovered that's the course of strings buzzing against each other for a second when picked hard.  Furthermore there isn't a true buzz on the high e's.  Rather it's like when picked they're just tapping the next fret for just a second.  I get this little metallic accent/ping that is audible acoustically and plugged in.  It's not the end of the world it's just...irritating to have it sound different on the b strings and the e strings.  I'm not sure if I should put a bit of a fallaway on the end of the fretboard or what...or if it even matters because who plays a 12 string up past the 10th fret or so?  In any case it plays well and for open strumming it sounds great just a bit frustrated with the fine details of this one.  No news on the Stinger.  New nut is due Wednesday."
Luthier,38za5q,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:14:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. Is the ""off"" sound near the nut, or the other end of the neck? If it's near the nut, you may just need some kind of string retainer to put a little more downward tension on the nut. Some strings just have a bad habit of ringing behind the nut, which can be annoying. If it's a non-tilt headstock, that could definitely be a cause, and something like a Floyd Rose retainer bar would be an easy (and cheap) way to take care of the problem across all 12 strings. Otherwise you could fabricate a more tradtional Fender-style retainer (except that fits pairs of strings) out of TUSQ or bone or something.  0.014"" still seems a bit much for an electric, even a 12-string, unless you're using really heavy strings. But, that shouldn't really have anything to do with the noise you're hearing (assuming the fretwork is okay, at least), and as long as the intonation is good, then it just boils down to personal preference. However, with that much relief, you really shouldn't be having the strings hit the next fret unless the saddle height is too low; if the saddle height is reasonable (say about 4/64"" at the 17th fret), then the only other answer is one or more frets that are just a hair high.  Check behind the nut though, and see if you're getting sympathetic vibrations back there. It can often sound like fret buzz when it's actually the strings behind the nut. An easy way to check is to just lay a piece of masking tape across the strings behind the nut (doesn't need to be stuck down hard, just so it touches the tops of all the strings.)"
Luthier,38za5q,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:45:11 2015 UTC,"The off noise is near the body.  Really about the tenth fret and above.  I've often thought this guitar could use a string retainer set for the G and D strings but I haven't gotten a set I like for it yet.  It's only when I first pick the string.  It is a non-tilt headstock.  I've thought about just installing a bar behind the frets like is sometimes seen with guitar with zero frets and flat headstocks.  I would hope the fretwork is okay...but it is only the second neck I ever did work on and I could be missing something easily.  The intonation is reasonable but I suppose I could adjust the relief a bit.  Every guide I read has a different number range on what is ""appropriate"" for relief it seems.   The action is much higher than 4/64ths but I'm not sure by how much.  I'll take a measurement in the morning.  Perhaps I just didn't get the frets on the body down enough compared to the others...even though I was using a sanding beam...  I'll also try the masking tape thing in the morning but again the noise is only on the upper frets and only on the two E strings.  More and more I'm worried that I simply missed a section when leveling frets on that corner of the neck.  Which makes me worry about the Stinger that needed similar work since I haven't been able to truly test it yet."
Luthier,38za5q,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:27:22 2015 UTC,Another reason why I'm starting to suspect it's frets is the LAST fret on the fretboard does not have this ping at all but between 10 and the second to last fret they all have that ping.  Sounds almost the same.  I'd swear it looks like it's a problem with the action when the notes are fretted but unfretted the action is way to high.
Luthier,38za5q,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:40:48 2015 UTC,"You might have a slight hump at the end of the fretboard. If it's a bolt-on, sometimes that area can curve up a bit when it's bolted together. A little bit of fall-away could fix it and is easy enough to do. I'd check that area of the neck again with a straightedge, with the guitar strung up to pitch. The neck may have been flat when you refretted, but has a hump when it's strung up. It happens."
Luthier,38za5q,KendleC,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:48:15 2015 UTC,"If that's the case I need to make or buy a little spot leveler.  I made a sanding beam out of some sand paper, contact adhesive, and a roll of sandpaper but I don't have a good short piece.  I could do it by hand with a flat file but I'm not sure if it's THAT flat."
Luthier,38z1zi,FamedRedditor,2,Mon Jun 8 01:26:46 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. The only time bridge choice factors into your neck is if you're using a Floyd Rose or similar vibrato unit that uses a locking nut.   Certain bridge types may need the neck to be angled slightly, but with Bolt-On necks like you get from Warmoth, you can either shim the neck pocket or build the body with the appropriate neck angle milled into the neck pocket."
Luthier,38z1zi,tigojones,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:31:45 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks!
Luthier,38z1zi,KendleC,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is bridge placement because that is determined by the neck scale you select. The bridge type will, of course, determine what kind of routing and drilling, and templates to use on the body. But to have a playable guitar, think scale... read on intonation. As a beginner I'd get something with adjustable saddles vs. fixed."

Unfortunately, the reality is it took this much to reach a conclusion on color - and this entire build is 100% of the effort, good or bad, warts and all. I am sensitive to the fact that this part was pretty un-enjoyable. Imagine being the one going THROUGH it!

I'd buy from a luthiery supplier rather than a sawmill or something so you don't need to worry about resawing and drying the wood.  It's quite easy to get Indian rosewood that is from plantation (ie. sustainable) growth, though if you don't know the source very well, it's very difficult to verify.  Good European woods you can use for back and sides...  Maple/sycamore  Walnut (English, American Black)  Cypress  Yew  Cherry  Maple and cherry make good necks.  If you can find a large enough piece, sloe makes nice fingerboards, laburnum also makes good fingerboards/bridges and can look quite similar to rosewood.  For the top, spruce is the go to choice, western red cedar is also good, but a bit more prone to damage, so not ideal for a steel string guitar."

The woods aren't going to have much impact on the sound, so you're really looking for the weight and hardness to be right more than anything.  Necks and fingerboards are the same."

The worst part was carving those inlays. What a pain in the ass that is! I had no prayer of making them uniform--and then routing the fretboard to get them to fit right was well beyond my dexterity.

Like cause issues later on?"
Luthier,38s30u,XDohSnapp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"Those little dents shouldn't cause any structural problems. If you like the guitar that much, I'd suggest keeping it and either ignoring the dents, or drop-filling them with CA (cyanoacrylate, aka ""super glue"".) You'll probably have to do 5-10 ""coats"" of super glue, but you can get it filled in and carefully sand it flush (or carefully scrape with a single-edge razor blade.) You could polish it out if you want, but because it's on the neck, it'll naturally polish up as you play. As long as you're careful and don't dribble super glue everywhere, they'll be nearly invisible once you're done.  Note: I highly suggest getting good CA glue, not the dollar store/99-cent stuff! Any of the brands model builders and woodworkers use are good: Satellite City, Mercury, Zap, Bob Smith Industries, StickFast, and Fastcap are all quality glues. For stuff you can find at the hardware store, the Elmer's super glue is actually pretty decent, as is the Loctite and Titebond-brand CA's.  Drop-filling isn't difficult, although I suggest using toothpicks to drop in the glue instead of applying directly from the container: much less chance of spilling CA everywhere (although acetone will clean it up, and won't hurt the modern poly finish that's most likely on your guitar. Just keep acetone away from plastics like binding and inlay dots.) CA glue takes a while to cure when it's not actually gluing two parts together, so it might take a few hours one evening to do the whole job. To speed it way up, you can buy a bottle of CA/super glue accelerator, which will cause the glue to instantly cure as soon as you spritz it on. With accelerator, you could finish the job (including scraping/sanding it flush) in under an hour.  A bottle of CA, a bottle of accelerator and some WetOrDry sandpaper (and maybe a razor for scraping) should only run about $10 or so. Don't use the ""thin"" viscosity CA, it's like water and will get everywhere (mostly where you don't want it!) Use the ""medium"" or even ""thick"" (or gel) type."

Luthier,38prxd,Wumbotw,2,Fri Jun 5 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"There are a couple questions here.   First: Is it still usable? this answer to this is going to be up to you. Since it is a squire neck, it could be prone to having some fret issues, or neck issues. Without actually taking a look at the neck it is hard to say. Just ask yourself if it plays well on the existing guitar? does it fret out? and do you like the way it feels?  Second: Can you extend the number of frets this guitar has? The short answer is, practically...no, and impractically....maybe, if you were extremely good at work working. I can give you a longer explanation of why this is a bad idea, and probably more trouble than its worth if you want. And to do it properly, you would end up spending more money on material, and tools then you would buying a replacement neck.  If you do want to use this neck on your new project, my advice is to just deal with the fact it is 20 frets, and build it with the same scale length as the squire."

Luthier,38prxd,Seanrtaylor,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:52:16 2015 UTC,No problem. If you ever have any guitar related questions shoot em my way.
Luthier,38prxd,KendleC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:52:03 2015 UTC,This is a short scale. If you measure from fret 12 to the bridge saddle you will see that the bridge is too far back: you could never intonate this chimera. If the measurement is exactly the same from the 12th to the center of the saddle then it would work. Plus when was the last time you used frets above 20?
Luthier,38ntcq,Condie,2,Fri Jun 5 12:31:47 2015 UTC,What do you want to do with the 4 way?

Luthier,38mv9a,fumblefinger,2,Fri Jun 5 06:15:21 2015 UTC,"If the humming diminished when you touched the strings, then it is grounded. Check the solder connection for the ground wire, and make sure it's solid. If it is, it may be the pickgaurd. Is the pickgaurd shielded? If so, check to make sure that no electrical connections are touching it besides the ground. Since the problem arose when you installed a new pickgaurd, it is probably the source of the humming. Test this by removing the pickgaurd and replacing it with the old one. If the humming is still present with the old pickgaurd, something may have been damaged when installing the new pickgaurd. Check the wiring for shorts, as well as any exposed wire where there shouldn't be. It may also be 60hz hum. Try plugging in the guitar and using the neck and middle or bridge and middle positions on the switch. If the humming goes away, then it's just 60hz hum, which is normal for any single coil.  This is all i could think of off the top of my head. Let me know if you figure it out!"
Luthier,38mv9a,shostakovik,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:01:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was doing it in all of the pick up positions, for what that's worth. The pick guard is shielded as well. I didn't think to check and see if there was any wires touching the actual pick guard though, so I'll have to do that.   Also. When I was messing with it today I noticed that sometimes when I switch to the bridge pickup it crackles and pops loudly. =/"
Luthier,38mv9a,shostakovik,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:07:17 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Does it crackle and pop when switching to the bridge pickup, or does it crackle constantly while playing the bridge pickup? If it's the former, it's the switch, if it's the latter, it could be the wires connecting the pickup, or the pickup itself. If it's the pickup itself attempting to repair it is not worth it, unless you're OK with potentially destroying the pickup. If it's the switch, a new one can be purchased for real cheap."
Luthier,38mv9a,shostakovik,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"Just when switching. And apparently only when my finger is actually touching the metal park of the switch, like under the knob."

Luthier,38lwds,wekillpeoplewithguns,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:52:58 2015 UTC,I don't think so.  I would think that you would have to replace the neck and move the bridge forward to where the bridge pickup would be.
Luthier,38itsm,the-derpinator,2,Thu Jun 4 14:33:38 2015 UTC,Putting wax under shellac isn't a good idea.  Usually you use shellac as a sealer or top coat and apply wax after to protect it.  Refinishing jobs take a lot of time and the results on tone are unpredictable if you haven't done it before.  You could botch it and be out money or you can view it as a $100 learning experience whether you succeed or fail.  Good luck.
Luthier,38itsm,coffeefuelsme,2,Thu Jun 4 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"you're unlikely to make any real impact on the tone with your finish unless you apply something really thick and heavy.   I'd suggest doing tru-oil or if you're feeling up for a bit more of a challenge, French polish.   It's a little tricky to work around the bridge when French polishing, but it's not impossible.  You can fill the pores with pumice or epoxy. I prefer pumice as it's less messy, but it takes a little longer.  Don't put any wax under the oil or shellac."
Luthier,38itsm,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"What is your method for grainfilling with pumice?  I use this method with shellac and 4F pumice, but I'm curious if there's another method that doesn't involve oil finishes and has a longer cure time so I don't have to work as fast."
Luthier,38itsm,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"A pad with a bit of shellac and a lot of isopropyl alcohol. Sprinkle a bit on, work in with the pad. build up a fine paste and spread it around. Because the colour is picked up from the wood dust that the pumice abrades you get near perfect colour matching on the pores. You can sand down if you have pumice build up, but if you're careful and do it in 2 or 3 sessions (it shrinks down into the pores after a little while) and wipe down with alcohol afterwards you can keep it pretty clean."
Luthier,38itsm,Clockwork_Monkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say just try a couple of coats of paste wax before you do anything else.  It's ultimately temporary, especially for something that'll be handled, and you might be surprised how well that alone will improve  any cracking or crazing that's going on.    If you're unhappy with the tone after that, at least you don't have to live with it forever and you aren't really out anything for your effort."
Luthier,38itsm,lotus2471,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"What make and model is it? Some instruments come with a matte / satin finish that's perfectly fine, but if you have only seen or felt instruments with a glossy finish before I can see how you might mistake it for a shoddy finish. I have no idea what your level of experience is with these kind of things, just want to make sure you aren't doing something irreversible when you don't need to.  I bought a Makala by Kala MK-B model baritone for a bit under $100 and it came with a satin finish that I quite like."
Luthier,38itsm,PeanutNore,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"Didn't catch if this was a new instrument or used/vintage, but wax is good to add shine and protection. No silicone containing products should be used if you want to refinish down the road.   You want to find out what kind of original finish is on the instrument before adding a layer. This will help you with choosing solvents and compatible finishes to use.  If the uke stays in a safe environment, then wax only might be fine. Shellac is a little fragile for travel. There are endless options for wipe on varnishes as well. Shellac is easy enough to remove if it doesn't work out.   Sounds like you are set on refinishing, so as long as you make sure to stay very very extra light or just avoiding anything to do with sanding or scraping or heat."
Luthier,38itsm,Absolving_Truth,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"Gummy comes to mind. beeswax is not a pore filler, danger. I'd recommend the Dunlop box of cleaners and waxes for instruments. Lots of rubbing using these products in order will improve the look and feel and do no harm."
Luthier,38h4c4,penguinbass1,3,Thu Jun 4 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"This may end well. The string tension may raise the top. I'd just proceed and recheck under tension. Even so, it is quite possible this will be a nice player even with cavitation. Keep going nice start."
Luthier,38h4c4,KendleC,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"This is my first build and I've noticed my top has a bit of concave to it. It may be hard to see, but I placed a straight edge from end to end down the center. The gap at the bottom of the sound hole is about 1/16"" and near the bridge location it is just shy of 1/8"".    I believe the concave is just due to the compounding of mistakes I made along the way. These include: Not realizing the top should have some radius to it as well. Not bending the sides perfectly so they would have very little tension in them. Not having a great mold to hold the sides square while the kerfing and plates were glued to the sides.    Is there much I can do to fix this at this point? And if I can't, how is this probably going to impact my guitar. Also if I missed anything in my mess-up list that probably added to this issue, let me know and I'll add that to the list of what not to do next time."
Luthier,38h4c4,nailattack,2,Thu Jun 4 04:22:27 2015 UTC,Many well known luthiers don't radius their top as they feel it is unnecessary. I wouldn't really worry about it and proceed. I don't think there is anything else you can do about it since the box is closed anyway.
Luthier,38h4c4,Username_Used,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:14:31 2015 UTC,Might work out in the end.  You may want a slightly thicker bridge to start tough our you might end up with a mile high saddle.  Lay your bridge on there and take some measurements before gluing it on.
Luthier,38h4c4,JuntaEx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:15:10 2015 UTC,When i was in school we would sand the convex shape into the work table itself with a rotating radius block (all custom made). This way when gluing the bracing (also sanded in the convex area) the top was guaranteed to have it's proper curvature.   What technique are you using to mount the bracing?
Luthier,38duzc,valde_,10,Wed Jun 3 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"Guitar tech here. Regluing a bridge is actually much easier than you'd think. The first time I did it I thought to myself ""THIS is what I was worried about?""   You need to pop off the bridge and clean it off before you glue it back up, and you need a couple special clamps, but it's not difficult. I'm on mobile so going into detail is difficult right now but you can find tons of tutorials online."

Luthier,38duzc,BDeans75,4,Wed Jun 3 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"I got this guitar for around 20€ at a local music store.  I bought it for a friend's bachelor party (the damage was already there) and surprisingly it survived the ordeal with no further damage.  The guitar still sounds and plays fine so I transferred it to our summer cabin to have an acoustic on hand there.  Now I was wondering whether I could possibly try my hand at fixing this myself to make sure it doesn't break off during the cold, dry winters for example.  We have basic tools and such available and could spring for a new part if necessary, but how doable is this for someone with no experience in instrument repairs and little experience with woodwork overall?"
Luthier,38duzc,piccini9,2,Wed Jun 3 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with r/shredtilldeth. It's an easy fix, especially if you have a couple of wooden clamps with long jaws lying around. If not, a google search of 're-attaching guitar bridge' will probably show you a bunch of clever ways to do it. Good luck!"
Luthier,38duzc,shredtilldeth,2,Wed Jun 3 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"You can do this. One thing I'll warn against from personal experience is, don't use Titebond II. Use the original Titebond. I re-glued the bridge on my Recording King and it started to lift again fairly quickly. Something to so with 'cold creep' or something like that.  I'm sure others will suggest different types of glue."
Luthier,38duzc,piccini9,2,Wed Jun 3 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"Ah! I forgot to mention types of glues (I'm not on mobile at the moment so I can elaborate, hooray!) Yes you are correct, I recommend Titebond I as well.   The only difference between Titebond I, II, and III are at what temperature they heat up again. Titebond I being re-liquified at the lowest temperature (about the temperature of a hot car on a hot day / a heat gun), and III at the highest, (beyond the smoke point of wood).   I'll often do headstock repairs with Titebond II, so that if the instrument is accidentally (or unavoidably i.e. the guitar is left in a trailer while the owners band is on tour) left in a hot environment the repair itself won't come undone. However bridge re-glues I usually use Titebond I so that the repair can be un-done if needed.  Also, and don't take this the wrong way, but usually when a bridge re-glue comes undone it usually comes down to the quality of the re-glue job. Often it just wasn't clean enough or wasn't clamped properly or well enough. I've used TBII lots and haven't had an issue."

Luthier,38frlf,KendleC,2,Thu Jun 4 03:33:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say your summary is ok but you need to open up the crack a little and pick out any crossed wood fibers. It needs to COMPLETELY close under light pressure. Sometimes you have to make it worse for that to be possible. Remove all the tuners. Make a back and front caul. Practice your clamping routine before bringing glue into the room. I always use hot hide glue. Check out Frets.com section ""of interest to luthiers"". Therein you will find out how to prep, clamp and use hide glue. It can be done with a microwave. I use the rim liner of a bicycle wheel as a wrapping: pulled tight, progressively, and tied it puts tremendous pressure on the crack. Others use strips of inner tube."

Luthier,38fjwc,mtguitbox,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:18:13 2015 UTC,"I've worked on guitars with 90 year old Grovers and they hardly needed tending, just tighten and lubricate, very nice. Mechanically, there are wonderful offerings and practically infinite choices. Start by narrowing your search and find out what your fitment is; metric, inch, and screw pattern. If you can, try to not swiss cheese your guitar with a different screw pattern, more holes. There are measurements in Stewart McDonald's web page and catalog."
Luthier,38fjwc,KendleC,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good tuners out there. My favorites are Hipshot (especially their locking tuners) and Gotoh (great price-to-quality ratio, made in Japan). Grovers are great too, and Wilkinsons are a good choice if you're on a tight budget (although you can find Gotohs and Grovers for only $5-$10 more per set if you shop around.)  The modern Klusons are actually made in Taiwan, and while they're fine tuners, I think they're really overpriced for what they are; you're paying for the historic name (which WD Music now owns), not really better quality. Honestly, I think Gotoh and Grover both make nicer ""Kluson-style"" tuners than the current Kluson company does, and at a lower price! Schaller has been having some quality control issues the past couple of years, so I have a hard time recommending them right now (especially given how expensive they are.)  Most quality tuners will function just fine, and will last for years. Modern manufacturing methods mean even ""budget"" tuners work much better than they used to, so it's difficult to get bad tuners as long as you go with a known brand. The gear ratio used to be a big deal (higher ratio being more precise tuning), but again modern manufacturing has kind of made that a moot point: I've used tuners of various gearing ratios and they all worked fine. I don't feel like gear ratio is the main thing to be concerned with anymore, and most manufacturers use similar ratios anyway.  Stew-Mac carries a lot of tuners, although they tend to be a little more expensive. Allparts is the same (although if you go through an authorized Allparts dealer, which most music stores are, it's less expensive than ordering directly.) Ant Hill Music and HDCustom Guitar Supply are good sellers for Hipshot tuners; Philadelphia Luthier Tools, MojoTone and AmplifiedParts all carry a lot of Gotoh hardware, and pretty much everyone carries Grover stuff. I've purchased parts from most of these places and they're all solid dealers: just shop around and see who has the best prices when you're ready to buy.  As for price, I wouldn't pay more than $60-ish for a set of tuners these days (unless I was looking for super high-end fancy stuff like Schertler or Waverly.) I think around $35-$40 is a good price range for quality non-locking tuners, and add $15-$20 if you're looking at locking tuners. I feel like anything much above those prices is just getting into the realm of diminishing returns and usually not worth it (a couple ""boutique"" brands not withstanding.)"

This will help you get the best result on your first go round (unless you have lots of woodworking experience).   Here is just something I learned when i built my first:   don't try to do too much ""badass"" stuff.  This seems like a cool idea but it can easily backfire. I don't play my first guitar. Mainly because it is too painful to look at.   Take your time.  You get the skeleton and you get eager to finish then you rush it and it can turn out poorly.   I wish you luck and if you have any specific questions just PM me and I'd be happy to help. I started building at your age and haven't looked back."
Luthier,38bajs,Jerhn,2,Wed Jun 3 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"Get a good tuner. Preferably a strobe.   Tune open string. Lightly fret string at the 12th fret and check tuning. If the 12th fret is sharp, tighten the intonation screw to lengthen the overall string length. If the 12th fret is flat, loosen the intonation screw to shorten the overall string length. Start over until the string is in tune when both open and fretted at the 12th.   For a Tele with uncompensated saddles, you have to pick a good in-between for each string. You likely won't be able to get both strings on a saddle perfectly intonated. Intonate one string, check the other, and adjust to find somewhere that get both string close to being intonated.  Hope that helps."
Luthier,38bajs,wdmcarth,2,Wed Jun 3 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"Not a luthier; more of a lurker, really. But I do setups on all my own gear and get good results. Hopefully someone with real credentials will come along and confirm / correct the following.  A tele is not really any different from any other guitar in terms of intonating, except maybe in the case of a 3 barrel saddle setup (compared to a bridge with 6 individual saddles). In that case, you have to go with a best fit / best balance between the 2 strings. You can also consider compensated or adjustable saddles; can be a nice perk, but really only truly necessary (IMO) if all other options are exhausted, or you're a perfectionist.  Did you have a specific question?"
Luthier,38bajs,reid-o,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:25:01 2015 UTC,"If you have the 3 barrel saddles, pick up a set of these:  http://www.stewmac.com/Hardware_and_Parts/All_Hardware_and_Parts_by_Instrument/Electric_Guitar/Saddles/Compensated_Bridge_Saddles_for_Tele_Set_of_3.html  They're inexpensive and are a big help in intonating those vintage style ash tray bridges."
Luthier,387yom,snurfle,7,Tue Jun 2 14:27:58 2015 UTC,"Wow for someone who doesn't play your info is super solid, the only reasons I could think of for the buzz are neck angle being ever so slightly out (possible but unlikely) or that somewhere you adjusted something wrong Do you have the bridge set up to math the radius of the neck?  And did you balance the string pull to the spring pull for the tremelo? (Because that will make the tremelo stay in tune much better)"
Luthier,387yom,blacksun2012,3,Tue Jun 2 14:41:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  When I set the action, I tried to follow the radius, but found a few sources that recommended backing off the lower strings just because they have a much larger waveform than the higher strings.  So I do have a radius form across the strings at the bridge, but it gradually gets larger on the lower strings.  I have done nothing with the tremolo yet; I see a few places suggesting loosening 4 of the 6 screws for smoother use, and even a few that suggest raising it to give both push and pull action.  For now, it is decked, and I actually removed the arm altogether just to keep it out of the way while I was working on the guitar.  In all honesty, I am a little excited to try it out and see how it acts with the roller nut, but the engineer in me says ""get every other issue resolved first!""    (The engineer in me says a lot of things that I ignore, but if I'm going to learn how to play even a  little bit then I think I will listen this time; my OCD won't let me move past a little string buzz and onto actually picking up a pick!)  But down the road, I will tackle the tremolo springs next.  Could you recommend some good info about that?"
Luthier,387yom,blacksun2012,3,Tue Jun 2 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"You might want to try just raising the action, the buzz should go away, you stings may just be too light/heavy for the fender suggested specs which is why they're buzzing  And the idea with the trem is balance. Balancing the tensions of the springs and strings is going to provide you stability the back of the bridge should raise off the body a tiny bit (about the thickness of a business card) if you go too much more or less of balance when you use the tremolo the springs/stings will pull everything sharp or flat when it comes to rest. And that little bit of lift may raise your action just enough to help your buzz"

I've never played an electric guitar set to factory specs that didn't buzz at least a bit unplugged. Idk about this 13th fret issue you have, sounds to me like wrong neck angle or too much relief. I've never experienced anything quite like it but strats are also famous for needing neck shims.   Also when you say it's a strat, is it a fender stratocaster or a squire strat. I wouldn't expect a perfect setup from the squire without doing a lot of work first. Also guitars can go in and out with the weather. My necks definitely move around almost daily. Some days they buzz some days they don't. To me that's a good set up, as low as I can go right to the point where the ambient temperature actually matters. If they are too buzzy I raise the bridge a touch."
Luthier,387yom,WillyTheDisk,3,Tue Jun 2 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"Right - my bad.  It's a Fender strat.  The buzz is DEFINITELY audible over the amp, the 2 E strings are hitting the 13th fret.  Could you please clarify - Neck shims?  I've not come across that phrase before, or I just skipped over it if I did."
Luthier,387yom,soundave,3,Tue Jun 2 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"A neck shim would be a thin piece of material that goes where the neck joins the body inside the pocket.  It would have the effect of raising the neck/fretboard relative to the top of the guitar body, lowering the action.  I don't think it would help you out here much, but I'm not a luthier."
Luthier,387yom,WillyTheDisk,2,Tue Jun 2 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Brilliant... I never even considered that.  As you said; may not help here, but I will have to think about this before I agree that it won't.  Work is taking away the focus from the necessary brain cells to digest this idea at the moment, but it certainly sounds worth investigating!  Thank you very much!"
Luthier,387yom,KendleC,2,Tue Jun 2 18:35:18 2015 UTC,Certainly something to keep in your pocket if you keep working on guitars!  I usually see it as a solution to make up for construction mistakes where the neck pocket gets routed too deeply or something similar to that.  You can also put shims along the sides of the neck within the pocket if the pocket is a touch too large.
Luthier,387yom,catdumpling,3,Tue Jun 2 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the ends of the 13th are lifting but you couldnt measure a difference? A razor blade could be used carefully as a fret rocker to determine if it is high. Usually lifting ends will be handled by using wax to protect the area as it is clamped and a drop or two of water thin superglue is wicked underneath. If you are having it go out of tune with it 'decked' or blocked, you might want to remove the neck screws to see if they are bent which could cause it to shift around in the pocket."
Luthier,387yom,KendleC,2,Tue Jun 2 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"Didn't think about a razor blade.  I used a 1/8"" piece of steel; the bench grinder here is good to within a few tenths (.0001"") and my indicator is good to about a micron (.000 05"") - I know it's probably overkill, but I figure as long as I have the tools at my disposal, I might as well use them!  But no - I measured all of the frets in groups of 3 (123, then 234, then 345, etc.), under each string.  I know the bow from the truss rod will give differences, but I figure that 3 at a time should have a very small difference as a group, which I found to be true.  Part of me wants to check it on our CMM, but I think that might actually be too much!  Neck screws - I had not even thought about them.  Considering that the previous owner did not take very good care of this guitar at all, nothing would surprise me!  I appreciate the suggestions!  Thank you very much."
Luthier,387yom,catdumpling,3,Tue Jun 2 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, excessive relief, combined with low saddle height tocompensate can cause buzz up high, past the 10th or 12th fret, especially on Fenders, although I don't think that's what's going on here. I'd be willing to bet that you either have a high fret, or a gradual rise in the fingerboard past the 12th fret at will need to be leveled out."
Luthier,387yom,KendleC,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"Yes This.      It's not uncommon for a neck to have a slight rise especially over the joint that will cause the problem you're describing and still have seemingly level adjacent frets.       Solutions include shimming the neck in the pocket as mentioned previously and, or,  working with a crowning file to take the offending frets down a bit.   I like to mark the tall frets with a sharpie over just the section of the fret that is having problems.   Then I file till I can't see the sharpie mark, tighten tune and test.    It usually takes me around 3 iterations per fret, but be patient because if you go to far you'll end up filing all the frets in front of your mistake... If you have 4 or more adjacent frets that need work I'd go for the shim and truss rod adjustment first.   Hope this helps"
Luthier,387yom,catdumpling,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"If the problem is a rise in the fretboard, shimming the neck won't fix a thing."
Luthier,387yom,braken,2,Thu Jun 4 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"Two suggestions: Check to see if there are four springs hooked to the claw behind the back inspection panel. If three, they MUST be in a straight line and the claw needs to be screwed in further. Check to see if the bridge saddles are on the same radius as the neck. If they made them straight, the may have also made them level (wrong)."

Luthier,385tki,kbbednarz,2,Tue Jun 2 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"The LSR nuts are tricky to install: they require a little bit to be taken off the leading edge of the fretboard, and if you take too much off you'll screw up the intonation. They're definitely not a drop-in fit (most nuts aren't, but LSRs are even more fiddly to install properly.) LSR nuts also occasionally lose their ball bearings, which can be hard to find replacements for. They were a good solution at a time before things like GraphTech nuts were invented, but these days I think they're unnecessarily complicated (and relatively expensive!)  Where the fretboard ends doesn't really make a huge difference, it's just a different way of manufacturing things. I tend to prefer the Fender slot, because it holds the nut a little better should the glue break loose, but it's not really a big deal either way. Neither one is really anymore difficult to install than the other (aside from vintage Fenders which have curved nut slots: they're not hard to install, just kind of annoying because you have to radius the bottom of the nut.)  My personal favorite nut material is TUSQ (or TUSQ XL, which is the lubricated version). It's about as hard and dense as bone, but it's uniform because it's manufactured: bone is a natural product and sometimes you'll run into voids or soft spots, which can be irritating. If you use your trem, I'd suggest going with TUSQ XL: it's inexpensive, easy to work with and works fantastic with trems! The white TUSQ is actually an off-white color, and can be polished up to look very close to bone, if that's the look you're after (I did that to the one on my Jazzmaster, you'd have to look very close to be able to tell it's not a bone nut.)  Note that pre-slotted nuts can save you a lot of time, but there's always some amount of fitting that needs to be done. At the very least, you'll most likely have to sand the bottom to get the overall height right, as well as file the ends to the proper length. TUSQ and most pre-slotted bone nuts are sold slightly oversized, so you can fit them to your particular guitar."
Luthier,385tki,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you that is very informative. how do you determine what the proper height of the nut should be? And is going with the pre-slotted nuts the better option? I'm trying to make this guitar quality, but easy to work with. Also, any recommendation of places to purchase?"
Luthier,385tki,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"Proper nut height depends on a few factors, with playability and no buzzing being the main ones. A good starting place is for the bottom of the low E to be about 0.022"" above the first fret, and bottom of the high E to be about 0.018"" above the first fret. The rest of the slots should follow the radius of the fretboard, with the wound strings typically being a bit higher than the plain strings. Note that the measurements I gave are starting points, but you can usually go a bit lower as long as the frets are level and the neck relief is properly set. I like mine at about 0.018""-0.020"" on the low E and about 0.015"" on the high E.  Pre-slotted nuts (both bone and TUSQ) are available from a lot of suppliers. You can get TUSQ nuts directly from Graphtech's website, although it's usually a little cheaper to find a Graphtech dealer (lots of music stores are GT dealers, I've ordered from Ant Hill Music, HD Customs and several other places.) Pre-slotted bone nut blanks are available from Stew-Mac, link in the sidebar.  One thing to note with pre-slotted blanks: they're pre-slotted for a specific fretboard radius, which may or may not match your guitar. Graphtech pre-slots their nuts at a couple different radii, just based on which guitars particular nut sizes are most likely to be installed on. Your best bet is to measure the nut you already have (especially the string spacing), and then find the closest match on Graphtech's website. Unfortunately they don't list the radius each nut is slotted for, but they're quick to respond to emails: just shoot them a message with the model number you're interested in, and they'll tell you the radius.  You can use a different-radius nut, but it won't feel quite right when you play in that area of the fretboard. Your only option in that case is to file the appropriate slots lower, but nut files are expensive (about $100 per set for good ones.) If you buy a nut and take it to a repair place, they can typically install it and tweak the slots if necessary for around $40-$50, so keep that in mind. Stew-Mac lists the radius of all of their pre-slotted nuts, so it takes some of the guesswork out.  You can install a pre-slotted nut with minimal tools, but no nut should be considered a quick drop-in fit. Every nut has to be adjusted and fitted to the specific guitar it's installed in for the best playability and feel. Pre-slotted nuts are great, but they're not designed to take all of the work out of the process, just to make it a little easier."
Luthier,385tki,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"You need an angle on the headstock for a couple reasons relating to tension. Try lacing the high e on your strat without the string tree to get an idea of what it's like without that additional tension. It will be buzzy and will want to jump off the bridge or nut.   As far as the nut goes as long as it isn't plastic you're golden. Bone,graphite and brass are all great. The nut is one of the most important parts of the guitar as it is always touching the string. It isn't important if a bit of fretboard goes a little above it, that's just how some of them are made. It won't affect your tone one way or the other."
Luthier,385tki,catdumpling,0,Tue Jun 2 05:16:01 2015 UTC,"The nut is one of the most important parts of the guitar as it is always touching the string.    I disagree. Once you fret a note, the nut is out of the equation. The nut's job is simply to act as a ""permanent"" fret for open strings. When you fret a note, the fret material ""takes over"" and affects the tone of the string(s)."
Luthier,385tki,Mikethrillmas,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:27:29 2015 UTC,The sustain added to an open string is very real and measurable. Try dropping a brass nut on the counter and then a plastic one. One sounds like a coin and the other a poker chip. This carries over.
Luthier,385tki,catdumpling,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"I was talking about fretted strings, not open ones. The nut does have an affect on the tone of open strings, but once you fret a string the nut has no bearing on the tone of that string. Your implication was that the nut affects tone even when the string is fretted."

Luthier,3817ey,mdeckert,2,Mon Jun 1 03:57:20 2015 UTC,You don't adjust volume while playing?
Luthier,3817ey,stealthgunner385,3,Mon Jun 1 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"Negatorino. Potentiometers increase resistance, that's how the change the volume or tone. I think resistance is bad, it takes away from the pickups range. A better volume option is a foot pedal that works by switching on and off really fast. No signal loss, and you can control the volume better.  Disregard all of this. I do things because they are awesome, I don't really care about making the perfect tone."
Luthier,3817ey,hob196,4,Mon Jun 1 13:54:18 2015 UTC,"If your pickups are passive and/or you're not using an on-board preamp, you're almost absolutely right, the volume pots will eat some of the tone no matter what setting they're at (by virtue of being parallel resistances in an RLC circuit).  I say almost absolutely because with volume pots of 1 MΩ the effect on the tone is negligible when you're dimed. With an additional treble bypass capacitor across the input and output lug on the pot, the tone remains effectively the same even if you turn it down. I've installed a few of those in the past few years for friends who wanted the effect - personally, I prefer the subtle dimming of tone, but to each their own.  Secondly, if you don't have a preamp on board, the moment you plug in a cable your tone is going to take a dive because the cable is basically a long concentric capacitor - which takes the tone away. So you're only going to get the true tone of the pickups if you go through your switches, through the preamp and then out the cable.  That said... those two switches look absolutely badass on your guitar and I love them for the same reason I love the four-switch panel on my Bass VI."
Luthier,3817ey,Hellspark08,2,Mon Jun 1 14:34:10 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that just create a square wave sound?   I would have thought something transformer based would be better and also avoid impedance issues.

There's still good old fashioned resistance in that circuit, and probably a treble bleed to counteract the frequency roll-off (I've used two different Morley volumes, they sound great to me). But that's not what you're describing. Can you name the pedal that you're referring to?"
Luthier,3817ey,krnichin,2,Mon Jun 1 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"The light for the light dependent part comes from an LED, which is controlled by a high speed switching circuit.

Luthier,3817ey,ziddersroofurry,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"Resistance is not bad.  Your pickups have resistance, your amplifier has loads of resistance in every part of the circuit, the speaker has resistance, and reducing resistance in each step is just the kind of flawed logic you sometimes see from hifi enthusiasts.  A statement like resistance is bad just looks like a fundamental missunderstanding of how electricity and amplification works.  The volume pot simply forms a filter in combination with the pickups, a large value pot like 1M, or 2M wil have pretty much the same effect as no pot at all when the volume is turned all the way up.  The commonly used values are used to dampen the sharpest high frequencies."
Luthier,3817ey,TheMadWoodcutter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to see it was a mistake to reply to things. Would it change your mind if I told you I primarily play through a Roland Micro Cube? How about if I tell you I have crappy instrument cables that probably lose 20% of their signal to attenuation or that I get buzzing sometimes because the shielding around the plug itself is starting to deteriorate.   Here's the thing though, and you actually hit the nail on the head. Those pots? The ones that sound the same ""when the volume is turned all the way up?"" What happens when you turn them down? I'd bet money it changes the tone. Just because there is resistance in the circuit doesn't mean I can't try and minimize it's impact on tone in order to shape the sound that I want. If I am not going to turn down a volume pot because I don't like the way it affects the tone, then I'm not going to worry about installing one"
Luthier,3817ey,chizmack,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do have an effect when you turn them down, you start to cut off some high end. You can minimize this effect by using a treble bypass cap and a resistor over the pot, this same trick is often used in amplifiers and volume pedals.  I am not saying that you should not try to get the best you can from your gear, but I think you are missunderstanding a few things about electronics and draw conclusions from these missunderstandings."

Luthier,384hwo,coffeefuelsme,2,Wed Jun 3 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"Tools are the most expensive part of luthier work.  You might want to consider buying a kit or prebuilt body and neck from Warmoth or Stewmac.  You get a lot more for your money buying premade stuff once you factor in the cost of a bandsaw, planer/jointer, fretting supplies, nut files, etc.    For Pickups, I like Dimarzio Area J and Bartolinis in Jazz basses.  If you're on a budget the EMG HZ passive series is relatively inexpensive, but I've only put those in basses with very poor stock pickups.    If you have a relatively dust free environment, ReRanch has many vintage fender colors in nitrocellulose lacquer.  Nitro lacquer sprays really thin and in my experience is not very forgiving if you don't do a good job with surface preperation.  I've seen good stuff done with Duplicolor automotive lacquer from auto parts stores.  I helped a student refinish his bass last summer with Duplicolor Candy Apple Red and Black, Van Halen style with stripes last year.  It was very forgiving and got a relatively flat finish with little effort.   If you buy a pre-finished body this won't be a problem and will factor into your cost/benefit of building from scratch vs buying premade.  For a natural finish, you can always use furniture grade stuff like minwax finishes and stains, aniline dye mixed with shellac, Tru Oil over stain, etc.  Or you can use oil finishes like Tung, Teak, Danish, or Walnut oil.    That's all I got off the top of my head.  Hope that's helpful."

Luthier,380uyv,KnucklestheEnchilada,2,Mon Jun 1 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the question, but I'll try to answer anyway.  If you have a tone pot, then yes, you need a cap...otherwise it won't do anything. If you're not going to have a tone pot, then there's no need for a capacitor.  Whether or not you need a tone pot is something only you can decide, based on your personal preferences and playing style. I don't think there's a massive difference in having a pot turned up to 10 vs. no tone pot at all, but some people don't want anything extra. It's up to you."
Luthier,380uyv,catdumpling,3,Mon Jun 1 01:24:08 2015 UTC,"There's a fairly big difference between having a tone pot turned to 10 vs. no pot at all. Luthier Helmuth Lemme explains it here. Here's what it boils down, TL;DR-style:   tone caps shift the resonant peak (timbre) up and down the frequencies   bigger value tone caps (47 nF, 100 nF) make it warmer with less top end smaller value tone caps (33 nF, 22 nF) make it more open with more top end  tone pots shift the resonant peak up and down in volume   higher-value pots (500 kΩ, 1 MΩ) make it brighter and sometimes even shrill, if turned to 10 lower-value pots (250 kΩ) make it mellower (so does a 500 kΩ linear pot if you turn it halfway down!) any pot turned completely down (0 kΩ) makes it dull    If you don't connect a tone pot to your pickups you'll have an infinite resistance between your pickups and ground - this falls into the 1 MΩ ""shrill"" category. I've not tried it on my P-90 SG, but I know some who have and the result is too bright for most people.  If you want to have the ""fully open"" tone but without the hassle of a tone pot, solder the following together:   fixed-value 250 kΩ or 500 kΩ resistor (see values' effect above) to a tone cap of your own choice (again, see above) one end of this RC filter to your output jack's ground the other end of this RC filter to the output jack's hot contact   This will give you a ""fully open"" tone all the time because it behaves exactly like a fully open 250/500 kΩ tone pot, without the fiddling.  Again, maybe the shrillness works for you. Let your ears be your guide.  edit: clarified the 250 kΩ explanation for perspective"
Luthier,380uyv,stealthgunner385,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:54:39 2015 UTC,That actually answers my question perfectly. I was basically wondering if I needed one since I'm not going to have a tone pot. Thanks!
Luthier,380uyv,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"Good. That's what I thought you were asking, but I wasn't quite sure. A tone cap's job is simply to send high frequencies to ground; no tone pot, no cap necessary.  ...unless you're going to install a ""treble bleed"" mod on the volume pot, but you didn't ask about that ;) ."
Luthier,38003x,HansJobb,6,Sun May 31 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"Blocking the trem is cheaper, faster and you can set it back to floating tremolo with minimal effort compared to changing the tremolo. There are plenty of tutorials in the internet on how to do this. Also a tremol-no could be a viable option!"
Luthier,38003x,CoffeeAndMusic,3,Sun May 31 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My Ltd Floyd bridge has been blocked for a year or so, works very well. Just cut a couple of wood blocks to size and place in the cavity, on both sides"

Luthier,37wwqq,TheFakeTomTelesco,3,Sun May 31 02:33:08 2015 UTC,Getting a multimeter with a wire tester makes it a lot easier to find any bad connections (vs just plain have fallen off cables).  Probably is one of the two cables going to the jack.

Luthier,37wwqq,TheFakeTomTelesco,4,Sun May 31 04:01:50 2015 UTC,I'd probably start at the jack.  Make sure both wires are still connected there.  One or the other may have gotten pulled loose when you had the pickguard off.
Luthier,37wwqq,chiefjoefixit,5,Sun May 31 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"thanks everybody, the issue was in the jack. a wire was wrapped around. when i unwrapped it, the guitar was just brought back to life!"
Luthier,37wwqq,shredtilldeth,1 point,Sun May 31 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"You shorted out the connection. Which means the hot and ground were touching.

The good thing is, electronics issues like that are usually a cheap fix."

Also, the frets are worn down and I'd prefer they be stainless steel. Not a lot of reputable Luther's live near me, and repairing it would cost more than the guitar is worth. A new Warmoth neck that'd be beautiful and solve all the problems I have with stability and such? $300."

Luthier,37wfxb,catdumpling,2,Sun May 31 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure without dimensions and profiles of the neck and pocket, but the chance that you could re drill the holes,pop it in no problems, and go is pretty slim. It probably wouldn't be that hard to make it fit, but don't expect it to work immediately. You may need to widen the pocket or reshape the end of the neck to fit.   With the amount of work it would cost do do all that, you could probably fix the lifting fretboard and the crack yourself, and pay to get a refret."

A fun trick at parties is picking up a plastic nut and dropping it on the counter and then dropping the brass one. The brass one will chime like a coin while the plastic one will kind sound like a pick falling, might even break. These are two of the most important parts of the guitar as they provide stability and actually touch the open and resonating string."

Luthier,37symr,Herman_Merman,4,Sun May 31 00:15:47 2015 UTC,"Hipshot makes fantastic hardware, and is worth the price of admission IMO. That doesn't mean there aren't other great bridges out there that are more affordable (Gotoh comes to mind), but Hipshot is a safe bet if you want something top-of-the-line without spending ridiculous amounts of money (I'm looking at you, Schaller and ABM.)"
Luthier,37symr,catdumpling,3,Sat May 30 22:56:36 2015 UTC,I believe the hype but haven't had the chance use one yet.  The fact that it's solid brass and string-through would sell me on it.  It was a pleasant surprise to see that Carvin now offers the HipShot bridge as an option.
Luthier,37symr,AntiFIanders,3,Sat May 30 12:40:26 2015 UTC,I used one my first build and it is very comfortable IMO.  The bridge itself is really solid and well made. I'd use it over any other hardtail. (sorry to sound like an advertisement)

Luthier,37re9s,ICannotHelpYou,1 point,Sat May 30 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"Someone else mentioned that. I think it's because it's not original. There are other screw holes there, and all the pictures I've found of these basses show a narrow, wing-shaped bridge. As much as I've grown to love this bass, I think I might be trying to trade it to someone who knows what they're doing for a much cheaper, but usable one. :[   That is if anyone would take it in its current condition. It sounds okay now, but I'm afraid to keep it tuned for more than a few minutes because of that crack in the neck.

Luthier,37re9s,millsman163,2,Sat May 30 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"The estimate /u/ICannotHelpYou gave is pretty accurate. I would never trade it in for a cheaper bass though, if you give 500$ (in a most expensive scenario) for some good work, aka a refret, the minor work on that head crack and some other issues (the bridge, making sure the electronics work, maybe an oiling of bare wood) the bass you have is worth about double that. It's also a professional grade instrument in terms of construction, always worth the long term investment!"

But by the time you get a router, proper bit, and a template you'll have spent much more than that.  Plus is sounds like you've never done it before so there's a possibility you can make a mistake.    Much easier to just pay a professional to do it correctly."
Luthier,37sq38,cromag5150,7,Sat May 30 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"Do you have a drill? Drill a bunch of holes, then use a chisel."
Luthier,37sq38,asad137,6,Sat May 30 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of hidden gems and good budget tools to be had...  ...routers aren't one of those things.  Cheap routers generally break quickly and can be downright dangers due to loose tolerances and sloppy manufacturing. Having a razor-sharp bit launch out of a machine spinning at 30,000rpm could ruin someone's day really fast. Every person I've ever known that bought a cheap Harbor Freight router used it approximately once, kicked themselves for wasting the $40, and went out and bought something nicer. A good router is a one-time investment for most people and it's not something to skimp on. You can find very nice used routers in working condition for around $70, but you have to know what you're looking for.  I'll have to second the suggestion to pay someone to do it for you. A guitar repair tech or luthier is experienced with routers and using them specifically for guitar work: enlarging a pickup cavity isn't a big deal. Plus, they'll have the appropriate templates already, and the proper bit. A good router bit for that sort of mod typically costs $20-$30 on its own!  You could use a Dremel or chisel and hammer, but those have their own issues as well. Dremels aren't routers, and don't have the torque to handle big jobs like that; you'd need to go very slowly, and it'll take a long time. Dremels also have a bad tendency of getting away from the user, and they're notorious for being ""guitar wreckers"".  Chisels can work, but you need to have a little experience with them: just digging in and banging away can also wreck a guitar in a hurry. Besides that, you need to know how to hone them properly, because brand new ones don't come fully honed: it's expected that the buyer will finish the sharpening and honing process before they actually use it. They'll often feel sharp when you buy them, but that's usually just a wire edge leftover from manufacturing and it'll break off as soon as you start using the chisel. You need to hone it with a stone before you actually put it to use.  If you decide to throw caution to the wind and still attempt it yourself, I think drilling most of the material out with a Forstner bit (about $9 at a hardware store, 3/4"" should be a good size), then clean it up with a sharp chisel. You just need to be extra-super-careful that you don't blow through the back of the guitar or into the trem spring cavity if you have one (and that wood is thin!) Forstner bits are designed to leave flat-bottomed holes, but don't forget that they have a small spur on the end and that can poke through if you're not careful."
Luthier,37sq38,catdumpling,2,Sat May 30 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"Can confirm -- bought cheap 1/4 HP Harbor Freight router, used it a few times, then bought another one with a lot more torque (also from Harbor Freight).  The counter-intuitive thing about routers is that the little routers are generally more dangerous than the big ones, because they tend to catch on things they don't have the power to cut."
Luthier,37sq38,elihu,2,Sun May 31 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"The counter-intuitive thing about routers is that the little routers are generally more dangerous than the big ones, because they tend to catch on things they don't have the power to cut.   Yeah, which is why I cringe a little when someone brings up a Dremel. Don't get me wrong, they're really useful for a lot of things, but holy shit can they do a lot of damage in a hurry! I think people assume they're no big deal because they're so small, but they're more than powerful enough to chew the hell out of a guitar top (or cavities, or whatever.) I think everyone who's ever owned a Dremel (myself certainly included) has had that project that got totally screwed up because we tried using the Dremel for something it wasn't meant for.  As far as routers go, quite frankly I hate 'em. They're useful for all sorts of stuff, and I've seen people use them to make really cool things...but they're ridiculously dangerous if you're not careful. I avoid using them as much as possible, because I just have this mental image of the thing catching on a chunk of wood and ripping my fingers off or something. I probably have a somewhat irrational fear of them, but there are few power tools that scare me the way routers do."

Luthier,37s725,kbbednarz,5,Fri May 29 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"Walnut is a great wood for an electric guitar.  Harder then mahogany, relatively easy to work, accepts finishes well, and figured pieces look awesome.  It won't tear up your tools and it will make a great looking guitar.    Like /u/HiddenKrypt said, you're going to hear different opinions on the importance of wood choice.  It's been my experience that joinery is more important then the type of wood you use on an electric guitar.  I'd focus less on your wood choice and making sure that your neck pocket is tight, and your body plates are jointed perfectly flat.  The best guitars I've built and played have had tight neck pockets, perfectly jointed plates with no gaps, and use as little glue/wood filler as possible.         OPINION TIME  It's my opinion that the biggest tone suck, is when the energy from the strings can't efficiently propagate through the body and neck of the guitar.  Wood choice, type of strings, joinery, tightly attaching your hardware, whether you mount your pickups to a pickguard or directly to the body, neck angle, string angle at headstock, string angle between saddle and tailpiece/through mount, or even if you're holding the guitar up against your body or away are all influenced by how the energy of the strings resonates through the body.  This is my opinion based on the experiences I've had with building and repairing instruments.  I don't think it's as simple as saying ""tonewood matters"" or ""wood choice doesn't matter"".  A guitar is a system and I don't think you can solve a systemic problem like ""tone"" with a linear solution of wood choice."
Luthier,37s725,coffeefuelsme,3,Sat May 30 02:17:47 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said, wood choice is less of a factor for a solid body electric. It does make a difference, but I'd worry more about your pickups and electronics, and the quality of the work you do. A well made instrument made from low grade pallet board will far outperform a shoddily constructed guitar made from Honduran  mahogany and AAAA flame maple."
Luthier,37s725,WillyTheDisk,2,Sat May 30 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"If you had asked two or three years ago, you would have gotten a variety of opinions on the matter, with a lot of anecdotal evidence from various user's personal experiences, possibly a list of guitar manufacturers that use walnut, and maybe a list of famous musicians that play walnut guitars.   These days though the general consensus has shifted to ""it doesn't really matter"". There's no real evidence that different woods impart any different tonal qualities in an electric. As long as the wood is solid enough to hold everything together, the only thing you need to worry about tone wise is your electronics."
Luthier,37s725,HiddenKrypt,1 point,Sat May 30 01:03:54 2015 UTC,"in an electric   Key part right there. When I hear ""tonewood"" I think immediately of acoustic only.   I'm actually not really sure whether it would be good or not for an acoustic. It would probably be decent, but idk what it would sound like. you'd want it for back and sides only though, not for the top, because it is a very hard wood. It's not very popular though, so I guess it is not well liked, in comparison to other alternatives."

Luthier,37s725,WillyTheDisk,1 point,Sat May 30 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"Cool, good to know.   I envy your ability to make guitars. One of my dreams in life, is to be able to sit with a luthier, listen to their wisdom, discuss with them about guitars, hear all sorts of different kinds of woods and stuff like that, and have them fabricate an acoustic guitar tailor made for me.   That's actually one of the things that drives me. Not having a mansion, nor a ferrari, or anything like that, but just a fully custom acoustic."
Luthier,37s725,Akoustyk,1 point,Sat May 30 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"The wood and construction affect how the string vibrates. That's like saying there's no difference between nickel and steel strings, or hex and round cores.   Obviously the pickups make a huge impact on tone, but it doesn't mean the wood makes no difference. Take this bass for example. It has a P pickup in the P position, but it sounds much more like a 4003 than it does a Precision."
Luthier,37s725,iunnox,1 point,Sat May 30 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"I never said it makes no difference. In fact, I didn't post my own views on the matter at all, just the general consensus I've been seeing here and in a few other communities.   In my opinion, there may very well be tonal differences between two types of wood, but there's too many other variables to really make a determination. Two guitars made of the exact same wood might sound as different from each other as they do from one made of a different wood, just from variances in grain, joint quality, and electronics*.  *Assuming they're made with the same components, there's still a lot of variance, most resistors can be off from their stated resistance by up to 10%"
Luthier,37s725,HiddenKrypt,1 point,Sat May 30 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"The wood and construction affect how the string vibrates. That's like saying there's no difference between nickel and steel strings, or hex and round cores.    Not to be an ass, but that's not a good analogy. Strings have magnetic properties, which are directly affected by, and directly interact with, the magnetic field of the pickups. These fields are measurable and easily detectable by putting a piece of ferrous metal near them."
Luthier,37s725,catdumpling,1 point,Sat May 30 23:26:12 2015 UTC,"It's been used with success, but yeah, as /u/HiddenKrypt said, it's less of a factor in an electric, especially once you start to add effects into the signal chain."
Luthier,37s725,tigojones,1 point,Sat May 30 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with it in an electric, and you can get some beautifully figured walnut.  But, there's one thing nobody mentioned yet: the weight! Walnut is a hard and heavy wood, and your back will hate you for making an entire guitar out of it. Black and Claro walnut weighs in the neighborhood of 40lbs per cubic foot (for reference, Alder weighs about 28lbs per cubic foot.)  It's not unheard-of: African Mahogany (Khaya, which is what most companies use when they specify ""mahogany"" these days) weighs about the same. But if weight is a concern, I'd suggest either putting a walnut top on a lighter-weight wood or doing some weight-relief chambering or something.  It's not less popular because there's really anything wrong with it, it just tends to make for heavy guitars so less people go for it."
Luthier,37s725,catdumpling,1 point,Sat May 30 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"You can get allergic to Walnut. It is very good in musical instruments and being closed pore it finishes like a dream.

Luthier,37qlbj,slapspatula,2,Fri May 29 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"Is the neck set or a bolt on? If its a bolt on you could try to angle the heel of the neck and/or the neck pocket to put a bit of an angle on the neck. If its a set neck you could pull out the bridge and rout a bit of a recess so the bridge sits a little lower. Also adjust the truss rod, there's a bit too much relief(bow) in the neck. The tail piece concerns me. It appears to be being pulled forward. The holes for the bushings may be to big and not holding tight or they may not be set far enough in."
Luthier,37qlbj,slapspatula,1 point,Fri May 29 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, I suppose il make the adjustment of recessing the bridge into it more. If the hole for the saddle are to big what could I do to fix it? Wood fill it and try again? Thanks for your help much appreciated!"
Luthier,37qimh,MisterVandemar,3,Fri May 29 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"Warmoth still offers baritone necks here, as does USACG here (click on the link that says ""Conversion"".) I think Allparts has a baritone neck as well, but you'll have to poke around their site and see.  It's rare that any company offers replacement set or neck-through necks, mostly because those are fitted to a specific guitar body during manufacturing. They'd require a lot more fitting work than a bolt-on does, which is why you don't see them. To add to that issue, manufacturers don't have a ""standard"" tenon pocket for set-neck guitars (and even Gibson has used two or three different tenon sizes over the years!)  With that said, Carvin offers neck-through necks, but those are meant for new builds: you'd be responsible for cutting out and gluing on body wings, routing cavities, etc. They now offer them in 7- and 8-string versions and they've always been willing to do a lot of custom stuff that wasn't listed, if you call and ask. They might be willing to do a baritone neck-through neck, but you'd have to call and talk to someone. I'd call them rather than emailing though: they tend to be more amenable to custom stuff if you show that you're really interested, rather than just testing the waters."
Luthier,37qimh,catdumpling,2,Sat May 30 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"Beautiful . I'm in for the rest of the build, I have built bodies, but I'm not ready to venture into necks yet. That is the kind of info I need, thanks."

Luthier,37qimh,punkynyan,2,Fri May 29 22:06:15 2015 UTC,"IKR?! I was super disappointed. And ""set-neck"" is the term I was looking for, I has a dumb today...."
Luthier,37qimh,catdumpling,2,Fri May 29 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"Well, set and through are two different things. I think what you want may be through, where the wood in the middle of the body is the same piece that forms the neck.  Set neck is like a Les Paul or most any acoustic, where the neck is joined and glued to the body in one fashion or another"
Luthier,37qimh,punkynyan,2,Fri May 29 23:02:04 2015 UTC,When did Warmoth do set necks? I've been buying stuff from them for almost 20 years and they never offered it during that time.

I was originally going to copy Tom Delonge's old Stratocaster model, but my friend brought up telecasters and the idea just stuck with me."

The pickup seems a little far forward, but it doesn't really matter. You might get a little more overtone than you would from having the pickups closer to the bridge, but that's not a bad thing.  Where'd you get the neck? How does it feel? Did you do any finishing on it or just slap it on?  Was the body a woodshop project for class, or just something you wanted to do so you could rock out?

Luthier,37jjnx,iinverno,3,Thu May 28 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"The only thing you'd need to allow for coil tapping would be an additional switch. This could either be a small toggle, or you could replace one of the pots with a push-pull (or push-push.) A P-P pot has a switch built in and you activate it by either pushing or pulling up on the pot. It's very common to use a p-p pot for coil splitting, because it means you don't need to drill an additional hole for a separate switch. A push-pull pot is only a few bucks and a reputable repair person shouldn't charge you extra to install that if you're having them install pickups; it's an incredibly fast and easy thing to do.  If you want to use a p-p pot to coil split, you can do it a couple different ways. You can have both pickups use the same pot, so they both split at the same time. Alternately, you can install p-p pots in the volume and tone positions, and wire each pickup's coil split to its own switch (so you can split each pickup independently of the other.) It just depends on how you want it to work.  Either way, having coil splitting installed at the same time as a new set of pickups isn't expensive or hard to do. As long as the pickups are four-conductor, it's no big deal."
Luthier,37jjnx,catdumpling,1 point,Thu May 28 02:28:32 2015 UTC,"You are an absolute legend!    Thanks heaps, I totally forgot about the p-p set up. I can confirm the pick ups are four conductor so should be good to go!   Thanks again."

Luthier,37jjnx,catdumpling,1 point,Thu May 28 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"No, definitely coil tapping. Cheers."
Luthier,37jjnx,catdumpling,1 point,Thu May 28 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? ;)  Coil tapping is where you take the signal from somewhere in the wind. In other words, you're tapping off the full wind to get a weaker signal. Pickups have to be manufactured to allow this, it's not something that can be added on later (unless you have the pickup rewound, that is.)  Coil splitting (sometimes called ""coil cutting"") is where one coil of a humbucker is sent to ground (ie, turned off), so you're only hearing the sound of the other coil. Basically a single-coil sound (although it doesn't sound quite the same as a true single-coil, but that's beside the point.) This is what 4-conducter humbuckers are almost always manufactured for.   According to Bare Knuckle's website the Juggernauts are coil splittable, which is pretty standard for humbuckers. Getting a set with coil tapping would probably be a custom order  I should also mention that I used both words in my reply below, but I meant coil splitting."

After that process, it was a little rough, so I passed the board through while moving the sled back and forth. That cleaned it up really well, but I think would be too much for the tool to handle without most of the wood being removed first."
Luthier,37eklg,ShutUpTurkey,3,Wed May 27 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"Genuine question.  If you were going to go to the trouble of making an entire giant jig, wouldn't it make more sense to design one to directly rout the opposite radius onto the fingerboard?"
Luthier,37eklg,maturin23,3,Wed May 27 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"I find that with 60grit on a good 18"" long radius sanding block, it takes almost no time to go from a flat finger board to a radiused fingerboard. I have a similar jig to make radiused sanding blocks, and another to rough radius a fingerboard at any radius, and I find that usually I'm just too damn lazy to set up the jig to cut a fingerboard radius. Plus, you're going to use a sanding block multiple times throughout the neck building process anyway, and even after you run a fingerboard through your radius routing jig, it won't be perfect and you'll still need to sand it.  The other benefit to building a jig like this is that you can cut many different radius blocks. All you have to do is move your fulcrum closer to your work to make a smaller radius."
Luthier,37eklg,anaemic,2,Wed May 27 20:16:15 2015 UTC,How would you rout convex shapes of multiple radii with a jig that small?  Edited to say that cutting from the inside of the circle is far easier in this case than cutting from the outside!
Luthier,37eklg,routed,3,Wed May 27 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure, have a couple of pre formed sleds that the router sits on top of?"
Luthier,37eklg,routed,1 point,Wed May 27 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"There are jigs with curved sides of the right radius, that ride on rails."
Luthier,37eklg,anaemic,2,Thu May 28 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"I've made both kinds of jig. With the version that routes the board directly, you still need to accurately sand the fretboard afterwards. For this you need a radius sanding block, either bought or made with the jig shown. I found I prefer sanding in the entire radius."

Luthier,37e6ab,Collin_C,6,Tue May 26 23:44:03 2015 UTC,"Old silvertone archtops usually don't have truss rods and to straighten out a bowed neck you have two options:   Heat, while clamping the neck flat until the glue softens and then removing heat so the glue hardens and dries with the neck straight. Compression fretting, using oversized frets to force the neck back into proper shape.     I'm assuming that your local luthier will attempt to number 2 to straighten out your neck.  The added bonus, is that it will straighten out your neck and give you fresh frets, killing two birds with one stone on a guitar this old.  If you want to learn about compression fretting and how it works, check out this link:  http://www.bluescreekguitars.com/?d=tutorials&p=written&tId=6  Filing down the frets will do nothing but damage your guitar and cause issues down the road as the bowing gets worse.  I'd let your Luthier diagnose that heel seperation and figure out where to go from there.    Hope that's helpful, those old archtops sound great I hope you get it in playable condition!"
Luthier,37e6ab,coffeefuelsme,1 point,Wed May 27 02:03:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I will look into these. Like I said, the guitar was cheap, so I'm not afraid to do stuff to it. Though I would like to keep everything original on this guitar, including the nice condition frets. Don't want chrome frets and a rusting tailpiece."
Luthier,37e6ab,Luthier42,2,Wed May 27 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"The reason most older guitars are cheap, is that it's going to cost quite a bit to get it into good playing order, and it's not an instrument that is sought after by collectors, so money wise that's probably not a great investment.  They can still be very nice instruments if you get them repaired properly, it's just not going to be worth much, because it has the ""wrong"" brand.  Half assed repairs will only postpone your issues, and make it more difficult to repair properly down the line."
Luthier,37e6ab,catdumpling,2,Wed May 27 11:04:39 2015 UTC,"Those frets are ridiculously worn, so I wouldn't exactly call them ""nice"". I don't even think there's enough metal left to do a level and crown. Combined with the bowing issue (and probably lack of a truss rod), there's not really any other options other than to refret the neck. In the meantime, you might be able to reduce the bow by tuning down a half or whole step, which would take some of the tension off the neck. It might help that gap at the heel too."
Luthier,37e6ab,catdumpling,1 point,Thu May 28 00:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been looking over it and finally have come to the conclusion that I can't keep everythign original. Damn, I gotta get this vintage fetish under control..."

Luthier,37e6ab,KendleC,2,Thu May 28 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to Jescar-brand frets (not that there's anything wrong with Dunlop or the stuff StewMac sells.) Since you won't have a fret-bender, you can actually get Jescar frets pre-radiused and pre-cut from Philadelphia Luthier Tools. That'll save you from having to radius the wire by hand, which is a pain in the ass. It's also pre-cut to shorter lengths, although you'll need to file them flush after they're installed.  Jescar's naming scheme makes finding the size you want pretty easy: the part number is the height and the width, in inches. For example, Jescar FW37053 is 0.037"" high, by 0.053"" wide. FW60110 would be 0.060"" high, by 0.110"" wide. You get the idea.  If you have a digital caliper, you can measure the width of your current wire. The height will be a lot lower than it would've originally come, but old acoustics like that didn't typically have really high wire anyway. FW37053 or FW37080 would probably be the most appropriate wire to use, but you can put in any size you want. Just note that higher wires (like the sizes typically used on electric guitars) will probably require either shimming the saddle or replacing it with a new one. Since this is a beater, shimming will probably be the best bet and you can use whatever you've got handy that'll work: thin strips of paper, soak with super glue (let it dry, obviously) makes good shim stock.  The Jescar wire is affordable: regular nickel-silver is about $8 for enough to do one guitar. They also have EVO wire, which is copper-based and a bit harder (also nickel-free if you've got nickel allergies), but it's about $20. It's good stuff, but if you're trying to do this on the cheap, the standard nickel-silver wire is fine and the easiest to work with. DO NOT get stainless! It's definitely not for an inexperienced person, and even seasoned techs hate installing it: it's really hard and tends to wreck cutting tools, plus you need to match the fretboard radius, otherwise it won't want to stay in the slot.  Speaking of the fretboard radius: acoustics typically have a flatter radius, usually in the 14""-20"" range. I have no idea what yours is, but nickel wire should be over-radiused anyway to help keep it in the slot, so you can either use straight or go for something like 12"" or 14"" radius (depending on what Phila Luthier Tools offers for that particular wire.) It's not massively important in this case, so dont' sweat it too much; I'd just avoid getting something with a really tight radius (like 7.25"" or 9.5""), because that will be a pain to get it to slot."
Luthier,37e6ab,KendleC,1 point,Thu May 28 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"So how would I go about sanding down the fretboard? Do I have to get a radiused sanding block since I'm going to sand some of the bow out? Or maybe just sand the frets to be flat... I think I will go with the FW37080.  Also, the bridge does have adjust knobs that I took off to make the action bearable."

Luthier,37ewzu,XxSCRAPOxX,3,Wed May 27 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to make the open book shape headstock out of the double curve of the Epi? You'd not have to bother the tuner holes but you're going to have to hyper-accurate in your making to the two half moon shapes to fill in the design to comport to the Gibson. Furthermore you'd have to make a new peg head overlay to effectively hide the modification. You'd probably want to make a mahogany back-strap laminate to hide the repair on the back of the peg head. Then you'd need new decals, a reamer for the tuner holes, and then refinishing. I'd wait, save, and buy the guitar you can't currently afford."
Luthier,37ewzu,KendleC,2,Wed May 27 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"Spend your time and money on how it sounds, not how it looks."
Luthier,37ewzu,gothicasshole,2,Thu May 28 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"You could (and people have, there are forum posts floating around the intertubes of the mod), but you need to be sure of your woodworking skills. The more difficult part will be refinishing: Epi's use a 2k catalyzed poly of some sort (either polyurethane or polyester, I'm not sure): if you try to match with acrylic or nitro lacquer, it won't be perfect. You can get 2k poly in a spray can now, but it's expensive (about $30 per can) and it's a one-shot deal: as soon as you puncture the inner catalyst and mix it, you only have 24-48 hours to spray whatever you need to spray; after that, it's hardened and anything left in the can is wasted. It would probably be better to use an acrylic lacquer and live with the minor mismatch, and if you can match the current color it'll blend it even more.  You'll need to get a headstock overlay, but those are pretty easy to find. You can either get an actual Gibson overlay, or a blank piece of overlay wood from LMII. Gibson has used holly (dyed black), ebony and vulcanized fiberboard, depending on the year and model.  As you can see, while it is possible, it's a pretty involved mod (especially on a brand new guitar.) My advice would be to search out a used LP Studio model, which can be had for around the same price as some higher-end Epi's. Or save up for a brand new one of the more basic Gibson LP's. I know saving up for gear sucks when you want it right now, but it'll mean more to you in the end if you go with something closer to what you want, rather than settling and trying to make what you end up with into something it's not."

On other instruments the binding is mostly cosmetic, and you will be fine pretty much no matter what you do on a 10$ beater.  If you have access to a tablesaw and some sandpaper you can easily make wood binding strips in any thickness you want though, much easier than starting to work with molds and epoxy I think."

If the binding has been removed the easiest solution is to install some pre-cut binding strips.  Here's a canadian Luthier supply company:  http://www.amwoodinc.com/pricelistpurflings.aspx  Here's a tutorial form some guy on how to do the binding:    http://www.tundraman.com/Guitars/001/GuitarBodyBinding.php  You'll need glue, a cabinet scraper, masking tape, and the binding.  It will take a few hours, but is easier and much better looking then the ideas you proposed.  A cabinet scraper is a little intimidating, but your local hardware store probably carries one for relatively cheap and if you follow these instructions it's pretty easy to get used to:  http://www.woodgears.ca/scraper/index.html  Hope that's helpful.  If that's too intimidating and you're alright with the guitar looking a little weird, an epoxy putty might work, but to get enough to do the binding channel of a whole guitar will be more expensive then buying binding strips.  Something like this would be ok:  http://www.rockler.com/sculpwood-moldable-epoxy-putty  Regular wood putty won't work as it's too soft, you'll need stuff that is maleable enough to form to the channel, but strong enough to hold it's shape."

Luthier,37dntk,WillyTheDisk,2,Wed May 27 11:29:48 2015 UTC,"Lacquer is actually dry to the touch about fifteen minutes after spraying a coat, so you'd be fine if you hit it with a sanding sealer, and then sprayed a few coats of nitro. Lacquer continues to off gas and shrink back for a few weeks to a month, so you'll still want to wait before you wet sand and buff.  A little sweat and grime on the bare wood won't hurt tone at all, but it will prevent adhesion of lacquer when it does come time to spray,  causing fish eyes and lifting lacquer, so make sure you at least get a coat or two on there before you do anything else."
Luthier,37dntk,catdumpling,1 point,Wed May 27 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"I second this, although I'll add that lacquer will get a bit sticky-feeling if it's fairly fresh and you start rubbing it with your skin. I remember when the first run of Eric Johnson sig Strats came out and for some reason the nitro on a lot of the necks wasn't cured all the way: this made the back of the necks notoriously sticky after a few minutes of playing warmed up the lacquer. I think Fender rushed a bunch out the door to get them to dealers because they were such a hot item that year.  If it's just one gig, I wouldn't worry about it. Dirt and sweat can seep into wood and make it look gross, and if it's been happening long enough you'll never get it all out. But one gig (or even a few) on bare wood isn't going to be a big deal, and any surface grime will get sanded off when the guitar goes in for its refin anyway.  It won't have any tonal effect at all. If you're really worried about it, just do a quick spray coat or two of sanding sealer (or even shellac), but it's really not anything to worry about in this case."
Luthier,37dntk,TibbittsN,2,Wed May 27 17:26:08 2015 UTC,All these guys are wrong. The tone of the instrument will be largely compromised due to increased mass in the wood.

Luthier,379bzx,sbujrb,1 point,Tue May 26 00:20:35 2015 UTC,It's a really cheap Laredo guitar that I want to fix up as a beater. The guitar came with very little markings. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Problem is you can't just get any gear to throw in there so you're probably better with a cheap ""vintage"" set off ebay if you want to keep it low cost."
Luthier,379bzx,sirsalamander,1 point,Mon May 25 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"Buy another Harmony parlor guitar off Ebay. As long as there are good pictures to verify. I'd say 1920-1963 should be an exact match. Don't bother with tuner parts because you may not get a right or left to match (they turn different directions). Don't try to force the odd brass gear to work. If it doesn't match up perfectly DON'T force it. Craigslist will have a donor guitar if not in your town try nearby. The headstock, squared off will be what you're looking for. Silvertone, Airline, and NEWER Stella's will work."

Luthier,379r41,bruddahmacnut,2,Tue May 26 04:56:18 2015 UTC,I'd assume it'd burn up the lacquer so I'd try it before
Luthier,379r41,blacksun2012,2,Tue May 26 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"I think the hardest part would be to maintain some sort of consistency. It'll come out blotchy more than likely.   Depending on how severe the burn was, it could make the top layer of the wood brittle and cause issues in the future too."
Luthier,379r41,TibbittsN,2,Tue May 26 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"Have you seen this?  http://youtu.be/5Jfi0sOawT0  It will look more blistery/bubbly depending on how much finish is on it. A heat gun or torch will make a good scorch on unfinished wood. Too much heat for too long isn't good, especially on a thinline. Import ones especially have tough sealer coats that may interfere. Anything goes on a distressed piece, practice on scrap is the mantra."
Luthier,379r41,Absolving_Truth,1 point,Tue May 26 21:31:50 2015 UTC,Do it before any finish. Burning is hard. I found I had to get one of those giant irons they used to seal tin roofs in the old days. Otherwise it is all about developing your technique. Practice.
Luthier,378le0,beardyman22,5,Mon May 25 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Neck and bridge maybe middle pickup  Pickup selector switch Volume knob(s)  Tone knob(s)  1/4 inch jack  Wire, 2 colors, normally black and another color (I personally like to match my guitar color)  Copper tape, conductive paint, copper foil for shielding  Possibly capacitors for volume and tone  Zip ties and electrical tape for cable management  Solder and soldering iron  That should be everything"
