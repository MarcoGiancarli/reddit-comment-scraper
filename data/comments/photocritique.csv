photocritique,3dz49o,EirikHavre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:14 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for that! Really appreciate it. I shoot with a Fuji X-T1, 35mm/f1.4 lens, with an APS-C (23.6mm x 15.6mm) sensor.  I don't have the EXIF data with me right now, but I'm guessing I shot this with a 1.4 aperture. Will confirm and edit this comment later :) (Edit: Yup. f/1.4).  Thanks again!"

photocritique,3dz49o,steffon,5,Mon Jul 20 20:52:12 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it's not. Only the camera body. I'm personally saving up for the 23mm. I find the 35mm too narrow in too many situations. I love the 16mm though!

I am actually so stoked to see someone not afraid of high ISOs after seeing most people here and other photography subs trying to stay below 800 indoors. I'm not sure which body you are using, but depending on how much you did to the file in post, this is a great baseline for figuring out how much noise and grain you personally are willing to tolerate. From the exposure settings you said, it sounds like this was ambient no flash, maybe low window light with incandescent lights indoors. Is this an f/4 lens or could you have opened up the aperture more? Just trying to figure out your exposure directions.  The light is pleasing, soft and not harsh.  Compositionally it's not perfect for cutting off the elbow and the tip of the hat, but feels balanced enough, even with the face in the center. But it's a fine moment and expression. More context could help, but the implication that this is an early birthday works well enough.  Overall, good light and expression. Practice composition and exposure."
photocritique,3dz44v,unsolicited_critique,3,Mon Jul 20 19:46:41 2015 UTC,Quick thought - top of hat isn't cropped off its just very close to edge..  You could easily add a bit of space and clone some background above her to make it less awkward.

I might crop the image to 16:9 or 2:1 to fix the moustache distortion and to draw the eye to the steps, the man and the trees. Or, if you can (I understand it's difficult with that type of distortion), fix the distortion in the bottom fifth of the image."
photocritique,3dxp5v,ellomatey,2,Mon Jul 20 13:56:00 2015 UTC,thanks. i went back and forth on correcting the mustache. it felt dream like and so at the time i thought the distortion fit. but it's useful to hear that people find it distracting.  do you think this is better? http://imgur.com/w5suJVZ  (i didn't want to get out of my chair to grab my hard drive so this is just an action edit of the already processed jpeg - just for mustache)
photocritique,3dxp5v,ellomatey,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:51 2015 UTC,Yeah much better. You need to straighten the horizon slightly now though!

photocritique,3dxp5v,bavarian_creme,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:00 2015 UTC,yeah. it was my first wide-angle lens (beyond the 35). it was inexpensive and a good learning experience. i now shoot mostly with a 16-35 in those circumstances (my first and only zoom).   i use a $15 program called PT-Lens to correct the mustache when i want to. i'm getting the idea that most people think it would have been better to correct it here.
photocritique,3dxp5v,teksimian,0,Mon Jul 20 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"You know what, I actually quite like the kinda radial symmetry it creates. Without it, it would just be lines leading to the guy in the center – this way you have a whole circle revolving around him.  Really like the shot by the way! Any reason why you didn't straighten the horizon?"
photocritique,3dxp5v,emkat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:56 2015 UTC,thanks. yeah looking back at it now i see why i didn't. straightening the horizon made the lines in the pavement slope up from left to right. when i took and edited this (about 6 months ago) i wasn't at the point where I was fine-tuning horizontal rotation and keystoning beyond automatic adjustments. the comments from this thread have encouraged me to give it another look.

photocritique,3dyhwn,tryanotherday,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"First, I love the pose. The background is cool and adds some depth, and your choice of clothing reflects the mood very well.   I think there's a bit too much contrast for my taste. The chin is in zone 0 on my monitor (black with no detail) and I'd like to see at least something there. The side of your nose is quite bright, and could be taken down a bit. This photo is the closest I've done to a low-key portrait. Not that mine is better (it isn't, yours is superior), I just note that there's some detail everywhere on his face, even if it's in a low zone.   Okay, now for a totally personal opinion: I think your framing could be tightened and moved up. You catch a lot of shirt and the left and right of the frame are sort of empty. When I think of a low-key portrait, I think of looking down at something or someone, so I'd expect to see the top of the head. Whereas in a more light-hearted image, the head can be clipped off a la Hurley.  (end very personal opinion)  Overall, nice work. Keep it up!

photocritique,3dyhwn,mmtrebuchet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yes I intentionally made it more contrast as I love high contrast images. I got inspiration from Sin City movie ( my image is not even close to that but I like the concept of making image more dramatic).   I did notice the bright part of my nose but thanks to you, I didn't notice that my chin is not visible. Will work on it."
photocritique,3dva9p,Mr_Clump,7,Sun Jul 19 20:33:45 2015 UTC,It seems you just misses the focus. very very close though. f/8 is super tricky for macro but if you aren't using a speedlight then that can't bee helped
photocritique,3dva9p,evertjm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"Good pun. :-)  I'm finding that macro in general is super tricky, especially when you're subject has a habit of flying off, and the flowers they are on are moving in the breeze.  A flash would have been good, I have a speedlite on order now, I had to really ramp up the ISO to counteract the lack of flash, which meant I had to use some pretty heavy noise reduction during processing."

photocritique,3dxa4x,truefrogma,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:01 2015 UTC,Id say try standing farther back or using a wider lens if you got it. Both would give you a wider depth of field and less close up detail so you might see less movement blur.

It looks like you focused on the treeline instead of the sky though, and your sky is out of focus (maybe back your exposure up to 25 sec to help with blur too). I would recommend taking a pair of shots (sky in focus and foreground in focus) and then use a program like Ps to blend them together, so you can get everything in focus. If you don't have the ability to do that, I would just focus on the sky, as the foreground is dark enough that having it slightly out of focus would be minor. Other than that, maybe bring your horizon a little lower into the frame, there's some useless space in the bottom of the frame that isn't really doing anything for you.

My suggestions for this photo would be to back down on the saturation and contrast a bit.  I think I would crop it too, the edge of the flower on the right is distracting, and composition is a little lacking with the flower being dead center.  Consider following the rule of thirds for composition; it doesn't always work, but it's a place to start.      If you were to try taking this photo again, you should consider a slightly smaller aperture because the entire flower is not in focus.  Composition-wise, maybe you could try straight on for symmetry to really show the flower's perfection."
photocritique,3dxf28,anneewannee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:18 2015 UTC,"Contrast and saturation seem to be a consistent part of critique in my shots really. I would also tend to agree that it's not completely in focus (partly because I was trying for the bokeh in the background). And I do agree with the flower on the right, looking at it earlier I noticed it and it was irritating me, I might go and crop it out later."
photocritique,3dxf28,anneewannee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:38 2015 UTC,"I have a difficult time keeping saturation and contrast in check too.  Once you start sliding those controls, you lose sight of what looks real.  I tend to go back and revisit my images after some time with fresh eyes, this helps me assess whether or not I over did it."
photocritique,3dw4iy,rretnuH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"So there's a lot of nice stuff here. However (and I'm not sure you can avoid this at all), there's this awkwardness created by the near parallel lines of the river shore and the path. I'm pretty sure they're both not level at the moment, but even if you level one of them, like the distant shore, the path will still not be level. The silhouettes are nice though."
photocritique,3dw4iy,duttyRI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"I do see that, it did not bother me until I focused on it. The shore line is in fact level, but the road creates that awkward illusion. Although, maybe that does not have to be a bad thing, perhaps the slope down to the left also emphasizes the tree lines downward arc to the left. That may even help emphasize the movement of the tree trunk too. I don't know, your input was very interesting and thought-provoking. Thank you for your critique."
photocritique,3du028,bushesandbriars,2,Sun Jul 19 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"I am really fond of this photo. I don't really shoot nature or bird photography but this is gorgeous. The depth of the field really brings your focus to the heron.  A small suggestion, if it wasn't ready to fly away, is to move your camera so that the heron is in the left of the frame so that the branch doesn't distract the eye too much."
photocritique,3du028,shotbyelisa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:53 2015 UTC,Looks like the focus is on the neck and not the head but good shot.

photocritique,3dx7ln,pulsepulsebeep,5,Mon Jul 20 07:40:25 2015 UTC,Shoot something interesting. That's my advice. A flat white wall is literally the opposite of interesting.
photocritique,3dx7ln,kwmcmillan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely see where you're coming from. I was basically practicing in my backyard today, so interesting was hard to come by. The reason I like this photo is that the vines conveyed to me the reality of what is and what could have been. The vines are feet apart and that was the difference between growth and death. Pulled my interest, but I can see how it isn't the most interesting subject otherwise. Probably reading too deeply into a couple of plants on a wall.  I plan to take my first photo-trip to the old part of a nearby city. Very interesting place with lots of cobblestone, bridges, random alleys and stairwells. Hopefully I will find more interesting subjects there. It will also be a challenge for getting my settings correct since there's so much dark/light contrast there."
photocritique,3dx7ln,kwmcmillan,3,Mon Jul 20 09:01:46 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind while walking around shooting is, if all you have to do is put the camera to your face and hit the shutter, it's probably not that interesting. Try to take pictures that result in images that the average person couldn't see just walking along. Get in weird places, take weird angles, try to explain the story of the object in your frame with contextual cues. A building is nice, but you're not an architect, so don't shoot it like one. What's different about what you're shooting? What can you show people that they wouldn't see themselves? You're not shooting postcards."
photocritique,3dwxxa,mortichro,3,Mon Jul 20 05:34:33 2015 UTC,"If I'm honest, I don't really see the connection between the society/disorder thing and the picture, but maybe I'm dumb.  The sky seems a little blown out, but that may be hard to avoid without bracketing.  For some reason, I don't mind the bicycle in between the columns -- when I look at this picture, it makes me think of a kind of rustic/poor community. But I don't like the plastic lawn chairs, they seem incongruous even if they (obviously) weren't."
photocritique,3dwxxa,duttyRI,2,Mon Jul 20 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"I think OP was referring to the contrast between the blank, lifeless concrete and the colorful, vibrant clothing on the lines. The setting is cold and boring, but the people are not. That's what I understood to be the concept, anyway.  I'm just a beginner at photography, but from my limited ability to comment I would say that the angle isn't really doing the concept much justice (if I understood the concept correctly). I think your point would come across more clearly if this was just the concrete and plain walls, and the laundry lines- the trees are also bright and ""disorderly"", but have nothing to do with the people. I am probably thinking about this more like a painting than a photograph, so forgive me if I'm overstepping.  I think if I was editing this I would try and drain as much color away from the background to make the laundry lines really pop out like something that didn't belong.  Hopefully someone with more knowledge can come along and give you more experienced advice. I do like the idea here!"
photocritique,3dwxxa,pulsepulsebeep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:02:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't get it either really, I was wondering if the garden chairs are disorder. It's not a bad photo really but I don't think it particularly conveys the message."

photocritique,3dwtpu,duttyRI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think that's far from different, it's a picture of a shoe, almost without any message or feeling to  transmit, maybe pointing the camera upwards could capture something really different, happy photography :)"
photocritique,3dwjwj,djragemuffin,2,Mon Jul 20 03:12:10 2015 UTC,"It's a nice cat picture and the bokeh is nice, but he covers a pretty small part of the frame right now. I'd personally go for more cat, less background.  Also, did you crank the clarity pretty high? Sorry if I'm wrong about that, but his fur has the look I've seen when I turn the clarity high up on cat pictures in lightroom."
photocritique,3dwjwj,duttyRI,2,Mon Jul 20 06:34:26 2015 UTC,"I did set the clarity a little high I think.

photocritique,3dwes1,mmtrebuchet,3,Mon Jul 20 02:25:31 2015 UTC,"The color is great. Obvious comment, but the trees are blurry, so your shutter speed was too low, probably."
photocritique,3dwes1,duttyRI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:39:04 2015 UTC,"I don't recall the exposure time, but this was shot with a 50mm lens wide open (f/1.4 or so based on the vignetting). Shot on Velvia 50 film.   I raised the black level a bit to reflect how the slide looks when projected. The scanner rendered the trees too gray and noisy, so I took them down to just black in GIMP. Some large dust particles were removed with the heal tool. The colors were not manipulated other than the black correction."
photocritique,3dv76i,ferapol,3,Sun Jul 19 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting shot, the wall makes for a strong leading line. You seem to have some chromatic aberrations on the leaves of the trees in the background which could be corrected in Lightroom or similar."

photocritique,3duyme,duttyRI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:22:29 2015 UTC,"Less chance of shake/blur (I know the strobes will freeze motion). Noise shouldn't be an issue.   Yeah just asking as the palms in the background look like ones native to far north Queensland, foxtail palms."
photocritique,3duyme,kickstand,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:18:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they say the general rule of thumb is have a speed of at least 1/(the focal length in mm), if your subject is stationary (and you're holding the camera). If your subject is also moving, you probably want more."

Trying to think of something critical to say, it might be stronger if the aperture were more wide open, to throw the background out a bit more. But it's not bad at all. I like it."
photocritique,3duyme,kickstand,2,Sun Jul 19 19:54:06 2015 UTC,Sadly... It wouldn't be nearly as sharp wide open. I'm glad it's stopped down to 5.6 (even though that's the max aperture @ 55mm)
photocritique,3dx3q1,duttyRI,2,Mon Jul 20 06:46:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want to say- is the photo about death or something else? Is it intended to shock or evoke sadness? You have to make these decisions as you are photographing and then adjust your composition around the message. What you have here is a snapshot of a dead dog's head. There's nothing in the composition that gives us anything else; maybe you cranked up the clarity in post to try to make it more shocking, but that's not really composing a photo.   Some things you could have done-- show more of the surrounding area, put us in the scene. If there were specific sights or sounds or smells, incorporate them in the frame. For instance this is a very different photo if the animal was laying near a stream vs behind a dumpster or on the side of the road.   I take a lot of wildlife photos and I've photographed animals in various stages of death/decay from just moments after they were killed (hunting photos) to months or years later when they are reduced to skeleton. Death can be a very powerful subject for photography because you are forcing us to look at something unpleasant about our reality. You need to take it seriously and think about what your composition is going to do to the viewer.   In terms of respect for the animal, for the most part, I try to include the animal's entire body in the frame. Also, I spend time thinking about the type of animal it is and trying to highlight unique features-- for deer it may be antlers, birds may be wings or plumage etc. That gives you a starting point for a photo that is more than a side profile snapshot."
photocritique,3dx3q1,KDShark,0,Mon Jul 20 14:23:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth reply. I think that's pretty accurate: I didn't have much of a message, to be honest. I guess I was going for shock... How could I evoke that more through composition?  I have a couple more from different angles, I'll post later. It'd be good to hear if any are better."
photocritique,3dx3q1,kwmcmillan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"I found this dead dog while out and about one day. It's a fairly unusual subject that you don't get a chance to photograph often: something dead, eyes already eaten, a blue fly on it, and if you look closely (really gross) there are also maggots that were writhing around in the mouth.  I feel like a more talented photographer than myself could make this a pretty striking picture. Instead, I seem to have just captured the gross part and I don't especially want to look at it.  What could I have done to improve, in terms of composition or post processing?  The parameters are on the flickr page. Thanks!"
photocritique,3dx3q1,kwmcmillan,2,Mon Jul 20 06:50:14 2015 UTC,"Get on the floor with it? Interesting photos are those which show us something we wouldn't see on our own. I can see a dead dog from that angle, if that makes sense? Maybe show where it is or something, add context. Set and setting."

I would be really interested to see how it looks with a deeper depth of field or even go more shallow - just to see what you get. Maybe try angling/positioning the camera so that the trees at the top of the stairs are not in frame, might get a more isolated feel to it and that way the only thing organic in the shot is the couple. That is up to the photographer and what emotions you are trying to express though. Overall great shot, I would be happy with it if I took it."

photocritique,3dv4pi,JackGSY,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"I can't say I'm totally sold. The image (particularly the background) seems dark and dreary, which sort of conflicts with the excitement of the car. I think you could raise this a stop, or process with a green filter to bring up the grass a bit. Looking at the histogram shows that you have about half a stop before you start clipping, and the majority of the intensity is in a low zone, maybe zone III. (Didn't have a tool to calculate this handy)  Composition-wise, I like it. The barrier in the bottom-left could be cloned out, but the rest of the lines in the frame do a great job of emphasizing the car. I particularly like the light swoosh in the top-right that curls toward the car.   On the technical side, as mentioned, you can raise your exposure a half-stop without clipping, or you could pump the exposure in post (assuming you shoot RAW). You've done a nice job tracking the movement, the car is nice and sharp and the ground has just enough motion blur to convey movement. If you've got a steady hand, you could try shooting this at, say, 1/200 to get even more motion blur. The stopped-down aperture works here because the motion blur is enough to offset the background.   MMTrebuchet's rating: 048b12f4-b6e7-4105 (out of b166-94a8547459ad).  Keep it up!"

photocritique,3duw6q,shotbyelisa,3,Sun Jul 19 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"The light is well done, I think, try experimenting with a reflector if you haven't already (although it looks like you're using one so never mind this point if you were!).   I'm not very fond of the model's expression, but that is always easy to change.   What focal length did you shoot at? Also, this is just my preference, but try and get a little bit more of the background into the shot. I think it makes the photo a tiny bit more interesting."
photocritique,3duw6q,shotbyelisa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"No reflector, but I used a white wall behind me to reflect light onto her.  This was shot with 85mm.  I agree about getting more background in the shot, and I'll keep that in mind for my next shoot. This was my first shoot with a model so I did a lot of experimenting to see what I like. All my experience thus far has been landscapes and snapshots.  Thanks for the feedback:)"

photocritique,3dui70,literally_alliterate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"A few more details: I basically built a small ""dark chamber"" with cardboard, paper and black cloth and lighting, besides the camera flash, was done with a bicycle flash light with some cellophane paper for diffusion. I am very interested in macro photography and this was my first attempt.  I have bought some cheap extension tubes and am considering buying proper flash/lamps and maybe a light tent, to start with. If you have any experience with this type of photography, what would your recommendations be for a good setup and practices? Any feedback and opinion would be most welcome."
photocritique,3dui70,duttyRI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:37:27 2015 UTC,Cool shot. I like it but the lychees themselves could be a little better lit.
photocritique,3dui70,duttyRI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I agree with your comment. This was a very rudimentary lighting setup and I am precisely trying to improve on that front. I will most likely buy proper flash(es) and lamps, since I want to continue exploring this type of photography. This is why I am trying to get some suggestions on what to purchase and works best for this purpose."
photocritique,3dt401,cassonrugen,30,Sun Jul 19 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"A slightly better camera will not make your photos any better. Working on your technique will. To make an analogy, getting a better drill won't let you build a better woodshed if you don't know how to properly build a woodshed.  A few simple things:    The lighting is shit. Why is the model the darkest part of the picture? Why is the lighting coming from above/behind her and why did you not expose for the model and overexpose the background? It's just going to get whiter, who cares? She looks bored. Not sassy/""I hate this shit""-bored, just boringly neutral bored. It's your job to instruct her, so that's your fault, not the model's.  The framing is tediously unoriginal and looks like you were doing a shoot for a cheap catalog. Were you trying to present the shorts and the top? I think not, but that's what the picture transports. A minor (but probably general) point (in the context of fashion and portraiture): Why are you shooting so wide open? There is nothing distracting in the background, you have, including exposing the model correctly (see point 1), about 1 to 1.5 stops of room for a handheld exposure (not even taking a tripod into account). Why are you at f2.8?    You don't need an expensive toy. You need to get gud."
photocritique,3dt401,noholds,-9,Sun Jul 19 11:24:25 2015 UTC,"If I overexposed I would lose detail in the whites and also definition along her silhouette. Yeah, she does. I find and ask random girls I meet and don't pay them. She had 0 experience. Portraying her as a person, which is why I like to keep it simple. I like a tight DoF.   Also there are many other advantages to a full frame than just sensor size. For some one that acts like they know so much I feel like you should know that."
photocritique,3dt401,Irrereplaced,16,Sun Jul 19 15:09:56 2015 UTC,"Hey, apologies in advance if this sounds rude, but you posted in photocritique, a subreddit for people to critique on your work.  I personally completely agree with what /u/noholds said, which are all valid points on errors that inexperienced photographers usually do.  His comments are on the picture, which is what every photographer is judged upon, and not on the extenuating circumstances that led to the picture being less than good.  My personal comments to your answers, if you would like to hear them are:   If your lighting is not good enough and have to choose on over-under exposing, always go for properly exposing your subject. You got an inexperienced model, that's great. How many pictures did you take? If it's less than 100, you needed to take more pictures to make her relax. If out of 200-400 pictures that's the best you could find, you need to research on ways to make your models feel more relaxed, and less ""I'm being photographed right now"" Doing ""character"" portraits can be very interesting, but this implies that the character has an interesting trait to show. For your model, it could be her eyes for example, or a tattoo, I don't know. What is clear is that she is in an empty background, doing nothing in particular and this is a boring subject. The choice of a DoF is a matter of preference only when it makes sense for your picture. It is certainly a fantastic tool to help the viewer focus on what you want him to focus on, but how is this the case in your photo?   Finally, regarding full frame; as far as I know, in adequately lighted settings such as the one you were in, a bigger sensor advantage is almost negated. Could you please elaborate on the advantages that you are referring to?"
photocritique,3dt401,Irrereplaced,0,Sun Jul 19 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"Not at all rude! Critiques are a back and forth. I'm only returning fire to garner more elaboration.  I took about 170 and this isn't the strongest image, which is why I posted it. I could have bumped up the aperture a bit to 6-7, you guys are right.  And as far as the full frame goes, it's much easier to engage the model in emotion when you're standing 3 feet away instead of 7 feet away."
photocritique,3dt401,annath32,2,Sun Jul 19 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"Why not post your strongest then?  I see your point on the distance, but remember that the crop factor on your T4i is 1.6, which means instead of 3ft, you'd need to stand at 4.8, not 7 ft - not that much of a difference."
photocritique,3dt401,adriftzealot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"Just measured and it was ~7ft. So ~4.5. But again, like you said, extenuating circumstances.  And I posted this because I knew it was weak and wanted some help. I had quite a few friends tell me they thought it was great but I wasn't buying it."
photocritique,3dt401,beixinqiaoboshiqua,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"Can I ask what focal length you're shooting? Unless you're already shooting a 40 or 50 it seems like you could achieve that engagement just by going to a better, shorter focal length lens. That would bring your subject in closer and give you more options with aperture as well."
photocritique,3dt401,Anduril1123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:19 2015 UTC,Yeah 39mm. If I go any shorter I start getting undesired distortion.  Edit* 37mm
photocritique,3dt401,Gradual__russian,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenters here. Photo critique is for other people to tell you what they think of your image, not just to get upvotes and praise, so keep in mind that when someone is giving you feedback, its not an attack so there is no need to be defensive; it's the feedback you asked for by posting in this subreddit. Remember that the most iconic photos you have ever seen have been taken on older tech, that includes supermodel photos and National Geographic. Your gear is not the hindrance.   I have taken gorgeous, engaging model shots on a t2i. It's not your crop sensor that is holding you back from pictures people can connect with.  Someone does not have to be a model in order to get a good, engaged shot of themselves. Otherwise family and portrait photographers would be out of business. A character shot or portrait should not have dead eyes, that defeats the purpose of a character shot.  Many of the models that I work with are first time models, I pick them because of their unique look, & I coach them myself into getting exactly what I want from them-- that is my job as the photographer. I am also an animal rescue studio portrait photographer. In order for me to get a shot of an animal, I must engage with it and directed into what I want. You can tell the difference between an engaged animal and one that is simply looking at the camera. It is the same with any subject, models or no.  You must build a good rapport with your model and direct them into a pose and expression that will translate for other people."
photocritique,3dt401,Darkside-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"You are portraying her as a mannequin, not a person. I totally agree that the subject of the photo is the outfit."
photocritique,3dt401,kwmcmillan,12,Sun Jul 19 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think anything about this photo says that a full frame sensor is necessary. Personally, I like a little more light on the subject. It seems the background is brighter than the subject."

photocritique,3dt401,MrJezzaaah,5,Sun Jul 19 10:05:28 2015 UTC,Full frame won't change anything
photocritique,3dt401,benji1the1dog,3,Sun Jul 19 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"You don't really need a full frame, you really want a full frame, and there is nothing at all wrong with that. That said, ff will not fix what's wrong with this photograph. The exposure and framing stuff mentioned by others is true (though could have been put a little more tactfully by some), so I will focus on the model and what could be improved.   Focus. Not technical focus, but artistic focus. You said that you find women you've never met and ask to photograph them. Well, something drew you to her in order to get you to ask. What was it? Her hair, her eyes, her body, her attitude? Accentuate whatever it was that caught your eye. Catch my eye with it. This photo has no focus. It's a pretty girl in an awkward pose. Pose. Speaking of pose, I have no idea what this girl's body looks like. She has her shoulders and hips squared to the camera, and the flat lighting is not giving me any information about her shape. Leaning against the post like that isn't helping, as it is compressing her (camera) left side. Her face. If she was inexperienced and nervous, then capture that. There is an innocence and a beauty to that. Or make her laugh and relax and have fun. Whatever look you want on her face, as the photographer with an amateur model, that is your responsibility.   And don't be overly obsessed with blown out highlights in unimportant areas of the photo. Unless you are printing these, the blown out information is no big deal to lose in that background.  Keep shooting! Don't worry about your camera. One of my biggest regrets is spending too much too soon on gear upgrades, only to learn that it was my inexperience, not my camera, that was to blame for my mediocre shots."
photocritique,3dt401,nomofica,2,Sun Jul 19 16:53:46 2015 UTC,I think the pose would have been better if the arm created a gap between her and the doorframe.
photocritique,3dt401,MrJezzaaah,4,Sun Jul 19 12:30:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but what in this picture convinces you that you need a Full Frame? It's a good picture."
photocritique,3dt401,MrJezzaaah,-2,Sun Jul 19 06:56:23 2015 UTC,Better dynamic range and also just engaging with the model more. It's much harder to make them feel comfortable when you're so far away.
photocritique,3dt401,IsaacJDean,6,Sun Jul 19 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"Get a different lens, not a body.  Full frame is nice, but if you want to be closer why not grab something in the 50-80 range?"
photocritique,3dt401,DeviatedNorm,2,Sun Jul 19 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Better scene planning and accompanying post processing as well as a lens with a shorter focal length is what's required, not a new camera."
photocritique,3dsck4,XJ_Tyler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:05:29 2015 UTC,really nice ... forgive me if i am wrong .. but it seems like the photo is not sharp and kind of blurry ... it's either that the tripod was not stable enough .. or you pressed the button on the camera instead of using external button / shutter release.  It's really great and i would love to see another more stable photo of the same palce  Edit : or it could be focused wrong (not on the infinity symbol)
photocritique,3dsck4,koko121,4,Sun Jul 19 02:16:03 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/GOsivnu what about this one?
photocritique,3dsck4,shotbyelisa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:25 2015 UTC,Not OP but I think this one is stronger than the one you submitted! I compared the two side-by-side and I think the colors work better. I also think the angle did more for the photo since that tiny tree on the lower right had a fuller body rather than becoming a tiny black triangle. The shooting star is a plus as well!
photocritique,3dsck4,koko121,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:47 2015 UTC,I agree. I was messing with different settings. Everything is the same except the exposure was just a little shorter. Shooting star was pretty cool as well. I almost posted this one instead but a friend told me they liked this one better :) thanks for you input though!

photocritique,3dsck4,sammeggs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"The trees look pretty clear, the problem appears to be the rotation of the planet. you don't really have a great deal of time for the exposure before the stars begin to trail.

photocritique,3duawb,zoopybot,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"I like the actual lighting and stuff, it's a nice night photo, but for a photo of the castle, it wouldn't be my guess that that is the subject. It looks like you've taken the water lights as your subject and the castle on the top right just happens to be there. I'd say try and change where you take the shot from completely or consider changing the time of the day and just put a lot more focus on the castle itself so it's very clear as the subject of the shot."

photocritique,3dsnwg,1Subject,2,Sun Jul 19 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"f/1.8 refers to the size of the aperture, a circular mechanical opening, whose size can be changed, which screens light coming into your camera optics. A higher 'f-stop' number means that the opening is closed more, allowing less total light to reach the sensor. Changing this setting also affects the depth of field/focus with a lower 'f-stop' number and widest aperture having less depth of focus.   1/60 is the exposure time, how long the sensor was exposed to light, 1/60th of a second. If you're getting any unwanted blur from the movement of the subject (or your hand), your exposure time might be too long.   ISO 560 is a digital sensitivity setting, i.e. how sensitive the sensor is to light. A higher ISO is typically necessary in low light level conditions, but the main drawback is increased digital noise."
photocritique,3dt3yu,saturnvertex,2,Sun Jul 19 04:55:12 2015 UTC,"The picture is underexposed. If that is your subject then you are giving it a lot of background, and nearly no foreground.

Compositionally speaking this is neither dynamic or intriguing to me to make it a good picture.  It seems to be that you are in that period where you just bought your first dSLR and you are amazed by the depth of field it can achieve. Keep shooting, keep practicing.

That way the photographer  (me) doesn't feel like you just hate the photo in every way and will actually listen to you.  Her hair is not covering up a lot of her face.... what you said makes no sense. It's like, 15% tops. And you can still clearly see her face. If you don't like it, that's cool but don't pretend like her face isn't even visible. Find a more valid reason to dislike it or I won't listen to you.  And yeah I agree her hand looks a tad large and I did do my best to fix that without making it look shopped. But using a longer focal length wouldn't have done anything unless I simultaneously backed way the hell up (could do that because my back was practically at the wall).  And that would have also been kind of boring because you wouldn't be able to see where she was."
photocritique,3drxfh,carbs109,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:07 2015 UTC,you probably shouldn't post here if you are going to get bent out of shape over a very valid critique
photocritique,3dtnnm,Meowsters,2,Sun Jul 19 10:11:26 2015 UTC,"Street photography is always a challenge because you want to get close, but you also don't want your (photograph) subjects to get mad at you. I think if you'd been standing more to the right it would've been better (to get those traffic blocker things out of the way). Then you could have more focus on the girl, who I think is the most interesting one in the picture (because she's the only girl and seems uncomfortable while the men are talking). Also, use a tripod. With night photography, it helps a bunch. Any little hand shake will cause the image to blur at 1/100 with low light."
photocritique,3dtnnm,postmoderncoyote,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"I shot it with manual 85mm, kind of far away and i totally understand your point of getting in closer. It was a challenge using manual lens with no tripod, haha.  Thanks for the input, I appreciate it."
photocritique,3dtnnm,htimsnhoj,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:46 2015 UTC,I would have like to see the people left justified.  The group is your subject and they are right in the center of the photo.  The dark area on the left third of your frame does not do anything for the image.  I would have panned to the right and moved in slightly closer. EDIT: Rule of thirds
photocritique,3dtnnm,htimsnhoj,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:08 2015 UTC,"sorry, but what do you mean by justified? I kept the left dark part in because of balance, I thought if I cropped it out the picture wouldn't be balanced, as there would be too much light on those right  walls? Now looking at it, it makes sense the dark part doesn't add to the picture, it's just.. black. How would I go about balancing the picture? Add black but more meaning/detail behind it? I'm still getting a feel for the concept of balance.  Would moving the picture to the right like you suggested balance it more?  Thank you!"

photocritique,3dstnf,eric_from_ecommerce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"Learning comes before critique. It sounds backwards, but you're looking for advice or training. Critique is when you post a picture you think is your best work and get other people to give constructive criticism. Go to YouTube and learn about the exposure triangle and then just go out and shoot. When you get that picture that you think is your best, post it here and you can learn from mistakes from there."
photocritique,3dstnf,rusology,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm im not sure what gear you are using and if you plan to do mainly like product photography. You can start by cropping out the corners. The lighting you use is too harsh and needs to be diffused. That bright line behind the ring is very very distracting. Picture can be sharper.  All in all not a bad picture but I can say from experience that this subject you chose is a very difficult one for a beginner as it is super reflective. Maybe start with something less complicated and work from there. Macro is a beast and it will take time to master it. If you need help, feel free to message me anytime :)"
photocritique,3dstnf,JitteryPenguin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"IMO Macro = Tripod. If you're going to shoot macro you almost always need to shoot it on a tripod.  nothing on that ring looks like it's in focus. it's close, but not quite. it looks like you were hand holding it and the small movements in your body / camera caused you to draw the subject out of focus. macro lenses let your subject get out of focus very quickly if you aren't careful."
photocritique,3dstnf,OM3N1R,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, leave your computer, you'll get more interesting photos.   Second of all, true macro has VERY shallow depth of field, so a smaller aperture is almost always necessary, this also means you need more light if you are shooting handheld"
photocritique,3dt2lq,ShadoWritr,4,Sun Jul 19 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"That light sucks, plain and simple. You don't have to have a clean background nor does it have to sit on all white. You also definitely do not need super shallow depth of field because you actually want the product (the food) to be in focus. In the photo you posted in the comments section, you plate is cut-off and the background is a bit too busy in both images. These are also things I would try to fix.   What you need is softer light and a better camera angle. Understand that there are three basic angle for product or food photography. There is directly overhead, 45 degree, and straight on (AKA hero shot). Of course, these are not the only three angles to use, but try to becomes comfortable with knowing how to use these three (and knowing when to use each one) first.   Also, you need to style your food better. What is going on with the giant piece of lettuce directly in the back? It looks ugly and attracts too much attention. Don't just overload dishes to make dishes seem big, make the dishes look simple with no competing compositional elements.   Start with easy dishes that don't have to many contrasting textures and easy details, and that are easy to style. Learn to use soft light."
photocritique,3dt2lq,Vomitclaw,0,Sun Jul 19 11:38:46 2015 UTC,I used pure light painting for this shot mimicking the shape of a softbox. How do I make that technique appear soft?
photocritique,3dt2lq,Vomitclaw,3,Sun Jul 19 12:08:17 2015 UTC,A small light source makes hard shadows. Just because you paint the product with a slow shutter does not make it soft. It just spreads the light making it look really weird. Just put the plate near a window.
photocritique,3dt2lq,snorlaxstomp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"Take time to style the food - it's hard to photograph something that's unphotogenic to begin with. Maybe trying arranging the toppings in a more strategic / symmetrical way and drizzling the dressing so it doesn't look clumpy. Echoing what /u/vomitclaw said about camera angles, 45 degrees works pretty well with food."

photocritique,3dt2lq,OM3N1R,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"You need to start out with a clean background, natural light, and a lens that can give you shallow depth of field (aperture of f1.8 or 2.8 would be best)"

What leading lines there are don't really take your eye anywhere, and there's certainly no subject. You would have been a lot better shooting vertically, since that would add more foreground and a bit more drama. The trees, buildings, and fire escapes/construction make for a very busy scene, and there's nothing that your eye really catches on to.  What was your aim here? What are we supposed to be looking at? Maybe with some editing this could be turned into something a bit nicer, but as it stands, it doesn't seem like anything special or out of the ordinary.

It seems that your subject revolves around the statues not the arch or colors of the background. Also, backing up the previous point, the colors are too saturated for me, but that's a personal opinion.  Additionally, I don't really like the shadows on the mum and kid statute, I think it'd be a stronger photo, if their faces were illuminated better. Title fits good with the picture.   Cheers!  EDIT: Going back to arch, it's always weird seeing stuff intersect or sprout out of someone's head. I'd take headshots at parks behind trees.

In Photoshop, you could use a brush, or masks...like everything else in Photoshop, there are multiple solutions of anything that you're trying to tackle.

First mistake was not letting your model get into a truly rested/natural position. Maybe sitting her on the chain was a bad idea.   Shifting a bit towards the right to see more of her would have worked to get more of her in view. It would have changed your composition. Not a bad thing considering the chain is colliding with the bench and there's a trash can in the background.  I think it's an honest go at a portrait. There's a lot of space for improvement.   Maybe get out there with her again if she's willing and find a place you can shoot for at least a good half hour. This time find a background with much less noise, shoot vertical and fill your composition with the model. This will give you a feel for the model and her a feel for the photographer.   Shoot for however long it takes you to get it.  If you don't like your shots you're definitely on the right path. Keep f***ing practicing until you get it right.   Great contemporary portrait photographers (fashion): willy vanderpeere, Karim sadli, Lachlan Bailey. There are tons more."
photocritique,3dnans,abnormalsyndrome,2,Fri Jul 17 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"As others have said, watch what's in the background. The trash can is a definite fail.  Your lens doesn't generate particularly smooth bokeh -- try and avoid multiple point light sources in the backfield (ie, gaps in tree coverage). It's distracting as all get out to me.   I'm not as big a stickler on the hand bit as others. No idea why, just doesn't bug me as bad as most.  General composition looks good and you've done a great job getting the model engaged."
photocritique,3dnans,primarycolorman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, don't cut/crop body parts and i would have liked a little more bokeh. Even though it was f/1.4!"
photocritique,3dnans,the_simple_ent,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a different tack from the other critiques here and focus on your post processing.  I know it's pretty shady in that little park behind the Smith building, but based on the bokeh in the image it seems like you're shooting it wide open. Thus you should be at or very near ISO 100. With that in mind I find the amount of grain present in this image to be rather dissatisfying.   I'm assuming that most of the grain in the image was added in post. You should consider using less grain or better yet, no grain. Grain blurs fine details like the hairs of model and the stripes in here shirt. In general grain hides the sharpness of the lens you're using. You probably don't want to do that unless you've miss focused.  And I'll end by saying that this is a fine portrait and you've got a lot to be proud of in this image."
photocritique,3dnans,NVIDIAMAN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I have to disagree with you on a few points here. To me it looks like the grain and the tonal range in this image are an artistic choice. This shot is edited to resembel analog film, or might even be shot on film in the first place. So I don't perceive the grain or the film typical bokeh as being distracting, to the contrary one can easily say that it adds character to the shot..."
photocritique,3dnans,Tobihimself,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"Hm, I'm not totally sold on the lighting. This light is sort of flat, without much character. You have a pretty strong ambient level, and there's something coming from camera-left, providing some highlights on her arm. I'd like to see this with some more light from the side of her face or something to help reveal the texture of the face."

photocritique,3dnhzy,5Pax,6,Fri Jul 17 18:32:52 2015 UTC,the half-blurred water is a bit distracting.  I think longer exposure to make the water completely blurred would be better.
photocritique,3dnhzy,majortato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it would also add a bit of motion in the clouds"
photocritique,3dnhzy,nowthatsrich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"Sure, it might work. I was trying to show the water's motion by slightly blurring it, and I kinda like the result. But it's probably a matter of taste I think."
photocritique,3dnhzy,mmtrebuchet,3,Fri Jul 17 22:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to ditto the previous notes. I've found that I like water that's either frozen still or blurred to hell, but not the middle. Frozen water works great when you have waves crashing against things, it gives a feeling of power and structure to the water. Totally blurred water (think >1 minute exposure) makes the sea into a mist, a sort of serene perfection. Trying to straddle these two just hasn't worked well in any photo I've seen.   Also, there's absolutely nothing you can do about this, but the sunset is kind of meh. I've found the best sunsets to be ones where the sun can light the bottoms of the clouds, and it's just your poor luck that there's a band of black clouds in the way.  On the composition side of things, I think you're doing great work. I love the use of lines in the top, it reminds me of a protractor, with a lot of stuff emanating from the center of the horizon. Cool!   I also like the rock you've placed in the bottom. The way the wave is embracing it, and the texture of the rock's reflection of the sunset are wonderful. I'd love to see how the waves play with the rock over 1-minute exposures (probably best to combine several 10-second exposures to help alleviate dark current noise from your sensor). Plus, it'd be cool to see how the image changes with the tide.   Keep it up!"
photocritique,3dnhzy,elblues,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree about the sunset, it could have been much better better. Although I have to disagree with you about the semi-blurred water. I really like this look, especially when I'm trying to make the water look like it's moving. Completely frozen water might work, but it just doesn't give the picture the same 'dynamic' quality, if that makes sense. As for completely blurring it; I'm not a big fan. I like it in some cases, but in this case it would make the picture a bit more boring.   I hope I don't sound defensive, I just disagree :)"
photocritique,3dnhzy,joyo_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:17:02 2015 UTC,This is pretty good.  I don't find the half-blurred water distracting - the motion blur makes me feel like I am right there. Personally I've seen enough smooth blur water photos and this is a nice break from it.  Want to say the bottom third of the photo is a tad dark for my taste. Nothing a simple level and history brush can't fix. Or be fancier and pop a flash.
photocritique,3dog0c,_Yeu_,3,Fri Jul 17 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"This is very clearly taken from a moving vehicle and suffers for it with a slanted horizon and haphazard composition.  The wires running all across the frame could be an interesting, rule breaking, feature, but given the blurry fencepost in the foreground I'm more inclined to see them as unintentional.    I also don't see how this portrays the draught.  The hills are brown in California every summer regardless of rainfall.  Admittedly it's a tricky subject to capture, but I'm not seeing it here."

photocritique,3dktaj,loztiso,5,Fri Jul 17 02:04:42 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of detail in this shot, so it is quite interesting.  My first observation is that the temple could be centred in the image as the most distinctive subject. I wonder if you could centre it, and cut out the Chase bank sign and awning on the left? Might mean you have a square image though - the traffic adds good contrasting motion to the shot.  At first I liked the subdued colors, but I noticed lanterns on the temple roof's corners that project a pattern on the corner walls. Is this an interesting enough artifact to try and retain? What is your rationale for the coloring?"

Sharp is good for prints, even a touch over sharp, but patterns like these should be avoided.  -You've got some magenta fringing around the trees and edges of the barn.  This can be removed in PS or Lightroom.  -You might want to brighten it up slightly especially in the mid tones.

photocritique,3dl1af,afcanonymous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:37:39 2015 UTC,Lume is the glow in the dark part. If you take it in a dark enough room and selectively show just that color...
photocritique,3dl1af,Skymek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:15 2015 UTC,The highlights on the right side of the watch are distracting.

photocritique,3djs7b,WaveShredder,2,Fri Jul 17 12:44:57 2015 UTC,I kind of like it how it is.  Nice shot!
photocritique,3djs7b,lukejc1,2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:43 2015 UTC,Composition is fine. This would have been absolutely perfect had you nailed the moment and wait for the seagull to come directly in front of the sun for a nice silhouette.  That's really nitpicky though.
photocritique,3djt4a,gamma-ray-bursts,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:25 2015 UTC,"The subject is nicely separated from the background by the shallow depth of field.    The light is problematic here, I avoid shooting in the middle of the day if I can.  The very bright patch on her shoulder draws the eye and distracts from the subject.    The pose is also weak.  She's pulling her head away from the camera and scrunching her neck up in an unflattering way.  People look better when they push their heads towards the camera.  Her smile is quite forced.  My recommendation with portraiture like this is to take your time and get the model used to being photographed.  I'm also not into the toning.  I don't see what it adds."
photocritique,3djt4a,EtArcadia,2,Thu Jul 16 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"Man, I just can't get a break at portraits. They're just too hard. Won't give up though. Thanks for the advice. All the flaws are there and you made me see them."
photocritique,3djt4a,EtArcadia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely don't give up.  Portraits are challenging.  The human face has great subliminal weigh; we notice things about it, feel it, without even thinking about it.  Flattening it and freezing, as photography does, is a great challenge if you want it to still feel human.    I'll emphasize my time suggestion.  To get a good head shot it might take more than an hour, snapping away hoping to catch that one right moment.  It's completely different from shooting stationary none human subjects.  Just keep plugging away and you'll get it."
photocritique,3djt4a,ExcitedBurritos,2,Fri Jul 17 00:21:53 2015 UTC,"I would crop the top and left a little bit more - feels like it has just a touch too much room, and her shoulder being cut off a little bit makes it more noticeable.  Don't give up!"
photocritique,3djt4a,majortato,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:44:20 2015 UTC,The way her hair goes straight into her arm looks a bit off....almost looks like she's missing an arm.  The pose is a bit weak.  Feels like you didn't put much thought into it.
photocritique,3djt4a,adjasent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:56 2015 UTC,Her left shoulder is missing. Make sure you dont crop out body parts Midday light is okay to work with just watch out for hot spots like the one on her shoulder. Buy some reflectors to diffuse the harsh sunlight

photocritique,3dkjwp,norbornyl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:41:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd use an unopened, cold coke with condensation built up on the outside of the bottle. Maybe have the taco peeking out of the wrapper so you can display the food and not get grease on the sweep.  I also agree that there needs to either be a LOT more flower petals, or none. It looks a bit half-assed the way it is.  Also, I would say that there's too much space at the bottom of the photo and not enough space at the top.   Use a narrower depth of field as well."

photocritique,3dj3gq,arcticmonitor,3,Thu Jul 16 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"At full size it appears seriously over sharpened; strange patterns appear in her face.  The pose isn't great, she seems a little nervous and the position of her arms isn't particularly flattering.  Generally speaking, great portrait poses take time, you have to get the model comfortable with the situation and relaxed.  Then the pose drops and you get something natural.  In terms of framing I'd give her gaze some room; instead of placing her in the left third I'd place her in the right."
photocritique,3dj3gq,EtArcadia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:00 2015 UTC,This - and she has a lot of head room. Maybe crop some of the top out and give her more room to gaze. Looking directly at the side of the frame (especially with so much room behind her) feels off balance and abrupt.
photocritique,3dj3gq,ExcitedBurritos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:45:40 2015 UTC,I find black and white works really well on overcast days.
photocritique,3dj3gq,OstrichBurgers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:54 2015 UTC,Increase the exposure a bit and place the subject on the right if her gaze travels to the left. This balances the composition.
photocritique,3dj3gq,norbornyl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:35:36 2015 UTC,Awkward pose Weird crop Slightly oversharpened   * Distracting background  Super nitpicky critique   Have the subject look into the camera especially in portraits. Her looking away from the camera makes the viewer look at other parts of the picture and lose interest in the photo. Spot heal out all the hair fly aways in the picture Never shoot up in a subject unless you want them to look like giants. A portrait should accurately represent its subject. Either photograph your subject from an eye to eye level or photographer with you shooting down at your subject which makes your subject look slender.
photocritique,3dj3gq,adjasent,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"There should be more empty space in front of her instead of behind her, in my opinion. Also, it's a bit underexposed. Other than that, I really like this shot."

photocritique,3dh9gm,Spudgun888,2,Thu Jul 16 06:55:06 2015 UTC,"Great picture. I really like the colors.  You could have placed the sun a little lower in the frame. approx 1/3 from the top. I see that the thorns in focus is 1/3 from the bottom and that's great, but I am not sure about the composition. Maybe you could have cropped the top of the plant? This is a hard one.  If you want to get more of the plant in focus, f/4 gave you too little depth I think. You should try with f/5 or f/5,5. If you want less of the plant. You should have gone closer and used f/2,8 something close.  Lower the ISO and use a camera stand."

I would also have have used an aperture that allows for the whole or most of the flower to be in focus.  On the edit I would have less vignetting in the sky, if any at all actually. Always thought that highlights darkened by a vignette looks kinda off."

photocritique,3dijc5,10ACJed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:48 2015 UTC,This is a photo taken in RAW format and converted to black and white. I took a new approach to my post processing and would like to get feedback as it relates to the B&W
photocritique,3dijc5,gjgroess,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:49 2015 UTC,There is not enough difference between the greens of the grass and the color of the stones.  This kind of looks like an LAB conversion. Did you adjust the yellow and cyan in the RAW converter?    Overall it seems flat.  the whites are good but the middle tones on down to black are flat.
photocritique,3dijc5,davesolo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:53 2015 UTC,I think this picture has potential with a little more post processing. Did you use a green filter (on camera or post)? There is not much contrast in the image and my eye doesn't have an interesting place to land. I'd say bring the background down and increase contrast overall. If it were up to me I would even add some light rays around and have one hit the bird. Unless you are against photo manipulation. That's my 2¢.
photocritique,3dijbp,mirrorsare,2,Thu Jul 16 15:34:44 2015 UTC,lots of color noise due to high ISO.  What focal length are you using?  I feel like you could have opted for a longer exposure and lower ISO.  The foreground is cool...looks like silhouette of a lion's head.  Too bad there are so many clouds in the way.  I'm actually shocked that many stars are visible through the clouds.  Is this a composite image?
photocritique,3dijbp,majortato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"Focal length 18mm at f/3.5  And nope, this is just one exposure."
photocritique,3dijbp,elblues,2,Sat Jul 18 08:13:13 2015 UTC,I like the idea. However I think the lion head needs to have more separation with the treeline.  I am guessing f/3.5 is as fast as your lens go. To reduce noise you simply need to extend the exposure time and reduce the ISO.  You can use an exposure calculator to work out your shutter speed.  For example the same 5 sec. f/3.5 and ISO 12800 could be shot at 60 sec. f/3.5 at ISO 1000 with the equal amount of light. That should greatly reduce your noise problem.  You'd need to put your camera on a tripod (or the ground) and put it on bulb mode though.

photocritique,3de4cf,melodamyte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:45:47 2015 UTC,That is damn sharp for wide open at 2.8! Did you try stopping it down at all to get it even sharper? I'm not an expert so I'll leave the composition critique to others.. Nice pic though.
photocritique,3difds,Doormatt_z,4,Thu Jul 16 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"The trouble here is that there are enough distracting elements in the shot that I'm not quite sure what the subject is. The big white blob (a lamp) off to the right draws your eye, but it's not very interesting because it's kind of blown out and out of focus. Still, that's where your eye goes. There's also what looks like a human head between it and the record player. We like to look at people, but we don't have any context of what this one is up to, what he's paying attention to or doing. The phone is blocking his face, if it wasn't there then there'd be more hope for the shot.   The glasses are in focus and have a decent level of exposure, but the overall image is lacking in compositional elements to draw attention to them as a main subject. Leading lines, patterns, repetition, these are a few things that could help. If nothing else, get rid of other distractions."

photocritique,3deygo,EtArcadia,2,Wed Jul 15 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"I like what it could have been, if it was portrait oriented. If the top wasn't cut out like it is, it could be a great photo, since the bottom has a great start and composition."
photocritique,3deygo,mirrorsare,2,Thu Jul 16 04:41:15 2015 UTC,I'm actually a big fan of the composition (as an object) but the placement of it is a little off. I would have probably looked to have composed with it more centered while giving 10-20% more to the top of the waterfall.    I'm not sure whether portrait orientation would have achieved this as you would have lost the sides of the waterfall which for me adds a lot to the image.  Perhaps next time also experiment with taking an additional frame to stitch later. I'll do this a bit for my waterfalls when shooting with a wide lens and just want to capture that little bit more. Works well.

photocritique,3dftw6,gamma-ray-bursts,2,Wed Jul 15 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"Hm, I'm not quite sure what to think of this. I mean, you've clearly identified a cool thing to shoot, and I don't think placing a 'subject' in the traditional sense works. But I can't quite get behind the composition here. It's like there are two images vying for my attention: the rubble at the bottom of the frame, and the strong lines in the beams on the top. The middle of the frame is kind of blank.   I don't know how I'd make this better, though. Maybe if the camera was closer to the ground? Or if the big gizmo hanging from the ceiling on the left side was made the subject? Ultra-wides are super-hard to shoot, and I'm no expert.   On the technical side, it's all good news. The choice to get this enormous DOF was a good one - this is not the photo for 'dreamy bokeh', it's nice to see all the grimy textures. Exposure is nice, too. The clipped windows really do a nice job for this shot. (Reminds me of the windows in The Stanley Parable. Clinical. Impersonal.) I'd like to see it with a little less contrast, though. The clarity of this image is like a cool mountain morning, brisk and refreshing. Of course, it's a totally personal opinion, but I think of this scene being gray and smoky, with the blacks dulled by years of dust.   Keep it up!"
photocritique,3dftw6,mmtrebuchet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"Damn. You really got in there. And I can see what you mean. Ultrawides suck everything in so many times it's hard to convey what the actual subject is. I only have a 10 20mm and a 50mm and the fifty wasn't going to work here. I shot at 10 instead of 20 because I wanted the viewer to get a sense of what that room looked like as much as possible, making for a more obvious sense of generalized degradation and decay and ugly and broken. So you get all the trash and rubble on the ground, then there's the broken walls and a compromised and fractured ceiling, which isn't too visible here. But yes, shooting at ultra wide angles is often very difficult and frustrating and in this case I feel there was a better job to be done. But I'm not sure how."

photocritique,3dftw6,London_Jones,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:03:24 2015 UTC,I like this a lot because of the natural light and the perspective you chose in relation to the open hallway toward the left third. is this part of a series?
photocritique,3dfr5i,thetravelloger,2,Wed Jul 15 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"Cool shot! B&W works very well here, I would not have thought to shoot this B&W. Great use of lines in the composition, they lead the viewer to all the right places (except the stairs on the bottom-right, but there's nothing you can do about that). The flag's a nice touch.   I have to say I'm not sold on the cropping. There's a lot of sky here, and I don't think it adds much. The vignetting is sort of oppressive and very evident with a featureless sky like this. I found cropping off the top third to help.   The contrast is a bit high for my taste, I think you could raise your shadows and get a more peaceful effect. Totally personal taste, of course.   Keep it up!"
photocritique,3dff8n,neo_halo,5,Wed Jul 15 21:08:48 2015 UTC,"I find it very compelling and unexpected: the blank look, the featureless background.  I like portraits like this that focus on the surface, the mask.  Too many pictures try to give this illusion that we're getting to know this person through the picture by seeing their ""soul"" or other nonsense. Here we're left with just this shell, a much more realistic, at least in my mind, interaction with the subject.  I'm not sold on toning or the vignette.  As unadorned as the picture is, these affectations really stand out.  Please share more as you continue to make them, I'm very curious."

photocritique,3dc9zf,iTSSOGRiM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:10:05 2015 UTC,I agree here.  I'd crop some of the ground to push the mountains higher up in the composition.  This will make them look bigger and kinda imposing.

Like others said, there is too much ground.  More contrast to the sky and maybe lowering the highlights will bring more detail to the sky."
photocritique,3dc9zf,Nick_Rad,2,Wed Jul 15 12:22:42 2015 UTC,"To add on what others have said, the shot is great and right now a little bit of a crop could make it better. Also dropping the highlights a bit so the clouds have more detail.  If you could do this shot again I would have the camera a bit lower to the ground so you can still grab some of that interesting ground texture, with the horizon at the base of the mountains aligned with the lower third and the barn at the lower left third. Maybe standing a little further back with a bit more zoom would help compress the image and really make the mountains look towering in contrast to the barn in the foreground as well."
photocritique,3dc9zf,scotttech1,2,Wed Jul 15 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of ground in the photograph. I would either crop closer or change the crop ratio.  I'm a sucker for 16:9 just because I love cinema, but either way, you need to lose more of the ground.  It's a good shot for your first. Love the light. However, the sky seems a bit off.

photocritique,3dc9zf,jonclock,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:25 2015 UTC,"I like it- but all your photos seemed a bit hazy. Could probably be helped in lightroom or by adjusting your exposure in camera (seems you were shooting a lot with wide open aperture- maybe try stopping it down and compensating with slower shutter). I know that having a polarizing filter on my lens really helps me get the most out of bright skies without overexposing and adds vivid colors.   From a composition standpoint- the link below was my favorite. You'd do better to get a little closer to the subjects in your foreground- barn and deer - which can be done by zooming, cropping in post or simply moving your feet. There's too much foreground, but overall the pictures were very nice.   No bears??  https://www.flickr.com/photos/23799390@N02/19710018571/in/album-72157655474352219/"

I don't know a ton about cameras but I immediately thought it was a leica when I saw the pic, it just has a distinctive look.  There's a lot of good stuff to look at in it. My only gripe would be that maybe the black part takes up too much of the shot; obviously it wasn't posed but moving a bit closer could have given you more girls/hallway and less black. Great shot though."
photocritique,3de5kq,duttyRI,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:30 2015 UTC,My other option is to make it square format. I know that the area of big contrast draws the eye in and I shouldn't be having that if the subject is the girls

You've cut off his back foot a little, but that's not too bothersome as its not really an interesting detail. The focus on the eyes and ""praying"" hands is good. I think you did well with depth of field to make those features stand out while the grid of the surface he's one quickly blurs. Said differently-- DOF is thin, but not too thin to the point of being gimmicky.   I see you are close to the front page of 500px (85pt) -  so I'll like this and hopefully others here will too."
photocritique,3dfb5t,KDShark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"There's not much you can do about this in camera, but I find the screen (?) that it's standing on to be visually loud and distracting.

He was a very small mantis, maybe 1.5 inches in length. I thought about moving him to some rocks, but he'd just blend into the background. The black  of the screen was the most neutral backdrop available.   Also, I saw some of your comments on the ""decay"" and ""armenia"" photos. I'd love it if you could have a look at my B&W heron photo (posted today) and make suggestions. I was trying to bring up the shadows to be less contrasty, but not sure I like the result."
photocritique,3dfb5t,rusology,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:31 2015 UTC,Looks fine. You edited some parts of the mantid too much causing the halo around its head and body (over sharpened). Since the back leg is missing perhaps you could just crop it out and do like a head/leg portrait shot. Can see some camera shake as well so it could be sharper.   All in all its good. Hope this helps.

photocritique,3dbar8,EirikHavre,3,Tue Jul 14 23:41:18 2015 UTC,Look all around the edges of your viewfinder when you're about to take a shot. It's important to be aware of what is there as well as what is in the middle of your frame.
photocritique,3dbar8,lumos8,2,Wed Jul 15 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"To make it dimmed? Were you relying on auto functions, and when you stepped close the photo was dimmer?   If so, you can always post process with any editing software.   Cropping has to be purposeful, in that the photo still makes sense when it's been cropped. Cutting off the ear and paw is a tad unsettling, which is why a few of us brought it up."

photocritique,3dbar8,minneru,9,Wed Jul 15 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"IMHO the best parte of this photo is the color palette, nice tones. But the composition is not really good... Its always weird when a photo cuts a little part of you subject ( in this case the tip of the ear or the pawn).    Also, the subject is not really interesting. I mean, cats are awesome, but this particular instant doesnt strike as an interesting moment to me.  I think that the beauty of the shot relies on an easy effect, which is the shallow depth of field. This talks more of the equipment you own instead of your skills as a photographer.  If you are starting up, and are interested in getting better, I WOULD REALLY RECCOMMEND TO STOP USING THE SHALLOW DEPTH OF FIELD. This will avoid that you get pleasing results easily, allowing you to focus more on one of the following: COMPOSITION, SUBJECT, LIGHTING.  Sorry for being a dick, and I hope that I dont sound patronizing when I soy that I with that someone wouldve given me that advice when I was starting up."
photocritique,3dbar8,geowonder,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this.   I see this at my job when they take pictures of the tattoo work.

I think you might benefit from placing the light source a tiny bit father away from your face, and maybe a little higher, to take some of the shine off your nose, and because it seems odd to have the part of your forehead that's farther from us be darker than the side of your eye– it's like your face is being lit by a strip of light, and that's a little weird.

It may look better with a more pronounced depth of field or if thats not an option, shift to the other side of the tree to avoid that in the background."

photocritique,3dbker,jazk95,3,Wed Jul 15 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"While they may have been a bit harsh in their phrasing, /u/BeesMichael has a point.  An ND filter is a great way of getting great textures out of water, but the overall image still needs to create something. A common touchstone of gauging the calibre of an image is ""can this easily be replicated?"" The story you've told here is that another artist made an interesting sculpture, so your role in the image is only a minor one. Using that ND filter to capture a waterfall in a remote wilderness at sunrise? That would make a little more of a splash.  In terms of editing, crop out the concrete ledge, try to recover the highlights a bit, maybe boost the shadows and increase clarity. The brick and trees look a little warm so I'd probably bring the temp down. I'd also work with the blue channel a little to try and get more richness in the water and sky.  Get out there and keep shooting :)"

photocritique,3d8jfs,mirrorsare,6,Tue Jul 14 09:54:56 2015 UTC,"Technically it's fine (the contrast is cranked a bit too much for my taste).    You have to ask yourself why you like it. I'll breakdown its contents a little for your: It's a picture of a featureless nondescript office building against a dramatic sky, isolated completely from any sort of context.  The low angle gives it a bit of an imposing feel.  The high contrast black and white look is reminiscent of mid-twentieth century photography and film (noir in particular).  The simple graphic, almost minimalist, composition calls more to things like the Madison Avenue style ads and early superhero comics than any particular photographic tradition.  What we are left with is like a simple vessel for this sense of nostalgia for the height of the modern era. It's stripped of any text beyond that, no identifiable skyline, no cars to place it in time, no people to interact with the building.  While it's reminiscent of film noir in its style it doesn't contain any of the noir subtext: the disillusion with modern social hierarchy, moral ambiguity, feelings of powerlessness before the machine of society (maybe getting close on this one).  To me a kinda sorta noirish shot, without any other context that isn't all that interesting but maybe it's something you can work with."
photocritique,3d8jfs,EtArcadia,2,Tue Jul 14 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"Looks technically sound from my phone. (But it's just a phone). I'm wondering if you used any filter for the BW or if you did it post processing (the blue sky was given lots of depth and the building has a good bright front for contrast). All in all though I'm a little jaded to photos of buildings right now. They look great and sharp, but show me something different and new. Photos of buildings on Instagram may be popular but art isn't always popular.   Keep going man! Expand your horizons."

As in, it's not unpleasant to look at but I'm also not really enjoying looking at it. Personally, I find her expression a little vacant; I'm not saying she is, and that's not really something you can help especially if you didn't have her pose for it. But it just looks like she doesn't care about the book she's searching for, when at the very least she could have a puzzled/interested/intrigued/joyous/any number of expressions.  With regards to composition, my eyes keep being drawn to the blown out window; when I cover that side with my hand, I end up looking at her/the bookshelf a lot more. Cropping it out would involve cropping some of her hair though."
photocritique,3d9kyp,duttyRI,2,Tue Jul 14 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"There's something unnatural about the texture of her face.  I can't put my finger on what it is exactly.  Maybe too much makeup, too much digital retouching, or some kind of clarity lowering area brush. Maybe it's just the light, but something seems off.    In any event, it's hard to get too excited about the picture in general.  I agree with u/duttyRI that her expression is vacant.  There's something haphazard about the text of this picture.  What is it trying to say?  Is it about politics and history (the books and little spartan picture hint at this)?  But what does this have to do with bored looking teen girls?  Stylistically it seems a little lost as a decolored digital image.  It looks a little like a stock photograph or something out of a college brochure, but obviously isn't taken in an institution.  It doesn't consciously refers to any particular school of photography nor does it break any new stylistic ground."

photocritique,3dazh7,EtArcadia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:41:52 2015 UTC,At full size this looks seriously over sharpened.  Artifacts are showing up in the soft focus areas.   Overall f4.0 is probably no a great choice for a subject with so much depth.  The soft focus lavender on the right is distracting.  Shallow depth of field is good for isolating a subject against a background but in a landscape like this everything should be more or less even ground in terms of focus.

If you spend some solid time, it will change the way you look at everything and undoubtedly make you a stronger artist. It especially helps with breaking down composition and understanding colors, contrast and the effect of shapes and lines. We should all spend more time here.   This photo is a bit bland to me- perhaps overexposed- but the grey and whites don't really capture the attention. I love the idea/concept and suggest you crop this down even further to your favorite little bit and then bring out some more tone. Maybe by dodging and burning by hand. One thing that's fun is to view the exposure as a canvas and now you get to hand paint it in post to bring out little bits (all very subtle or you lose the minimal feel)"

It's all about what you want to portray, why is it in color? why landscape instead of portrait? These, and many other questions, are the ones that you need to think about before you hit that shutter button.   Google: Gregory Krutzen His photography needs a whole team of people and weeks or even months of preparation to take a one shot, EVERY single detail is thought out.   Google: Nan Golding She got really famous for photographing her friends and lovers in the 90's, she took pictures of the ugliness of everyday life. Very graphic images (one self portrait of her with a black eye after her boyfriend beat the shit out of her) Ballad of sexual dependency, look it up, beautiful book.  Google: Moriyama Japanese photographer Daidō Moriyama  He is most famous for his book, Stray Dog published in 1999.  He wanders the streets of his city (can't remember which one at the moment) like a stray dog. His believe is that every photograph is already made, we just have to capture it.  I see a lot of people here on r/photocritique asking what they could do better. Some images are technically good, but nothing more than that. If you want to do better in photography, make up a series, experiment, look at other photographers, find what makes you horny and shoot it but don't think too much about the technical side of things. Always exploring the settings of your camera doesn't help you and keeps you in the amateur zone. (Though it is good to know the relationship between Light, speed and aperture) It doesn't matter if someone else has done it, everything has been done before but what matters is what touch you put on it.  I hope this answers some of your questions (or makes you more confused) and because I'm such a narcissist I'm gonna put a link to my blog here (www.ulfarloga.blogspot.com), I started shooting pictures when i got my first polaroid camera when I was 10 and I'm still finding my style or voice.

As others have mentioned, foreground is half a stop under exposed. You can easily fix it in Lightroom by pulling the shadows out. Try for a better composition. Putting the waterfall in the dead center doesnt quite work, at least in this composition. The empty space on the right side doesn't add anything to the picture. You could have tried a different angle. [Subjective] I personally would have gone for  longer exposure, to smooth the water down. But its purely subjective, a lot of us do like to freeze the action with a fast shutter speed."
photocritique,3d7amz,Mr_Supertramp,2,Tue Jul 14 05:33:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I definetly would have went with long exposure as well but I need to purchase one of those filters I believe (forgot name.) So I am able to do such in daylight. Thanks so much for the info it's much appreciated!
photocritique,3d7amz,Canon_Goes_Boom,3,Tue Jul 14 13:48:24 2015 UTC,ND Filter! You can also try cranking your aperture all the way up to get a darker image. I got this photo without an ND filter just a few days ago. (f/22 - 1/4 shutter - ISO 100)

Also, by tone down, you mean turn the saturation down, or their exposure in general?  I actually already made the water more vibrant, because this river tends to be pretty dull looking... I was afraid I overdid it, but I guess not if you're telling me to push it further :)"
photocritique,3d9p2m,helloze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"When i mean tone down the dark areas, i meant the metal structures and the fence, because i feel like they're blending in with the wood and brown colors. possibly try to bring them out, so there's a bigger difference."
photocritique,3d9lyc,natebaken,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:01:09 2015 UTC,Beginner here so everything i say take as crap advice:  You missed the focus on the eyes and the focus falls on the glasses.  The blur/bokeh is nice and creates a strong leading line.  But l think the subject matter is meh nothing about the model interests me or grabs me at all which is subjective I know but feels like a snapshot of a friend rather than something that could draw me in.

photocritique,3d74na,tweedyrug,3,Tue Jul 14 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'll second Nebula's suggestions. Using a low iso for astrophotography would be awesome, but you just can't do it. iso 1600 is usually considered the minimum to get useful results, any lower and it's usually too dark.  Here's some examples of what you can do:  Startrails (stacking): http://i.imgur.com/rpgmUg2.jpg   Startrails (15min exposure): http://i.imgur.com/EA6jx9n.jpg   Startrails (more traditional): http://i.imgur.com/a2yxAwN.jpg   You can see some blur in the last (more traditional) one. This is from the longer exposure (30 sec). That shot was taken at 24mm, so even at very wide angles you can still get motion blur.  As a side note: if you're interested in trying your hand at stacking you'll need a camera that can do time lapse photography. This is one of those areas where a better camera really is necessary. Technically you could sit out and take them by hand with a remote, but the shot of my house is a composite of ~60 images over about 3 hours, so, yeah."
photocritique,3d74na,tweedyrug,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:16 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks. I definitely found out where I went wrong. It's was my iso which I probably should have figured out. Just curious since you seem to know what your doing, do you just shoot the star photos at a random time or do you wait for a certain day if month or something? Thanks for the response"
photocritique,3d74na,tweedyrug,5,Tue Jul 14 04:31:24 2015 UTC,"No problem, and feel free to pm me if you want to talk shop, I'm more than happy to help.  Anyhow, there is a little bit of timing involved in getting decent shots, among several other things I'll get to. I actually need to get out and retake some of these with some different gear as those are from a while ago.  Back on topic haha, I'll split this up so it's easier to read.  1.) What do you want to do? if you want to capture the core of our galaxy (what astronomers refer to as the 'Zone of Avoidance') you need some place that gets very, very dark at night. Any light pollution from nearby towns or cities refracting and diffusing through the atmosphere will trash your shots. Ideally, you're several hours from any inhabited places for shots like this. But, that's impossible in many places, so check websites like this to find the darkest area you can reasonably reach. That being said, it doesn't have to be totally dark, I live on the eastern seaboard of the US and can still see it at night, though light pollution is apparent in my shots. If you want to include other objects in your shot besides stars, some excess light may help your shot, or be essential to it.  2.) Timing. this relates closely to #1, as what you're trying to do will affect your timing. As a general rule of thumb though; shoot when it's cool outside, the atmosphere is generally more favorable and the cooler temps can actually help to reduce sensor noise during long exposures. Try to shoot when the humidity is lower, and let your camera acclimate to the climate before shooting. After several hours of shooting at night, even when it's clear out, your camera (depending on where you live) will be soaked, I've actually had to delete shots off the end of a set because during the last 30min or so the moisture buildup on the lens made the shots unusable. If you have equipment that can handle it, shoot in winter (just not, like, -30 or anything; cool temps don't help if your mirror is frozen in place and your battery is dead due to the cold.) If you want to include landscape into your shot, the moon can do your lighting for you, but that means waiting for it to come out, and favorable weather (this is what I did with the shot of my house.)  3.) Prep and setup (I'm going to assume you're using a D-SLR.) Some discipline and control over the situation is required for this type of photography. If you can, make sure that nobody around you uses any kind of light during exposures as even small amounts of light, ie. cellphone, is blinding at night and the camera can even pick it up if it shines through the back of the viewfinder. A sturdy tripod and a remote release is essential to getting sharp shots, and if your camera offers it, fire the camera in 'remote mirror-up'. This will set the mirror to lift before the shutter is opened to avoid shaking the camera due to the mirror lifting (one press will lift the mirror, another will open the shutter.) Finally, as I said earlier, if you want to do star trails, you'll need a camera that can do time lapse. Also, for the love of god make sure you're fully charged before attempting time lapse, the extended amount of time the camera has to keep the shutter open will wreck your battery, especially in cold weather. This mode will allow you to dictate the camera settings, total # of shots, and any delay between exposures. This will allow the camera to remain absolutely motionless during the shots. Just how still the camera has to stay is borderline insane, just walking next to the camera while taking time lapse for stacking could destroy the entire set. If the camera would move, any shots before cannot be used with any after, because when you stack them it will create a double image, as you are literally setting them on top of one another, but times 50 or 100 (hence the precision.)  Sorry for the book, hopefully that covers it. If you have any other questions feel free.  Also, if you actually read all of that, the advice is really for somewhat more complicated shots. If you just want a picture of the Milky Way just set your camera up on a tripod someplace really dark, open the aperture, set focus to infinity, shutter to ~25 secs and iso to ~1600 and you should get something useable.   :)"

photocritique,3d79dz,OM3N1R,2,Tue Jul 14 01:53:43 2015 UTC,"It's got some nice color and texture, but there are a few big critiques here for me. First and foremost, composition. The foreground here is really dull, especially when it seems like you could have taken a few steps forward to get rid of the boring dirt road. I also think there's too much sky here - you could cut off about half of it and still have a nice gradient from red to blue. Ideally, you would have moved forward; then, the focus would be on the mountains and the foreground rather than the rather unimportant blue sky at the top.   Other than that, you've titled it 'Long Exposure Landscape'... which begs the question, why long exposure? Rather (since I know the technical aspects of photography), why specify long exposure? There's no movement whatsoever, so as a viewer, there's absolutely no way for me to think that this was shot at anything longer than 1/50. If you want to advertise the fact that it's a long exposure, that's fine. But I'd suggest getting some elements of a long exposure here (and that being said, I don't think there's enough opportunity here for good movement. There aren't enough clouds to really add anything in terms of movement).   All that being said, I think you've got some great elements in this image. But I also think that there's room to improve from this and make it way better. Can I ask what the metadata is?"
photocritique,3d79dz,MajorSuccess,0,Tue Jul 14 06:25:24 2015 UTC,"Metadata is on 500px. 30 sec f8 ISO 100. Long exposure landscape is not a title just a description.  I wanted to include Jupiter and Venus, so there is a lot of sky. I should have shot at 5.6 so as to shorten the exposure and not have the movement in the planets.   Thanks for your insight."

photocritique,3d79dz,mr_not,0,Tue Jul 14 12:37:30 2015 UTC,"It's fine to shoot distant landscapes at lower apertures since you are focusing at infinity. It's very necessary if you shoot a lot of night time photography, and want to capture things like the milky way."
photocritique,3d66le,photo_hunter,8,Mon Jul 13 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be harsh here.  In terms of concept, it's very heavy handed and doesn't play to photography's strengths in any particular way.     These images provide almost no subtext, beyond women as the source of sin (a very very tired cliche much more appropriate for deconstruction than repetition) and some very likely unintentional references to advertising (could be an  interesting direction regarding commercialism/advertisement and sin).  What I look for in photography is something which uses the medium to do more than simply illustrate a simple idea: ""we are blind to our sins"".    This kind of direct textual work is reminiscent of photography's pictorialist period (think Julia Margaret Cameron's ""Sadness""), a time looked on with almost universal derision for its naiveté by the modernists and postmodernists who followed.  I think it's starting to get reappraised now, but it's for its purely aesthetic qualities, which these images are lacking.  While they're reasonably competent from a technical perspective, they definitely aren't beautiful.  The light is harsh, the spaces feel cramped and very obviously staged, the model's make up is too thick etc.  If you're into this kind of idea, look at the 19th century photographers who delved deep into it: Cameron (who I mentioned before) and Henry Peach Robinson come to mind.  But keep in mind that this is a very old fashioned way of thinking about photography and anything you do should squarely address the past rather than simply ape it."

photocritique,3d66le,E6H,2,Mon Jul 13 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"The subject matter has been touched on already by /u/EtArcadia so I think I'll stick to composition, focus, and color.   I'm not sure where to look. there are no strong leading lines, and isn't any hierarchal brightness, either– the brightest point is the chair she's not sitting on. The second brightest point is either that reflective glass of the cabinet. On top of this, things are not laid out in a way that's pleasing to the eye. The image feels cluttered and noisy, like a panel of an I Spy book, but whenever I go to look into the details of the image, there's nothing clever to find. The pattern of the curtain is weak, because the shadows create vertical lines but the circles break it up in a really harsh way. That backdrop could only work if the curtain were stretched out or lit extremely evenly, because right now it just looks like a mess. The floor has a beautiful grungy grain, but it's too bright and too contrasty the way it's been lit and processed, and besides– it detracts from the image. Her environment is so distracting it's difficult to get a good look at her.   If you're really intent on such a cluttered background, make this woman our reprieve from it. Give her a more modest dress, and have the fabric be solid rather than patterned. I think you chose the wrong chairs, too. They're bright, but covered in what we're supposed to be looking at. I think everything should have character, but there needs to be some sort of agreement as to where we're supposed to look.  The brightness of that upholstery matched with the ornateness of the wood is a real attention-hog. In theatre, stages might be beautiful, but they never steal our attention from the show itself.   So in short, I think you need to simplify your textures. Save those contrasty patterns and textures for where you want us to look, or else make where you want us to look somehow different. That's a beautiful dress, but I can't see the beauty over the loudness of the rest of the image.   I think you could also benefit from a more developed color-scheme. We've got the warm tones of the necklaces and her skin, the blue-greys of the background, the green-greys of the floor, and that artificial-looking purple of her blindfold.   I think as a painting this is beautiful. It's like you're trying to show off the gamut of your skill with a brush. You can make every kind of material, every pattern, and every color. But this isn't a painting. It's a photograph, and we know it took no effort to make these patterns and colors, so the image is... boring. And noisy."

Regarding the photo: if you are trying to show chaos in the order, then you need to show the order. I think you can achieve that by rotating and tweaking with the photo so that walls are straight.

photocritique,3d7mox,jerrred,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:11:04 2015 UTC,"i see that you're brand new, and i'd say you're doing alright. work on composition. there isn't really any clear subject, it reads more as just a generic shot. however, i really like the reflection of the clouds off of the building."
photocritique,3d5qmt,jackbauer616,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"Quite nice, if a little dark, it just needs a little boost in exposure.  It's very straight forward and looks like many of the photos in David Aurora's book Mushrooms Demystified which you should check out if you're into mushrooms."
photocritique,3d5qmt,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"haha Im not really into them it just started to rain where I went to go shoot so I took a few quick shots and left, thank you though"
photocritique,3d5qmt,rusology,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:34:39 2015 UTC,I think the mushrooms 'friend' kinda makes it not lonely anymore. Picture is a bit dark and gloomy looking. If possible maybe get the whole mushroom clear next time (not sure what gear you used). You need to be more sensitive to what is in the picture as im kinda distracted by those partial leaves creeping into the shot. I think it is an okay shot so i hope my 2 cents helped.
photocritique,3d0x6d,ToTouchAnEmu,27,Sun Jul 12 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"Great photo, but classic brenizer glitch on the left side. It's clearly visible that the walls is bent unnaturally. Every other bend in the frame can be looked over, but that part really distracts me."
photocritique,3d0x6d,Dunavks,4,Sun Jul 12 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the image would benefit from being cropped not far from her elbow. That way the ""glitch"" would not be there and she would not be in the middle of the frame (which I don't like in this particular image)."
photocritique,3d0x6d,EirikHavre,5,Sun Jul 12 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The ""glitch"" or perspective warp is blatant everywhere because of all the leading lines.  The carpet rising up to to cushion level of the couch, the table is all kinds of warped. The wall is both bending and bulging.   Also the photo needs to be straightened."
photocritique,3d0x6d,PeaceOfMynd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:37:36 2015 UTC,Would using a lens correction profile in LR help with this?

photocritique,3d0x6d,PeaceOfMynd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:37:20 2015 UTC,Nope to correct this you will need liquify and perspective warp tools
photocritique,3d0x6d,Mafia-Hitman,11,Mon Jul 13 05:18:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get down voted, but its time to play art class.  You seem to have executed the technical aspect of the photograph well, given the tools at your disposal.  Compositionally, this thing is a mess. You've got tons of leading lines, but they lead to a dark blob of negative space that is doing nothing. Your model interrupts the leading lines, instead of being the focus of them. The DBoNS wouldn't be so bad, but there's a TV screen in there that is terribly distracting. Photographers are notorious for breaking rules to get their shots; I would have climbed up there and unplugged the screen, security be damned! :-). Also, the white chair breaks up the lines. Moving it would have helped, or substituting a dark chair if one is available. Without that screen and the chair, the DBoNS would function better, returning a degree of focus to the model.   Technically, as others have mentioned, the line are warped. While I haven't used Brenizer, perhaps a well calibrated pano head would help? Use of one would slow you down: if the photo is made from 50 shots, and you did it in 2 minutes, then you only took about 2-3 seconds per shot; with a pano head you would at least double that. Perhaps in this situation you could cover the model first, and then let her take a break while you cover the rest of the scene.  Lessons to take away: don't be afraid to modify your environment to improve your shot, especially if you are already bringing in lighting equipment. Find the right tools for the job: free handing, or just using a ball head for panos doesn't work very well, you really need a well set-up pano head to work in close quarters: that's why they were invented. They aren't cheap, but if you really want to explore this technique you might want to invest in one. Supporting a 6D + 85/1.8 is going to require a very expensive one."
photocritique,3d0x6d,ysengrimus,2,Mon Jul 13 12:36:06 2015 UTC,Well if you read my other comments you would have seen that I mentioned purposely sacrificed good composition to exaggerate the lack of dof.
photocritique,3d0x6d,ysengrimus,2,Mon Jul 13 13:38:34 2015 UTC,"Why not strive for both? Don't limit yourself by pursuing a fetish, instead use the technique in the service of art, rather than putting the art in service of technique."
photocritique,3d0x6d,ysengrimus,3,Mon Jul 13 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Well I guess I don't think the composition is as bad as you think it is. I mean yeah its not perfect but I still enjoy the way it came out.  If I had used the leading lines of the wall to lead towards the model, I would have had to move the camera up and to the left or move the couch entirely (wasn't an option).  Not that I don't appreciate your comment. I agree that I've seen better composition and I've shot photos with better compostion. But again I suppose we both value composition at different levels. For me things like proper lighting and shadows outrank absolutely perfect composition."
photocritique,3d0x6d,fnord_happy,4,Mon Jul 13 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the purpose of critique: its all about pointing out what can be improved in a piece. If all you talk about is what's works, and gloss over what doesn't work, then you don't learn anything. As a result, the comments can sometimes come off as harsher than they are meant. I don't think that the composition is horrible, just that there were things that you could have done that would have improved it that would have added a couple of minutes to the setup. Its a question of looking at the scene and seeing the final result, including things that can be changed to improve it. As long as you're hauling along a light, why not break a few more rules? That's part of the fun of the art.  When light, shadow, composition, subject, and technique come together photographs can become great, and that's what we're always shooting for. You've got light and shadow, the technique has some issues due to lack of equipment, but the composition got away from you a bit. Next time, look at everything the camera is going to see, and get more proactive about the background. Don't rely on DoF alone to isolate the subject, take as much control of the environment as you can.  Cheers!"

It's very jarring to look at a photo where lines are supposed to be straight and they aren't. This is why the straight horizon ""rule"" exists. The rule can be bent but you have to remember that it's just one horizon and all the other lines kind of ""attach"" themselves to the horizon, so your brain doesn't freak out.  In the case of this photo there are just too many lines doing their own thing."

Very good execution of the method, but I think your could've had a wider depth of field and it would make the picture better.   That, or just ha in the pillow not that, and I think that alone would make it look better without changing the depth of field.   Ninja edit: the more I look at it, the pillow is just weird looking and distracting to me. Otherwise, it's great."

photocritique,3d0x6d,DiversityOfThoughts,3,Sun Jul 12 17:34:24 2015 UTC,About 50 photos I think.  And only a couple minutes. The only set up was an octobox right in front of where she was sitting
photocritique,3d0x6d,awhaling,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:45:59 2015 UTC,"Do you fill the entire center frame with the subject, then shoot around it?"
photocritique,3d0x6d,DiversityOfThoughts,3,Sun Jul 12 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"No I get as close as I can. As an example, one of the frames I shot was her head and the tops of her shoulders.  That kinda helps explain how close I was in"
photocritique,3d0x6d,awhaling,3,Sun Jul 12 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"For the brenzier, I can't quite work out. Do you place your camera place and photograph on a tilt? I.e. keep your camera in the same place but tilt it up/down/sideways. Or do you try and keep the camera the same distance from the subject but move it in the x and y plane, without tilting or moving in the z?"
photocritique,3d0x6d,bestcoastiswestcoast,2,Sun Jul 12 22:56:22 2015 UTC,It's basically a panoramic picture at a low depth of field.  Nothing fancy.
photocritique,3d0x6d,autopornbot,2,Sun Jul 12 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"I get that, but for a panorama I'd keep my camera still and just tilt it. I was asking whether for the Brenizer, tilting gave problems with later stitching?"
photocritique,3d0x6d,Jcwolfe00,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused about what you are asking, but I usually do it with a tri-pod if that helps. I can move it in any direction on a tri-pod. A tri-pod isn't necessary, I just prefer it."
photocritique,3d0x6d,autopornbot,3,Mon Jul 13 01:09:04 2015 UTC,"You've answered my question, essentially. A tripod means the camera itself is physically stationary, and you pan/tilt it to take the photos. I was basically asking if for the Brenizer you physically moved the camera, say in a grid pattern, to get the photos."
photocritique,3d0x6d,Jcwolfe00,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured you were asking something along those lines and that the tri-pod would help.   I'm curious what would happen if you did your other method. Would it look 3 d like our eyes, or would the computer just get confused."
photocritique,3d0x6d,som3a982,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:03:02 2015 UTC,Tilting is fine. Sometimes gives whacky perspective but its way easier than shooting by moving the camera x and y.
photocritique,3d0x6d,nuuue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:45:30 2015 UTC,"Very nice shot of the model, but coming from a background of shooting medium and mostly large format film, the transition from sharp to OOF looks really fake and awkward.

photocritique,3d4bw9,Govanz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"I think the mountain and the textures are too flat. You've got a nice horizon, but I don't think it's composed in the right spot. I think the preference here would have been to put the top of the mountain on the upper third, giving it a larger andm ore commanding feel in the frame.   I'd mess with the contrast here, because it feels a bit lifeless to me. As it stands (with the way the lighting and highlights/shadows are working), the clouds are what draw the eye in first instead of the mountain."

photocritique,3d5p9b,panddda,3,Mon Jul 13 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think every photographer has this picture. So subject wise its not really too original or ground breaking or thought provoking. But technically.....it's in focus and the exposure is nice. You lose some shadow detail in the camera from the image being a bit shadow heavy, but there's a true white point. So there is a range of tones.  Overall it's nice, I guess. It's just cliché. We all gotta start somewhere though. I have this exact picture myself, I would rather just share something more creative.   Just keep shooting. :)"
photocritique,3d5p9b,Trancefuzion,2,Tue Jul 14 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"I know the other commenter said this is cliche but I think you did a good job in doing more with a common theme.  The framing great. The hair and the camera frame your face which forces the viewer to look at the eyes and lips. The glasses themselves frame the eye.The only improvement would be to center the glasses more around the eye. It's a little low.  You have a beautiful model. I know it's shallow but this seriously makes a big difference. Art makes us think and feel. We naturally feel differently when viewing attractive people vs not attractive people. With that said, the hair strands need to be smoothed out. The sharpness of the shot is also showing the skin pores too much for a shot like this. You could either address that with makeup or in post processing.  The lighting is superb. The light also focuses the attention to where it needs to be. There's some shine on the camera that could be done away with but the rest is good.  Overall, it's a really good photo."

photocritique,3d5hsy,rusology,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:33 2015 UTC,I feel it is kinda overkill with the editing. Personally i prefer nature photos to be light and fresh but here it feel dark and gloomy. Flowers on the left is distracting and also the brightest subject in the picture which is drawing my eyes. So i think this pic is kind of the middle ground which is bad. You will need to either go in more with the bee or move further away to include some nice flowers. Hope this helps :)

photocritique,3d5c1w,spokenbean,4,Mon Jul 13 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"I want to start by complimenting you on the color, both from your processing choices and from what you didn't have control over. I especially love the fact they're all in a pure white, the reddish-brown rust against the warm green background works excellently, The slight hint of blue in the sky; the more confident blue of the river... the trim of hot pink around the edge of the shirt– I think it all works together for a really pleasing image.  Compositionally, this photo is all technically wrong, but I think somehow it still works really well. The obvious choice would be to line up the bridge so it's perfectly centered, but you didn't do that. You also have more weight on the right side of the image with the two subjects,  but you didn't put more space on the left side– you weighed it even further toward them. Normally I think the slightly tilted horizon would be a horrible flaw, but somehow it works really excellently with the way the subjects are weighted in the frame– It's like you tilted the picture to the right, so they fell towards the right.   Their posing is weak. Really weak. I understand this is probably a more documentary photo, you didn't tell them to do that, but you didn't take the photo when Pointy was at the peak of her pointing, or when Lefty was at the end of her head tilt, so Lefty's got the wind under her shirt in a off-putting way and the way her arm is hanging makes her seem really... dead.  I think the woman on the right has a really nice pose though. We get just enough of a hint of her face to want to see her but not enough it's an unflattering profile. You've also done a great job framing them so they aren't cut off at the knee– they don't look like paraplegics.   I really like the way Pointy's hair is flowing, but I almost wish it covered her face, since we can't see the other two faces. I'm not sure, maybe it'd detract, but I think it might make the photo a little more mysterious.   I think there's an excellent mood in this picture, and your processing definitely helped. It feels heavy, like something is going to happen, like an old horror movie before the monster's been introduced. While Lefty and Pointy are distracted, the woman on the right looks onward, expectedly, pensively.   I'm a little annoyed with that triangle of green on the right. The trees are like a fog, and it's distracting to see that fog cut off by the river ahead– but I suppose you didn't have much control over that.   Nice work!"

I feel like I should have taken a tighter shot so that the four people were bigger in the frame. And it should have been from the eye level of those people.

If you're looking for them to be the subject, they're currently about the third or fourth thing they eye is naturally drawn to."
photocritique,3d4siq,carbs109,2,Mon Jul 13 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"This is way, way, way oversaturated. Be careful with your processing, often less is more. The greens are nuclear here.

photocritique,3d4siq,oceanswell,2,Mon Jul 13 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you for the feedback! I'll take another crack at it and see how it turns out.  Also, I moved the saturation up only +3 but I think the issue with the greens looking nuclear is that I moved the green primary hue towards yellow in the camera calibration. Going to tone that back a bit because the greens definitely look a bit radioactive haha"
photocritique,3d4siq,My_Name_Is_Maverick,2,Mon Jul 13 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the brightness of the colors as much as the vignette. The vignette draws my eyes to the dead center of the photograph where there's nothing interesting (the reeds at the edge of the water).  I'd remove the vignette entirely and decrease the saturation a tad.   As for composition, I'm not sure if the figure is the subject, or the landscape, or even the drone. If it's the person, the landscape is far too much the focus, if it's the landscape, then the person and drone are a bit distracting.   I personally would crop the top part of the sky so that the figure is more centered, because I see him as the subject.  Great job, I love it!"

What does shooting at F/1.7 add that shooting at F/5.6 or F/8 would lack? I can't see any reason as to why this is shot at F/1.7.

photocritique,3d3bo8,Blaze6181,3,Mon Jul 13 04:41:00 2015 UTC,Very hard to get this picture to an interesting level. Perhaps some smart editing would bring out the picture more especially the 'canyon' part. Also i feel the composition of the 'canyon' is kinda off and far away instead of being the main subject. Well hope my 2 cents helped :)
photocritique,3d3bo8,rusology,2,Mon Jul 13 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input! I cropped the image to give a sense of depth, but I agree with your sentiment. I felt like I didn't do the illusion justice, and cropping the image further would have lowered the resolution too far. Maybe I should give this another go from another angle? Perhaps closer to the 'canyon' with something in the background to give a sense of scale? Thanks again."
photocritique,3d3bo8,rusology,2,Mon Jul 13 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yup try different angles and see if it improves. You could also try some lighting to lift up the photo or include another subject in to sort of support the idea like an insect or a small plant growing out of it. Here is an example of a nicely done texture, yes its not a bark but similar concept i think :)"

photocritique,3d300l,gynoceros,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"I often say that at the end of the day, you're the only one who really has to be happy with your art, but a totally centered subject leaves a lot of dead space around the frame.   There are some times when it works nicely to have a centered subject but it really depends on the other compositional elements, like if the subject is in the middle of a symmetrical scene or if you're really trying to isolate the subject.   A good guideline to use for composition is the rule of thirds. You don't have to follow it to a T if you don't want to, but you'll see for yourself how using it can result in much better compositions. You may see in your viewfinder that the frame is divided into 9 areas by 3 vertical or 3 horizontal lines. It may not be turned on in your camera but it's probably an option. Anyway, those grid lines help you decide where to place things within the frame- eyes, faces, horizon lines, stuff like that. There are YouTube videos dedicated to composition, when you have time, get lost in the sea of great photo tutorials ;-)  Coincidentally, I just had a similar critique of another post here, where the photographer centered his subject in a way I thought could be improved and he swore he used the thirds lines.  Have a look and decide for yourself which one you like better."

photocritique,3d2vae,sciencearthuman,2,Mon Jul 13 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"I think shoopieshoop makes some pretty specific comments, and I agree with them both. Perhaps I can expand on that a bit for you.  The angle is uncomfortable because it is very obvious that the photo was taken at this obscure angle. Also, the line of the desk in the background really interrupts the focus on the lamp, particularly because the photo wasn't take straight on. I could be wrong, but even a bit more of a blur on the background (aka wider aperture) could help, but ultimately the lines will still feel a little wonky.  Considering the lamp itself, let's be honest: a lamp is a lamp is a lamp. I don't feel that you do anything in particular to make this lamp stand out, and I'm even distracted from it due to the angles discussed previously. However, I also think that the colors look pretty flat and uniform throughout the entire photo. I do enjoy the bit of light hitting the top of the lamp, but otherwise I think it just fades into the background."
photocritique,3d2vae,loztiso,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:21:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for the input. That was much more helpful then what Shoopieshoop said. I'll see what more I can do with it.

photocritique,3d22rc,rusology,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:51:18 2015 UTC,Textures are hard to make interesting so normally an additional subject is included like maybe a bug on yr bench or some sort of dramatic lighting like this.

Exposure settings aren't really relevant to my question, but in case anyone is curious, it was 13 seconds at f/8, ISO 50, merged with a separate exposure of the sun at 1s, f/8, ISO50.  So, which version do people prefer? I wasn't 100% confident in the original composition, feeling that given the width of the image, the horizon was a little low, and there was a little too much space between the islands. So, rather than wait another 13 years for the next total solar eclipse that will occur in Australia, I photoshopped the islands into different positions and cropped it down to 3:2.  Any other critique is of course welcome. Thanks!  (And before anyone gets confused and asks whether there was a recent eclipse that they missed, no, it's an old photo from the 2012 eclipse!)"

photocritique,3cwkp0,pgrim91,8,Sat Jul 11 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Davmeister13, it really just looks like blurred water. It's too uniform to be a normal long exposure, and if there were waves like you said, the water is too clear (unless you stuck a CPL on your iPhone...?).  Compositionally speaking, the center point is really busy. You've cut off the top of the pier with the horizon, and it gets completely lost. There's not much contrast, and the horizon is right in the middle of the frame (which really doesn't help things). The lighting is pretty poor for a landscape, though there's nothing you can do about that aside from choosing a different time to shoot.  Overall, I think there's a nice image buried in here somewhere, but there are a lot of things I'd fix."
photocritique,3cwkp0,MajorSuccess,4,Sat Jul 11 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the actual feedback! It's actually a burst of 500 images taken over two minutes or so, then aligned and averaged, so it's pretty close to an actual long exposure. This is pretty much what you'd expect to see if you took a photo of a beach with clear water when it was wavy.  About the rest of the feedback, I agree. Most of it was technical constraints, I had to hold the phone on the pier so it doesn't wobble too much and ruin the exposure, so I couldn't go higher, and there was no other time I could shoot than midday. I think the technique is interesting, though, even if the final image is pretty boring."
photocritique,3cwkp0,jhuynh405,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:49:03 2015 UTC,How'd you align and merge the photos together? Btw that burst idea is genius
photocritique,3cwkp0,jhuynh405,2,Sat Jul 11 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"I used hugin to align and then to merge. The ""mean"" method produces results like a long exposure, but I chose ""median"" here, just because I like the results here a bit better (otherwise the pier was blurry from camera shake).  It took two or three days of my laptop churning away to produce this. I like this method a lot, I'm going to try it on a better subject, with clouds, etc, but it's much better in that you don't need expensive ND filters or any special gear, just any camera and maybe a tripod so you can skip the alignment step. I'm going to try with my camera next time, just take a photo a second or so. Water is easy because the randomness there is uniformly distributed, clouds are a bit messier because you get ""gaps"" if you leave too much time between subsequent shots. Here's a good example of that."

photocritique,3cwkp0,Davmeister13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:44:23 2015 UTC,"It's actually a burst of 500 images taken over two minutes or so   It's interesting that it's come out looking ""different"" to regular long exposures of water, I can only think that because it's discontinuous exposures you lose the effect of waves actually travelling like you do with a real long exposure, so it comes out just looking like a blur, or maybe 2 minutes is just too long?  Have you tried reprocessing with maybe just the first 100 images?"
photocritique,3cwkp0,Radiatron,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't, and I don't have the photos now, but I think it's just because that's what a long exposure of a relatively calm shallow beach looks like at midday. It's certainly what you would expect to see if there were no waves at all, which is pretty common for that beach.  I'm actually writing an iPhone app with a friend right now to allow you to take long exposures like this completely in the phone."

Content-wise, the green hills are nice... but nothing that special. So the main thing you have going for it is the river, but that's interrupted by that hill in the middle. So it would probably be better to get to a better angle where it's either behind you or you've moved up high enough so that it's not in the way of the river."
photocritique,3cz9s5,_lancelee_,2,Sun Jul 12 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. So this seems like one of those things that probably looked pretty great in person, but is hard to take a picture of so it captures what grabbed you at the time.  One thing is that the background is pretty blown out from the sun. That's hard to get around, because if you expose for that, there's a good chance you're not gonna get the darker parts like the moss and stuff in the extreme foreground. And bracketing will be hard here too even with a tripod because the leaves move around a lot in between shots.  What were you trying to bring attention to in this pic? If it was the river, that branch on the left is very distracting. In the future, maybe move yourself or temporarily move it out of the way."

photocritique,3czmhh,velonaut,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:23:04 2015 UTC,"Composition: I would have moved a bit further left, in order to get a slightly more side-on view, such that the moon and runner would be moved further away from the centreline of the image. Also, a wider zoom or lower position is needed to avoid chopping off the runners legs.  Flash: On-camera flash generally looks terrible, so there's the potential to massively improve this kind of photo by using off-camera flash instead, but that requires a lot more equipment. See Strobist if you're interested and not already familiar with it.  Exposure: Exposure is perfect, but with the sky needing a long exposure but the runners being moving objects, you're in a difficult position, and you can see where this has caused the runner's right shoulder to become transparent. Options for improving this would include: Taking a short exposure for the runners, with a black sky, and a separate long exposure for the sky, then merging the two in post-processing; or positioning yourself so that the runner only has another dark (and non-moving) part of the foreground behind them when the flash fires, such as how the hill is behind all of the runner's body except for the shoulder, and you can't see through the runner with that in the background."

photocritique,3cwit5,yopla,2,Sat Jul 11 13:09:07 2015 UTC,I generally agree but with one exception. When trying to sell an image that has a human element in it it can be advantageous not to show the persons face.

photocritique,3ct2ag,ToxicKnight6,5,Fri Jul 10 15:26:05 2015 UTC,i love it but i wish it was brighter .. are those dark areas around are an effect or the photo came out like that ?

photocritique,3ct2ag,koko121,2,Fri Jul 10 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, it's a telephoto lens. High zoom reduces light coming in. On top of that, its a faster f- stop. This makes the picture subject stand out and blurs the background. So even if it was brighter, there is nothing but a smudge of colors from the tree leaves."

Decided to try out some B&W edits and uploaded three to 500px (1, 2, 3) and this one (1) recieved the lowest spread. I'm just eager to find out why. I know with the low amount of followers luck is a factor, but perhaps a more uninteresting composition, a more uninteresting B&W edit or the selective colouring?   I'd also like critique in general, of course. Thanks in advance!   Canon EOS 600D EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 III 20mm 1/20 s f/7.1 ISO 200"
photocritique,3cup5c,Radiatron,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:53:16 2015 UTC,I'm one of the many people who do not particularly like selective color. I'm guessing that is the reason it received the lowest spread.
photocritique,3cuod4,cassonrugen,3,Fri Jul 10 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"Agree that it's a little off-putting that her hair is fading to white. I'd burn it a bit, if you can.   Also, the eyes are a bit softer than her brows, nose, and lips; so you might want to sharpen her irises and eyelids a bit at the base of her lashes.   Lovely shot, otherwise! I don't think ears and shoulders need to be in focus, but you definitely want to focus on the (closest) eye next time. If it were me I'd highlight her right cheek a tiny bit, maybe."
photocritique,3cuod4,GETitOFFmeNOW,3,Sat Jul 11 00:09:54 2015 UTC,Like it a lot. Shoot more.
photocritique,3cuod4,yuckytown,3,Sat Jul 11 02:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's a striking portrait.  Although I agree that the hair looks a little off, but I quite like the effect.  The first thing I noticed when I clicked on the thumbnail was that the focus was on the end of her nose rather than the eyes.  That aside, I like the small DoF."
photocritique,3cuod4,Matt_82,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:03:42 2015 UTC,Too Bright at the top. Higher DoF needed since her ears/ edges of her shoulder blades are way out of focus.  Nice but a few tweaks would make it a lot better.
photocritique,3cuod4,MHerboth,5,Fri Jul 10 22:43:58 2015 UTC,I can agree with you on the first point but would disagree on the second. Deeper DOF will lose the tight effect focus on her eyes he is going for.
photocritique,3cuod4,nav13eh,2,Fri Jul 10 22:56:27 2015 UTC,Why is it desirable to see her ears and shoulders? Just curious. And wouldn't it be a bit boring if the background from bottom to top was all the same brightness? Background gradient can add a lot of emotion.
photocritique,3cuod4,MHerboth,2,Fri Jul 10 22:59:37 2015 UTC,It would however because it is so bright it almost looks like her hair is going grey and I doesn't look pleasing to me imo.   Since she doesn't have a shirt most of the skintones blend into the white space leaving a lot of dead area taking away from the focal point. Its not necessarily about the ears but how your sharpness doesn't encompass the whole face which is your focus point. Also it looks like she is wearing an earing which is pointless with the DOF in the picture. Just my opinion take it however you like.
photocritique,3cuod4,soforth,0,Fri Jul 10 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I think you nailed the depth of field. I somewhat agree about the light at the top. It could be slightly less blown out. Other than that I think this is a very well done portrait."
photocritique,3cv26l,cocogator,2,Sat Jul 11 00:35:24 2015 UTC,"a bit too much empty space in the top half of the photo, and would crop in some from the left too, that whole first pole can go.   also there is some slight aberration where the sun is reflecting off the bird, try correcting for that. and if it hasn't fully clipped, bring the brightness down to get more detail into it. reduce the brightness of the plank too, to make sure the bird is the focal point of the image."

The shadows by the nose  and under the jawline alone ruin the photo.  The framing is super basic and kind of right between two better shots.  The color is vibrant and solid tho and the background looks frea5ky and delicious.  I'm of the opinion that If you are going to take a picture Of a girl And that is the whole picture then you need to make it PERFECT or its just one in a billion pictures of a female. Edit: an auto corrected word  frea5ky= creamy.  the background is creamy and delicious."

Perhaps this photo isn't technically perfect, but I do feel like there is something special about her expression. It's very evocative, almost sensual (maybe that's what made it jump out to OP?), and this is one of the better examples ""wind through the hair"" I've seen.  I also think the shadow by the nose is minimally distracting, if distracting at all, and I actually think the jawline shadow adds to the photo, bringing out a stronger contour from a face that could look too round from the wrong angle.  /u/moreplastic, could you explain what you mean by ""messy overall?"" My one qualm with the pic is the fact that her left arm is almost entirely shadowed.  One more quick note, not about the photo, is that I think using language like ""absolutely nothing special"" is not very encouraging , considering this is a subreddit where people muster up the courage to post a photo they (usually) think is neat and ask total strangers' opinions of. Not that I'm saying that there should be an ""everyone's a winner"" mentality, but that particular quip doesn't really give OP useful info about what he/she could do to improve. In fact, I think it's a little mean-spirited."

Some of the pictures seem to have distorted perspective.   It seems like better weather would have helped in many places.   In several pictures, it seems like the more interesting parts are not in focus. For example, in #5, it's the near part of the road that's in focus and it would have been better if you focused farther out."

If it's not, it would have been better to shoot without it there, but maybe I'm nitpicking.  It might also be better shot from a different angle, so the shadow isn't so diagonal across the picture. And maybe a hill without a path? Basically, I'm just getting at simplifying the whole thing to bring attention to your shadows."

We decided to place the bags there to show that this was a longer trip in the backcountry and not just in our backyard. I thought that this would enrich the picture and take the focus away from us. I placed the shadows close the trail to use it as a leading line away from us and to the horizon so that the nature was in focus and not us. I also thought that it would work as an element to enriched image and make it interesting. As for the angle, I totally agree with you. I did not bring a camera stand, so I had to have the camera hanging on my hip because of the lack of stones to lay the camera on. A lower angle and maybe from the right hand side so that the leading line of the trail would be more obvious would make the picture a lot better I think. The sun was setting and it had been a long trip. We were in a bit of a hurry."

I actually had the stairs in the original shot, but later realized that the whole photo was crooked and the biggest giveaway were the stairs. That's when I cropped them out, because rotating it at this point would have costed too much in image quality/sharpness.   could you share what you did?

Perhaps a shorter focal length would give us more of the cliffs and surrounding context?  Whenever you are trying to focus on the horizon and something close up, you can use a technique called focus stacking to get a greater depth of field. It will require photoshop to accomplish."

photocritique,3cszra,deadliftingturtle,3,Fri Jul 10 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"Just my opinions: I would get the bike out of the shot (if you posed this; if not you're kind of out of luck). It's a little distracting, both because it breaks the symmetry with the other side of the bench, and also pops out because it's bright white against those duller colors.  Similarly, maybe wait for the boat to pass; that streak of red is a little distracting and you can't even enjoy the whole boat.  Otherwise I like it. I like the guy contentedly surveying the whole city."
photocritique,3cszra,duttyRI,2,Fri Jul 10 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"The boat bothered me, as well. The bright red only-most-of-a-boat threw the image off a bit too much.   I like the bike in the shot, though. It adds a pop of color, but it does throw off the overall color scheme."

photocritique,3ctmtd,blooheeler,2,Fri Jul 10 18:00:09 2015 UTC,The framing is what's really killing this image for me. The subject has no room to breathe and you've cut parts of it off at the bottom and right sides of the frame. When you learn about and play with your aperture you should be able to isolate the subject from the background with depth of field.
photocritique,3ctmtd,oceanswell,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:08:47 2015 UTC,Thanks. I definitely wish I hadn't chopped all those photos down so much.
photocritique,3ctlq2,yeezak,5,Fri Jul 10 17:51:43 2015 UTC,You need to fill in the shadows with a reflector. You need more light on the subject overall.
photocritique,3ctlq2,BombDisposalBob,2,Fri Jul 10 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Novice here- are you referring to the big white umbrella panel- things? Because if that's what will brighten the woman's face and let me see her eyes, that is what OP needs.   I want to look at her eyes when I open the image, but with the upper half of her face in a mask of shadow, it's almost uncomfortable with that bright overcast background."

photocritique,3ctlq2,BombDisposalBob,2,Fri Jul 10 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"What does the silver and gold do that's different than white? If I were to get one of these, how would I use it? Do I point it at my subject? My wedding photographer used one, but I have no idea what it does or how to angle it. I take most of my pictures outside in natural light and I struggle with shadows.   Edit: never mind the ""what does it do"" question. I am an idiot. From the link:   Silver increases the specular highlights and yields a high-contrast image. It's perfect for video, product shots and B&W photography.  Gold produces a natural, golden fill that is great for sunsets, jewelry, and indoor portraits.  White produces an even, neutral-colored bounce light that works beautifully as a fill light source for both product shots and indoor/outdoor portraits.  The black side diminishes unwanted reflections or color casts.  Translucent fabric is used to diffuse light, producing a broad light source and a soft, wraparound effect that's perfect for outdoor portraits or whenever a softer light is needed."
photocritique,3ctlq2,blooheeler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"Im with blooheeler, what are the purposes for each color.  I am assuming they reflect the light differently since they absorb it in different intensity. I also mostly use natural light as well"
photocritique,3ctlq2,BombDisposalBob,2,Fri Jul 10 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"Silver reflects a lot of white cooler light, White, reflects white light but is less than the silver side, gold reflects a lot of warm yellow-ish light. The black side acts as a negative fill, and subtracts light. i.e increases the contrast ratio."

photocritique,3coq0o,schultzz88,10,Thu Jul 9 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"This photo is very aesthetically pleasing. My one comment is that the color balance feels a little warm.  Consider cooling it down or reducing the red just a bit? Also the far right side feels slightly overexposed.  Consider playing with the brightness just a tad?  That being said,  The color range is lovely, the color contrast is great.  The variety of textures in the various surfaces is really pleasant.  I really like this photo.  Where is this boardwalk?"
photocritique,3coq0o,PeaceOfMynd,3,Thu Jul 9 15:50:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I did brush in exposure on the white parts of the building but I think you're right that it may need more. With the warmth, I'm hoping to do a whole set of photos from this town and give it that summer feel, so the warmth may make more sense in a set rather than stand alone. By itself, it is on the yellow side.   This is Long Beach, NY. Just moved here and it's a great town right on the Atlantic Ocean. The boardwalk is brand new, having been wiped out in hurricane sandy."

I liked the texture of the boardwalk and grungy windows, but didn't pay much attention to the blue stripes. Luckily they worked out. I like to try and get clean photos but there's always power lines or garbage cans or something in the way.

The only thing I can think of to say (correct me if I'm wrong) is that you're probably trying to get a huge DoF with f/29 but from what I understand it's kind of excessive and you start introducing diffraction effects at that point, so it's really just degrading the image.  Also, maybe it doesn't matter here, but if it's a still anyway, why not lower the ISO and use longer shutter speeds with a tripod?  Great pic!"
photocritique,3cqvg2,rusology,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:39:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! You're completely right. I don't know why I didn't really thinking of going with f/11 or f/16 since I'm stacking images anyway. You're right about the ISO too. I was using a tripod but it was a difficult position so I was using it more like a dualpod hah.  I'll try to improve on my settings to maximize image quality next time.  Thanks for your comment!

As it is right now, its too big of an area of photo to be lacking as much detail as it is.  Also, on the crop, what did you crop more out of, the water or the sky? The water isnt really doing anything for me. If you have it available, I would crop the water and bring back more of the sky.  I also think you could probably push the saturation and colors just a bit on the mountain and sky and maybe increase contrast or clarity on the mountain. Just obviously be careful not to overdo it. I think it would really help this image pop."

To me this is a man that pales in anonymity. He is just a man, and barely one at that.

The written word and photography are two distinct domains though. They don't completely overlap. I would never judge a picture by how well it would work if it were a piece of music, or a dance or a sentence. I do get where you're coming from. You feel that there's no substance/story/dynamic here. That's your opinion, which is fine (and I happen to agree somewhat), but I would hate for someone to take such a rule too seriously. In fact, it's great when photographers do something that clearly 'works' and is very hard to adequately express in any other medium. I've seen stuff like that. In fact, I don't know of a whole lot of truly great photography that isn't like that.   Maybe I'm wrong..."

Photography is a communication tool, so I understand what the original comment was saying, but in saying this I also agree with you. I also agree with you that opinions are opinions as I have had many people say the opposite to the lack of story and say that this photograph provides them with a deep meaningful story- I guess that's down to personal connection and horizon of knowledge of each person. There may be something in this photograph that connects with some people and not others due to experiences in life being so vastly varied. It's interesting what you say last, as I know of many photographers who try and fail to use photography to express things that just cannot be expressed in it! So I agree with you, each medium is very different, but there are thin strands of connections occasionally...not to be mistaken for having a direct connection (: Thanks for the comment!"
photocritique,3cr712,jackbauer616,2,Fri Jul 10 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"The idea to frame a landscape is one that can sometimes work, usually if you have a very specific point of interest you want to frame and bring attention to (search for a recent earthporn shot of half dome in yosemite).  But in this case, theres really nothing there worth framing. You have a sky, and some trees. The composition is telling me you want the sky to be the focus but I dont think its interesting enough to carry the image. And I just am not sure if theres anything in this image that has enough interest to really carry it.  I hope thats not too harsh, but the classic things I look for in a landscape are just missing. And I think the frame in this case actually pulls attention away from the middle of the image.  As far as editing, its not bad, you pulled out some pretty good colors, but be careful of your shadow/highlight recovery. There are some very large, very noticeable halos just above the tree line."

photocritique,3cotfq,johnny5ive,2,Thu Jul 9 16:00:04 2015 UTC,Something about the perspective makes this feel off.  1WTC is so giant compared to the Statue of Liberty and the fireworks.
photocritique,3cotfq,scottread1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but unfortunately you can't change the size of buildings :(  This shot is very interesting because it showcases the enormity of 1WTC, but the light from the fireworks steal focus a bit.   If you're into heavy postprocessing I'd suggest cutting some of the dead space (not all of it) from the center, stitching the two sides together. I might also turn down the colour saturation on the fireworks, just so that 1WTC remains the focal point."
photocritique,3cotfq,loztiso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:35:27 2015 UTC,There too much weight on the left side. It may had been better to fill the frame with more of the fireworks.

photocritique,3cmymj,scotttech1,2,Thu Jul 9 12:48:48 2015 UTC,"i would turn the high lights up. black and whites pop from the contrasting white to black, but that doesn't mean to crank the contrast bar up. you can use your brush in lightroom or dodge and burn in photoshop to enhance selective whites and darken blacks."
photocritique,3cmymj,vgooding,2,Thu Jul 9 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"I would straighten the horizon and cut out some the stuff on the right and top. I think lopping that stuff off will make the repetition of the targets on her left more impactful.   Also, yes to dodging and burning, and you remember what that's about, I bet!   Not crazy about toned monotones; when you don't have almost-black blacks, you miss the chance to pop out the mids.   You have a good eye, I'm sure you're going to like doing more B&W in digital. It's not quite the same rush as seeing a print come up out of the developer, but it's much more convenient."
photocritique,3cmymj,GETitOFFmeNOW,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of your skill level with Photoshop, but if you are a beginner, learn about the channels first. I like to go into each channel separately and tweak each one using curves/levels and other image adjustments. I look at each channel and decide if any of them suck, and if one is ugly, I might use apply image to blend in other channels to make it look better. Sometimes I'll lighten or darken a channel with another channel by varying amounts depending on the image. You can use the sponge tool in the individual channels to pop contrast, I'll also do some dodging and burning. I also like to use the preview mode to look at the rgb image in black and white while editing and before I convert it. Some people like to use the channel mixer or the black and white Lightroom sliders, and there are probably more modern ways to convert than the ways I've been converting since I learned all of this in 2001-2002, and I never really use actions and plug ins."
photocritique,3cmymj,Argle,3,Thu Jul 9 14:22:05 2015 UTC,Absolutely get to know the channels.    I look at it this way I personally have found no less than 5 different ways to convert to black and white in Photoshop.  I have found none that does the job better than going into the channels and using split image to break the image into 3 B&W images.  I then recombine them in the way I want to after adjusting each separate channel for maximum results.  Try something like this. Black and White Discussion
photocritique,3cmymj,gjgroess,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"Completely a beginner to photoshop: I've only ever used it to clone stamp and context-aware fill stuff, I don't really know how any of the rest of photoshop works. I'd like to learn though.  I did all of this in lightroom, fiddling with the exposure and channel sliders and the B+W mix sliders. About the biggest visual change I did was pull the exposure down 1/2 stop and then used a dodge brush on her face, arms, and upper body to get some separation. The original photo has somewhat blown contrast from the glare shooting into the sun and while I wanted some of that to show through, I wanted her to stand out a bit more. I think it kinda worked.  Thanks for the tips! It sounds like photoshop will give me a lot more control over the conversion process. I'll have to see if I can dig up some tutorials on it."
photocritique,3cmymj,Hubblesphere,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"I think it looks great. I'm a fan of adding a little warmth to B&W and I think you have a good % of it here without looking too warm.  As far as advice, did you warm the entire curve here or play with any split toning? You could play with warming the highlights just a bit and leaving the blacks less saturated or vice versa if you'd like and see if you favor that method more."
photocritique,3cmymj,Xtol11trix200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"I can't remember how it did it, but after my first edit on it originally I found that straight black + white felt too cold for a shot into the sun like this, so I figured I'd shift it a bit towards warmer colors and this was the result.  I then played around with the split toning option in lightroom but I don't entirely understand how it works and the only result I could get out of it looked, well, bad."
photocritique,3cqpmq,Bletti,2,Fri Jul 10 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"unless the ripple effect is desireable, try at a slower shutter speed and a higher aperture. also a neutral density filter if you don't have it on. it'll make your sky more vibrant."
photocritique,3cqpmq,cassonrugen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:29 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think you're right that if I had my camera on a tripod and slowed down the exposure it would be better.

photocritique,3cnjtz,dororai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:08:01 2015 UTC,"There doesn't seem to be a subject. It's pretty busy too. Not to be mean, but it's a bad picture overall. It looks like you just whipped out your phone and took a picture from where you were standing without much thought at all.  I would recommend trying to focus one thing. My eye is rather lost and doesn't know where to look. Looking at your other pictures on your flickr, I see you are taking much better pictures. So I have to ask, why did you ask for a critique of this photo? This is one that I would've deleted on camera, especially with how good your other pictures are.   You have the skills to take good pictures which makes it really hard to critique this photo.   If you wanted to make this better, I would take it squatting so the car lights are in the middle of the frame. I would also go for a much smaller aperture, since you have no main subject. This will allow more of the picture to be in focus."

photocritique,3cl1tg,soforth,2,Thu Jul 9 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"Since you already have this one you might want to experiment with blending it into another, less edited version. Sometimes the two together can be better than any one edit alone."

photocritique,3cksvx,Golden_s_hour,2,Wed Jul 8 18:08:06 2015 UTC,thanks for the reply.  I actually like the airglow. are you referring to the green above the horizon or higher in the sky? are you looking at the trails near the edge of the frame? i took a faster shutter than i could have. i think i could do 35secs but i only did 30. the trails near the edge look like barrel distortion as commented in the previous post. i might try again and lower it to 25secs just to be sure. Thanks again for the comments.
photocritique,3cksvx,htmwrx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:41:20 2015 UTC,i see what you are saying. i will try and get rid of the green portion. never tried to do that before.  next time i go out this next weekend i wanted to try stacking. maybe it will give me a cleaner image just without trails. also i need to try a lower shutter and maybe bump the iso to compensate.  thanks for the reply

photocritique,3cksvx,htmwrx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:06:16 2015 UTC,That was the most math intensive thing i have done in a long time!!!!  alright so if 3.1 seconds is my max time then i could possibly take multiple exposures at 3s and stack them then overlay the foreground on top to get a clean foreground over a crisp milkyway. does that sound about right?
photocritique,3cksvx,htmwrx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"Really...I've taken static shots on a tripod that are 20 seconds long that I can live with.  But I also mostly use the iOptron SkyTracker and composite.  Longer exposures at lower ISO.  Then, add the foreground back in in post.  It also has a setting for 1/2 speed that will double your exposure time, but blurs the foreground a tad.  Theoretically, you could use a rear curtain flash to illuminate/freeze the foreground, if you really wanted to.    Also, the apparent motion of the sky towards the north is exponentially slower than towards the east or west...and to a lesser degree, the south.  They may make a 360* circle in the same amount of time as the others....but that circle is also smaller.    TL;DR if you can live with a couple of pixels of trailing....cool.  No one will probably notice anyway."
photocritique,3cksvx,mybendphotography,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:25:28 2015 UTC,Well maybe not that math intensive! It hasn't been that long! Yeah i like the idea of adding it back in in post.

photocritique,3cksvx,arcticpoppy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:43:29 2015 UTC,"I totally get that.  Buying gear for niche shots isn't worth it.  But I do a fair amount of Astrophotography.  Sadly...I sometimes wish the $300 for the skytracker was all that I'd spent.  As with any hobby, it gets expensive quick.  But, for ease of use and portability, it cant be beat for doing widefield AP.  After setting it up properly, you can get 5 minute exposures without any trailing.  I wouldn't use it at focal lengths longer than 300mm, though."

photocritique,3cktmj,yourmomsvevo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:50 2015 UTC,It was on manual. And you're completely right I had no idea how to improve focus in low light conditions because the photo already looked grainy to begin with
photocritique,3cktmj,asilenth,3,Wed Jul 8 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Her left foot being cut off bothers me immensely and as another poster said, the focus being so far off kills it."
photocritique,3cktmj,rylos,2,Wed Jul 8 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe crop at the top to remove her foot. I love the way the fabric flows in waves, and the overall creaminess of the image, and how the light works with the dress. If the face were sharper, it might distract from that. The high contrast of the face complements the way the light works with the dress.  Make it all about the form & flow of the light.     If you can't finally get something adequate from this image, you will still have it in the back of your mind during the next shoot, influencing you. I often get shots that almost, but didn't quite make the cut. They inspire me the next time around, and often I eventually get ones better than the earlier ones could ever have been, had they come out ""proper"".  Practice, lots of practice, is key.  If I had taken this image, I would certainly be playing with cropping, levels, and even trying it in different hues before giving up on it. The art isn't about making something perfectly sharp, or perfectly exposed, it's about making an image that brings out a feeling.  I took a lot of photos at a musical event where there was a laser light show involved. I got a lot of good images, and the focus and exposure were pretty good in most of them. Pretty low noise, as well. I didn't manage to catch the feel of it like I wanted, though. Later I saw a photo taken by a gal with much less experience than me, with a camera thousands of dollars cheaper, with a much more ordinary lens. The image didn't have as good dynamic range as mine, and was certainly noisier. But it captured the moment in the way that mine hadn't, by getting the right timing & composition. It was a wonderful image, as it conveyed a feeling. I had already been giving sincere encouragement to that photographer, as she did exhibit some talent & enjoyed taking photos, I made a point to tell her how I felt about that photo, and why I thought it was better then mine."

The way that the flow of the fabric is cut off by the edge of the stage is kind of awkward.   The soft focus doesn't bother me as much as how harsh the light is on the dancer's face. With everything else being so soft, that harsh shadow feels out of place."
photocritique,3ck30j,MrRicardo,4,Wed Jul 8 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"Any reason for the wide aperture? For shots with a large focal range, it's qusually better to shoot f5.6+ it'll help keep everything in fore and background sharp.   Not saying your photo isn't sharp, it's just a rule of thumb."
photocritique,3ck30j,OM3N1R,2,Wed Jul 8 15:11:35 2015 UTC,Thank you! I completely agree. I was actually surprised when I looked at the metadata because I was almost certain that I had a wider aperture. It definitely would have been better if the whole image was sharper.

Another thing I notice is the purple fringing on the edge of the front girders . This is chromatic aberration, and is a optical side effect of many lenses.

Have you tried taking photos from the walking park down by the water on the left side of the bridge. There are some good photo opportunities there.   This is one I took in that area during an overcast day. With black and white, you get a unique, textured contrast in the rust. The main critique I got with this was that I lacked a subject matter which I now agree. I think the same applies here with your picture. A subject would give this picture more meaning.  I agree with /u/OM3N1R in terms of narrowing your f/stop to retain sharpness in foreground and background. It's also a tad over exposed, and that should help as well. f/2.2 seems a little too much for daylight especially when you have so much depth in the bridge, and no clear subject. I also think it's a tad over saturated for my taste, but it's not a bad photo. This bridge in particular has so many cool areas where you can play with orthogonal lines, repetition, shadows, and texture. I would say go back and take as many as you can, and also play around with black and white. Cheers!"

Talk about an interesting subject. I couldn't see your link - your album isn't public? But I would love to see what you've done there!   I think that part of my problem with the F stop on this photo was that I had just gotten a new Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S Lens, and I was so excited about the wide aperture that I just couldn't stay away from it.

It's a fine line you have to walk when dealing with depth of field.   And if you like saturation, then try photographing bold colors like reds, greens and blues. The sky's color is kind of lost because you're over exposed. If you keep the sky a tad under exposed, you might have been able to get that sweet orange/blue complimentary color combo with the rust color of the bridge.   All in all, just keep playing and you'll find what works best for you!"

I think it could have been improved by making the bridge more of a focal point.   I also really dislike that Westin logo. I feel like it draws the eye away from the rest of the photo.   Otherwise, great image!"

Thanks for your critique though!"
photocritique,3ckzkr,willowalo,6,Wed Jul 8 18:53:08 2015 UTC,Your subject needs to be on a significantly different focal plane than everything else for Brenizer to work well.
photocritique,3ckzkr,DeusExMachinist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"It's definitely different from what you normally see on here, but I like it. Strange composition, strange contrast, interesting aspect ratio. I'd keep working at this style, see if you can come up with something a little more compelling. I think the exposure of the model is a little too low. As well, I would rather see the subject a little further down, and have empty space above her, rather than below. Keep trying, I'd like to see this concept taken forward."
photocritique,3ckzkr,GeneticCowboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:31 2015 UTC,Full size my eye continues to be drawn to the stick that is camera left of her head.   I feel like she gets lost in the higher contrast background a bit.
photocritique,3ckzkr,fstahp,0,Thu Jul 9 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"I have found that my most interesting resultat has been when I have had the subject offset from the centre and active in some way.  Also what /u/DuesExMachinist say about the focal plane is true, and can be enhanced if you have an object or feature going into and the out of the other side of the focal plane."
photocritique,3ck8s3,wackattackyo,12,Wed Jul 8 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"It feels kinda cramped with her legs cropped where they are, with just the back of her calf showing. Try it with all of her in the frame or crop above the knee and see how it works."
photocritique,3ck8s3,ExcitedBurritos,2,Wed Jul 8 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. Get more of her thigh and leg in there. If you crop a body part off, don't crop at the joints like the knee, which you are doing in this photo. You can either crop a significant amount above or below the knee (or other joints)."
photocritique,3ck8s3,geekygeekz,5,Thu Jul 9 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I see is that you chopped off her legs. It just seems like a really weird part of the leg to crop out, especially in the position she's in. Also, I would crop out the box behind her, I like the contrast of the weathered concreted and the girl, but the smooth box takes the texture contrast away. I don't understand the empty coke bottle, but now I'm just being picky.   I like the light. The girl is in a nice pose, and wearing a good outfit. I get the emotion you were going for. Over all it's a nice photo, I just had a few small things that I think would really elevate it from a clothing advertisement to a portrait photograph."

photocritique,3ck8s3,picc1233,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"GREAT SHOT, so I will be picky:   Legs should be uncrossed or we should see more of them.  The cut off elevated leg (her right) is odd dislike the different metal thing along the right side of the frame, slight shift in approach would improve. I find the empty Coke bottle distracting.  Gone or half full with a straw in it would be cool."

I know that a CPF can cause banding in photos, but that is normally with the color gradients in a sunset or something else of that nature. I was thinking that maybe it caused banding in all the changing colors, which caused this to come out the way it did."
photocritique,3cj1x4,richierich27,14,Wed Jul 8 08:15:03 2015 UTC,"It feels to me that this shot can't decide what the subject is, the elements in the pic don't form much of a pattern and it's like they were thrown together. I'm assuming that you were capturing the scene rather than focusing on one subject.   I would have positioned myself further to the left so that the lane divider was more diagonal in the shot and thus eliminating the far end of the road: focus on the towers in the background, might be able to keep the fire hydrant and shoes in and you still get the same look.   There are other processing issues to be looked at IMO but that's what r/postprocessing is for (give us a RAW)"

photocritique,3cj1x4,PeaceOfMynd,2,Wed Jul 8 08:48:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with the above. Further, try reducing the Green a little. You want to in essence bring out the browns and reds to add that grit feel.   It feels too lush."

Add something to that- with dirt/mud- or post shoot.    Get crazy- go to a car demo lot- take a few shots of beaters on the lot.  maybe add into the composition.

photocritique,3cj1x4,artbyhatch,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"This! Perhaps make the blacks darker. Also, it feels like it is not level because of the street on the top of the hill and the speed limit sign slanting just a little to the left.

photocritique,3cm0cn,Darth_Tanion,2,Wed Jul 8 23:18:27 2015 UTC,Be mindful of your composition - the flowerpot is cut off at the bottom of the frame which should be avoided. There's a lot of shadow at the top of the image which leaves me questioning why it's there. I think this photo needs more context. Try to think about why you're taking the shot.
photocritique,3cm0cn,oceanswell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"I love the color and the rich texture in the wall, but it feels chopped up a bit- like I'm missing something on the outside edges, even if it's just more black space. I think it would help me settle more on the subject."
photocritique,3cjhhv,ThomasSoerensen,2,Wed Jul 8 11:48:50 2015 UTC,I think I like it. Certainly a different composition than usual. Lots of black space in the bottom left. At first I thought it should be cropped but then you'd miss the reflection. ...so im not sure...

photocritique,3cgg8c,ExcitedBurritos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"Nice. The image is so clear but the horizontal motion is blurred, and the only way I know how to do it is with IS engaged in vertical-only mode!"
photocritique,3cgg8c,ExcitedBurritos,2,Tue Jul 7 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yea mode two to eliminate vertical motion is what I'd usually select but I've found turning it off so it doesn't interfere works just as well tbh, the monopod eliminates a lot of user shake and if there's any track gradient it will also require a slight diagonal motion of the pan, that can be enough to make the IS judder"

photocritique,3cmhgx,WindowShoppingMyLife,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  The focus is missed, the whole photo is soft, black and white isn't effective, but the biggest problem with this photo is still the expression of your subject. You caught this lion at a really awkward and frankly unappealing moment, which unfortunately in my opinion makes this shot a throwaway. Also, in most types of photography and more significantly, animal photography, the focus needs to be tack sharp. That's something you need to get right in-camera, no amount of post processing will ever fix that."
photocritique,3cmhgx,oceanswell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"Really? I love the expression. I got a few others but I thought the tongue was the coolest part.   As for the tack sharp, I'm not 100% sure whether this was me or the lens. It doesn't auto focus on my camera, so it's possible that I didn't get the manual focus right. Other commenters have suggested that it might be the old lens, but I have seen conflicting sources on this. It was shot with a borrowed nikkor AF 70-210 f4-5.6, on my d3100, with a tripod. The lens is almost 30 years old, but I've heard conflicting things on whether that could affect clarity. I'm still trying to figure out what is me and what, if anything, is the lens.   Why do you say that the black and white doesn't work? I thought it covered up some of the color issues, and worked better aesthetically with the unfortunate ""soft"" look of the photo. Am I wrong, or is it a preference issue?  http://imgur.com/qvwaWPA This is another shot taken at the same time, but no tongue. Thoughts?   I really appreciate your comments, perhaps especially because your take on things seems to be so contrary to what I was thinking. I'm still having a hard time even just finding the right terms to describe what I'm seeing, let along figure out why or how to fix it next time."

See how in the top 2/3 the edge is darker (to contrast with the lighter background) and then when the background goes dark in the bottom 1/3 it gets light (again to increase contrast)?  I guess that could be natural, but it looks a lot like the algorithms that find edges and selectively change tones locally to increase contrast to accentuate the edge."

photocritique,3ci4i0,nuodaispalis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"OK here they are side by side.  See how in the original image as you move across the image right to left it stays pretty much the same tone (dark vs light)?    In the edited version, it gets darker as you approach the edge. This happens because one of the functions that you used to edit the image finds that edge and darkens the dark bits near the edge and lightens the light bits near the edge to make the edge more obvious.  In most of the image that looks fine, but when there's a big block of color it's obvious."
photocritique,3cjx1s,AnalogRocks,3,Wed Jul 8 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"I prefer the black and white one, personally. The background is very vivid and draws away from them. In the color, they seem washed out, but in B&W it seems more natural.  The background is still quite distracting in the B&W, and I'd try to lighten it a bit, but I think it's better than the color.  Beautiful picture though, overall!"
photocritique,3cjx1s,My_Name_Is_Maverick,2,Wed Jul 8 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that the black and white is less distracting. I think if you used a bit more control in the light post-production (say a black or white brush on 1% flow over areas you want darker and lighter) to direct the eye more the the couple it could really make the image pop. The tones in their skin are the same as the sky and it flattens the whole image. I do think some additional contrast is needed for the WOW factor, stunning location and moment captured regardless!"
photocritique,3cjx1s,crossleyphotography,2,Fri Jul 10 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"Great picture! It seems a little dark in both of them, and could use a touch more contrast.  Do you have one of them kissing? A B&W of that would be killer."

But overall the shot looks nice, has nice details, color, and framing. For some reason I want to see the camera move back a couple feet and reveal a bearded fisherman or something."
photocritique,3ci5z4,dpiersonphotog,2,Wed Jul 8 03:41:41 2015 UTC,Yea that would be very cool if that were the case.
photocritique,3ci5z4,ExcitedBurritos,2,Wed Jul 8 05:24:25 2015 UTC,I like it. It made me stop for a second and gaze at the details.  Do you do much Photoshop? You can get get rid of that grain by blend in a a copy of the image with an applied Gaussian blur.  Just be careful not to blend too close to any of the edges you want to keep sharp.
photocritique,3ckhcq,Cslush,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"The line of the ledge at the bottom is distracting, and the angle on the subject makes the focus unclear. The highly saturated blue of the sign above makes it look like this is just an ad for American Insurance Group.   Next time try to narrow down more on what your focus is, and look for the best perspective to highlight that focus."
photocritique,3ckhcq,mister_sleepy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:35:34 2015 UTC,So is this any better? IMO I dont really like it because the sign was cut off / I think its a bit distracting.

photocritique,3cibfv,trapya,2,Wed Jul 8 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of fireworks photos tend to look a little cliche to me, but this sticks out to me. I think its the colors playing with each other, and the detail in the scene.  I would experiment with the order of the photos. The composition feels a little heavy to the left due to the larger firework. Although I like that currently the middle one has the stream from where the firework launched."

photocritique,3clo24,lamar5559,0,Wed Jul 8 23:58:17 2015 UTC,not necessarily if you have advanced knowledge of your menus you could tweak them enough to get it pretty close to this. just in the presets sautration etc. mix that with a custom white balance.

photocritique,3cfrzl,lycosa13,3,Tue Jul 7 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"Love it, but I wish that it was straight. It's most noticeable along the windows at the top. I don't really like that I can see your reflection in the window. It's also quite grainy and soft, but I kind of like it that way."
photocritique,3cfrzl,purebishop,3,Tue Jul 7 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"I had to choose between either the windows at the top being straight or the road itself; chose the latter because it felt like the horizon of the shot. The building's just been built at a very slight angle, maybe I'll go into Photoshop and warp it into place."
photocritique,3cfrzl,quintinza,3,Tue Jul 7 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"Don't. Having everything is probably technically correct, but this picture works as a nostalgia type snapshot of reality.  Do you have a large enough crop to level the road and leave the building at an angle? In my minds eye that would be even more effective, giving the viewer the ""I was there"" feeling that would make this perfect.  I love this shot."
photocritique,3cfrzl,gynoceros,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:17:12 2015 UTC,Thanks!   I meant I chose the pavement/sidewalk part of the road as my horizon and straightened off that. Felt like that was the most important thing to have level.
photocritique,3cfrzl,Smithers66,2,Tue Jul 7 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Fuji X100S - f/16 - 1/8s - ISO 200. Probably had the internal ND on as well but I can’t remember for sure.   I’d just ditched my big bulky DSLR system that’d completely taken the fun out of photography for me and was out and about in central London with my new X100S. Because it was so light I was trying out hand holding it and playing with motion blur, I saw this black cab driving down the street, lined my shot up and hit the shutter once it entered the frame.   Purely by chance a lot of things line up with one another; guy on the far right’s in line with that window column; my reflection in the window next to him’s in line with another, the two guys walking in opposite directions are perfectly either side of the break in the windows. If the guy standing still looking at his phone’d been one foot over to his right things would’ve been perfect.   So I just like how the cab came out looking and then by chance how everything else happened to come together around it. Obviously things could’ve been sharper but I didn’t have a tripod on me. I've taken technically better photos but this one's my favourite so I'm curious anyone else sees anything in it."

photocritique,3cgfh3,peri123,12,Tue Jul 7 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"There are a few issues with this photo.  Firstly, your composition isn't straight. Photos like this work better if the leading lines (your road there) lead towards the subject but in a pleasantly aesthetic way, usually either winding from the foreground or exactly straight and dissecting the image. It's uncomfortable to view because the road is instead skewed off from centre and appears careless. Luckily, this can be easily fixed without reshooting using photo editing software.  The second issue is that your subject is ill defined and just generally uninteresting. You can't make out enough of the truck for it to hold any attention and the eye veers off towards the (also boring) tree on the right. A bit of patience and waiting to find something unique to photograph will improve your photography no end.  Thirdly, the mountains are hazy and detract from the overall quality of the photo. A CPL filter would have cut straight through this - they are relatively inexpensive and are a must for landscape photography. If you did have a CPL on the camera, you didn't use it well.  Fourth and final issue, this looks like it was taken at midday and so the lighting is very harsh. Again, patience would have went a long way - in this case, waiting for the right light around sunset or getting up earlier for sunrise. If you claim this wouldn't have been possible because you were travelling or couldn't manage it as you took this quickly while passing through etc. then that leads on to the biggest thing you'll learn towards capturing great images: you have to go out and earn them. If you can't make the time to be patient and capture high impact pictures, you won't capture high impact pictures, easy as that.  Hope that helped!"

photocritique,3cfb47,PhotoWhite,0,Tue Jul 7 13:46:05 2015 UTC,"Good capture, but what's the subject you want us to notice? The sun? The road? Trees? You might try masking some exposure to highlight where you'd like to lead the viewer."
photocritique,3cfb47,dpiersonphotog,2,Tue Jul 7 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"This is a very good point. The trouble with landscape shots is that you need to have something that draws the eye. With no subject, the observer wanders and ultimately feels lost.   For what it is though, the shot is well taken and the flares are really nice."
photocritique,3cfb47,TheSobadef,2,Tue Jul 7 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, agreed, what is the subject? The path leads to nothing. You used a wide angle lens, I'd do some geometry work to get the horizon level as well. And the big red lens flare in the bottom right is distracting. Cool shot, though."

photocritique,3ch2fc,KrystanGrace,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's great, personally, but the background isn't doing it for me. That bumpy wallpaper is an element which imo clearly doesn't belong in this picture. First of all, it's ugly. Secondly, the image for the most part is quite special and the wallpaper drags it back down to the mundane in a way that's not interesting. Thirdly, the background looks like it's quite close to the subject. This last thing is an issue because it seems unnatural. A man isn't ever going to look sideways into darkness, while his body's close to a wall. There's no story there for me.  The good thing, if I'm right, is that, with a little bit of work in photoshop, the only major flaw can be removed."
photocritique,3cho08,JaggerNotchas,2,Wed Jul 8 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"Also the chin shadow is very dark. Does not fit with the diffused outdoor lighting. Other than that, very smooth."
photocritique,3cho08,Yonityyy,2,Sat Jul 11 11:15:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty good. Without knowing, I don't think I could say for sure that it was photoshopped. If you could blend/blur the edge around the guy it may help, as the edge is really sharp."
photocritique,3chg2a,Davecoupe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"Not a bad shot, car is nice and sharp.  Possibly only comment is that maybe a slowet shutter speed would have blured the background a bit more for a better sense of speed, though if its a corner they may not have been going that fast anyway. The colours are a bit saturated to me, especially the greens."
photocritique,3cikh4,rossocorsa,2,Wed Jul 8 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"It seems your lens is struggling a bit with focus. I see you have zoomed in all the way here at 85mm, but I find that it seems a bit soft everywhere. I don't know that camera or lens so it's hard to say - but in this situation I might have upped the aperture to try and get more of the scene in focus. Sometimes telephoto lenses at their longest focal length suck with sharpness, particularly on the lower end budget wise. In the previous photo, at 1/125 and f 29 - you've narrowed the dof and reduced the shutterspeed too far and you can see how the settings aren't working either and the scene isn't in focus at all. The ISO settings are also much too high for these situations, you shouldn't be at 500 or 900 in broad daylight.  For me, the scene is a little overexposed and the colors are quite pedestrian. I would have preferred a little more context (zoomed out a little more) to give the red and white tower more breathing room and to see a bit more sky. Shooting in the bright, mid day sun is also typically going to give you boring and highly shadowed shots with unappealing colors. Try waiting for more interesting skies and light. I think you'd benefit from reading up a few basic tutorials on photography basics including aperture, shutterspeed and ISO, the exposure triangle, google 'the golden hour' and keep shooting.   And lastly - the watermark. Nobody uses watermarks these days, except for amateurs (and some pros with branding). I'm not trying to be a jerk, You say yourself you're just starting out - there really is no need to attribute 'credit' or to worry about theft or any other reason for a watermark. If you drop the watermark (which you likely will anyway) you'll lose the harsh judgement from other photographers based on it. I'm just saying - as a professional photographer when I see a watermark like that I immediately know the photograph was made by someone with very little experience and not much understanding for aesthetics."
photocritique,3cikh4,oceanswell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, this is extremely helpful! This was literally my first jaunt out with my fancy new camera, and I don't really have a grasp yet on working with aperture, etc. I think I put it on aperture priority and moved the f-stop to the highest one it would let me use. Maybe the 24-85 mm lens I have isn't great for these types of wide landscape shots? I definitely realized on this trip that going forward I pretty much only want to take pictures during golden hour, because the lighting was so bland, haha. And I'm relieved to hear that about watermarks, because they look crappy to me too and also reveal my name. Thank you again for your input!"
photocritique,3cihrg,Hypocritical_Taco,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:14:55 2015 UTC,"curious as to why you chose to shoot at that high of ISO.  looks like you're outside in good light.  at 24mm, you could have easily shot at something like 1/80th of a second with 400ISO for the same exposure and no risk of camera shake.  It would have provided the same picture but potentially less noise.  Technically, your focus was spot on and exposure is good.  The framing is pretty good given the subject.  However, as for the picture itself....unfortunately it's just not that interesting.  It's a leaf...and there's nothing special about that leaf in any way.  If I was flipping through a bunch of pictures, I honestly wouldn't find myself stopping to look at this for more than a second.  In the end, it illicits no mood.  It doesn't make anyone say ""wow"" or ""cool""."
photocritique,3cihrg,majortato,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback! Yeah, it was just an in the moment decision to shoot outside. You have a good point with the shutter speed. Most times, I find myself using this lens to photograph for  school events and such. This is how I've learned photography, and I guess it was a natural to set my shutter speed and ISO high, since I am normally capturing moving people. I'll definitely pay attention next time though. Kind of a common sense thing.  I agree, the picture itself was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I just went outside and took some up close photos. It was part of an album of photos I uploaded to Imgur, which you can see here.  I tried to take some wider shots, but they weren't working to my favor, so I settled on up close shots"

And then frame your photo to show what you liked about it. If you want to show the scale of the radar, frame in a way that shows that (closer/ low angle/ maybe wider lens). If you like the rusty fence, shoot through that.  Currently there is a lot in the frame, and a lot of it isn't important (tree to the left, buildings, etc)."

When the person is the main subject, but only the backside is shown, it detracts the personality of it and the stories that could be added to your photos.

I also was very close to this to take it I used a 50mm prime lens and since I was so close even with a higher fstop the depth was a bit off so thats why the rock is out of focus a bit, I dont think it was camera blur."

photocritique,3cff67,Onlylikesblades,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"For waterfalls, you want 3 things, maybe more but 3 basic filters. Polarizer, a .3 or .6 ND Grad filter, and .3 or .6 ND filter. Grad filters are graduated, meaning they go from darker sunglasses looking and grade to clear. ND filters look like dark sunglasses all the way through. A kit is expensive but here is an example of a basic kit in square filters: https://www.formatt-hitech.com/en/products/Landscape---Colby-Brown~148.html. You can get screw on types as well but I like the square ones. You can buy the holder and the screw on adapters for one or two of you favorite lenses. Then start with the three I mention above. It can get spendy. There are less expensive starter kits with plastic holders, which work just fine. Can't remember the name right now. Basically, this allows you to stop down the water movement and get that movement without compromising the overall exposure. Look into it.   As for what DOF, check out the DOF calculator below. It depends on your lens, I think you said a 50mm, and camera. This kind of tool can be found as an app for your phone as well. This will tell you how much will be inside the DOF and in focus based on your aperture. Note that several feet in front of you is where the sharpness will start, so everything between you and that point will be blurry, then it extends outward until it gets blurry again.  http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html  A 50mm lens f/16 on a Nikon 7000, subject 20 feet away would result in a near limit of the DOF at 11.3 feet and far limit at 88.5 feet. Everything between the two should be in focus.   Hope this helps. Yell if something doesn't make sense, happy to help."
photocritique,3chvmm,Exyide,2,Wed Jul 8 01:03:38 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the reds are way oversaturated"
photocritique,3chvmm,Onlylikesblades,2,Wed Jul 8 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"I was going to say that this looks close to perfect. But, I agree with the comment above - the reds seem oversaturated to the point of losing detail in the chest feathers.  For similar images in the future, I would consider leaving a little more space around the bird (I think that the crop is a little too close to the birds head), and perhaps putting the bird on the left hand side of the frame to give it some space to 'look into' (assuming the subject is also looking to the right).  Otherwise, a great photo - vibrant and colourful, with exquisite focus and detail around the head and eye area!"
photocritique,3chvmm,t4taylor,2,Wed Jul 8 07:41:07 2015 UTC,Definitely. The subject needs more room to breathe - the crop is too tight. He should also be placed on the left hand side. Generally you don't want to cut the gaze of your subject out of the frame.

The railing you have it on doesn't do much. Find a way to place the bottle and get the shot but maybe crop out what it's sitting on. Maybe put it in a mound of sand on some plywood and then get lower to shoot the shot. Make it look like it's sitting on the beach. Second, I'd blend two exposures. First shot will be as you have here, with the longer exposure for the bottle rocket. Second exposure for the night sky. Would be really cool if you could actually get the Milky Way. Either way, expose the second shot for the sky and get all those twinkling stars and well defined moon (try for a full moon and even better, a harvest moon that is bigger). Then blend the two in photoshop. It would be like a rocket taking off to the stars."

I think you could crop the top of the photo down a bit to position the face better.  Other thing - 25mm is a pretty wide angle lens, and I personally wouldn't use it for portraits. It exaggerates someone's nose and front features, while diminishing features like ears, etc. A decent range for a portrait lens is 85–105mm (see Ken Rockwell's post on portrait lenses, and keep in mind he is opinionated)"

I wonder if it was possible to get this shot the other way around...the sunset being in the window and the cooler side being part of the reflection.  My eyes are drawn to the beautiful colors, but the reflections in the glass are distracting.    I think a crop to remove the bottom of window would be good too.  As it stands now, it's blurry and distracting.  With it gone, it also creates a bit of confusion at what's going on when looking at the picture, forcing the viewer to look at it and think a bit longer.  Finally, this is really all about the contrast between left side and right side.  One of few times where I think breaking the rule of thirds might be better here, centering the transition line."

photocritique,3cfrfp,TheWeyers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"The picture definitely doesn't need that guy on the left. The lighting is most extreme on him, so cropping is the way to go, I think. An added benefit is that it moves the figure in focus away from the center of the picture, which creates a little more tension.  Also, the contrast on your picture is good, but you could take it a bit further. Optimizing the contrast for the figure in focus (teacher, I guess) is going to help make it stand out more."

photocritique,3ceyre,AnalogRocks,2,Tue Jul 7 11:41:30 2015 UTC,"Well, these are a few things I notice   I'm not sure what your subject is. I think it's the flowers because they're more in focus and in the foreground, but don't make us guess. Fill the frame more. The bridge appears just as large here, albeit less in focus. Watch where your horizon line is. It dissects the flowers and is distracting when the white of the flowers blends into the white of the sky. You didn't need as much wood fence in the frame to let us know what the flowers are sitting on. There's a point where including more will hurt the composition.    What I like is you balanced the composition with the bridge and the flowers. I think they're placed well. I would have got closer though, held the camera higher to position the flowers against the dark green background and also put less sky in my composition."
photocritique,3ceyre,sub-merge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:08:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the critique! This is definitely helpful. I've been thinking about cropping out more of the sky to help with how much sky there is in the shot. The rest of it though seems like I'll just have to apply to future shots!

photocritique,3carfz,TheWeyers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:14:09 2015 UTC,"Not sure what kind of feedback you're looking for. I certainly don't know of a way to improve the specific shot you ended up taking, so everything that follows should be read as notes that might be helpful for future endeavors.   First of all, I don't dislike the image.  I'm going to assume that you were going for minimalism. Do the colors of the building mirror those of the red, white and blue to you? I'm color blind so that's sort of lost on someone like me. Regardless, I think simplicity is really hard to pull off. The fewer the interesting elements in a picture, the more crucial balance becomes. For instance, for me, the flag seems like it's either too small or too large to be read as a statement. I can see it. It's definitely there, but it doesn't look like the rest of the image was created around it in order to accommodate it. I don't think any experienced painter would use these proportions when painting from their imagination. Another thing to note is that it's actually a quite busy image for a minimalist picture (lots and lots of attention grabbing lines and blocks...). In my opinion this is another example of imbalance; there's just too much of what is essentially noise. I probably wouldn't mind this as much if the building and it's details were less ugly/drab. You gotto admit, it's a real eyesore :) I don't know, maybe there's some symbolism in that for you, but I don't think anyone would see that."

This picture is busy without any variation, so it looks kinda monotonous and dull. I don't know what the desired effect is, and I actually love the picture. If I was to make it better though, I would focus on the balcony with the flag, perhaps crop out everything but a few balconies in each direction, and position the flag in a position of prominence, like one of the upper corners in the Rule of Thirds Grid."

photocritique,3cej3j,billyfraser,2,Tue Jul 7 08:02:05 2015 UTC,"You wrote your problem in your title. F1.8 has an extremely shallow depth of field, and your focus is at infinity, which leaves everything blurry.   If you're going to shoot a landscape shot such as this, you're going to need at least f4, but ideally f5.6-8. This will allow you to focus much more easily on your subject, as the depth of field is far deeper. You should also look into reviews of your lens to find out which aperture offers the sharper image. For my 1.8, it's 5.6  You don't need a shutter speed as high as 1/1250, and dropping it down as low as 1/125 would allow you to get a lot more light in, as long as the horse isn't running."
photocritique,3cdhtc,Niskyspy,2,Tue Jul 7 01:43:10 2015 UTC,"looks a bit over processed to me.  The trees on the right are suppose to be in the shade, yet they are lit up.  There's a glow around them, which tells me you sloppily used a brush to increase the exposure in that area.  There's really no need for that because there's nothing interesting in the trees right there.  They would be better off being dark...why draw my focus to the trees when the focus point of this picture should be the golden glistening water.  The colors are nice in this pic and the glistening water is pretty."

photocritique,3ce3zx,DogsCatsAndHorses,2,Tue Jul 7 05:01:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say the main issue is a lack of focus.   First, your shot isn't focused on anything in particular, and the whole thing is just sort hazy.   There's also a lack of a subject. If you wanted the bridge to be your subject, I would have dropped the tripod down and changed the angle to make a particular element of the scene jump to the eye."

photocritique,3ce3zx,TheSobadef,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:01:58 2015 UTC,Do you think there's any way of playing the colors or cropping the photo to give some type of focus that makes sense? I don't know the next time I'll get to this location to reshoot this photo.
photocritique,3ce3zx,ChoadIsland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:13:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I really don't think there's much worth salvaging with over editing.

photocritique,3ce3zx,ChoadIsland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"The first thing I'd say is, try to get rid of the motion blur (most apparent in the stars). Use a tripod if you have one, if not, maybe crank ISO/use faster shutter speed."
photocritique,3ce3zx,ChoadIsland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:05:10 2015 UTC,"The Stars motion blur is from the stars moving and me not being focused on them. I had a tripod and it was on solid ground.

photocritique,3cb1cq,TheMagicTractor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"Went down to Wilsons Promontery with a friend to try out my new Mk3. Haven't done landscape photography before so it was fun to give it a go.  This is a beach which is the south-most tip of Australia (not counting Tasmania obviously), and it was like 7c, cold and really windy!  Would love to get some opinions on this photo and if anyone is keen on checking out the other shots I took on the trip, the flickr album is here  5d Mk3 with Sigma 85mm 1.4 (yes i know its a strange lens for landscape, I didn't want to switch lenses on the windy, sandy beach) shot at f7.1, ISO 200 and 1/400 shutter speed  Thanks!"
photocritique,3cb1cq,oceanswell,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"This would be great if it was straightened. It's giving the impression of being crooked because the far arm of the beach is on an angle and so is the land behind it. A simple rotation improves the image massively. In landscape photography always always always level your horizons, especially interfaces between water and land. Water always lies flat. This is one of the basics that should always be kept in mind when photographing. Monitor your horizontal and vertical lines. A non-level horizon comes off as amateur or lazy. http://i.imgur.com/UqJ8LFN.jpg"
photocritique,3cb1cq,oceanswell,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! I completley overlooked it initially, funnily enough for all the other landscape shots I took I did level them, but on these the horizon was very clearly visible. The edit you made does look substantially less crooked, and in turn looks a lot better, i'll keep an eye out for this in the future, thank you!"
photocritique,3cb1cq,haaahaaa0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"The album you have linked is great. Good mood and good colors. The sigma 85 1.4 is also a sexy sexy lens, I have it too and I love it."
photocritique,3cb1cq,htimsnhoj,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I appreciate it, first time trying out VSCO too haha  Yeah the 85 1.4 is quite a nice lens, I bought mine used for 600 aud (450 usd) and it performs pretty damn well, can't beat it for portraits and bokeh crazy photos. The sharpness is also very nice! AF is a little slow and it has a bit of CA issues but IMO for an 85 its perfectly reasonable and I find the image quality to be similar/comparable to the 85 1.2."
photocritique,3cav1y,Simz88,6,Mon Jul 6 13:48:32 2015 UTC,"Overall its not too bad. it looks like you took a rather mundane snap shot and decided to try and make it interesting with some post processing instead of taking a great shot and making it more interesting with post. Nothing about this image says you were intending to make a ice portrait when you initially took it. I mean she is wearing a spaghetti strap top - which screams summer, not ice portrait.  Posing. I like the head tilt. Would be nice to have some hands in the shot. Touching her shoulder, collarbone, hair etc. I would also really prefer this to be in portrait orientation. Nothing interesting in the background that needs the wide orientation for inclusion.  I would try taking another shot with everything in the shot meant to convey 'Ice portrait'. Have her in some furs, or some interesting 'ice' outfit. Have her do something more interesting with her hair rather than I just woke up and showed up. Maybe add some kind of ice prop - glowing led lights in a icy glass or something. You want as many things as possible adding interest while staying congruent with the theme / story."

photocritique,3cc4um,purplesnowcone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:32:53 2015 UTC,cool shot.  the black part is a bit too large and dominating.  I think cropping it so the mountain only takes up bottom 3rd would make it better.  Also I prefer the wider aspect ratio for shots like this.
photocritique,3cc4um,majortato,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that is what I was wondering.  I wanted to try creating equal proportions between them but wasn't sure if it was too much black or not- I will try a crop version."
photocritique,3cdq3m,Hash-Tag,3,Tue Jul 7 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, you need to find an interesting subject to photograph.  It doesn't even have to be THAT interesting...but you need to make your subject clear and give it focus.  This shot really is just a mess.  My eyes are bouncing everywhere.  There's some messy dead wood on the bottom left, a crooked dock on the right.  A random sign sticking out of the ground.  And an ugly telephone pole dominating the scene.  Finally, my eyes can't help but eventually get drawn to the brightest and most colorful part of the picture, but it's just an empty sky with the telephone pole blocking the view....so it doesn't stay there and ends up bouncing around the picture again.  Some potential ideas for shots you could have tried for in the area.     Walking up to what looks like a point on the left and focusing on the trees/water....your subject becomes the flood.  This also might give you an angle to avoid capturing any of the other junk in the scene..especially that telephone pole. focus on that crooked dock....get closer...make it interesting looks to be a sunset and some sunrays on the left...take a picture of that with the water in the foreground."
photocritique,3cdq3m,majortato,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:04:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the feedback. I assume it's probably over edited as well?
photocritique,3cdq3m,majortato,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:05 2015 UTC,I didn't notice that it looks overly processed.  Looks like you bumped up saturation and contrast a bit...nothing extreme or unnatural about it.  Focus on composition and subject first...worry about post processing after.

Plus it's not like she does anything else to earn her keep. Lazy bum...  Anyway, these are some nice shots, though a few of them are similar enough to each other that they become redundant. In some of them it looks like you didn't quite nail the focus and/or had too narrow a depth of field.    I think you can skip the shot of the back of the cat's head. It's about as interesting as the back of a cat's head.   One of them is all washed out, I assume intentionally. Didn't care for the look.   Most importantly though, you've made me feel a little less like a crazy person. Thank you."

photocritique,3c90v4,thechangbang,3,Mon Jul 6 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"I love shooting subway stuff!  Just put together a book on it.  I know shooting on the subway is hard at some ISOs, but I've been shooting f/2, 1/30, iso 400, and think it's a bit more thoughtful to do shallow depth of field live rather than in post, and you could probably afford to bump up the iso a little (though I mostly shot film so it's usually grain over digital noise) and higher ISOs are becoming more and more usable with modern sensors.  Subject matter this is cool, but I think it would be much better if it were closer, not a crop either, people on the subway don't really react too much if you're 5 feet away from them shooting in their face as long as you're discreet.  I do think this is a very solid attempt, and the post blurring looks very good, but it's just so close to being really special.  Lots of good ideas.  Vertical is the right call imo, and colour grading screams the personality of the subway.  I might add a bit of grain and make it B&W, but this is also very tasteful."

Use your lens at its widest (unless you're looking for star trails) Don't be afraid to push the ISO up I can notice some stuck pixels (blue / red / white dots) - substract them with a dark frame.
photocritique,3ccbu3,KhloQ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"your exposure is set a bit too long.  notice that you can see significant star streaks in all the pictures.  Your foreground choices seem a bit uninspired.  Doesn't look like much planning went into it.  You just stepped into your backyard, picked a random spot and then decided to include a bit of foreground in the shot.  If you do manage to find a decent foreground subject, try using a flashlight or something to light paint it and make it pop in front of the starry backdrop."

I think the contrast is a little high and there is a bit of detail lost in the blacks and whites.  I think her face needs more fill light, and the green needs to be minimized. I would also deemphasize the objects in the foreground so your eye leads to her face more (darker/ less saturation if you're doing it in post)."

photocritique,3c86mr,35nnnn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I assumed there wasn't too much you could do about the lighting in the situation.   Seeing the original, I actually think you can just pull back a little bit on the editing as a whole. Once your'e white balanced and your blacks are black, I don't think you need to go much further with adding blue. I personally like some of the warmth in the original.  Then I would add a little bit of magenta (opposite of green) to her face until it looks right to you. If it still looks too grey you can try adding yellowish skintone on top of that."

Particularly her chin      It's way too easy to make a pretty person look odd, and more difficult than it should be to make an ugly person look good. In this case, you started out with a nice model, just try different variations on positioning & lighting. I was tasked with getting a portrait of a gal who did well in local beauty contests, and she did seem pretty. But cameras hated her. Without the dynamics of life, just a capture of a single instant in time rarely looked well.  Partly because she'd learned to smile too big for the camera, which put her face into the wrong proportions. So I got the camera all focused & ready, had her pose, then told her to not smile. Then told her to think of something she did that her parents won't find out about for twenty years, and held down the button for about 7 or 8 fast shots. Caught her with the start of a smile, looked perfect.    Keep it up, you're off to a good start."

But I'm not the best with manual focus, either.  Any tips, especially on small moving subjects in low light?"
photocritique,3c7s87,knz_ru,2,Sun Jul 5 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not exactly the best camera nor the best lens (I assume you're using old 50/1.8) for that kind of shooting - tracking moving subjects, I'd even say that it is one of the worst combos from AF perspective in all Canon's lineup, so it's gonna be quite hard. It would be a lot easier if you got a lens with fast and precise autofocus, I personally found USM motors to be the best in that regard - EF-S 17-85 IS USM lens that I had was great in terms of AF.  Anyways, there are some advices to be given:   Use continuous or AI Servo AF and back button focusing (it will take you some time to get used to it, but it's definetely worth it) - link about what it is and how to enable it Shoot at smaller apertures (f2.8 and slower) so that the depth-of-field would be larger - if AF misses a small bit, maybe the extended DoF would cover it up, and you'll save the otherwise ruined picture. That would most likely involve inceasing the ISO, but it's honestly better to have a slightly noisy picture than not to have one at all Use central focus point for tracking, if possible from the composition perspective. It is cross-type, which means that it focuses, in theory, more reliably and is better suited for tracking moving subjects Shoot in bursts, it highly increases the chance of getting a nice in-focus image    Hope this helps!"

I do have back-button set up.  I've tried focusing on stuff and then moving, and I don't notice the camera changing focus.  Do I need to hold-down the back button the whole time? I'm sure I could find it in the manual or on a video, but I also haven't quite figured out how to control the focus points through the viewfinder. Good tips on aperture and bursts.  I'm getting more comfortable exposing darker with a slightly faster shutter speed, as it seems I can pull a lot of it out in Lightroom.  I've been afraid of going above ISO 400 as it just looks so grainy, but you're right that a noisy photo is better than no photo.   Thanks a bunch!"
photocritique,3c7s87,vxsarin,2,Sun Jul 5 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have to hold it down all the time. It tries to focus and track the subject while you're holding the button down. The main reason to have AI Servo + back button focsuing is that you can separately control the AF system and the shutter. You can, for example, set focus on some object beforehand (some furniture, for example) when your child (or cat) is running towards you, and then press the shutter button when your subject comes into focal plane to take photo instantly without camera trying to focus once again. You can do manual focus all the time without needing to change AF mode on the lens (but sadly not on 50/1.8 - it has a very fragile AF motor that could get wrecked if you apply momentum on the focusing ring while the lens is in AF mode, but on most other lenses you can do that - that's called full-time manual focusing ability). And it just feels a bit more precise that way - maybe it has to do with a slight delay between a half-press and a full-press of a shutter button in a conventional way, during which the camera stops focusing. It seems like this delay should be negligible, but I dunno. My experience tells me otherwise.  I don't really know about Rebel T5, but on other Canon cameras I've had you have to press the focus point select button (top-right corner button on the back), then the autofocus point that is selected should be highlighted in red in the viewfinder. You can then switch the point by directional pad keys. Central button (""SET"") sets central point or changes the mode to auto, when the camera uses all focus points (all of them should be highlighted then). You may or may not have the ability to do that in some of the automatic modes, though. To be honest, I never used anything other than M and A on any of my cameras, so I wouldn't know :D But I remember reading something about that in the manual.  About exposing darker - actually, it's better to have, say, 800 ISO with a spot-on exposure than 400 ISO and then pull it +1 stop of exposure in Lightroom. Well, the difference would be not so apparent in this example, because that 1 extra stop of shadow details are still in the sensor's dynamic range, but as ISOs get higher and sensor's dynamic range shrinks, it becomes vitally important to get the right exposure. -0.5 stops, +0.5 stops - you'll get noise or blown highlights.   If Canon 60d or 600d are any indication of t5's sensor performance (they use the same sensor, as far as I know), it should be quite possible to get decent results even on 3200 ISO - just get rid of chroma noise in Lightroom, it's the nasty-looking one - leftover luminance noise should look like a film grain, which may even add some artistic touch to your photos. I've found ISO 100 to 1600 on my 60D to be completely usable, ISO 3200 - usable with some caution. Hell, I've even used ISO 6400 to get Milky Way photo. It was a mess with chroma noise all over the picture, but it was still a Milky Way shot! And it looked decent enough after some Photoshop treatment to post it online.  Oh, by the way, another thing you might want to consider is Magic Lantern firmware (unofficial, unsupported by Canon, etc, etc), that gives you lots of additional options and tricks while shooting. For example, you may find useful the focus trap mode - camera will take a shot when something comes into the focal plane. Or Dual ISO mode, that increases the dynamic range of the image in a similar way that HDR mode does, but with one shot only."

I think it would be better cropped tighter with a 8x10 ratio. I think you should drop the exposure and make the photo slightly darker.

photocritique,3c5uz2,ParticleSpinClass,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:10:12 2015 UTC,"Was this shot in RAW or JPG? I'm assuming JPG since it was unedited. Would you mind uploading the original file so I can try a few basic edits and share what I did with you?   Regardless of that, I would get Adobe Lightroom and start playing around. It's quite affordable. The photo package of Adobe Creative Cloud is $10/mo. Check out /r/Lightroom, and there are a number of good youtube channels teaching you the basics of Lightroom use. I also recommend Mike Browne's youtube channel as well. I don't think he has any Lightroom-specific videos, but has great photography information in general.  For this photo, specifically, what I would do is try to add a little contrast to darken the sky and bring out the shadows in the cows a little more as well as the mountains in the background. It looks a little flat overall. Then adjust the whites/blacks levels to make sure nothing is blown out or too black. Then play with the highlights/shadows to get a good-looking exposure. And maybe crop in the right edge just a tad. My eyes feel it's a little uneven, even though it's likely just an illusion. I would also probably crop the bottom a little as well to get the cows on the bottom third line. Or at least apply lens corrections (assuming it's a known lens profile) to try to fix that distortion at the bottom.  Just out of curiosity, what camera/lens was this taken with. If your camera supports it, start shooting in RAW (or RAW+JPG) and processing with Lightroom or something similar to get more out of the light the camera is getting in."

This is currently the only lens I have for his camera! I can't afford anything else yet. Planning on the Nikon 70-200 2.8.

There's nothing really interesting in the picture that draws my attention to it.  The sunset is washed out.  The clouds are boring.  The foreground is a mess.  Perhaps the sunset colors were really cool, but the exposure is wrong.  You need to expose for the sunset so that it's not washed out.  Then use some post processing to bring out the colors more.  This was obviously taken with a quick shutter speed, so you can see the waves in the water.  If you get an ND filter, you can take long exposure shots creating that nice smooth dreamy effect with water which goes a long way to helping out pictures like this."

Maybe you were spot metering something dark?"
photocritique,3c7pgi,sub-merge,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't remember what it was set to at the time. EXIF data shows ""multi-segment"" which doesn't directly relate to any settings on the camera.   I was generally trying to under-expose most of these shots thinking that it wouldn't clip the whites as much. I thought I had the EV set to under-expose, but EXIF shows 0.   So you're saying I should set exposure bias to positive for snow shots?"
photocritique,3c7pgi,carvshner,2,Sun Jul 5 23:18:26 2015 UTC,"Your cameras built in meter will meter reflective light. The downside to this is some surfaces reflect more light than others so the camera has no real way of knowing how much incident light is falling on a subject to expose properly. Camera manufacturers decided that somewhere from 12-18% grey is what a scene should mostly look like so when it sees snow or a bright scene, it tries to average it out to 18% grey -- this leads to it underexposing the scene as a whole.  So you need to help your camera a little. When your scene is lighter than 18% grey, you need to over expose because your camera will naturally try and underexpose the scene. When your scene is darker than 18% grey, you need to do the opposite, by under exposing because your camera will want to overexpose.   It's a little weird and not intuitive, but the best case I can give is for weddings.  A bride in her white dress against a white backdrop will be severely underexposed  A groom in his black suit against a back backdrop will be severely overexposed.  A trick I do is to spot meter a pure white surface and add a stop or two of exposure compensation and see how it turns out. Similar for blacks, but opposite."

It's slightly crooked at the top of the frame. Your subject is the children, but you exposed for the landscape. Because the scene is so bright, the children are now way too dark. You can fix this a few ways. 1) Use a fill flash to balance the ambient light and the exposure on the children. 2) Use exposure compensation and overexpose by maybe a stop or so. The background will be overexposed yes, but your subject will be properly exposed and more pleasing.

Lines lead the eye, so having a crooked lines makes the photo unbalanced. This is true whether you're taking horizon lines on a body of water or lines within the walls of your house or trees outside. I am not saying it's a hard fast rule, but generally it's better to have lines that are parallel and perpendicular with the frame of the photo. It just produces a more pleasing composition."

photocritique,3c3kil,tlevitate,2,Sat Jul 4 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"This is such a nice moment. Nice job. Fill flash would just ruin it. I think you have to ask yourself, in a short amount of time, what you want to capture. Do you want or need shadow detail? What for?  Or do you want to save a moment of the kids looking off into the sunset, with a golden highlight and silhouettes against green fields.  I'd keep shooting in this instance to try to capture their faces looking into the sun in unison. Maybe even drop the expose a half or full stop more to make the children's silhouettes darker. After doing that I'd wheel around to capture them head on, with that nice side light.  I think people don't realize the opportunity they have with light like this to create really great silhouetted pictures, and they try to stay in the middle ground.   TL;DR Nice shot. Wait for better moment. Work with the natural light you have and try exposing for the highlights. Don't be afraid to lose shadow detail if it's not critical to image."
photocritique,3c3kil,miladymondegreen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're going for.  Are you focusing on the kids?  Make sure their all of faces are well exposed.  It might have been nice to have them all face the setting sun, and capture that golden silhouette the first two kids from the left.  Or, have them face you, with the sun in the background, creating a halo around their heads, and exposing their faces with a reflector or fill flash.  If you're trying to capture more of the landscape (and it is a beautiful one), make sure your aperture is wide enough to increase the depth of field.  And take as many shots as possible (as long as your models are willing), at multiple times of the sunset. You never know when the sun will hit the perfect angle and make the lighting that much sweeter."

Learning how to take criticism is fundamental no matter your level of photography. Sometimes having a second set of eyes will make you see things you didn't even see yourself.  That said, this is a nice photo. Good job on getting a clear and well exposed shot. I am not a professional in this type of photography, but the subject takes up most of that frame and isn't cut off. That's a great start.  Try reading a little about compositional balance. Specifically how areas of light / dark and placement of your subject can balance a photo. To me, you're using the rule of thirds to place your fireworks (subject) but the rest of the frame is relatively empty to the right. This throws off the balance and creates tension, making your eye want to visit these dark areas to try and balance the photo, but being unable to do so."
photocritique,3c68nj,sub-merge,2,Sun Jul 5 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"Agree about composition - needs another firework burst to the right or something else to fill...something like a lit up Ferris wheel in the foreground to balance. Image needs to be leveled out too, appears to be sinking on the left. I like the fireworks themselves, the colors are pleasing to the eye and there's a nice diversity of firework styles without clouds of smoke obscuring them."

This was shot at a railway station while their train waited departure. As I started clicking, this child walked up to me wondering what was going on. The family was more than happy to be photographed. They wanted a family photo, and they were getting everyone else ready for the family pic - in the background you can see the lady helping the child down from the bunk."

Maybe in the morning if there is some fog or dust and light beams, or in the evening (light permitting).  Otherwise its just a picture of the woods. Also when using 18mm the rule is the closer the better. 18mm isn't technically for ""getting it all in"" you want an anchor point and some depth. Keep at it tho! Sometimes ill go to the same spot 3 or 4 times because the sun is never really in the exact same spot (ya know with whole earth rotation stuff). Also, if there is dust or something, try an ND filter and a longer shutter. You will be surprised the landscape shots you can achieve!"

I dont mess around too much with color and tint in nature photography but that depend on what you want to portray. Would love it if the negative space is on the left because the damsels are mostly on the left side. ISO could be reduced by lowering the shutter speed to about 1/200 which is sufficient for a handheld shot. From your other pics, I think you need to be aware of how you crop, there are like parts of flowers in the shot which is distracting. Hope im not too harsh.  All in all a good shot. Im just nitpicking."

The girl on the left fades off into the room starting with the back of her head. I noticed that fairly quickly. Enough to be a little distracting.  I think that should be fixed if the data is there to allow it.  Overall it's a litle dark around the women. Just a tad darker than I care for. I feel like I should be able to make out a little more detail.  The grain is a little overdone. Unless you were shooting real film. I'd back that off a notch. The grain is making it look overall less sharp... and that's probably why it's hitting my meter.   It could be cropped a little tighter, and maybe throw the subject/s a little further off center."

I the cameras and the eye are what you were photographing, they should be a lot more ""central"" (I don't mean that in the ""in the middle""-way: more contrasts, better crop, less distraction, etc.) to the picture. Perhaps a portrait cut of the left part? Or even more narrow? You'd still have the issue of them not being prominent enough, but it'd be a start."

photocritique,3c1muj,sebigboss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:53:31 2015 UTC,"It's certainly more focused on the eye and cameras, so in a way: yes, it's better. But the issue of the cameras being very hard to notice is still there. There is simply too much going on in the picture for the cameras to matter if they don't stand out. Post production there is only so much you can do to make them pop more: a) reduce to monochrome and then work them out with the contrasts... Not sure, how much it'll be able to salvage, but might work. b) lighten them up with a selection and curves. Might work, might look ugly... who knows.  The placement is one of the biggest problems for the cameras, I think. If you moved forward to place them in the sky, they'd stand out. Or maybe if you placed them as a counterpart to the eye instead of kinda grouping both objects in the left side of the photo. All just ideas, but I hope, I can give you some things to consider."

It might work better if you shot it from an angle rather than straight on. That way it would have some diagonal lines, and hopefully a better sense of depth.   Also, at the bottom you can see just the edge of the fence. That's kinda distracting. I would either include more of the street, or cut it out altogether. Probably the former.   Edit: also, your title makes it sound like the focus is supposed to be on the eye, rather than on the entire building. If that's what you're going for them I would compose it so that the eye takes up a lot more of the frame, and you don't see the whole building."

Obviously you can't go back in time and fix it, but I would consider at least cropping off some of the stuff on the right to make the wall panels symmetrical.  Also the white balance seems way off to me (did you shoot in auto WB?).  If you play around with it you can probably draw out more color, or at least clean up the yellow cast a bit.    Other than that I like it."
photocritique,3c3bxv,WindowShoppingMyLife,2,Sat Jul 4 10:33:05 2015 UTC,"At first I thought the focus was off, but it seems the photo is moderately blurry as a whole. It most certainly comes from your lens. Lens technology has immensely improved in 20 years to match the needs of more and more efficient digital cameras. An old lens, especially if it wasn't top quality even then, falls far behind today's lenses. It is also possible that the lens itself suffered damaging during all these years. A damaged coating impacts image quality a lot."
photocritique,3c3bxv,Magic_Baguette,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:38:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you. It's possible that the focus was off as well, since the lens isn't compatible with the camera's autofocus. The viewfinder on the camera isn't really intended for manual focus, so I was really just kind of eyeballing it. I think I got it, but it's possible that it's not perfect.   But yeah, I suspected it had to do with the lens somehow, but I wasn't sure whether it was just age or something else. I'm still a newbie, so this was my first time using anything other than the kit lens."
photocritique,3c3bxv,mcjiggerlog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:14:43 2015 UTC,"You said this is lens related. I've been reading about old lenses. This is my first time experimenting with anything other than my kit lens, so I don't have a lot of basis for comparison.   This was shot with a Nikon AF 70-210 telephoto, f4-5.6. Its my dad's, bought some time around '87. According to some of the info I've been able to find, this is supposed to be a nice lens. That makes me wonder if the lens was the real problem. The auto focus doesn't work with my camera body, so it seems equally plausible that I just botched the manual focus. Could that account for the ""soft"" look?   Here's another shot I took with the same setup that day.  http://imgur.com/AafJ2sM The focus seems ok (to my admittedly untrained eye), but there's still a lot of chromatic aberration. I'm not sure if that's a flaw or if that's typical for this sort of lens.   Any info you could provide would be very helpful."
photocritique,3c3bxv,mcjiggerlog,2,Sat Jul 11 01:38:11 2015 UTC,The image is very soft. I think it's actually quite an interesting effect and think you could shoot some great pictures with it.

Other than that, I don't think the foreground branch/leaf elements are doing you any favors.  They're very big and blurry and encroaching on what looks like it should be the focus (the shadowy areas in the middle) a bit too much.  Also is that a lens flare artifact in the center left of the image next to that plant that's in the light?"

However, the 2D composition is very interesting, but the shallow DOF kinda forces you to see it in 3D.  So, I would use a larger dof (smaller aperture) to make it all in the plane of focus, and maybe print it on matte paper to give it a more flat look so the viewer is forced to consider the 2D arrangement of shapes instead of the depth behind the trees - which isn't very interesting with just a flat rock face as the focal point."

photocritique,3c0uxt,Remington_Underwood,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a striking image.  The horizon line is crooked, which I find distracting.  I also find it odd that the trees are almost completely black given that it's daylight.  I think that they could be brightened up (or at least the midtones could be raised a bit) without affecting too much of the primary focus (the contrasty clouds).  This is often done using a graduated filter to darken the sky but keep the ground bright enough."
photocritique,3c0uxt,Tetrad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:00:45 2015 UTC,"I actually really like this, I love the way the darkened trees make the clouds pop towards the foreground, the whole image feels 3D and full of life. The lighting makes no sense and yet it still works, maybe keeping some of the texture in the trees but retaining the dark tone would add a little interest, keep your contrast high and balance the composition overall. Good work, it's simple but different."

I just have no idea what the purpose of this series is, except that you apparently wanted to make a series of self portraits   While this is as good of an interpretation as any other, my goal was to depict a semi-autobiographical story about a young man who learns to let go of the expectations laid by his surroundings and to ""be his own man"" and do the things that feel right to him."

There's nothing in the photo that really catches my eye, no depth, no perspective, no interesting lighting. Technically it seems very bland.

photocritique,3by4ho,Radiatron,5,Fri Jul 3 06:27:42 2015 UTC,"It's not bad.  The problem with selective color is that it's one of those things everyone starting on creative photography thinks of and does just for the sake of doing it.  It's like a dad joke - 98% of the time it's groan worthy and 2% of the time its actually pretty funny.  My thoughts on selective color is not that it should never be done, but that it should only be done if there is a purpose other than it might look cool.  There should be some recognizable reason behind it.  This particular photo isn't bad, I just can't find the reason and the colors pop too much so that it is distracting. I wonder if it would be better to do it more subtly."

Both B&W or experimenting with color tones could have made this a winner but the selective color absolutely ruins it for me. Just my opinion though!

I didn't think the colors were interested enough to keep it as a color picture, so I switched it to B&W, and upped the grain and contrast, hoping to give it a filmy look.   I don't like how out of place the white rod-holders look, but I couldn't figure out how to change them for the better.   I also don't like how the crest of the wave cuts right through the man's head. I wish I had taken another set to get a better-framed wave.   Any other thoughts?"

photocritique,3c2m5j,imnothatguy,12,Sat Jul 4 04:31:22 2015 UTC,"The shot just isn't done well, technically or artistically.  On the technical side:   The photo looks blurry, probably from having too high of an ISO.  Get a faster lens or a camera with better low-light capabilities, or use more light (you could likely simulate the lighting here with a strobe easily enough) The photo is tilted, and not in a way that looks intentional.  All the vertical lines are going to the left.  The image looks like it needs to be rotated clockwise a few degrees.   Artistically:   There are a lot of distractions.  You could easily edit out the light switch and wall plates.  There's this weird blue light in the lower right.  I'm not sure what that boxy thing protruding from the shadows in the left side is supposed to be. I'm not sure what the point is supposed to be.  Is it the guitar itself?  Because it's just kind of there. Is it the lighting/shadows?  Because the whole arrangement just looks a little confusing.  And usually in those cases you boost the contrast and go black and white to make that focus more clear. The angle is very pedestrian.  One thing I tell a lot of new photographers is to get lower.  This looks like a snapshot, partly because it's just not very well done, but also because the angle is what you normally see just walking around a house.  If it was shot from much higher, or much lower, it would make you think more since the shot would be less familiar and therefore make it more interesting.   Also, this doesn't help much, but I really hate those fake brass door handles that seemed to crop up in anything built in the 90s.  Just comes across as ""cheap apartment"" which doesn't necessarily make for an interesting photo subject.  But that might be more of a personal misgiving than anything else."

I would have also shot the guitar in portrait versus landscape to remove the light switch and other bracket on the wall (not sure if it's an outlet) That being said, I prefer filling the frame when I take my own pictures.

photocritique,3c0egy,nightrage707,2,Fri Jul 3 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"The photo is split in half with the top of the water. Unless you've made a conscious and clear decision to cut an image in half, an off-centre or rule-of-thirds placement will almost always present a stronger composition. Overall the image is just too boring and has no impact."
photocritique,3c2ktt,nimblybimblyco,2,Sat Jul 4 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"Constructively speaking, I think the butterfly is slightly out of focus and that kind of put some strain on my eyes.

photocritique,3c2ktt,WindowShoppingMyLife,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:49:52 2015 UTC,The light coming through the branches pulls the focus away from the butterfly.
photocritique,3c2ktt,rusology,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:54:00 2015 UTC,Hmm first of all welcome back to photography!  I assume the butterfly is the subject but its not in focus. Maybe zoom in or move a little closer to avoid the leaf clutter (but butterflies are skittish and im unsure what gear you are using). The other orange butterfly would be a better subject due to its contrasting colors. Maybe next time you can try multiple angles and see which works better if the subject allows :)  Take your time and get your groove back!

photocritique,3c2k8o,Tetrad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:12:34 2015 UTC,"For shots like this you really should consider the rule of thirds for your horizon line.  Having it in the middle is possibly the least interesting way you could frame this, and all the grass at the bottom doesn't add to your image in any way.  Crop it down so that your horizon line is in the bottom third of the image.  And while you're at it, make sure it's straight.  It's hard to tell sometimes because there might just be a slight hill, but looking at the building in the background it looks like it ever so slightly needs to rotated counter clockwise.  Maybe try to edit out the lens flares on the grass if it's still visible after cropping.  I like the placement of the tree in the frame and the mist and everything, although I wish there wasn't the overlapping of the light and building behind it.  Maybe if you took several steps to the left it would be more on its own you could still get that misty effect and the backlit tree look, which I feel is the strongest part of the whole composition."

photocritique,3bx9tz,CSquared75,9,Thu Jul 2 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, welcome to the B&W club! If you want to get serious about it, I just finished Michael Freeman's book on digital B&W and I highly recommend it.   First thing that struck me was how splendid the textures are here. The repetition in the buildings, the knurl of the beam on the diagonal, the bumpy road, the dripping paint at the top: all excellent. Keep your eyes peeled because you are clearly looking for the right elements.   Composition-wise, though, I'm not totally sold. Maybe it's just the way I scanned the image mentally, but the top of the image suggested that the beam was the subject, then the city jumped into view and then the motion of the car drew my attention. There were just too many factors asking for my attention that the whole image seems unbalanced.   I think the top half is really strong as a landscape crop (crop to just above the tops of the buildings), but the bottom has more detail than my brain can process.  On the technical side, I think you've done great work. The choice to have such a deep depth of field was good, the (top of) the image separates the elements in the frame enough that they don't need to be separated by the depth of field. Your exposure is spot-on, keeping the clouds and losing the bottom of the beam makes a stronger image than one where the bottom of the beam is revealed but the sky is lost. There seems to be a slight bright band on the bottom of the beam where it contacts the sky (just a few pixels wide but it's distracting).  Keep up the great work!

I wasnt able to see the car at first and really enjoyed the photo.  I thought the vibe was very Chicago.  Without a title I would have guessed thats where it was taken.  After seeing the car the photo lost some of the timelessness to it.  The car puts a time period to the photo.  With no car the photo could have been taken within a 50 year span and I wouldn't have had the slightest clue, and thats something special IMO.  Overall great shot!

The car is a big gimmicky, it also adds too much to the photo, I wasn't sure where you wanted me to be looking. On this its a bit clearer.   I think maybe if it was a bit lower, it the taller buildings would fill the gap and the beam would be reduced which could be nice.   Really its a pretty good photo, but I think there are a lot of possibilities for this position."
photocritique,3bx9tz,RSredditBot,2,Fri Jul 3 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"everything is so conflicting. i like the idea of the natural border, but when its used to emphasize something so far away, its hard to arrange the other elements. the focals are the skyscrapers in the middle, but the moving car is distracting as well as the other ""window"" on the top right of the frame.  the b/w conversion is fine, but a little heavy handed in my personal opinion, it is very dark which usually indicates the mood you're going for, but the subject matter doesnt match that."

The horizon doesn't look level to me, which is such a simple fix that a photograph should really never be presented with that mistake.  It's very distracting and causes uneasiness.  The subject is very centered and it looks like he's just staring at a wall of rocks to the right.  This doesn't really elicit a feeling and makes it seem like you put the subject in there without much thought.  If most people were there, would they sit and stare at the rocky cliff or the beautiful ocean?  It makes it really bad when the framing is such that there's actually less space on the side that he is staring into.    I would have preferred the subject staring out at the ocean in a relaxed state taking it all in and the framing shifted a bit more to the left to give him ""room"" in the direction of the eyes."

Here is the SOC image: http://www.imgur.com/SJCbcRH  It was just a surreally desaturated scene with the black sand and mist. I wonder if the photo becomes any more appealing to you now? I should mention I chose to slightly desaturated the colors to make his orange outfit stand out because it reminded me of an astronaut's clothing, and I thought it went nicely with the extraterrestrial feeling of the beach. Didn't work?  Regarding the reciprocal photographer: I agree, she's unfortunate. :( What to do, though? Anyway he was her friend, not mine :)"

photocritique,3bxzvd,KDShark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:09:11 2015 UTC,"Either the GA Pacific building or the 191.   A couple techniques that can help shooting through a glass window.   1- clean the glass--- really well. With a cleaning solvent 2- drape a dark cloth or tshirt over your camera / head 3- polarizing filter-- buy one of these anyways 4- you can minimize visible spots like on the right side of your frame by playing with aperture 5- wide angles are not the ideal for this shot  Composition wise--   1- your light is interesting, but everything looks a little bluish. Maybe your white balance is off, or the golden hour wasn't too great. If you shot this today, It was gorgeous here so I supposed you may have been late. 2 - I find your perspective interesting as someone who lives in Atlanta. Because its different. But this isnt the skyline. You are shooting north up Ptree street, parallel with the skyline, and you need to shoot perpendicular. Go east to Freedom Parkway and there is a bridge you can shoot from. Also , the Lindbergh marta station has a parking deck that gives a nice view from the north east. I've gotten some good sunset photos there; get some planes taking off in the background too.  3- Also, this is kind of a boring shot. There's interesting buildings in Atlanta-- the flat iron, some of the other buildings very near to where you were (and probably visible from a different window. I'd go for those over this shot.   Hopefully this link works for you- this is the freedom parkway perspective.

I was maybe a little too focused on the technical aspects here (colors, symmetry, framing, light/shadows, etc.)  The only reason why I looked up is because I feel like this lens, shooting from this distance while looking straight at it, makes me look ugly as balls. So we took a few of me looking at the camera, some of me not looking, and I decided to go with this one, even though I still feel like the angle is giving a weird shape to my face/head.

When an image isn't leveled, it comes off as lazy or amateur.   The image isn't very sharp which unfortunately for wildlife photography is imperative. 1/40 is generally too slow to freeze motion in animals, you could have bumped the ISO and increased the shutterspeed. The color is oversaturated for my taste and the greens are looking a bit nuclear, I do like the effect you have going on from shooting through foliage."
photocritique,3bvmpo,oceanswell,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"It is level though. It's just the angle I was shooting at. Straightening the shot using the river bank as a horizon looks awkward. I think I just needed to reposition myself to be perpendicular to the bank so I could get a level ""horizon"".  This is cropped in a bit so I definitely lost some sharpness unfortunately :(  This guy was standing completely still which is why I kept the ISO down and chose a slower shutter speed.  Saturation was bumped to +7 in LR and I didn't think it looked unnatural but everyone's taste is different.  Thank you for the feedback!"
photocritique,3bvmpo,oceanswell,3,Thu Jul 2 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"It is level though. It's just the angle I was shooting at.   This sentence doesn't make sense. You always need to consider your horizontal lines in photography. Yes its the angle you were shooting at - adjust your position or straighten it afterwards in post processing.   Water always lies flat. Here your water looks as if it should start flowing downhill to the left. Sorry, you're wrong. http://imgur.com/Feht0P7 immediately looks more normal.   I see your reasons, but generally for wildlife, even if the subject is standing completely still, you still would want a faster shutterspeed than this especially to prevent camera shake on your end. I get cropping in but you want a really sharp, high quality image for cropping."
photocritique,3bvmpo,mybendphotography,2,Thu Jul 2 16:33:15 2015 UTC,"THIS^ x100!  r/oceanswell is spot on. Especially regarding shutter speed. If you had a faster shutter speed you also would have been ready if your subject decided to take flight. Be ready for the picture you are taking, but also for the picture that presents itself.  IMHO, start with your ISO at 200 or even 300 for outdoor nature shots. The slight boost in ISO will give you a lot more options if the light changes rapidly or if you need to increase the shutter speed for a quick action opportunity. Since it is very rare that you are going to print the final shot larger than 11x14, you will never see the difference between ISO 100 and 300.   Keep up the great work Vinnie and have fun!"

But I did notice that everything you shoot is at ISO 100 (even the cityscape night light-trails shot). With your Canon you should be able to shoot at ISO 400 and still see no difference than ISO 100. I'm not saying shooting at ISO 100 is bad, but you gain a LOT of flexibility by bumping up the ISO just a bit."

You're right that the water looked like it was going down-hill, but it's not because of the bank of the river, rather the reflections of the bird and brush. The beak and tail should be perfectly aligned vertically. There are also darker portions of the brush that can serve as a guide."

photocritique,3bvmpo,SCphotog,2,Thu Jul 2 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"It's not level.  Look at the reflections.  The water is a flat mirror, so things reflected should align vertically with their reflections. I think if you made this adjustment, the bank of the river wouldn't matter.  There are a few easy spots to compare: the tail, the beak, and some reeds. You'll get the best results aligning the tallest thing you can find that provides a reflection."

I've fallen in love with my sigma 24mm 1.4 art lens :)"
photocritique,3bsz10,SCphotog,15,Wed Jul 1 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"For kids, family, etc... wide if fine, and fun too. For full body portraits it's cool too.   Go to shoot some professional models... and it's not gonna work out.

photocritique,3bsz10,pedramnavid,25,Thu Jul 2 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"Notice how her arm looks like its twice the length of her body? Wide angle lenses exaggerate things closest to the lens, on top of the distortion you get around the edges. It doesn't matter here because it's a nice portrait of a kid, but if this was a family portrait, model work, or something else where proportions are a little more important, you'd want to be very careful with a wide-angle shot because you're going to get weird alien legs and arms if they're not posed correctly.   Couple examples of where I've done it well and not so well. Both at 22mm   Not so well. Little kid with size 13 men's shoes, or a wide angle lens where the leg is just a little bit closer to the camera than the body. Well. Same lens, same angle, but further from the subject, plus she's on the same plane as the lens. Well, she's a little biased to the legs, but that's fine because it's her dress being distorted and not her legs, so she just ends up looking tall."
photocritique,3bsz10,ParticleSpinClass,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:08 2015 UTC,Can you not apply lens profile corrections?
photocritique,3bsz10,pedramnavid,9,Thu Jul 2 02:48:10 2015 UTC,It corrects distortion but not proportion. Try lens correction on a fish eye lens to see what I mean..

photocritique,3bsz10,pedramnavid,-5,Thu Jul 2 12:11:45 2015 UTC,"As i said in an earlier comment, i know the distortions are more extreme with a wide angle lens but i dont really find the arm so weird in this picture. She is quite tall and the table she is at is pretty high aswell.  .  Ive worked in a studio, shooting models for the past year and me and most of my friends who also work in studio prefers the 24-70 2.8 lens. we usually shoot around the 50-70 range but sometimes you go wider. In the industry its always been a taboo to go to wide when you get close like this but this image cleary shows wides can be great for portrait. I don't think this image would look as good on a 85mm 1.4.  I'm not saying its better with wides, im just saying people should not be so afraid to use them for portaits. you dont need a long lens for portraits :)"
photocritique,3bsz10,diesel828,16,Thu Jul 2 01:47:44 2015 UTC,"You posted in photocritique, so I gave you a critique. if you like this shot in a 24, then pose the body better so the arm isn't closer to the camera and occupying as much space. or, switch to a 35mm. the truth is this is just a snapshot, not really a portrait of a subject.   you asked her to look at you and you took a nice photo. the background doesn't really tell us anything. the kid is cute but there's not much else there."

photocritique,3bsz10,My_name_is_lame,14,Thu Jul 2 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"More so for adults. Kids have a harder time looking fat. lol. Distorted, sure, but they're normally thin enough that it doesn't totally deform them in the same way."
photocritique,3bsz10,ToTouchAnEmu,6,Wed Jul 1 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"very true, and the fact that most of us are taller than kids so we shoot down at them rather than straight on"
photocritique,3bsz10,diesel828,5,Thu Jul 2 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"Couple of things.  First, that rule is meant to deter newbies from thinking they need to be up close and use wide lenses for portraits every time. The fact is that it does distort facial features quite a bit and can cause undesirable bulging of the face.  Here is a self portrait I shot to demonstrate the undeniable effect  Now this is a bit more extreme because it's a 16mm shot, but you see the point.  Second, this is a child. Children's faces are a lot more forgiving when it comes to distortion.  Third, This is clearly a 24mm prime lens, and that smaller dof sort of emulates a longer focal length which gives it a ""portrait"" look. I bet if you shot this at f/4 or higher it would no longer have a portrait feel to it and it would just a standard photo.  That being said, great portrait! I have a 35mm prime and use it at practically every portrait shoot. I don't care if it distorts a bit, the wide angle is just way less boring than your usual 85mm portraits. (not that there is anything wrong with 85mm lenses... I own one because it has its purposes)"
photocritique,3bsz10,couldyouelaborate,13,Thu Jul 2 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"Too much distortion and the bokeh is distracting and not very smooth. You could have taken this same exact photo a little further away with a 35mm or even a 50mm and it would have looked a thousand times better.  You think the distortion doesn't have much effect here, or that it lends itself to the photo somehow, but that's lack of experience talking. It's not even just the disproportionate limbs, but also the barrel distortion of the overall photo.  And aside from the bad distortion, if we're gonna do a critique, let's critique, even though you were just looking for praise because you already said in your title that you think the photo is ""great.""  The colors are strange. The tones in her arms look weird, and it actually looks kinda dead as it fades into that bluish color moving toward her hand.  The light isn't the best, as it's not hitting the mask of her face, but more of an angle from the back that sweeps across her head and cuts abruptly near her nose.  Because it's such a wide angle, your depth of field is not as shallow as longer focal lengths, so the chairs, plants, furniture and everything else in the background is hugely distracting. There isn't a clear enough separation of your subject from the background because of those things bisecting her head.  The vignetting is too strong, and I believe that's to make up for the flat light and distractions in the frame. Generally, you want a vignette to draw attention to subjects closer to the middle of the frame, but the vignette is too intense in this photo.  When you look to complete a frame, you generally don't want to cut objects in weird places. Putting the whole cake in the frame, which shouldn't have been hard to do with such a wide angle lens, would've removed that weird tension to the right edge of the frame."
photocritique,3bsz10,diesel828,5,Thu Jul 2 06:02:41 2015 UTC,"I have to say, as much as I am reluctant to post wholesale negative feedback, I agree entirely with this post.

I applaud you for experimenting though, and hope you continue to do so."
photocritique,3bsz10,pedramnavid,0,Thu Jul 2 12:17:41 2015 UTC,"I hope so, too, because I don't want to discourage u/joeland2 from experimenting and pushing things to the limit. That's what builds great photographers. But there are some basics that definitely need a bit of work first."
photocritique,3bsz10,Poromenos,2,Thu Jul 2 18:29:53 2015 UTC,Beyond basics it's being able to take criticism well to improve instead of assuming greatness and dismissing everyone who disagrees.
photocritique,3bsz10,diesel828,3,Fri Jul 3 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"That's very useful feedback, even to an observer, like me. I have a few questions, if you don't mind:   It's not even just the disproportionate limbs, but also the barrel distortion of the overall photo.   Is there a specific place where this is more evident? I only see it as a general ""this is distorted"" feeling, but maybe that's what OP was going for.   The light isn't the best, as it's not hitting the mask of her face, but more of an angle from the back that sweeps across her head and cuts abruptly near her nose.   Is there a specific reason this is bad? Shadows help define what objects look like in three dimensions, so, as a novice, I have a hard time telling good from bad shadows. I think that even hard shadows have their place. Do you have any ""good"" and ""bad"" examples of photos, when it comes to shadows?   The vignetting is too strong   Where do you see this? The upper left corner (the garden) looks exactly as light as the center middle (again the garden) to me. I don't notice any vignetting at all..."
photocritique,3bsz10,Poromenos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:21:58 2015 UTC,"Sure. It's not a specific place you see it, but in the entire photo. So if you move about 3-4 feet away from your computer, or you printed the photo and put it on a shelf or mantle, you'd see it (the average person wouldn't, but it's there).   And generally, you don't want want to go for a distorted feeling when you take a portrait of a child. I'd say there are few exceptions. An example would be getting underneath the chin of a baby that's crawling with a wide angle to make the baby seem larger than life, or just how big the world really is when you're that small.   As far as shadows, it depends on your subject and the mood you're going for. But generally, want shadows to flatter someone's face, whether it's a soft shadow to make the subject look softer or more feminine or just brighter, or a hard shadow to accentuate lines/angles/jaws.   One way to improve the light and shadows on this girl's face is to turn her to the left (camera left, the girl's right) just a little more so some of that light touches her other cheek, and maybe another catch light will hit her eye.  Vignetting is very noticeable. Again, it's not the specific area, but the image as a whole. Click on the 500px or 640px wide version of the photo and step a little further from your computer and you'll notice it immediately. Where it's especially noticeable, if you're really looking for it, are on the upper and lower right hand corners."
photocritique,3bsz10,diesel828,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"You're right on all your points, zooming out I see the distortion a lot (especially in the lines of the furniture in the background) and the vignetting. Thanks for the tips!"
photocritique,3bsz10,diesel828,-3,Thu Jul 2 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"But it's blurred, so it wouldn't be as much of a distraction as a blown highlight, for example. But that you have a large, red object chunked at the edge of the frame makes it distracting."
photocritique,3bsz10,SantiagoAndDunbar,-2,Thu Jul 2 16:58:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter. The cake is much darker than the girl's face, so it's not going to be that big a distraction if it's entirely in the frame. AND it gives the photo context, like the little girl is just about ready to dive into some sweets. The argument can be made that the look on her face is happy anticipation for the slice that's about to come. For that reason alone, it should be entirely in the frame, or completely gone. Not cut in half."

The colors, the lighting, the casual setting and the model and facial expression are great. But I do think it would be even better with a longer lens.  Why? Because the image is all about her face and her expression. The background, the context, the room, the cake add nothing. The arm adds nothing and even distracts my attention away from the face. Her arm looks a bit withered and atrophied IMHO, likely because of the lens perspective.  An 85mm lens wide open would throw the couch in the background completely out of focus, and you wouldn't recognize what it is at all.  Now, I think the 24mm would make a bit more sense if her arms were at her sides, maybe bent on her hips, with her shoulders parallel to the film plane. Then the wide lens would exaggerate the size of her head, which is now closer to the lens, which would complement her face painting in giving the shot an exaggerated vibe. The wide lens would be adding to the story.  This is all just subjective opinion, of course."

There's something youthful about him, the shorts the haircut but there is also a sense of pain, something evoked with the time of day, that last little bit of sun.   It would be interesting to see this in context with some other images that flesh out a world for this person.  Photography like this works best in series where the images can work off each other.

This makes the snow here look grey and unnatural.  An image like this doesn't need a whole lot of retouching.  It should be able to stand on its own without a bunch of tacky post processing, so I'm glad you haven't done too much.  Otherwise contrast, exposure and color balance are all pretty much spot on.  In general I'd encourage you to shoot in more interesting light.  Midday sun just doesn't make for that compelling pictures."
photocritique,3bvqi2,EtArcadia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely didn't want to over-do anything. All my retouching was exposure, contrast, color, and tone. I did mess with the snow and I don't like it either. Does it look over sharpened to you?"
photocritique,3bvqi2,EtArcadia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"To me, it looks just right in terms of sharpness here, but I without seeing the full resolution file I can say for sure."
photocritique,3bvqi2,el_ocho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:50:39 2015 UTC,The snow in the foreground is grey even though it doesn't appear to be in shadow making it look unnatural
photocritique,3buik5,HawaiiSunshine,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"I was out with some buddies who were fishing at night on the Eastern most cliffs of Oahu when I stumbled across this lava tube. I was expecting to take some shots of the milky way while we were out there, but the lava tube definitely made this shot unique. If you would like to check out the rest of the post it is on my website: https://hawaiisunshine.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/night-fishing-on-east-oahu/ The shot was taken with a introductory DSLR Nikon D5300 at 1600 ISO shutter speed 20sec with the Tokina 11- 16mm lens at 11mm and f/2.8 I was pleasantly surprised with the result and would love any feedback on how to improve as I am a complete newb at this."
photocritique,3buik5,anneewannee,3,Thu Jul 2 06:55:19 2015 UTC,"I much prefer the same shot without the person.  It might just be personal preference, but I find that bright light very distracting.  Really cool find though, the lava tube frames the milky way perfectly."

photocritique,3bwxqv,t-bone_malone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"I think the composition is swell, though I'm puzzled by the squiggly red lights. What would have caused those?   If possible (I don't know the location), it might have helped to back up and then zoom in; this would let you get rid of the distracting yellow building with blue stripes on the right of the frame.   Also, this is totally personal preference, but I'm not liking the sunstars around the lights. You could get a 5-stop ND filter and shoot at f/4 and they'd go away. Up to you, of course."

photocritique,3bv8mu,gam8it,3,Thu Jul 2 12:48:02 2015 UTC,"The idea is really cool, but there's a few changes I would make.  1) Give the picture more breathing room, which in case would mean having more empty ""sky-space."" Right now the composition has pretty good rhythm and a nice natural point of focus (a little right of center), but the photo could be more interesting if there was more breathing room, and therefore, more contrast between the branches and the sky.  2) Commit to either deliberate under exposure or correct exposure for the branches. The branches are a bit underexposed, but not to the point to where they look completely black. Either have them be full silhouettes that add geometry to the pic, or allow them to have some color and texture. (Either way, I think the flowers should be a bit brighter).  3) Zoom in more to bring out the blossoms. Right now the blossoms are too small and make the photo look cluttered. You could zoom in so that they look more recognizable as flowers. This might be done at the loss of the interesting composition created by the branches and trunks, so you'd have to be clever about the framing.  But yeah, this photo has a lot of potential!"

photocritique,3bvrx0,MrMason007,2,Thu Jul 2 15:35:26 2015 UTC,Solid shot man. I'd like to see it from a lower perspective. The blending of the background and the ocean is beautiful.
photocritique,3bvrx0,lawlpaul,2,Thu Jul 2 16:11:41 2015 UTC,"Would tilt a bit to straighten out the (admittedly) vague line between the sea and the fog, and would crop top bit to have a wider aspect ratio. Neat shot though."
photocritique,3bsqgu,dimi7rof,6,Wed Jul 1 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"You know, the more I look at this the more I like it.  It's got a bunch of technical problems, but it's interesting because of them not in spite of them.  It's pretty reminiscent of some of Florian Maier-Aichen's stuff in the way that the technological mixes with the sublime.    That being said, if you're a beginner I'd recommend getting a handle on you're equipment before getting too experimental.  This looks like a soft image, due to focus or camera blur or something else, that has been over sharpened.  That or it's suffering from the effects of the HDR frames being out of alignment.  You also have some pretty significant red/green fringing going on at the edges of the frame (most visible in the leaves that appear on the right).    Take note of the odd black lines and dots that appear when looking closely on the left.  I don' know what these are, maybe crud on the sensor?  In any case they should be spotted out.  The color balance is all over the place, it's part of what I like about the image, but given some of the other technical problems, one gets the sense this was not intentional."
photocritique,3bsqgu,EtArcadia,6,Wed Jul 1 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"The scenery is nice, you have a wonderful palette of colours here. The foreground colors seemed in an interesting shade of red/orange, so I would have framed that photo slightly down, with less sky. (and/or shot it vertically). Maybe sharpen a little bit too."
photocritique,3bsqgu,Magic_Baguette,4,Wed Jul 1 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"Easy on the vibrance\saturation there, buddy"
photocritique,3bsqgu,AWildAnonHasAppeared,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:57:20 2015 UTC,This is really nit-picky but that lens is really soft beyond f/11 due to diffraction. I would recommend shooting landscapes with it at around f/5.6-8 for a sharper image out of camera. Aside from that the composition isn't bad but to me it's a bit boring. I'd like to see some more of the hills and a foreground that is different from the rest of the hills would benefit it a lot.

photocritique,3brnx1,ParticleSpinClass,6,Wed Jul 1 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"Nice color, sharp, well captured. I think the horizon is too low in the frame, especially given the fact that the sky just fades to black. This is the perfect wallpaper image, especially for phones."
photocritique,3brnx1,MajorSuccess,3,Wed Jul 1 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know... it doesn't just fade to black; those pinpoint stars in the black sky really help make the photo, I think."
photocritique,3brnx1,FatherOfPharaohs,4,Wed Jul 1 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Maybe he's viewing at too low of a resolution (which the stars would get knocked out of). There are definitely stars up there :)  EDIT: Here's a full-res, full-quality upload of the photo. Lots of stars there :)"
photocritique,3brnx1,MajorSuccess,3,Wed Jul 1 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"I guess I should rephrase what I meant - the stars don't stand out that much. I'm using my Mac monitor that I use for photo editing, and realized they were stars... but right now, they don't act as a crucial part of the image. It's pretty clear that the main subject of the image is the silhouetted mountains with the sunrise/sunset in the background, and there's really nothing that pulls our eye upwards to the top to notice the stars.   All that being said, regardless of whether the stars are there, I still think the horizon is too low. There aren't enough stand out, bright stars at the very top to make it that interesting, so your eye will quickly go back down to the mountain/water. Again, this is just my opinion as a complete neutral viewer."
photocritique,3brnx1,ToxicKnight6,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:09:27 2015 UTC,"Fair points. And yeah, the stars aren't particularly bright. Not much I can do in post that I didn't already :/"

photocritique,3buwyd,likesduckies,2,Thu Jul 2 10:22:57 2015 UTC,"There is not enough negative space around the subject, either to provide any context to the situation and/or place the squirrel on a thirds point or line via crop.  So too close in - also it looks a little blurry - perhaps there is some camera shake, though at 1/1000 I'd not expect that. Perhaps a lower shutter speed with a narrower aperture (for more depth of field) would have been better.  Lastly I would have probably over exposed the shot a little to make sure the squirrel was brighter, then brought the rocks down a little in post."

photocritique,3bwgkk,PonchoKitty,3,Thu Jul 2 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with no.  You might be able to do something interesting with it in a composite context, but on its own it just isn't a technically good image, and there isn't any compelling reason / point of interest to justify the abstraction.  We've all seen blurry, grainy, badly-color-balanced images before--to me this doesn't communicate any idea, show me anything interesting, or satisfy me in any purely aesthetic way.  If you're trying for something different than that, maybe.  And if you personally disagree with #3, mazeltov.  But I wouldn't count on selling it in a gallery any time soon."
photocritique,3bwgkk,I_tinerant,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:49:17 2015 UTC,"I found it just now when i was going through my pictures on my old camera that i like and thought it fairly good. I was curious so I decided to post it on reddit. It does look cool as a desktop background though  I'm satisfied anyways with your comment, at least it isn't a completely horrible picture and is on the lesser side of Mediocre or just a bad pic."
photocritique,3bwgkk,EtArcadia,2,Thu Jul 2 18:51:27 2015 UTC,"From a technical point of view this isn't even close, it contains essentially every problem an image can have: both under and over exposed, out of focus, motion blur, grain, etc.    From my perspective it's also painful to look at at a large size.  All that being said, there's something interesting about it.  It has all these artifacts of the digital process, that we see less and less these days as cameras get better.  In the same way that people like to make their digital photos look like film using filters, this has a nostalgic feel.  Nevertheless, if you're still working on your photographic technique you should focus on getting a technically correct image before getting too conceptual."
photocritique,3bwgkk,b33fm8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:21:21 2015 UTC,I want to know because a lot of the stuff i think is good or cool looking are actually stupid.
photocritique,3bwgkk,b33fm8,0,Thu Jul 2 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"i think images like this can work for sure. im all for more experimental processes and interesting colors in images, but this doesnt hit the mark because it really shows lazyness. it doesnt seem to me like the effects are purposeful, rather that they randomly happened and this is what you got."
photocritique,3bra5b,dolfan311,2,Wed Jul 1 14:47:13 2015 UTC,I like the subject but it feels just a bit off balance to me. I think if you had composed it so that the waterfall fell on the left third line it would have been better composed and also would have allowed for better framing of the waterfall since the rock wall on the right would be more prominent.
photocritique,3bra5b,carbs109,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:30:49 2015 UTC,I can totally see that now. Thanks for the comment!
photocritique,3bra5b,EtArcadia,2,Wed Jul 1 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"There's a good deal of camera motion blur in this shot which you've tried to compensate for with some heavy sharpening but it doesn't look good up close.  We don't have the metadata so I can't comment on your settings, but if you're shooting without a tripod you need to keep your shutter speed up and compensate by raising your ISO.    You are also getting some purple fringing around the trees.  This can be removed with some lens correction filters.  Otherwise, lovely light and strong composition."

Lets say change your shirt to something less distracting and maybe move the mirror or angle to really frame yourself in there.  I really like the concept as it feels like this setup would work well for a normal portrait but you then create some interest by having yourself trapped in the mirror. Nice shot!"

My bathroom is very small so I was trying to get myself as centered in the mirror with my head completely in the brighter background and without any of my body part popping out around the corner and into the frame.

Actually, quite a number of people have said I looked like Leehom Wang (some Chinese celebrity).  My camera was in front of the center of the picture (pointing perpendicular to the wall). It was actually the only place I could put it because the camera was in the doorway. I had it on a tripod and then set a 10 second timer, so I had to move every time I took a picture. It took several shots to get myself perfectly in the mirror without my arm or shoulder getting directly into the field of view of the camera and to look not awkward in the picture... Haha.    In other words, I was standing left enough of the mirror so that I can be in the reflection since the camera was right of the mirror."

photocritique,3bte41,champagnepupi,2,Thu Jul 2 00:09:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it just kind of looks like a shot of something fun you did on vacation. nothing about the composition really jumps out at me. the left of the frame seems very heavy for your subject to be right in the middle.  moving your subject to the right might have created balance with the trees on the left. or leaving the subject where he is and walking to where the trees more or less ""envelop"" him.  Your highlights seem a little overexposed, but that might work here. That might be a style thing, I guess.   It's pretty late here, so i'm questioning my eyes right now, but it seems like your subjects face isn't quite in focus either."
photocritique,3bte41,JitteryPenguin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with your comments. And I personally think the photo would look better without the person in it. Without him, the photo would be a pretty neat modern yet natural composition, with the straight tree trunks along the left and bottom of the frame and then the rounded trees on the right."

Personally, I kinda like the imbalance but that might just be me trying to defend my photo lol. As for the focus, I'm working on it. My autofocus broke and I think my eyesight might not be as good as I used to think it was because focusing is really hard for some reason. But thank you! I'll keep working on my photos"

photocritique,3br7un,Hubblesphere,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"my eye can't decide where to look. should I look at the car? or the people. or maybe the road. the subject matter of your photo seems very spread out, but doesn't fill enough of the frame to make the whole shot interesting.  shooting this from the left side of the car toward the visitors faces might have made this an interesting shot."
photocritique,3br7un,JitteryPenguin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"After I posted it, I thought I should crop in tighter. Maybe move the car more to the left of the frame. I feel like the road leads the eyes to the people and the car. Can a picture have 2 subjects? I usually like to photograph the people around the cars. I think it adds more character, but I can see where it could be distracting occasionally."
photocritique,3bryp7,RP_Photo,3,Wed Jul 1 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that what's focused is what draws attention. In other words, what's focused must be one of the key parts of your composition. Here it could have been the ""destination"" (the road in the background) or the ""vehicle"" (the car at the end of the light trails, with the help of some rear curtain sync flash), but the foreground grass ? meh."
photocritique,3bryp7,Magic_Baguette,2,Wed Jul 1 22:13:40 2015 UTC,"You don't need to shoot with such a wide aperture. The grass is the only thing in focus and you clearly wanted to light road/to be sharper. The portion of the photo that is in focus is so small—tucked away in the front corner. The widest aperture isn't always the best. Not to mention, a more narrow aperture would have lessened the exposure to the flash—which is too much, in my opinion."
photocritique,3bryp7,awhaling,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:33:26 2015 UTC,"Light trails tend to work better as leading lines or secondary/other interest in a composition. Because the trails take all of the interest in the photo, they become the subject and so the actual 'process' of capturing the photo is put into the viewer's mind - basically the image says ""look at my cool light trails I captured at long exposure"" rather than ""look at my interesting composition which features a strong subject complimented by powerful secondary elements.""  The capture process shouldn't be a part of the picture unless you can work them in as seamless elements to make up a compositional ""whole."" Same goes for long exposure flowing water, star trails, pedestrians walking etc. Make them part of the picture but not THE picture."

Some warm is re-added via gradient filter to the helmet from the right but not much maybe like +5 er so.

photocritique,3brjgh,gjgroess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:26:15 2015 UTC,Colours need to be toned down and for me the left hand side is a little busy so maybe a crop.  Also if the colours look balanced on your monitor/TV you might want to calibrate it.

photocritique,3brikq,gjgroess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:50:53 2015 UTC,Try using a different HDR process for this shot the halos and blow outs hurt the image  you might try EnfuseGUI
photocritique,3brikq,TheZenEffect,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"HDR shouldn't look like HDR if it's done right. It should broaden the entire signature of the image without adding damaging elements like haloes, light patches or flattening. Try capturing as much as you can in one image and reset and reconfigure by looking at your histogram in real time. HDR should rarely be used and even then it should be in severe moderation and not to the point that the image suffers rather than gains from the effect. One solid image is far, far better than 3 different exposures patched together. Look at any webinar for landscape photography and you'll notice that most pro's all do the same thing: try to catch as much detail and exposure in one shot as they can."

photocritique,3bpxn8,ExcitedBurritos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"To add to the above, the woman behind your main subject is a little distracting. If she had not been in frame (waited until she stepped away), there would be more separation between your main subject and the background."
photocritique,3br7tl,jackbauer616,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"The issue for me here is subject isolation. You have a green plant on a green background and everything is in focus because you stopped down for the long exposure. if you used a strong ND filter and shot at a wider aperture (possibly a different focal length, including details of your shot can help!) you could seperate the plant from the water and still keep it milky.  The plant is also a bit short on space at the top, shooting from a slightly lower angle may have added some drama and sense of depth and movement to the shot."

photocritique,3br7tl,photosoflife,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"What to think about before you take the shot depends on what you want the shot to say, find the narrative before you take the photo.  With this instance we have a young plant battling to survive in the middle of a stream, the picture should reflect this, yes the milky water looks nifty - let it work as a supporting element and not fill the photo. Also, work with your editing to try and allow the colours to build composition, adjust the white balance and colour saturation to allow the plant to stand out more."

photocritique,3bqvcb,photosoflife,3,Wed Jul 1 12:30:09 2015 UTC,"it's not a bad image of light, shape and colour and your eye isn't bad.  But, if you're going to do a photograph that implies symmetry, it has to be perfect. liveview with a grid and a tripod will make your life a heck of a lot easier.   Use the perspective correction tools as a starting point in lightroom, then bring it into photoshop and use rulers, transform tools and layers to make everything perfect.  If I was being really harsh I would say there isn't enough of a subject or aesthetic interest to make this a real keeper, the vignette is a bit naff and i feel it may benefit from more depth of field and texture on the lit areas, I would also consider black and white for a shot of this nature.  Please don't read my post in a negative light, I'm probably one of the harshest critics you will see around here, but I don't give advice for people I don't think show promise and your last 2 photos have definitely shown you have an eye for composition and light, the 2 most important things for a photographer.

photocritique,3bpr14,dahizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:32:31 2015 UTC,"The reason behind it it was that this was shot a morning after a sand storm so the background was pretty hazy. My thought was a narrower DOF would work better,  I could be wrong :)"

photocritique,3bpr14,TheZenEffect,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:55:18 2015 UTC,"Why black and white? There are no interesting textures that are highlighted or juxtaposed in the picture and your reflections would still be present in the water. If you had either gotten up earlier or went later in the evening the sky would have been more interesting and the colours and lights of Dubai would have really shone. The composition isn't bad but the light, and maybe colour as a subjective option, could have been so much better."

The colors are clearly edited, I just liked the mood the color toning had and reducing the number of colors in general. I felt black and white was a bit dull. Hardly any contrast and no ""light changing"" filters have been used though, the light was really good, occational showers were around. I've really tried to restrict the number of levers that I pushed. But I know the feeling, if it feels overedited, it feels overedited. Any comments on the composition?"
photocritique,3bn3qv,Systral,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like it is a bit overshadowed, having an even bigger emphasis on the sun beam.

photocritique,3bn9qn,ExcitedBurritos,2,Wed Jul 1 17:18:20 2015 UTC,Nice light bursts from the streetlamps and yet none from the similarly bright headlights? This immediately screams that it's a mix-match of images and throws the viewer off. The glow around the front of the car looks unnatural and the vehicle itself attracts too much attention away from your interesting subject. It's a nice concept but all of the elements don't mix well together and the composition as pretty poor. Maybe one to try again?

It was a really tight turnaround, so all the art directing that would happen on a normal piece kind of dissolved.   The final piece that was published to social cropped the street light out, since the client requested there be no starbursts on the car's lights.  I looked at it as a fair challenge, since the piece was intended as social content.

Thanks again for the comments and glad you liked what you did! I got the a5000 as my first camera in december and have been trying my hand since then."
photocritique,3bk1nz,mrjb3,2,Tue Jun 30 02:38:32 2015 UTC,Adobe Lightroom can automatically correct that distortion. It has an auto correct profile for a5000 with kit lens.

photocritique,3bmryg,carbs109,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly? It kinda hurts my eyes to look at. Seems like you're trying to save a mildly interesting photo by adding a lot of color. Don't mean to sound harsh at all, but aside from the rainbow (and even then, you've taken away the core component of the rainbow - varying color), the content isn't very intriguing.   If you're looking for post help, I'm not sure what your technique was other than to raise the vibrance and saturation."
photocritique,3bmryg,MajorSuccess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:09:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I was kind of going for a dream-like/fantasy aesthetic and attempted to make the rainbow look more like another planet in close proximity. Probably easier to just do some compositing to achieve this effect but I figured I would give it a shot through Lightroom sliders.
photocritique,3bmval,momentswithfeathers,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:29:56 2015 UTC,I used to skate the 7 stairs that's there between the buildings. Great photo though.

photocritique,3bmukk,Grenar,2,Tue Jun 30 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"An almost perfect natural frame. It's overexposed, in this case it's better to underexpose imho, because the eye is drawn toward the center of the picture."
photocritique,3bmukk,opant1234,0,Tue Jun 30 15:30:58 2015 UTC,I don't know how to expose yet. I don't know what meter to use here.
photocritique,3bmukk,ExcitedBurritos,2,Tue Jun 30 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"I would split my critique of this in to two parts, composition and technical. Technically, you should look into the exposure triangle. http://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/ you are at F29 and at ISO 3200.  You are losing a lot of sharpness and color because of the higher iso and to small an aperture.  Most lenses are in their sweet spot between 5.6 and 8 so if you were to go down to f8 and that would give ~4 stops to drop the ISO to 200 or so?  then you could use http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html to figure out how to get what you want in focus.  You would then have the same exposure, but better colors, more dynamic range, and possibly a sharper photo.  composition wise, it is a nice frame, it leads you to a point in the picture with leading and converging lines, but what is the payoff? you blew out the highlights so i cannot see what is at the end of the lines.  as /u/grenar said, if you were to underexpose the image a bit you could get some of that detail in and we could get the payoff at the top.  And this will come off as harsher then I intend it.  Don't fall into the #nofilter trap, don't say RAW no edit.  Nearly every famous photo you know or admire was edited, learn to edit.  Musicians go over a song a thousands times, painters refine the painting, programmers fix their code and photographers edit.  Getting it right in camera is hugely important, but even the perfect shot in camera can usually benefit from some editing."
photocritique,3bkjba,Shoopieshoop,3,Mon Jun 29 23:44:07 2015 UTC,Could've been a lot cooler if you leveled out the picture and had the divide going straight down the middle
photocritique,3bkjba,femio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"Nice, very nice. Perhaps you could play around with different crops, you might be able to balance the image?"
photocritique,3bnk5i,Shoopieshoop,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:28:39 2015 UTC,Removed the orange chromatic aberrations around the leaves and applied a tiny amount of image tilting
photocritique,3bnk5i,Jignheng,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Not a pro here, but I find the tree at the one third position on the right distracting. It is kinda at the position where you expect it to be the main subject but there are nothing about it that stand out as the subject. So it just become distracting."
photocritique,3bjunt,Dinodude101,2,Mon Jun 29 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"the colours are certainly pleasing! Nice juxtaposition of complementary colours to make the subject pop.   I feel like the subject should occupy more of the frame, but what you did emphasizes the scale of the bug and the emptiness, so I think it works to break the rules in this regard.  Also the bug is nicely placed and looking into the frame. All in all, I think there's more right with the photo than wrong. It's well executed :)"

photocritique,3bjunt,Onlylikesblades,2,Tue Jun 30 01:52:57 2015 UTC,"The majority of how the picture looks actually came from perfect lighting and good composition. The most extreme edit I did was brush some sharpening on the bug and reduce the shadows a bit to make it stand out a bit more, which is to say not that extreme. Other than that is pretty standard stuff like contrast, vibrancy, tone curves and the like. Though I did add some blues and magentas to it since the original image was a yellow-ish green color."

photocritique,3bk9cd,madeinthewild,2,Mon Jun 29 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"actually, I like that the face is cut off. It makes the image about the tattoo and artist and not about the person getting the tattoo. Really cool perspective and lighting. I think the light areas could be a touch lighter to bring a greater sense of balance, tonally. It's edging a bit too far to the dark side IMO.  Even so, great shot! I love it"

photocritique,3bk9cd,sub-merge,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:37:34 2015 UTC,Not much though...maybe not even at all. Give it a shot and see though :) Good job!
photocritique,3bk9cd,mrs_pots,2,Mon Jun 29 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/madeinthewild!   I was looking at this photo for a while and then I flipped through your albums on Flickr. You have a nice photostream. Below are some questions and observations about this photo and how it was cropped.  Things I notice the more I look at the photo: converse shoes (yours?), some object on the baseboard on the bottom right third of the frame, a faint object in the top left corner. Believe me, if I've been looking at a photo for this long, it means I like it. That being said, I think you could burn/dodge these distractions or be more mindful of them when framing the photo with the camera (distractions in my opinion).  Questions/things to think about: See what happens when you crop to make the tattoo artist even more of ""the hero"" of the shot. Is that tattoo gun dead center? What happens when the client's torso is parallel to the frame? What happens when the tattoo artist's forearm (on the left side of the photo) is parallel to the frame? What happens when the client's body spans from corner to corner."
photocritique,3bij5g,gamma-ray-bursts,5,Mon Jun 29 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"Nice, but boring. There's no real subject matter or much depth here. I would tone back the highlight though as it looks like you have some white clipping in your lower left quadrant."
photocritique,3bij5g,Akhalyndra,3,Mon Jun 29 15:02:21 2015 UTC,But... But the colors are so pretty...
photocritique,3bij5g,sub-merge,2,Mon Jun 29 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah to add to what Akhalyndra said, texture and pattern are rarely enough on their own. You may say it's abstract, but since we can tell they're umbrellas, it's not an abstract photograph.  Try looking for something to break the pattern and give context to the image."
photocritique,3bij5g,austapasta,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"It really leads me to look at the left side. That would be fine, but there's not much of a subject to look at. It would be a lot more aesthetically pleasing if it either had a subject or led your eyes towards the center."
photocritique,3bij5g,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"You've got some blown out highlights on the left side which given the time and effort obviously spent on setting this up just shouldn't be there.    Overall, aside from the technical problems, this has a stock photography vibe, it's superficial and doesn't have much subtext.  It  might work as a background for something, but doesn't stand on its own."

I took tonnes of pictures of him, and I think this is my favourite that didn't have someones head or iPhone impinging on it.... I'm a little concerned it's a bit empty other than him, but perhaps that's the whole point!  Any comments or criticism would be very welcome indeed."

photocritique,3blrp4,sub-merge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:37:10 2015 UTC,"What was your shutter speed on that shot? I would still use say 1/200 and see if that helps. Most landscape photographers will use tripods, even during the day and a cable release to prevent potential camera shake.  There is some variation in lenses, so it could be that you got a slightly soft version of the 11-16."
photocritique,3blrp4,TimePressure,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:08:04 2015 UTC,"If you used a quick shutter speed for this shot, i guess the lens is not centered correctly (i.e. some lenses are not positioned correctly). I suggest returning it, if you have that option. If not, contact customer support."
photocritique,3bhx1w,captain_proton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:46:58 2015 UTC,Looks good for the equipment you are using. No flash i presume? Some purple/green hue on the ladybird that can be easily fixed. All in all a very nice picture.
photocritique,3bhx1w,rusology,2,Mon Jun 29 12:43:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate your comment a lot! That purple/green hue can be fixed on Lightroom I'm guessing? Yeah no flash, and I don't have an dedicated macro lens unfortunately. I was using a Raynox 250 attachment."
photocritique,3bhx1w,rusology,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yeap it is in LR - Lens correction - Color - Defringe. The raynox will take you a long way so it is good enough till you decide you want to spend more time with bugs/flowers. I used extension tubes for sometime before getting a macro lens. I would say a flash is more important than a lens if you want to improve. A flash and homemade diffuser is paramount. I tried without flash for a long time but then the quality of pics will depend on harsh sunlight, anything darker than that gets hard. You can pm me if you need more info on anything specific :)  You can view my pics here"
photocritique,3bii6w,leftlooserighttight,2,Mon Jun 29 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like lacks from too much negative space paired with too little contrast because it's so obscured by fog.

photocritique,3bii6w,ParticleSpinClass,3,Mon Jun 29 20:16:24 2015 UTC,The composition as it is leads your eyes into the white area above the antenna you almost miss the building
photocritique,3bii6w,Kh444n,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"I can see what you mean. My take on it, though, is that the spire is the subject of the photo, especially since the building is partially obscured."
photocritique,3bii6w,ParticleSpinClass,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting, it really minimizes the height of the building. I think a portrait orientation might help emphasize its verticality, but maybe you're actively going against that. I also think playing with contrast might help, since the fog is muting the body of the building but not the antenna.  As a side note, just so you know, the building is called One World Trade Center, not Freedom Tower."
photocritique,3bii6w,Silver_kitty,0,Mon Jun 29 19:24:12 2015 UTC,Almost perfect. Play with some vertical and horizontal distortion here to make the building a little more squared up with the frame. The colors and everything else is good otherwise.

photocritique,3biokt,bent_over_curls,2,Mon Jun 29 15:27:22 2015 UTC,I would just sharpen it up a bit and try to remove some of the chromatic aberration left frame.
photocritique,3biokt,Akhalyndra,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Watch out for the fringing on the rocks on the left, I'd get rid of it in PS.  I also feel like the out of focus patch of grass in the extreme foreground is distracting.    The original image is just too dark.  It looks underexposed.  u/Xfocus has offered an alternate processing scheme here, but I have to say that I don't like either.  Something in between would probably work.  Overall it's a little dull.  I don't know what kind of competition NatGeo is running but in general the kind of photography you see from the them is higher impact.  This is a nice moment, but is lacking something to set it off and help it rise above the snap shot."
photocritique,3biokt,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:40:46 2015 UTC,"It's pretty flat, which makes the image look and feel dull (even though it's not). I think you're on the right track with the whole dark and brooding, misty type image, but the people are at an awkward exposure. They aren't bright enough to stand out from the rest of the image, but they're also not silhouetted. Instead, you're losing a massive amount of detail, and they don't pop whatsoever.   Compositionally, though, I think is where the changes could be made. For one, the subjects are just a little bit off center - not enough to put them on a third, but far enough that they're very clearly not directly in the middle. It's very noticeable, and could be remedied by cropping some parts of the image. It would probably make the most sense to crop some of the empty space off the right side of the image, but you could crop the rocks off the left side I guess. The other main issue I have is the distracting and OOF patch of grass in the bottom left corner. It serves no real purpose, except to act as a distraction. I understand you were probably trying to show DOF, but since it stands alone in the bottom of the frame with nothing else OOF, it doesn't add anything at all.   Aside from that, little things like cleaning up the chromatic abberation and sharpening things up (as /u/Akhalyndra mentioned) will make things generally better. I think you've got potential for a nice image, but it could definitely use some tweaking, and could use some tips for next time."
photocritique,3biokt,MajorSuccess,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:03:02 2015 UTC,"This is a great capture!  I feel that the post-processing isn't quite doing it justice.

You can likely do better than my attempt if you have the original RAW image:  https://i.imgur.com/IAh8Z6Q.jpg"
photocritique,3biokt,Xfocus,2,Mon Jun 29 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"I spent some time on it when I took it and at one point had it looking like you've got it there, but I felt that where it's at now really represents the colours/tones of the rocks and the hill itself, as it was still fairly misty at that point! I guess it's a trade off between staying true to the conditions or making the photo perfect, and I have to decide with all the car pictures I take regularly!   Thank you so much for the feedback though :)"
photocritique,3biokt,sub-merge,2,Mon Jun 29 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with the post processing, specifically the huge white blotch in the left.

Good job and good luck in the competition."
photocritique,3biokt,ParticleSpinClass,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's always a challenge deciding whether or not to over-process to make the photo look better, or stay true to the original scene."

Your horizons are horizontal and your subject is in focus.  I also enjoy the background, it's refreshing to see the lemon in its natural habitat :p opposed to the white background that one usually sees when a photographer does one of these.  You edited this well as well. It really looks like you did your research!  Since this is photocritique, I think what I would really love to see you experiment with a few more shots at different angles in order to really nail the composition. You've done so much right with this already, and I know these are hard work. All in all, great job!"

If you have 19 more, then you have a portfolio."""
photocritique,3bh1c6,oblisk,2,Mon Jun 29 12:10:49 2015 UTC,"This is awesome!   My only suggestion would be to do this against a less busy background   (maybe just plain white, or plain black) so that more attention can be paid to the lemon. :)"
photocritique,3bh1c6,kwmcmillan,5,Mon Jun 29 06:43:01 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. I think the setting adds a unique element to the image, as well as fulfilling the aim of ""looking at normal stuff differently"" in a more natural way than if it were to be shot on a seamless. Dragons are cool, dragons in castles are cooler."
photocritique,3bh1c6,Vomitclaw,6,Mon Jun 29 10:33:47 2015 UTC,"I understand liking the background for context. I do like that context, But the background is busy because of where he framed it in relation to the Lemon.   If the lemon was all against the white tile, or the cabinets i think you have a stronger image than straddling the two background elements."

I set this up by untwisting a metal coat hanger, feeding it through the lemon, then kind of bending the ends up into little feet to keep it upright. Took one shot with the lemons up then knocked them out of the way and snapped another to layer in photoshop. And to answer a question...I'm definitely planning a better composed follow up shot."

photocritique,3bjegz,bazke,3,Mon Jun 29 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"I think you did well, especially for a photo with your phone. Phones can get down to F/2.4 now?! That's surprising actually. As for the focal length, I think there might be an error. 40mm sounds more realistic. 4mm would be insanely fish eye.  As for the composition you did several things right! Your horizon line isn't dissecting the image right through the middle, you chose to focus more on the sky and got enough detail with the silhouette of you and your bike. I think it works great. I also like that it isn't post processed like crazy. It feels natural and not fake.  Now, some things that can be improved:   It's so so important to get that horizon line straight. It makes the viewer feel off balance, dizzy and it's just generally not a good look. Straightening it out will help the image composition. Keep an eye for things touching the frame because they carry a lot of visual weight. I think the composition is relatively balanced but the mound of land touching the frame to the left has a lot of visual weight for a few reasons. 1) it's high contrast and 2) it's right up against the frame. I think the composition would be stronger without it.    Good job man, minor nitpicks really."
photocritique,3bjegz,sub-merge,2,Mon Jun 29 22:05:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm not 100% sure what you mean by touching the frame, is it that the hill is kind of just broken apart in the middle? If so, looking at the picture I really see what you mean. It would look a lot better if it wasn't there, or flattened out towards the water at the edge. But on the right side it's not as annoying, maybe because it seems to continue in a flat line?  Are there any tricks except Photoshop to help with the touching frame-issue? There are many beautiful places in the Stockholm archipelago but it's also littered with small islands.  As for not being processed, the original post is actually the picture straight from my phone! No editing or silly filters at all :).  And about the focal length you are probably right, I just copied from the details tab in windows. Maybe something wrong with the phone. F/2.4 - isn't it amazing what phones can do these days? And this model (Nexus 5) isn't even marketed as a picture phone as far as I know.  Not an excuse, but an explanation about the horizon line - I didn't plan on taking any pictures and I had to grab some pieces of wood to make a makeshift monopod :-) I have signed up for a photo marathon later this summer, and this really inspired me to learn more so I have ordered a proper tripod!  I would also like to give a shoutout to /u/keithj5000 from /r/photoshoprequest for editing the picture (and fixing the horizon problem), to look like this."
photocritique,3bjegz,sub-merge,3,Mon Jun 29 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"yeah that edit did it!! Actually now I don't mind that lump of land ""touching the frame"" to the far left. It balances out the image.  Compositional balance is one of the most overlooked aspects of composition in my opinion, but one of the most important.  Before taking a photo do a quick trace around the frame to see what, if anything, is touching the frame. Things close to the edge of the frame of the photo have a huge amount of visual weight and should be placed with care.  See this link for a more in depth read.  Good luck with the photo marathon!"

photocritique,3bjegz,greybyte,2,Mon Jun 29 23:14:23 2015 UTC,F 2.4 isn't all that uncommon for phone cameras. The focal length is so short that you still end up with a huge depth of field though. They also generally use a fixed aperture.   4mm is correct. On such a small sensor that's a normal focal length. They often times have a crop factor somewhere in the 7-10 range.

What I would like to understand more about is the composition. I kind of understand that leading the viewer in to the picture by having objects closer/further away is a good skill, so I used bike->me->sun for that. Maybe going far away in the left, and near in the right is the wrong way for us westeners? Here is the picture reversed, I think I like it better, but I wanted to post the non-edited version.

To people who look at a lot of photographs this degree of yellow cast does not give off a industrial vibe, it looks like the color balance is off.  That isn't to say you have to use exact color balance, a subtle shift can create the mood you're looking for, but this is too far in may opinion."

Generally you'd want to follow the rule of thirds and place either the sky in the top 2/3rds or the ground, but with reflections, the 50/50 really works. I might crop a tiny bit of the sky so people know you did the 50/50 intentionally and it wasn't a mistake.  Most importantly though, your horizon needs to be straightened because if throws the balance off towards the left."

Knowing when your piece is finished without overdoing it. That being said, this photograph may have benefited from being two separate photographs. Maybe a straight on of the mural with the people sitting on the bench and then one looking down the alley?  I cropped the photo in a way that makes it a little easier for the eye to travel through the photo and changed the levels a bit so that the shadows on the ground are more visible.

photocritique,3bkzhi,oceanswell,3,Tue Jun 30 02:00:57 2015 UTC,Nothing about this photo is remotely in focus. Your shutterspeed was way too slow. Judging by your settings you might want to read up on the basics of photography. Absolutely none of these settings make any sense. Why would you have a polarizing filter on inside? F29?
photocritique,3bk51e,helensis_,2,Mon Jun 29 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"It's great that you're taking the time to practice and get to know your camera. That being said... what are we looking at? Don't mean to sound harsh, but catching light trails is only a small part of long exposure photography (and in plenty of cases, not important whatsoever). You need a subject, which this image is absolutely lacking. Sometimes, the movement is your subject, but it needs to be a primary part of the image. Long exposures can add interest or feeling to an otherwise dull environment (ignore the horrible selective coloring here, not my image), or can add the typical light trails to a city scene. But this seems like we're looking at a parked car, and the light trails still feel static and don't add any sense of movement.  Keep practicing, though - that's the most important aspect of learning. Apply what you learn to your own work, but make sure you understand what you're trying to do, not just the technical aspects. It's great that you have figured out how to have your camera steady for 8-10 seconds - now your next step is figuring out how to make it look good."
photocritique,3bk51e,MajorSuccess,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"It was a car turning a corner on my street, I know it's nothing special in and of itself, but I was just fiddling about with it really.   I was trying to figure out how to do long exposure photography in the daylight (where I'd be able to get past the ""what am I looking at"" thing) but everything was just... way over exposed because it was letting in so much light for so long. Is it in the aperture? Or the ISO? Or both? I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrow to have another fiddle around."
photocritique,3bk51e,MajorSuccess,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"It's both, and the fact that you need a Neutral Density filter during the day. You should be shooting at ISO 100, anywhere from f/8-f/16, and you should use an ND filter if you plan on anything longer than about 1""."
photocritique,3bk51e,Mattbothell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:18:05 2015 UTC,Pretty much the best way to achieve decent daylight long exposures is with a super low ISO and a Neutral Density Filter (ND Filter) This filter is essentially sunglasses for your camera. It blocks out light so that you can take longer exposures in brighter settings.
photocritique,3bk51e,sub-merge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"So I figured it's high time I got to know my camera, and looked up some tutorials online for long exposure photography. Unfortunately, I don't live in a place that's conducive to going out at night with a £400 piece of technology (I will get stabbed) so I stuck it out of my window and waited for a car to go by.   Couple of issues I ran into:   Autofocus couldn't quite hunt down its prey and so I missed a few opportunities as it was whirring away. It was way too dark for manual focus and I couldn't see what was in focus and what wasn't. The rest of the picture is way too dark.   BUT overall, I'm proud that I managed to actually get this far!"
photocritique,3bk51e,sub-merge,2,Mon Jun 29 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"Look for areas of high contrast to focus somewhere near where you want your focus plane to be. Street lights, illuminated signs...etc  same as 1 if you find an area of high contrast Yes, too dark, too much dark area and the illuminated area doesn't have a clearly defined subject.

photocritique,3bk51e,Radiatron,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:23:15 2015 UTC,"So, the idea of night photography might be appealing to you, but given those constraints, I would focus on other areas until you are able to comfortably and safely take photos at night.  A huge part of photography is working the scene. Meaning trying different perspectives, walking around the subject, different focal lengths..etc.   Choose an area of photography where you can do those things and it will not only make you a better photographer in that area, but in photography in general :)  Even in your room, you can practice night photography by using long shutter speeds and see how your camera responds to different light sources (flashlights, glow sticks..etc)."

photocritique,3bj1pa,sub-merge,3,Mon Jun 29 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"I think the hot spots everywhere are a little distracting to the eye, since the eye is drawn to the brightest parts in the frame.  Posing is somewhat awkward, but that's difficult to overcome without trained models. Specifically, the one foot contorted back looks unnatural and I can't stop focusing on that.  Since you didn't give any meta data information, I am going to assume you used F/5 or greater. I would use a shallower depth of field < F/2.8 if you have it to try and isolate the subject a little more from the background. Those flowers up in the top right carry a lot of visual weight and your eye wants to go there as well because of their vibrancy compared to the rest of the scene.  Great start though, just keep in mind those few little tweaks."

Try and envision slicing your frame into 3 parts diagonally, and 3 parts horizontally. Your subject should lie in an intersection of those lines  • Get out of auto mode - My personal favorite mode to use is Aperture priority mode. I tend to use lower apertures to get shallower depth of field.   • Watch photography videos - I would personally recommend DigitalRevTV on YouTube as they make the experience fun and exiting.   • Learn how to edit your photos - Right now your photos look like they came straight out of the camera. While that is sometimes not bad, I feel like these photos need some extra help. Try messing with the contrast and exposure settings and learn how to read a histogram. It will help you in the long time.   I hope my advice will help you! Good luck!"

photocritique,3bfd7c,Akhalyndra,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Hey Ben!  First off, I love this subject. The colors and shapes are very interesting and exciting.  Technically, I feel like there's some weird distortion or uneven framing happening here. It's hard to get curved anything to look proportional, but I feel like I'm falling to my right looking down this... or maybe my left. It's actually very tough for me to decide because all the lines on the right look straight. I'll let that keep you up at night and not me, haha.  Also, the third light at the very top of the frame is almost sneaking out. This is a small thing for me to point out, but something that I (personally) am instantly drawn to.  Other than those small things, I'm not really sure what to be looking at here. We have some distant people in the background and this really neat building, but something feels so empty and lacking.  Your f/4 aperture seems to be focused right in front of you, at your feet and the very bottom and most empty spot of the picture. Empty space like this can create anxiousness when not balanced with other compositional elements.  If you live near here or plan to go back, I would recommend taking a picture of someone walking through--especially with that colored wall in the background. Or, if you're too shy / are just interested in the building, I would try and get a long exposure shot. Do you have any other photos of this scene? You should always have a few and in different perspectives--especially as a digital photographer!  Anyway, I hope some of that was helpful! Keep shooting!"

I don't think its really necessary to really keep the whole scene in focus and you lose sharpness.   Look at your lens specs here and see how much sharpness you lose at f22. (play with the dials.)    I would personally add some contrast and tweak some other settings. I use lightroom and it pretty much changed the game when I realized what I could do for editing my pics. I use Adobe Lightroom.  If your willing, post the raw and I would show you how I would edit it. If not, download the free trial of lightroom and import your raw, play with the contrast, sharpness, shadows, highlights etc.."
photocritique,3bh8ao,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"The metadata says this is an 8 second exposure so I assume you're using a tripod (a requirement for night shots in my book) or resting this on something.  If that's the case then there is no reason to not shoot at your lowest ISO.  ISO 3200 makes for a very grainy picture.  Longer exposures will also have a nice smoothing effect on the water.    Watch your horizon, this isn't level."
photocritique,3bh5zl,Foxhovnd,2,Mon Jun 29 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm not sure what the focus or the thinking behind this image. Technically its ok, reasonably ok exposure if not evenly lit, there is a greenish colour cast probably strip lightning on the train. That can be fixed via colour balance.  Me personally I would have got a longer lens and focused on a smaller part of this moment in time, maybe the kid looking out the window and his reflection.   But someone else might do something different, what story or reason or theme are you thinking about? Think then capture"
photocritique,3bh5zl,foxandowl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:26:30 2015 UTC,"Right, I would crop in more to focus more on the kids surrounded by cell phones. The image is a little busy with everything else going on. I kind of like the green tone as it's instantly recognizable with old train cars."
photocritique,3bfs3x,mycoolalley,3,Sun Jun 28 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"The hair should be blowing into the opposite direction to create balance with her posture. Having both her body and hair face the same direction is a little boring and also makes me think she's about to fall over. ;)  She's also a little stiff in her lower torso.  I would have possibly used a faster shutter speed as well to freeze her hair a little better. Possibly a slower one as well.  Your focal length should really be between 35-90mm for portrait work--up to 135mm even if you have the room for it.  Overall, cool shot and it looked fun to do! Keep shooting!"
photocritique,3bfs3x,Akhalyndra,2,Mon Jun 29 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"Hi! I like this image, the contrasty light with the shock of red hair I enjoy the composition. I think it appropriately lit for image, I would have removed that flare on the right side.   If you looking for a different effect remove the stool in Photoshop  and increase the contrast, It could make for an interesting perspective image."
photocritique,3bfs3x,foxandowl,2,Mon Jun 29 10:57:00 2015 UTC,"It's a very striking image, and the strong side lighting works well. While the orange and blue color grading can be a little cliché, I think you used it nicely because of the hair color. By adding warmer highlights you kept the hair from being isolated in the image.   The big, well, small, thing I see in the pose is her right hand is catching some light in what is otherwise a shadowy area. I would like to see what the image looks like without her hand there.   I think you've done an excellent job breaking some of the conventions for studio portraits. Overall I think it's a successful photo. I would continue to work on posing for the model, which is something that you'll get better at the more you shoot with people and the more shoots your model has done."

photocritique,3bfb37,Akhalyndra,2,Mon Jun 29 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. While this may seem like an after thought to most photographers shooting geometric shapes, you should know that your reference point for this oval is the door smack in the center of it. All you need to do it stand directly across from where the two doors meet.  Pick your reference point before you shoot!  Also, remember to wear neutral colors. It doesn't have to be black, just not bright red. ;)  Good lines otherwise and keep shooting!"

photocritique,3bgxwf,BroccoliTurkey,2,Mon Jun 29 03:14:54 2015 UTC,Need subject matter.   Shutter speed is too slow -- picture is blurry.  Stop your aperture down to f/8 or f/16 -- background is mush.  Use a wider focal length if you can (24 / 28mm)  Too much white clipping in the background.  Use ISO 400 - 800 if you need to compensate for light  Foliage on the right is distracting.  Too much magenta in the soil.  I can't stop staring at that tree -- you know which one I'm talking about.

Everything would have been a little more squared-up and we would have gotten a better profile shot.  The colors seem a little off (kind of pink/red and a little saturated) and I'm not a huge fan of the vignetting either. Those are creative choices, though.  Great composition overall, and keep shooting! I love seeing pictures of people."

photocritique,3bgju3,Linksta35,2,Mon Jun 29 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"When shooting subjects, whether they are animals or humans, one thing to prevent is leaving any of it going out-of-frame--or close to out-of-frame.  That said, this fish is far too big for the photo. It falls out of frame and there's no real compositional factors here other than it is off-center.  Also, the background is very busy although I do like a couple of the other fish facing the opposite direction for some balance.  Aquarium photography can be tough. You did manage to get the shot in focus and with no visible glare. Try getting your subject with a less busy background next time and keeping all of it within the frame.  Hope this helped! Keep shooting!"

Everything is sharp and accounted for otherwise, and I'm jealous that you have one to play with--but there's really not much happening in this photo.  I feel like when using this lens, you should ask yourself ""why do I want to use this crazy angle of view--what is being contributed here? Is it better to use fisheye for this, or a normal wide-angle lens?"""
photocritique,3bg14z,txbergy,2,Sun Jun 28 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"I think just the title for me hits right to what doesn't work here.  ""Dramatic"" and ""Lamppost"". Sorry bud, having a really pedestrian subject and turning it black and white doesn't automatically make it dramatic or interesting. It's like ""Intriguing B+W Recycling Bin"". The composition doesn't work for me as the base of the lamp post is too close to center but the light is on the left and the tower is on the right. It's very unbalanced. The tower is too far to the right and too close to the edge of the frame. There's no detail in either so that it's mainly just black silhouettes. There also is no context really. The subject matter isn't really saying anything here."

All my photos that required cropping needed quite a bit of noise reduction even with my d3. Which sucked but oh well.
photocritique,3bemit,Tuxx115,2,Sun Jun 28 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"Clarity slider is up to high. Didn't think it was terrible until I looked at the green/yellow transition and it looks terribly unnatural.  Probably should have cropped a little lower since it looks like your a little above the waist and the model looks low in the picture and it would be nice to have both hands.  Biggest issue is it doesn't seem sharp at the model. Probably could have used a larger aperture. Is it a compression issue? Did you shoot in RAW if not you should it gives you a lot more freedom and better quality in the long run. Only disadvantage is digital space.  If you have the exif data, aperture shutter speed, iso, etc it helps people guess what went wrong sometimes :)"
photocritique,3bemit,MHerboth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:38:39 2015 UTC,You said a lot of what I was going to point out. For me it looks like the highlights were pulled down really low.

photocritique,3bemit,PrincipalPoop,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Looks like he's grabbing for something, or doing something with his hands.  But, we can't see it due to the crop.  Based on his shadows, looks like this was taken with the sun high overhead, no clouds, and no shade.  That's a rough spot to try and take a portrait.  Looks like you tried your best in post to correct for it, but it still comes out a little unnatural."
photocritique,3bemit,bazookaman3,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think there's a big problem here, either with your camera or your editing.

photocritique,3bemit,mashuto,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yea its definitely your processing. Not a huge fan of it here either.

photocritique,3bemit,MrSpyder,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"Get a little closer or zoom in. I like that we have the context of him standing in a field, but there's a lot of extra space above his head. If your depth of field becomes too shallow as you get closer, you can always stop down to f/4 or f/5.6."
photocritique,3bfk15,MrSpyder,3,Sun Jun 28 19:52:21 2015 UTC,42.5mm focal length would get rid of that distortion that makes your face look like its bulging.    EDIT: Also always use the lowest ISO possible if your shutter speed will allow it.  ISO 400 makes no sense if you can use ISO 100 just as easily.
photocritique,3bfk15,Bitteraftertaste,2,Sun Jun 28 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct, 42.5mm would be a better focal length. I have the Olympus 12-40mm f/2.8 that works pretty well, but I miss the shallow depth of field I get with the 20mm f/1.7. I should probably look into buying a longer focal length prime.  Also, yes ISO 400 was a mistake. 200 is the lowest native for my camera. ISO 100 yields slightly less noise, but worse color."
photocritique,3bfk15,Akhalyndra,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"I typically favor 50-90mm for portraits and definitely agree with this.  But, you obviously get a different look on the wider spectrum that doesn't look terrible, just more characturistic.  I would also hit f/2.8 or something with a wider depth-of-field to make sure his nose is in focus. But that's a creative opinion.  And I think you could get away with a little more shadow in your image--but again, creative opinion."

photocritique,3bfgw1,Akhalyndra,2,Mon Jun 29 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"I love your thought process, but you weren't close enough.  My first impression looking at this photo was ""why is this blurry if it was taken on a sunny day up against a wall?"" Your shutter speed is a little slow (but adequate) for such a long focal length and your aperture at f/5.6 is going to give you a very narrow depth-of-field at that length. Your camera must have focused for the wall, with razor-thin depth.  Assuming this is a 100% crop, my advice next time is to stay zoomed out a little--maybe 100mm and crop in, in post. Also, granted you are shooting digital, take several shots of these two to get them between the two lines instead of having the little girl's arm pouring over into an adjacent square on the wall.  The saturation is a little strong and the flesh tones look a little too orange for my taste--but that's a creative opinion.  You have a good mind and eye for photography! Keep shooting! And don't snipe people! ;)"
photocritique,3bfgw1,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:50:47 2015 UTC,I try to keep post production to only increasing contrast (which I probably overdid with this.

photocritique,3bfgw1,Akhalyndra,0,Mon Jun 29 05:00:59 2015 UTC,"Well, in some sense you wouldn't have gotten this image if you didn't have the telephoto. In another sense, it would have came out much better if you weren't using the telephoto.  If you're interested in shooting street photography I recommend buying something like a 50mm lens. You can grab the Canon 50mm f/1.8 off B&H for $125. Having a fixed focal length will not only improve your overall image (more glass is always bad) but it will make you think a little more.  Telephotos can make photographers very lazy. Need a shot of that thing way over there? Zoom. How about a shot of something not so far away but it needs to fill the frame more? Zoom. How about that other thing with th--zoom.  Having a prime lens will make you think ""damn, how can I make everything fit and look good"" instead of ""zoom... got it."" The 50mm in particular is very similar to what you naturally see as well. You can sort of get a feel of how your shot will turn out before you even look through the viewfinder with enough practice.   Also, there are other benefits to the lens like low-light performance thanks to the wide f/1.8 aperture and the depth of your objects. What I mean by depth is when you have a telephoto, you have about 15-20 pieces of glass squashing your image and making everything look flat--blurred background or not. With the 50mm, you have about six which makes everything look a little more ""3D"" by the time the light reached the sensor or film.  Then again... you could just have easily not zoomed with your lens and kept it at 55mm or whatever the minimum is. When shooting people, you really should be able to fill the frame at a distance that a 24 - 90mm focal length lens could have achieved. Anything further and we begin to lose intimacy with our subject. Do they fill the frame either way? Yes. Is it the same? Nope."
photocritique,3bfgw1,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:21:06 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in doing street photography, do not buy a 50mm on a crop. This is the equivalent of an 85mm and will be insanely tight for street shots, which are far easier to do when you shoot wide. You'll want to start somewhere between 24 and 35, which on a crop is between 15mm - ~22mm."
photocritique,3bfgw1,Akhalyndra,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:04:43 2015 UTC,"Well, 24mm, 35mm, 50mm, or 55mm will do you good either way. The 50mm is just a cheaper option usually. Pretty sure Henri Cartier-Bresson used a 50mm and turned out with some good work. But I guess I'm thinking of film--I don't shoot digital."

One way to get more detail in scenes like this where there is a huge difference between the brightest and darkest things you want to capture is shoot using an HDR method. There's lots of tutorials out there on how to use HDR, but it's easy to go crazy and end up with some rather ""unnatural"" results.

If the later, then bang up job on the shadow where feet meet the ground.  The back light is interesting but doesn't quite blend with the environment. Some flare over the subject might help with the look.  The smoke / dust seems a bit weak. I'd recommend using randomized smoke / cloud brushes to help create the look.  The electricity looks pretty neat, I think adding some dimension (color cast, variation, etc) will help make it look more realistic. Tesla coils are a great study material for this.

photocritique,3bbuqy,meisangry2,3,Sat Jun 27 19:00:10 2015 UTC,You have a good eye and are already doing many things right. You got the cow with a simple background. You got her from an unusual angle. You got her with her ears forward.  In animal photography the ears express a lot of emotion.  If they are back it shows stress or fear but forward shows that the animal is happy.   My biggest critique would be your lack of knowledge. Go learn some post processing so that you can take your work to the next level.
photocritique,3bbuqy,hanswatson,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"Is there any part of post processing that would make a large difference, anything that stands out? Or is a more general point to improve my pictures over time?"
photocritique,3bbuqy,co_radio,2,Sun Jun 28 01:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can work on adding more exposure to the darker parts of the picture, sharpen the image, remove the vignetting. There's a lot of post processing that can make this better.  That doesn't mean it's a bad picture. EVERY photographer you've ever heard of (and every one you haven't) manipulates their pictures some how. They always have, they always will."
photocritique,3bbuqy,deflyingfeats,2,Sun Jun 28 02:23:56 2015 UTC,As others pointed out a reflector or fill flash would be nice. I'd also consider composition here - the barbed wire is placed a bit weirdly in the image and goes straight across the cow's throat and his ear tag is prominent. This sets a weird tone which may not have been intentional.  Otherwise I like it!
photocritique,3bbuqy,Cha0sfox,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"She was a very friendly cow but wouldn't stay still, her head was over the wire or sniffing round in the grass behind the fence the entire time. The ear tag I'm not so fond of but really do not have the knowledge or skill to remove it without compromising the photo.  I'm still trying to identify my style so the barbed wire tone that is being set was unintentional. I'm still mostly trying to figure out how to compose images I, and other people, find pleasing/interesting."

photocritique,3bbuqy,BlackholeZ32,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"It was direct sunlight from the right, hence the left being dark. Don't know how I could rectify that without a flash, which would scare the cow away.  I positioned the eye a little above center, I felt it looked funny with the cow dead center. And as for the drool, that was what made me pick that over all the others too :)"

photocritique,3bdm93,TheZenEffect,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:38:10 2015 UTC,If you didn't have the time to take the shot you wanted you shouldn't have taken it. You admit yourself that this caused the image to underexpose due to your low shutter speed and so you already know what is wrong with the image. I'd also leave out an overcast sky and concentrate on the ground and the good ambient light such a sky provides.

With the composition, I think that if you are going to include the tracks and center the subject, it just be perfectly centered and balanced with the tracks and background.

I tried cropping, but I can't seem to get the right frame without diverging from the current aspect ratio. Are there some common understandings when to adjust the ratios of the photo?   My second question is about the ISO, which is quite high at 400. From what I understand I should keep ISO as low a possible. Is this indeed a mistake I made, and is it visible in the picture?"

photocritique,3bakdc,eled_,5,Sat Jun 27 10:29:02 2015 UTC,"Unusual may not be the word, but the framing and the geometry is pretty cool indeed.  To me, the geometry is the most appealing part (the triangles mostly, and eventually the tunnel), but a closer look reveals a heck of a lot of very distracting details, almost everything past the contours, in fact.  So I'm not sure that works too well as is. It has an abstract vibe, with too many hints as to what we're actually looking at, it's hard to get lost in the shapes."

photocritique,3bcby9,Bitteraftertaste,3,Sun Jun 28 00:07:16 2015 UTC,"My two cents:   As mentioned, the watermark needs to go. Honestly at this point, watermarks are mostly ridiculous. Even a fair number of top tier pros are skipping watermarks and I suspect the trend will continue. Plus there's the issue of someone who has barely owned a camera essentially marking something as if they were an established professional. This can be a hot topic for some but regardless, it still dilutes the field for actual working pros who depend on photography to pay their bills, and it does so in more ways than one. There are technical issues. Also as mentioned, the eyes are not in focus. Pretty much every human being looks at the eyes in any relevant picture. If any one part of any face needs to be sharp and in focus, it's the eyes. Of course there are exceptions, but this isn't one of them. There are already 19 bazillion pictures of cats in the world. Unless you're doing something especially unique or unless you're taking that picture because a client asked you to, don't take generic pictures of cats. The exception is if you're trying to learn. Even then, find a human subject to practice on as it'll help more in the long run unless you very specifically want to focus on pet photography.   I hope this is helpful."

photocritique,3bbmfw,raysuhhh,5,Sat Jun 27 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"You managed to get the focus right, and you got the subject out of the middle of the frame, so there's that. The pattern on the blanket is terribly distracting and takes over the image. If you're going to compose with negative space, make it negative - use a black or white piece of cloth, or at least a solid color that compliments the subject in some way. Also, usually, you'll want your key light coming from the more open side of the frame, the left side in this case. What has already been said about cutting off body parts is true as well. If there's one arm, have two. Crop above the elbow, or above the knee. A crop below the elbow should include hands, and below the knee should include feet. These aren't firm rules you can't break, but things to keep in mind and only deviate when you understand why you're deviating. Read a lot on portrait composition and take 20,000 or so more photos that you've put thought into, and you'll get there. Don't get discouraged - enjoy the learning process because it never ends."

Also, because she's tilted head down and a bunch of trees are tilted to the right, it makes the image feel like it's not on a straight horizon line. The makeup on her face is hard to discern. Her whole face is a mystery, really; her head angle isn't great. Awkward right arm. Finally, the bokeh is really distracting. Bring down the ambient and light her accordingly."

I think it's a good benchmark shot and a way to try to put your own personal spin on it. This brings me to the second point, I was going for the ""tunnel vision/claustrophobic"" feel and mood that the city can sometimes give you. I guess it works for some not others. I can definitely play around a little with the darkness a little to see what it changes about the feel or if the added detail gives a little bit more of a subject matter.

photocritique,3b6tbt,diesel828,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"So, that's the thing. What's your personal spin on it?   That's the reason why we say we've seen this shot thousands of times before. If you'd done something interesting with it (which is very hard, by the way), the response would've been, ""Nice twist to a cliché photo!""  That's what we want to try to elicit from our viewers and friends."
photocritique,3b6tbt,diesel828,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"I would say that my ""twist"" or the feeling I tried to give the scene is the claustrophobic/tight/lost feeling caused by the under exposure and the tunnel vision to ""nothingness"" (per seanithanegan). You know all of the massive buildings are there, however, you still need to search for them. You expect there to be an obvious subject at the end of the upside down triangle but there isn't. I know that I have felt those feelings while walking around NYC before. Maybe that doesn't translate to everyone, or anyone for that matter, but that claustrophobic searching feeling in an everyday public space was what I was going for."
photocritique,3b6tbt,Chuckaroo91,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think that's a little bit of an excuse. It sounds harsh, but it doesn't invoke the sense of claustrophobia at all. I understand your reasoning, but it just doesn't work because the lines do lead to an opening, and that opening stretches up to the sky.  I'm in NYC for two weeks. If you wanna do some street shooting, let me know."
photocritique,3b6tbt,Hormonfleisch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:41:41 2015 UTC,Like the spot. It's across the street from my apartment. But it's shot a lot like others have said.

I guess in this case it's hard to know what will be the subject beforehand.  Also, I personally don't feel like contrast is a cop-out, but to each his/her own!"

I would've walked backwards at least 5 steps and to the left 5 steps, to reframe the shot so that the subject was mostly in the right half of the picture, and the shadowed texture would be splayed out behind him. As someone said, it's out of focus. The lighting here is fantastic, and there is so much potential; I think if you did a reshoot, you could have a slam dunk."

Not really a big deal, just noticed it. Not much you can do about the house being there, so making it at least look a little more framed couldn't hurt!  FWIW, that is the #1 thing I seem to notice is overlooked - lines that are not level/complimentary to the image."
photocritique,3b9rl2,moj0risin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:40:02 2015 UTC,I think this is cool - I think it needs the tiniest tilt to the left to feel straightened to me. One thing I'm trying to think more about now is what the message is of the picture...you could suck some of the color out and add texture and screw around with it a bit in post to make this look pretty bleak which would have a great feeling. You could also soften up the distance a little and bring out the color in the trees and warm the image up a bit and make it feel like you're coming home after being away for a long time or something positive and nostalgic like that.
photocritique,3b9rl2,Shoopieshoop,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:23:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I took the picture with the idea of travel in mind.

Seascapes during the day can be tough because there is an overwhelming amount of blue - blue water, blue sky. All the shadows here have turned blue as well but your water is the worst offender. It's very oversaturated and a nuclear blue color. Try dialling it down on the saturation. You could have lowered your ISO for this shot in full daylight also."

photocritique,3b7jne,gynoceros,2,Sat Jun 27 00:56:59 2015 UTC,+1 for tighter crop. Brick contrast is great against the outfits of the peeps in the frame.
photocritique,3b7jne,ExcitedBurritos,2,Mon Jun 29 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"Shutter speed, defiantly.  There is pretty obvious motion blur. To add to /u/Hormonfleish's recommendations, I would also watch your leveling. If you look near the top edge of the brick wall, you can see that the camera is tilted 2-5 degrees or more to the left (counterclockwise). It CAN be corrected in post processing, but I'm commenting on the image here as I see it :-)  When shooting lines (bricks on the wall for ex) the eye can easily be distracted if there is any asymmetry.  Love the color/vibrancy of the wall however. Keep shooting! Good work."

photocritique,3b7jne,Hindsight_DJ,2,Tue Jun 30 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Great set of photo's.  My recommendations based on what I saw:   Work on low-light and motion photography.  In particular, I notice a lot of grain/noise in your lower light photo's indicating your ISO levels may need to be adjusted to compensate for your light levels (light meters are key here... invest!! - I use a mobile one that does a killer job ). Shutter speed - I'm seeing a lot of motion blur, you can chalk SOME of it up to artistic, but in several photo's it begins to appear amateurish (point and shoot style).   Just my 2 cents :-)  Keep Shootin'"
photocritique,3b7jne,Hindsight_DJ,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insightful comments! I know I definitely have to work on my shutter speed skills, I always shoot in manual so sometimes I am too slow at selecting the proper speed.   I took most of the low-light pics with and SLR and a 400 ISO film but often had to crank the ISO up to 800, this probably accounts for the noisiness. Thanks again!"

photocritique,3b90no,delofan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"The raw naturally looks less contrasty. Lower contrast and raise the shadows in lightroom (prefered) or photoshop.  You got really lucky with a focus that good at 1.8  I think this photo would be really good if you played with the levels, saturation, contrast, etc.   Just needs some moderately heavy processing."

photocritique,3b4x43,gjgroess,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:55:51 2015 UTC,I was thinking next time i go out i might try the stacking method. Maybe that would help with the signal/noise ratio. How do you get a good exposure without trails though is you have to shoot 20 shots? Is it just 20 1s shots with no break? Seams like you wouldnt get much light out of each frame to make a difference?
photocritique,3b4x43,vgooding,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:23:32 2015 UTC,You would use a tracking mount to keep the stars in the same location and average out the mountains or non sky bits. I'm on mobile and don't have the resource links but its the same process used to take people out of vacation photos. Pretty neat process really. Basically you'd have a series of slightly offset sky bits that can be combined into a slightly smaller overall picture.

I'd love to see it larger, I'm sure there's some interesting detail.  Out of curiosity, what time was that taken?  I think there might be a little too much foreground sand, although maybe in a bigger file some detail might come through.  I also feel like the reflections could be resolved a little better; I'm not sold on how the top of the reflection of the rock on the right is cut off.  The horizon look ever so slightly off, might be worth a crop.  I'd like to see more pictures like these if you have them.  *Edit: Saw that you posted a similar image to r/pics a few days ago.  I definitely like that one better.  Are these stitched panoramas?  If so I think you might be having some problems with the horizon fluctuating across the image."
photocritique,3b4qj0,EtArcadia,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"I stared at this for a while.  I really like a lot about it. I like the use of black and white. I like the dark contrast of the big foreground rocks.  But there is something that keeps throwing me off. I guess my eyes have no where to rest, and I keep expecting them to land somewhere, but they don't. Perhaps something about the composition leaves me with no focal point?"
photocritique,3b4qj0,thejollysin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:25:30 2015 UTC,You should adjust your horizon. It leans to the right.  Also there is some dirt on the right.
photocritique,3b4qj0,FreeWildbahn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:52:29 2015 UTC,"I too like the contrast/black levels you went for. IMHO the composition lacks a bit of depth, but I wouldn't want to stray too far from what you've got. I'd eventually try to use more generously the water lines while retaining the outermost parts you included, maybe go wider and closer ? The sand at the bottom is not super effective, maybe it has more texture in the original, but from what we can see it lacks interesting features and doesn't work too well as a negative space (it looks a bit forced).  I'm undecided about the tilted horizon, it bothers me a bit, but I think it fits the current composition with its general movement going from top left to bottom right.  And yeah, dirt-spots are distracting."
photocritique,3b4qj0,eled_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"I have to be honest, this breaks a few compositional rules which if they were conscious decisions were good ones; if not, you got lucky.  Black and white wad a good decision with the amount of texture present and although the horizon cuts the image in half it works well with the scene and the positive and negative space.

I'm a very new photographer (just got into it 1 week ago), and I'd love to hear some feedback and try to improve as much as possible.  I am having some limitations with the kit lens, although I am looking to also get a 50mm f1.8 in the upcoming weeks.

photocritique,3b7kjn,Onlylikesblades,2,Fri Jun 26 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"So I am far from an expert but I'll give my two cents.  Why did you take these photos?  What are you trying to show someone with them?  They're very edited pictures of a fence, that's it.  When you're taking a picture, think about what you're trying to show someone and then think ""Would I enjoy looking at this?""   Now for the positives!! In all your pictures, you did a pretty good job of making sure your background was interesting.  Also, the lighting in your pictures was great!  The editing looked a bit overdone in my opinion but some of that is subjective.  A great example is the sky in the third picture.  I have never seen a sky that color.  When you edit pictures, you're purpose is usually to make the picture look better but still be natural.  All in all, I think you just need to find some interesting subjects.  Also, just continue to take pictures....and then some more....and after that, two more just to be safe.  The best way to improve in photography is to take pictures and then go over them with a fine-tooth comb, and look for ways to improve.  Good luck!"

Most yoga shoots emphasize lightness, freedom and comfort with lots of mild greens and blues.  This picure puts a much more disturbing spin on it.  Given the mood, it almost looks like painful contortion instead of liberating movement.  If this is for a client I'd certainly check with them before submiting something like this."

I felt black and white was perfect because the natural colors were very muted in this original, especially with the fog. B&W made it way more bold."

The models are dressed very suggestively but the poses here seem a little too casual, like the shoot has really begun.  This could be interesting but doesn't quite gel here.

I think there are a lot of ways to do street photography, but the most important thing about shooting on the street is ""be not afraid to get close"" it's hard, I know, but in my experience I have to say that magazines, blogs, galleries, contest, etc. love the pictures where they can see faces, and where they can feel the proximity between you and the subject.  Maybe next time you should try to take a picture from the front of the subject. Also there are some composition mistakes, like the feet crop, there are a lot of elements in the background, etc.  I recommend to you reading Eric Kim blog, I learned everything I know about street photography from him. http://erickimphotography.com/blog/start-here/  He wrote a lot of tips about how to overcome fear and some lessons about composition."

photocritique,3b304c,EtArcadia,2,Thu Jun 25 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, I like it when people say not to hold back:  It's a picture of sunset/sunrise, probably the most cliche contemporary photo subject.  Amateur photography has a funny relationship with cliche.  I'm not sure what r/poetrycritique is like (maybe I'm wrong), but I have a feeling it's not filled poems that start with ""Roses are red violets are blue"", yet somehow this sub is flooded with the photographic equivilent of tired poems about flowers.  I don't know what it is about photography that makes people so conformist, always seeking the most common and familiar.  Not only that but this picture has the photographic equivlent of a glaring typo in the form of the palm fronds or whatever they are, peaking in from the right edge of the frame.  So we have a boring, expected subject and careless composition.  Ok rant over.  Techinically it's fine, maybe slightly dark in the foreground.  From a purely compositional point of view the fisherman is in a funny place.  He's neither lined up with the sun nor sufficiently offset to be visually pleasing.   You're in Florida, an incredibly complex and important state.  There are so many photos to be taken there if you avoid trying to make photos that look like photos you've already seen."
photocritique,3b304c,micmea1,2,Thu Jun 25 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Not everyone, especially beginners, are going to be investigative street photographers.

While these won't win any awards, they can still look nice and are a good way to learn the basics of photography. They will also be relatable to an audience, as not everyone appreciates abstract photography, or gritty street shots, or whatever else."

photocritique,3b304c,micmea1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:26:53 2015 UTC,The exposure can work. I might even toss up a bit more contrast and have the fishermen even more silhouetted since he's 90% there already. Though you can go either way. The color with the sun and clouds is nice.   Your image is slightly off level. You can fix this with cropping to make sure the horizon line is perfectly horizontal. The bird(?) on the right hand side that's mostly cut off is distracting and doesn't add anything to the image. I'd crop it out. The fisherman is also sort of just...there. I don't know how to describe it. The focus of the image right now is mainly on the sun and clouds.
photocritique,3b304c,scrote_inspector,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:17:24 2015 UTC,"The background is way too dark to properly silhouette the fisherman. If it's not too troublesome, try to targer the water for editing and jack up the exposure."

Everyone I know in the commercial industry has broken in by becoming an expert at something: events/weddings, fashion, product/food, real estate.  They become someone who is known for creating a particular kind of work.  Clients, especially at the lower level, rarely want to be surprised. They want to see your style and say ""that's what I want for my wedding/fashion line/hamburger, make me pictures that look like these, but have my thing in them.""

The surreal thing isn't really working.  These aren't surreal scenes, they're mundane.  When you crank the saturation they still look mundane just over saturated."

photocritique,3b2qqw,xrobex,3,Thu Jun 25 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"Suuuuuper unflattering pose, and the lighting drops off quickly as you go farter down her body. The lighting should be more even, imo. Boring composition.  I find it really hard to light models with uneven skin texture. Short of blasting them with light from every angle, it's difficult not to get shadows on their faces from the various pits and bumps. I usually just light them to flatter their bone structure (I'm partial to butterfly) and fix their skin in post."
photocritique,3b2qqw,scrote_inspector,2,Thu Jun 25 18:41:02 2015 UTC,butterfly   What is butterfly? Also can you provide and good resources on posing models?
photocritique,3b2qqw,scrote_inspector,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"This is where I started with lighting. Butterfly is included.   Here's a very basic guide to portrait posing, though in your case a lot of the problem stems from the low angle you shot from compared to the angle of her head. Low angles are rarely flattering to anyone. Her chin is closer to the camera than any other facial feature, so it draws a lot of attention and looks relatively large.   Edit: What's going on in the background, by the way? Did you mean to totally black that out?"
photocritique,3b2qqw,evertjm,2,Fri Jun 26 07:24:40 2015 UTC,that focal length and pose combo does her no favours.  the hair in line with her neck needs a bit of backlighting
photocritique,3b2qqw,EtArcadia,2,Thu Jun 25 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a flattering picture, but maybe that's not what you're going for here.   You might want to take a look at Katy Grannan's photographs.  If you're just starting with this kind of equipment you should keep working at it and learn to make more flattering portraits before you start pushing the limits.  The other posts have said it, but I'll echo and clarify a little.  A 27mm focal length is generally not good for portraiture, you'll want something longer."
photocritique,3b2qqw,scrote_inspector,2,Thu Jun 25 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"Katy Grannan I checked out some of her work, interesting stuff. As far as focal lengths go is there a good starting point for portraits?"
photocritique,3b2qqw,EtArcadia,2,Fri Jun 26 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"I personally use a 80-200mm lens and typically shoot at 80mm. I don't have a large collection of lenses yet, but it's the best I own for portrait work. I've been told you should never shoot portraits below 50mm, but I've also heard 80mm as well. Definitely avoid wide angle lenses, they stretch stuff at the center of the lens and compress stuff at the edges (think fisheye look)."

photocritique,3b3a6z,Daenarya143,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:50:14 2015 UTC,I just got a new / older camera a few days ago. I know nothing of what settings were used. ( all I know is the flash went off lol. )  My dad is slowly teaching me how to use it. I believe its a Sony DSLR A200. Anything you have to say will be much appreciated and I will figure out how to do it with this camera. Thank You!
photocritique,3b3a6z,EtArcadia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"It's in focus and properly exposed so you've got the bare basics!  You should start by read up on your camera's different manual and automatic modes and begin experimenting with the its different settings.  Try photographing indoors and outdoors in different lighting conditions.    The first thing I'd learn how to do is shut off the automatic flash.  Built in camera mounted flashes are like the canned food you keep at the back of the pantry for emergencies.  You shouldn't use them unless you've exhausted all your other options: open a window, turn on some lights, move the subject.  This shot actually looks ok with the flash, but it's going to be the exception rather than the rule."
photocritique,3b37ge,TokoTijoh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"A little more blur on the background would have made it more surreal and interesting, a larger aperture would have been required.  Great composition."
photocritique,3azfy2,austindaley,19,Wed Jun 24 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"This is nicely done, but without knowing the context it's a little hard to critique in great depth.  Is this a team picture, a commissioned portrait, part of a broader series of pictures or just something you've done for fun?  In any case, there are two factors which I find compelling about the picture.  Firstly it it doesn't shy away from the grit of the scene; his pads are scuffed with dirt and his hair is mussed from wearing the catcher's mask.  There's a sense of a real ordeal, of being present in the environment.  It reminds me a bit of Rineke Dijkstra's outstanding photographs of bull fighters after fights, woman just after giving birth and soldiers before and after their first tours of duty.  I'd play this kind of experience up in the future, it's a welcome break from the freshly laundered team portraits you usually see.  The second thing I like about the picture is how the boy is placed teetering on the edge of adulthood.  His expression says a lot, both tough and vulnerable, very human.  I'd play this up as well. There's a rose tinted nostalgia for childhood that I think you've done a good job avoiding, but it's a fine line between subverting the nostalgia and portraying kids as mini adults.  I do however think it's way over processed.  I'd much prefer a more naturalistic color balance and I'd ditch the vignette as well.  It's an interesting enough picture that it can stand on its own without affectation."
photocritique,3azfy2,EtArcadia,7,Wed Jun 24 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much! It was a last minute request from his parents (family friend) I hate the traditional baseball photos so im going for a grittier look, I agree with the vignette ill fix that. And exactly how you explained it is pretty much what I was trying to accomplish, im just not very good at post production...."
photocritique,3azfy2,Hubblesphere,3,Wed Jun 24 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"Try using the adjustment brush to add some more natural looking vignetting. I think most photographers dislike vignetting because it is so obvious to us. My personal preference is to avoid the top corners where the sky is visible. I usually bring down graduated filter from the top slightly darkening the sky and adding some saturation, so you get a more natural look to it while also pushing the viewers attention closer to the center of the frame. My personal rule is if everything looks noticeably vignetted (like the top left of your picture where the sky, light post and fence are all darker) then I try to avoid it."
photocritique,3azfy2,EtArcadia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the parents will be happy with it!  In the future I'd push you to get a little more creative with the pose though.  This picture is kinda the expected position for a catcher.  If you're planning on doing more sports shots like this I'd encourage you to look at both Sharon Lockhart and her photographs of Japanese girls basketball and Andrea Modica's book Minor League (very hard to find many of her shots online)  I was also just think that you could probably crop this ever so slightly, there's a little dead space around the edges."

photocritique,3azfy2,JonFuhrmann,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:37 2015 UTC,sweet thanks! ill destroy that vignette asap! because I completely agree.
photocritique,3azfy2,somelamephotoguy,2,Wed Jun 24 19:45:00 2015 UTC,Posing and composition look great.  And I really like what you did with the styling but I feel like it goes a little too far.  Are you going for the grungy look?   Also the catcher seems to be fairly soft all over and I feel if he was much sharper it may improve the image.  Especially his eyes!
photocritique,3azfy2,benji1the1dog,2,Wed Jun 24 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I shot it at 1.4 it was the best focus picture I had, I was going for a gritty look. Ill try to sharpen it a bit more but the sharper I add it the more grain it gets. (I used a crappy 1.4 as well...)"
photocritique,3azfy2,sabr0sa,2,Wed Jun 24 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"Agree with @jhigg - I really like the composition. Did you pose him or was this spur-of-the-moment? Expression is great.

I lm just being picky but the height of the picture feels a little off. Not real sure why I think about 6 to 12 Inches higher with the catcher looking up would have added a nice touch. But overall fantastic job.

photocritique,3azfy2,GingerHero,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:14:57 2015 UTC,Yes that is correct.
photocritique,3azfy2,andy_sass,2,Thu Jun 25 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"Overall I like the shot and agree with most I've read others say here.  My only critique is with the framing/ cropping.  I think there is too much unnecessary room on the right and not enough on the left.    And, the way the backstop posts are right at the edges doesn't create a very clean border.  Either crop them entirely or have them fully  in the frame.  Also, unfortunate to have the trees in the back a similar color and value as his clothing, could have more separation there, but not much you can do about that."
photocritique,3azfy2,puga1505,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"Fantastic image, it doesn't need any modification, but if I had to say something,  I would say that lining up that center post with the plate and align it down the spine of the boy might give more leading lines into your subject and draw the eye more. Great lighting!"
photocritique,3azfy2,foxandowl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's a cool and unique take on a baseball photo. It looks great, but I feel like the cool/dark colors might be too fancy/non-traditional to my eye. I'd probably drag the greens back a little closer to their rightful place and add a touch of exposure... baseball shouldn't be quite so gloomy.  In any case, the parents are going to love it."
photocritique,3azfy2,Bitteraftertaste,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"Actually that's a great idea, after going back after a break I decided it is very green I'd like a bit more sunset tones. But I'm still getting use to photoshop... lol thank you!"
photocritique,3azfy2,scrote_inspector,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"You've gotten a lot of good feedback, so I won't go too in depth, but I will crit your focus a bit. One person mentioned how the player is a bit soft, and you said you shot it at 1.4, which doesn't give enough DOF to keep the helmet, the plate and the whole player in enough focus.  The other drawback to that aperture for this shot is the bokeh in the background through the fence is pretty harsh, particularly to the viewers right of the players shoulder. That's actually more of a lens problem here, but stopping down one or two may clean it up, so it will be worth experimenting with this lens a bit to find your sweet spot.  All in all you've done nicely here and the feedback you've gotten is solid. Remember to settle on something you're personally happy with and don't fuss too much; then, as you progress and keep shooting and finding your style, come back in a year or so and see how you would process it again.   Thanks for sharing with us."
photocritique,3azfy2,n1c0sax0,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:53:53 2015 UTC,"For sure! thanks! And it was a crappy nikon 50 1.4... not the god one, its the only 50mm I have, 85mm just didnt feel right to me... I totally get what your saying to about the focus being soft... :/ I could of shot it at 1.8 or maybe even 2... Just the sun was dropping and I was in a rush lol. This was probably the most helpful critique ever.. lol"
photocritique,3b2pq0,Caasi67,3,Thu Jun 25 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"You can immediately tell that it's been over-sharpened to compensate for soft focus. Unfortunately, I don't think this one is salvageable. There aren't many ways to fix camera shake. You're right about the trees and the background - they all look off. Get your ass back up that mountain (and keep working at it!). When you get there, check and double check your settings, take multiple shots and change your settings, check your screen."

photocritique,3b2o6o,schnaarzard,3,Thu Jun 25 14:04:12 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know where to look. That seed and thistle are lovely and both draw the eye but are obscured, or at least visually confused, by the long grass. The tree in the background also grabs attention, but clearly isn't meant to or it'd be in focus and not cut off at the top. It's a case of a missing subject.  Horizon could use some straightening as well. The light pole aligns so closely with the edge of the photo that it's hard not to notice the angle.  Check out the first two points in this link from the sidebar."

I've been doing landscape/travel photography for the best part of 7 years now as a hobby, and feel fairly ready to step up a level. But there's always more to learn/improve :)"
photocritique,3az580,EtArcadia,3,Wed Jun 24 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"Wedding photography is a tough gig.  Don't get taken advantage of by doing too much for free though.  I'm certainly no expert when it comes to wedding photography but the one tip I can give is to come up with a cohesive style that you can market.  The successful wedding shooters I've come across all have a sort of visual brand, a way that their pictures look that prospective clients can look at and say ""that's how I want our pictures to look.""  This particular picture, obviously not a wedding photo, doesn't really give the sense of a style, it's pretty generic."
photocritique,3az580,EtArcadia,2,Wed Jun 24 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you - that is excellent advice! I hope the style will become more apparent once the weddings start happening - I have had some good feedback from other types of events, which hopefully is a good start.  For reference - this was a ""random"" shot on a walk with family & family friends on holiday.   Do you photograph for a living, as well?"

I'm working on a book of landscape photography right now using a 4x5 view camera shooting Kodak Ektar 100 color film.  A good medium or large format digital back would definitely be better quality than 4x5 film (at least in terms of clarity), but the cost is just beyond my reach at this point. I've played around with high end digital backs as rentals and on some shoots.  They're awesome.

I'd be intrigued what strangers (ie unbiased, as opposed to friends and family) think of my work.   This was taken with no extra lighting on a lovely balmy (and slightly overcast) evening, so lighting looks good to me at least. What I'm wondering is how this would feel to you on a website, in terms of showcasing work? What might you have done differently?   (Could post website here, as well, but I don't want to come across as advertising - but website critique on the whole would be appreciated, as well.)"
photocritique,3ayd08,ExcitedBurritos,8,Wed Jun 24 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"As usual the qualified ""It Depends"" answer will have to do.    1st its a nice shot and a creative use of the light.  That being said if the shoes are the focus you could light them from the front with a reflector or some kind of source that brings them up a bit.  If it's just the legs as a subject then they fit the frame well and the lighting draws you in more than it drive you out.  The edge line and separation created by the back lighting are quite nice and the overall tone and color of the image are good."
photocritique,3ayd08,gjgroess,3,Wed Jun 24 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The shoes & legs together are really the subject. FWIW, I took a few others and made them brighter with a higher ISO and then Photoshop. They also look alight, but this one has a different feel from them because the light is lower.

photocritique,3b3jal,clocksailor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:30:04 2015 UTC,Just in general. It's my first week with the camera.
photocritique,3b3jal,clocksailor,4,Thu Jun 25 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, I get you now.  When I first started doing photography, I'd get really excited every time I managed to take a picture of anything on manual where the thing I wanted to be in focus was actually in focus. And it is exciting! This shit is complicated! But the thing about /r/photocritique is that people will be extremely honest about the artistic merit of your photos without regard for your level of experience--great when the only people around you are friends and family who just think you're the shit and don't have any constructive criticism to give, but maybe not so helpful for you right at this moment.   So, for this photo, I'd say you did a good job getting the coffee cup in focus and following the rule of thirds, but the clutter on the side isn't helpful, and the fact that that clutter includes a lens cap and another arm holding a camera makes it pretty obvious that you and a friend were noodling around with your equipment and not really trying to take a Good Photo. Also, the subject matter/lighting isn't very interesting, so while this is good practice for you, the folks on this sub won't have much nice to say about it.  As camera mechanics become more automatic for you, you'll have more brain space to think about what you really want to communicate. It's like learning to drive--you tool around in a parking lot while you learn how the car works, and THEN you can start worrying about traffic, navigation, and messing with the radio.  TLDR: Good start, keep practicing, haters gonna hate (but that hate will be helpful when you get a little more experience)."

photocritique,3b171n,pfloyd102,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:32:12 2015 UTC,"Reduce the vignette, you could try to show a little more movement by tracking the subject and a lover shutter speed. You could also experiment with off camera flash placement with rear curtain sync."
photocritique,3b171n,scairborn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:43:30 2015 UTC,Too much vignetting in this one but really cool shot regardless
photocritique,3b171n,carbs109,0,Thu Jun 25 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"The vignetting is distracting and the tilt isn't doing anything for me. Yes a tilt like this can work but it calls attention to itself here. Colors looks nice but the moment isn't very exciting. You should show motion by lowering your shutter speed, as was already mentioned in the comments here. Or find an exciting moment, if he slides, dirt flying up or if he zooms by, something."
photocritique,3b171n,amateur_samurai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"what tilt are you talking about? I'm not sure what you mean. Also, I'm sort of confused. In a shot like this: https://www.flickr.com/photos/63916594@N02/18781802349/in/dateposted-public/   I tried to show movement and people told me to show less movement, and in this I tried to show less and now you're telling me to show more. So whats the medium? What's a good example of good movement?"
photocritique,3b171n,KDShark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"your camera is level and the trail / rider is tilted. I think he is suggesting you tilt the camera's perspective down and left, more parallel with the line of the downhill trail. As is, rider is sort of sticking out from the earth at an odd angle relative to camera.   I think the motion blur in the rodeo shot was fine. If you are going to slow shutter and pan, do it at a higher fstop to give you more margin for depth of field (say f13 -- this is obviously not a magic number since it really depends how far away the subject is and the light you have).   The biker is a bit static and could use some panning blur. Or you could shoot these guys really tight as they come around the trail to get their expression (you lose all the foreground and a good bit of surroundings, but if framed right its interesting to see the detail in their arms, neck and face-- maybe just seeing the handlebars & up. Then you get a glimpse of the trail and woods over the shoulder. Frankly, you should be doing both techniques and more--- take tons of pictures knowing that the failure rate is going to be high, but that's fine if you get one good motion blur, one good tight shot, one good action shot. Professional photographers do this, especially for action shots. Here's a link to read-  http://davidduchemin.com/2013/03/editing-hokkaido/  Vignette is not working here. People who use vignetting in professional pictures keep it very, very minimal-- like almost imperceptible. Lightroom should really adjust the sliders on this, because 95% of the range produces too much vignette."
photocritique,3b171n,amateur_samurai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"The tilt I'm referring to in this shot  is how it looks like it was shot at a 45 degree angle.   I tried to show movement and people told me to show less movement   Everyone is different and has different opinions on showing motion. For a shot like this you either want to stop motion by shooting at 1/1000 or more or by showing motion by shooting at 1/30, 1/60, etc  Hope those two motion examples helped and nice rodeo motion shot by the way ;) Happy shooting"
photocritique,3b0mdx,OM3N1R,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:36:36 2015 UTC,"Focusing is off by a hair's hair. This is 'normal', considering how hard that is in macro photography, but the biggest problem in this picture is that half the head/mouth is hidden. Is this format 16:9? Doesn't favour this particular picture very much."
photocritique,3azgv2,Clickbitch,2,Wed Jun 24 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"The sky doesn't look overexposed now, pretty much spot on.  It does look a little grainy but it's hard to tell if the whole picture has this grain or if this is an artifact of bring down an over exposed sky.    If you're having problems with exposure, I'd recommend bracketing your shots, especially when shooting in difficult lighting like this."
photocritique,3azgv2,EtArcadia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"I like it personally, it's got a very gloomy feel with whatever you've done."
photocritique,3axsi6,foxandowl,2,Wed Jun 24 10:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think mantis' are some of the creepiest things ever, and you definitely captured that in your image. Nice shot. Maybe move the mantis to the right next time to closer follow rule of thirds? I'm not sure how it would look but would be worth a shot."
photocritique,3axsi6,Vynjak,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:43:29 2015 UTC,Thanks!
photocritique,3axsi6,PeaceOfMynd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:28:42 2015 UTC,"The focal plain is a bit narrow.  See that tiny bit of the table that is in focus?   The end result is that not all of the mantis is in focus.  Also the areas of grey in the bottom right, the bottom left, and that bright stripe in the top left are distracting.    I don't mind the subject's placement because I think, one its and interesting subject essentially a portrait photo.   Also the angle of its body similarly matches the leading linear lines on the table.  You can follow the table lines directly to the mantis, and I think that is pretty cool.     Colors are excellent other than the out of focus colors in the corners."
photocritique,3axsi6,Pennigans,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks peaceofmynd, I agree probably need to be up one or two f-stops."
photocritique,3axsi6,Pennigans,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:28:16 2015 UTC,"The aperture is definitely too high on this one. It'd be better at f/4-f/6 probably. When you're shooting something so small you need a smaller aperture, f/2.8 NEVER works. Also I think more contrast would improve it, especially on the torso area."
photocritique,3aykoi,Sosayslori,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:19:55 2015 UTC,A lower angle would improve it.

photocritique,3azuzs,stvedt,2,Wed Jun 24 20:58:53 2015 UTC,"This is more of an urban landscape than street photography.  The figures are simply too small top make out anything about them.  Are they playing with their phones?  If this is about those people than you need to get WAY closer.    What is it about this scene that interests you?  From what I can see the primary thing going on here is graffiti abatement.  Not necessarily an uninteresting subject, but you'll have to dig a little deeper to make it compelling.  A couple of general notes:  -Straighten your horizon, the verticals are all leaning to the right.  -The bottom corners are both heavily vignetted for some reason.  If this is intentional I'd lose it, but I'd guess this might be caused by a lens hood out of alignment."
photocritique,3azuzs,EtArcadia,2,Wed Jun 24 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"It's okay, but it's a little busy for my taste.  What do you want our eyes to land on in this shot?  A couple of crops that I would try: 1.  A vertical crop of the two people, including the two windows and all 3 of the different types of wall sections. 2.  Similar to above, but horizontal crop and put the people in the bottom left of the crop, getting 3 of the vertical pipes in the shot. 3.  Incorporate the trash can and the ""happiness is"" graffiti in one shot.  No people in this one."
photocritique,3azuzs,bazookaman3,2,Wed Jun 24 21:59:09 2015 UTC,"I think the vignette is too strong, and the shot is too busy. I'm terrible at any kind of landscapes too though, so I know the struggle."
photocritique,3azuzs,Pennigans,2,Wed Jun 24 23:21:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenter, that's urban rather than street. Street is up close & personal, capturing expressions, emotions and situations often paying less attention to backgrounds and rules."

photocritique,3b07pb,pragmojo,2,Wed Jun 24 22:43:18 2015 UTC,"This second one is much better.  I don't doubt that this is a beautiful place, but the first one is very lacking in composition.  It just feels like a hastily taken travel photo that you show your friends and try to explain how it was so much better IRL than the photo.  The second  has nice geometry and a clearly defined foreground, middle and background which are each interesting and varied in scale."
photocritique,3b07pb,R101C,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the second on is much more interesting. Getting closer and rotating a bit to the left may have been even better.

photocritique,3b0bmh,Pennigans,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:25:34 2015 UTC,"That's the issue with critique subs, the saturation and position of the bird and the kind of dull look is what I like about the picture, but thank you I know what you mean"
photocritique,3b0bmh,Iledash,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:03:23 2015 UTC,"The Branch coming from the left corner makes up for the horizontal positioning of the bird imo. I think it's kinda unfocused, but that's probably because you already cropped it or because i am spoiled by all those supersharp wildlife shots on the internet."
photocritique,3b0bmh,pragmojo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"I like the silhouette of the bird, but the focus isn't so precise, and the framing doesn't sit so well with me."

photocritique,3b08k4,lopeztein,2,Wed Jun 24 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"The flower isn't pronounced enough as the subject. It would be ideal to get a lower angle, but since you said it was impossible maybe just to photograph it head on so it looks bigger. Also maybe crop it in more too since it's such a small subject."
photocritique,3b08k4,Pennigans,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think this could be a lot stronger if there was something setting the flower apart from the rest of the image - the background and foreground are a little cluttered, so it takes away from the focus on the flower. Next time maybe try framing the flower above the horizon instead, so it's surrounded by blue? Just my opinion!"
photocritique,3b08k4,-guanaco,2,Wed Jun 24 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Unfortunately that would have been impossible to do without digging a hole in the moss and moving rocks around and I didn't want to disturb the scene in general, but I appreciate your criticism. Thanks!"
photocritique,3awqtg,20somethinknownothin,3,Wed Jun 24 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"This is a nice attempt. The DOF is a little too shallow, eyes are out of focus, and you've underexposed by a stop or two.  Looks like you tried to get the eyes in focus. That's good, but you missed by a hair. A tiny hair. ;)  There's a little bit of motion blur going on too. This can most readily be seen in the hairs. There are 'ghost' hairs... almost double exposed.  If you like this kind of work you're off to a good start.  Are you shooting with flash? What lens and camera?"
photocritique,3awqtg,SCphotog,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:50:24 2015 UTC,I actually like the exposure as it is. It gives the photo a dark atmosphere that I feel would be ruined if the exposure was increased. I agree with all your other comments though.

Looking up into the light of the emitting from atop the stairs leading to the basement. It faded as the door closed. Leaving him in the dark. The human of the house had sprayed pesticides down here. Killing his family and friends. Leaving only him. And only him would it would soon be. For the humans first mistake was deciding not to burn the fucking house down.  Honestly really good. My only recommendation is maybe add a bit of color on the body on the outside of your DOF.

photocritique,3az7rq,systemA,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"The whole image is quite grainy.  Since you're on a tripod you should use a longer exposure and lower the ISO, you'll get star tracks but in my opinion it's a small price to pay for clarity.  Also the mask or area brush you're using extends a bit into the sky on the right hand side giving a fringe above the trees.  I'll also second the suggestion to STRAIGHTEN YOUR HORIZON."

They give you a ball park, but you need to look too.  Regardless of whether it actually was slanted, it looks like it is which is all that matters in the end.  The image could also use some color balance, it's pretty shifted towards green and yellow."

photocritique,3azlt2,Sinfathisar,2,Wed Jun 24 19:51:23 2015 UTC,"A few notes:  -I like where you've placed the silos in the frame, sort of a visual punctuation mark.  The start of a story.  Unfortunately the rest of the image doesn't really pay off with anything else to look at.  -Shots like this in black and white can stand quite a bit more contrast. Look at some of Ansel Adam's work particularly Moonrise Over Henderson.  -I'd really push you to make photos like this on days with a more interesting sky.  A big blank grey portion of the picture just isn't fun to look at.  -I love landscapes, particularly those that show the built environment.  Try to think about the issues that are at play in this area (land use, government, industrial agriculture, etc.) and incorporate them into your photos."
photocritique,3azlt2,EtArcadia,2,Wed Jun 24 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Your first point (very well written by the way) made me smile. Every time I take a photo, I attempt to tell a story, convey/provoke emotion, or draw attention to something awe-inspiring. I am certainly working toward that and eventually I'll fit both elements of your first point: tell a story and do so with an interesting subject throughout the photo.  I will definitely take a look at Ansel Adams's work and attempt to pull some insight and inspiration from his stunning photography (thank you for this recommendation).  As to the sky and it's level of detail, I completely agree and understand; looking at the photo with a more dramatic or at least contrast-heavy sky would be so much more pleasing/interesting.

Your going to almost completely white on the upper left and on paper or against a white background as it's displayed on flickr it bleeds off the edge.  I'd either lower the highlights a couple of points or add a black border.
photocritique,3b0fj9,Aeri73,7,Wed Jun 24 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"It's sorta a neat idea, but there are some issues.  Way way too much HDR.  It especially doesn't work for people faces as the increase in local contrast enhancement makes them look blemishy.    You're also using a wide angle lens which is an odd choice for a portrait.  It isn't flattering and in this case makes the man look like he has a tiny head on big body and makes the dog the largest figure in the picture.  The low angle is also a bit much, you're kinda shooting up their noses.  I get that you want a sense of command from the figures but you can achieve this without such an extreme angle.  For some inspiration take a look at Thomas Struth's actual state portrait of the Queen. Here"
photocritique,3b0fj9,EtArcadia,0,Wed Jun 24 23:46:41 2015 UTC,"no HDR used for this photo...   I agree on the angle... but I liked the dog that big I must admit... I wanted him a bit closer to the chair  but the bastard kept running away, lol"
photocritique,3b0fj9,EtArcadia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"Like HDR, double processing is a type of tone mapping and has a very similar effect: ""crunch"".  It's to be avoided or at least used very sparingly in my book, but is a big no no in portraiture.  You really don't want ""crunchy"" faces."

Not sure on this one, As said before the processing seems inappropriate and makes the image unpleasant overall. looking at the shadows, I also think the lighting is quite hard and unflattering. What you have to ask yourself is would these people honestly be happy with the way they look? The composite on the windows is a good idea but is a little to bright and drew my eyes away from the subjects. I cant see the dogs eyes properly and it makes him/her look strange. Id recommend redoing image with softer light and lighter processing"

There doesn't seem to be so much depth in this photo that would require such a high f stop, and in general, if you go too high, you lose sharpness. And 1/40 depending on the camera and lens, is slow enough to give you a shakey image.  I'm looking at it on a phone so it doesn't matter, but I think it's just safer to shoot with a higher shutter speed. I usually don't shoot below 1/120 hand held unless I have to.  But either way, I think it's a cool shot. Though I kinda wish the smoke felt more menacing."
photocritique,3au82o,mrjabrony,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:56:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice! This is the exact kind of help I posted here to get.  I thought the depth was such that f/18 was necessary, but I guess I was wrong.  Thanks!"
photocritique,3au82o,mrjabrony,2,Wed Jun 24 00:08:43 2015 UTC,Cool shot. What is that smoke from? An explosion or something?
photocritique,3au82o,almathden,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yup! It was really weird actually-I spent the day hiking at Mt. Pinatubo, and I expected to get some incredible shots there.  But my two favorite shots were from the return trip, and taken within five minutes of each other.  Our group of 4x4s had to stop in the middle of this valley/plain/I-don't-know-what-to-call-it because (I think? this was not really explained, and the explosion totally took me by surprise) the government was blowing up ammunition less than a km away (again, I think--I'm bad with distances, but that's what someone told me).  In case you're curious, this is the picture of the 4x4s, which gives the above picture some context:https://www.flickr.com/photos/131546487@N04/19056272095/in/dateposted-public/"

photocritique,3avlni,djragemuffin,7,Tue Jun 23 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"Its nice. Warm and fuzzy, like the cat.  Easiest way to improve from here? Framing. You have to look at everything in the frame before you take the shot. You have a bunch of empty space on the right, but you have cut of the cat's feet on the left. Moving your camera a couple of degrees to the left ther would make all the difference. To go a bit further you can use the rule of thirds and put the cat's eye right on that line, instead of close to the middle."

photocritique,3avlni,MajorSuccess,3,Wed Jun 24 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"It's a fine shot. If you're looking for ways to improve, a few things jump out right away. The blown out highlights on the carpet are very, very distracting. The cat seems way over-sharpened, and I'd probably boost the contrast a bit. There's also one spot right in the middle of the frame (around the bottom whiskers, under the chin) that is off color and a different exposure. Not sure if it's just an artifact from lens flare, but you probably could fix it."

I would like to see a little more of a subject though.  Just the tiniest thing might work here, a bridge, a river, something for the viewer to settle on.  You might want to look at the work of Adam Katseff whose working in a similar direction and is getting some great attention recently."
photocritique,3auckb,EtArcadia,2,Tue Jun 23 17:01:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the critique and the reference. I am still trying to find the style which feels true to me and I tend to be drawn to darker and moodier images.  I agree that the photo is lacking a clear subject.
photocritique,3auckb,jackbauer616,2,Wed Jun 24 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Im not a fan of the black at the top which I imagine is the sky, have you tried a crop of less black space or no black space at the top, just curious to see what that would look like"

Most compositions of this mountain have it off the right with the waterfall there down towards the bottom left.  Unfortunately, I just didnt have great light or weather that day. So this is what I came up with."

photocritique,3aud9n,RadiologisttPepper,2,Tue Jun 23 17:36:02 2015 UTC,I like it but I think you might be slightly overusing the negative space. Without being there for the shot it's hard to know but I think ideally I'd like to see the point of the hill/mountain just at or slightly under the center line.
photocritique,3aud9n,moronthatlater,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that. I was trying for something a tiny bit different than the usual. In the foreground, there is a really nice waterfall, then inbetween the mountain and foreground there is a road. I was trying to minimize the road, and I ignored the waterfall because that shot has been done to death by people who have seen it in WAY better light than I had. Unfortunately, I was only there for about half an hour in the middle of the day, and didn't really have very interesting weather or light to play with, so this was my attempt at playing with what I had."
photocritique,3aud9n,sakelazy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:34:59 2015 UTC,Totally understand. Situations don't always make for the best options but we work with what we've got. It's by no means a bad shot at all.
photocritique,3aud9n,sakelazy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:51:15 2015 UTC,I like it. I think you are on to something. It is more evocative when I turn it 90 degrees right. Technically sound from my mobile.

photocritique,3aud9n,Richardmg9,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"Nice! I like the angle you chose here too. Is that a bit past the waterfall, away from the town?  Also, very hard to tell with IR, what time of year was this shot?"

photocritique,3aycdo,TheZenEffect,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"The title sounded more intense than the photo.

photocritique,3awfj7,EtArcadia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"I really like the composition of this photograph, how the weight of the mountain is countered by the spindly tram wires.  The featureless background allows the subjects to stand out perfectly and gives a sense of emptiness, of the mountain standing alone in a void with only a tenuous connection.  There's metaphor operating within this image, it's more than the some of its parts.  The only thing this picture is lacking is something unexpected.  Something like what Roland Barthes called the ""punctum,"" the detail which allows the viewer a deeper emotional connection with the photograph.  Something which turns the viewers expectations on their head.  It's hard to say what that might be given I've only seen one of your pictures and it's kinda asking a lot, but since you seem to have the technical stuff down and already have a solid voice, I think this is the next step."
photocritique,3awfj7,EtArcadia,2,Wed Jun 24 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment. I have never heard of the ""punctum"" term before, I'll surely search more about it later.  When I was at the Concorvado, the mountain next to the sugar loaf, I thought that the tram lines would make an interesting composition for a photo, and since it was a cloudy day, they would stand out more easily on a photo (but sadly we couldn't see much of the city due to the weather). I just stood there, waited to the trams to stand next to each other and took the shot. Even if it's missing a wow factor, I am very happy with the results. If you some spare time and want to check out my other photos you can see them at my Facebook page at my flair (or just click here) or, if you are not a fan of Facebook, I also have a 500px profile.

photocritique,3avvcf,NYCphotog9,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think I'll remove the vignette and maybe bump up the exposure by half a stop. It looks great on my MPB but once I upload it, it seems a but under exposed.   Let me know what you think.   Thanks"
photocritique,3avvcf,EtArcadia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"It is, of course, a very cute picture.  I think you're right about it being slightly underexposed, needs maybe a eighth or quarter stop bump.  Since you're just starting out, I'd encourage you to think about composition.  You've placed your subject in the direct center of the image, which is the obvious choice, but not necessarily the best.  You could try using the rule of thirds and place the subject to one side or the other.  You'll also want to think about distance.  This is a ""medium shot"" or ""mid-shot,"" not a close up and not quite a wide shot where the subject's whole body is in frame.  Personally I prefer either wide or close, either focusing only on the subject's expression or focusing on the subject's interaction with the environment.   Your choice to blur the background with a shallow depth of field is a good one and does well to separate the subject from what's behind her.  You've caught her in sort of a silly moment, do you think she'd like this picture?  How about when she is 12?  Funny kid picks are ok, but it's just something to think about."

photocritique,3avz7g,f0t0fan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:05:28 2015 UTC,I like it a lot and think it's good that you isolated the flamingo.  Nice bokeh and it looks sharp especially around the eye. I can't tell for sure though because of the small image resolution.  I love the drop of water. It gives it the something special to stand out from other flamingo pictures.  Really great job!
photocritique,3ax43d,PM_ME_YOUR_TITTIESSS,2,Wed Jun 24 05:12:08 2015 UTC,I would suggest a faster shutter speed to make sure your subjects are sharp. From the EXIF it looks like you're running up against a lack of light. The only real solution in this case is a faster lens - there's a reason sports pros all shoot with f/2.8 or f/2 lenses.
photocritique,3ax43d,Matchstix,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:36:22 2015 UTC,It's blurry. Is that all shutter speed or a focus issue too?
photocritique,3ax43d,R101C,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:06:06 2015 UTC,shutter speed mostly. They are moving too fast.
photocritique,3ax43d,MrLightR,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"With the equipment you had, this may have been the best shot you could have taken of this.  Poor lighting and a slow lens....  Your panning skills were the only thing that saved this shot."
photocritique,3ax43d,MrLightR,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:46:41 2015 UTC,well I only shot with 1/50. So if in wasnt so late in the day I probably could have shot with a faster shutter speed.

photocritique,3auh39,Sosayslori,2,Tue Jun 23 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"Partly because I like the effect of having the face right in focus with the blurred background.  The other part is because I am an amateur and don't always make the best decisions.  I was waist deep in water trying to get this shot, it seemed like the best option at the time to compensate for me being in a darker area"
photocritique,3auh39,Sosayslori,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:36:53 2015 UTC,I like the shallow depth of field. We don't care about the leaves.  The background would be a hell of a lot more distracting if it was a bunch of sharp ass leaves. I like the shot as is.  And the spots on the picture is sensor dust not the lens. It's really rare for lens dust to show up in a shot. Light for the most part bends around it. Clean the sensor first and don't waste time on the lenses. :)

photocritique,3atusb,EtArcadia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:05:42 2015 UTC,Not all that excited about the content.  Seen shots like this so many times.    I'd like to see the composition a little tighter on the rocks in the foreground.   You should use lens correction to straighten the distorted horizon.

photocritique,3atusb,MajorSuccess,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"There is a LOT of chromatic aberration in this image. I also feel like you could have cut off some of the right side, since it's just empty space. Personally, it doesn't do much for me, but it's a pretty nice shot. I think there's too much sky - you would have been better off applying the rule of thirds with the foreground instead of the sky."
photocritique,3avg1c,c_relleno,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"I like these kinds of shots of mountain faces, they can have a strong sense of the sublime.  That being said, I'd strongly encourage you to think more about lighting.  Half the picture is in shade while the other half is in harsh midday light, not a great combo.  Try shooting right around sunrise or sunset, the so called ""golden hours.""  My personal favorite for landscapes is 20 minutes after sunset when the sun is completely down and the scene is lit only with the soft light reflected from the sky (you'll need a tripod in this low light).     This also looks like it was taken with a phone camera.  Nothing necessarily wrong with that, but landscapes like these need resolution.  It's just barely holding up at the low resolution you've displayed them here."
photocritique,3awvsq,XJ_Tyler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"Looks like you tried to hand-hold a shit with a slow shutter speed.   If you are shooting handheld, it a really good rule of thumb to shoot (at the VERY least) twice as fast as the length of your lens.   By that logic you will always want to shoot at least 1/100 when shooting @ 50mm and 1/200 when shooting @ 100mm.  This is a good starting place and something to keep in mind.   Take a look at this write up on shooting for sharp images. It is a lot of information but will take you down the path of much sharper images.   Also, when shooting landscapes: Use a tripod.  Tripod = more stability = lower ISO = better image quality = sharper image."
photocritique,3awvsq,nubbled21,2,Wed Jun 24 04:39:40 2015 UTC,Thanks a million! Was worried no one was gunna give me pointers. This was the top of a 11.4 mile hike I had my camera with me. I'm a fat kid wasn't about to hike my tripod in for a shot. Just was a spur the moment deal. But yeah I'm not sure what mm I was shooting. I wanted the water drag but I guess holding perfectly still for almost a full second kinda did make it not that sharp. I'm new so I thought I looked pretty darn good but now looking at it I could've done better
photocritique,3awvsq,scull9256,2,Wed Jun 24 04:46:53 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a tripod, you can always look around for a fallen tree or stump to set the camera on. Set a timer to capture and line it up best you can."

photocritique,3aspgn,Dawrt,3,Tue Jun 23 08:39:41 2015 UTC,"Adobe Lightroom is pretty easy to use and learn.  I think the image itself is a good start, but as others have commented, you should edit it to make it pop more and maybe even change the drab feeling of the background.  I think this image would have worked better if the subject was on the left 1/3 of the image, since it's looking up at to the right, which points your eyes that way, but it kind of goes no where because the edge of the image is right there."

Get a tripod or monopod if you don't have one already this helps also.  Ppl will probably banned me for saying this but if you are not shooting in RAW (You should be shooting in RAW if you want to be serious it allows you greater editing power), windows media center has an ok tool to do basic edits.

photocritique,3aspgn,InfernoTurnip,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"Looks a lot like a kingfisher. I would go back and try to get more pics of him- I assume you were near water? If not, find the closest body of water and try to find him fishing. You'll need 1/1000 or faster depending on how much light you have, but action shots of king fishers are pretty incredible. They basically dive bomb under water fish and fully submerge before rocketing back out with a fish in their beak.   You are really lucky to have randomly spotted and photographed this particular bird. The composition here is fairly plain, like a snapshot. But it is somewhat interesting how he is looking up and you could crop better to emphasize their distinctive beak (tighter and portrait rather than landscape). Think also about how to maximize the blue and orange, which are complimentary and again- very distinctive to king fishers."
photocritique,3aspgn,kickstand,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:54:30 2015 UTC,Yes it is actually a Kingfisher. This was shot while I was sitting in a boat going through the mangroves in the backwaters of Kerala (India). The guide took the boat as close as possible to the bird without scaring him away. I really only had less than a minute in which I took 6 or 7 shots before it flew away. I wish I had the opportunity to take an action shot though.  Thank you for the inputs.
photocritique,3awrqw,JECN,3,Wed Jun 24 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"I like the composition but the skin tones ruin it. They aren't natural. Maybe the whitebalance was off. I notice when I adjust white balance in non raw shots in post, it gets a similar sickly tone. Maybe the lighting there? It feels like it would be a nice Facebook profile picture but it lacks much interest to my eye as a photograph."
photocritique,3awrqw,TheKillerPupa,4,Wed Jun 24 04:26:31 2015 UTC,"You do not have a color correction problem as much as you have a saturation problem.  Original  Things to notice:  1) the white and the black point are very nearly neutral.  The AB values shown need to 0 in order for it to be completely neutral.  But what this shows its that overall the frame is color correct.    2) Next notice the skin tone hue clocks. Almost all of them are pointed to between 12 and 1 o'clock this is generally a suitable range for Caucasian skin tones as there is no exact value you can shoot for.   I created a mask based on the skin tones and then reduced the saturation of just the skin tones Saturation  Notice here that the hue clocks have not moved the color stayed the same it is just less saturated.  Here is a final result.  AMMV as the low res image posted left some artifacts in the mask.  Final  You can always get the color closer if you choose good neutral points.  Mid-tone gray is not the only choice you have.  Bright whites, true blacks and deep shadows all can be used to set the color balance.  Additional edit:  More infomation"

I've just been so damn busy with work that I haven't had a chance to get to more photos.  You definitely made an interesting point though, that the context in the title completely changes the way the photo is perceived.

photocritique,3au7uz,skalex,12,Tue Jun 23 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"Brutal it is:  This is a very weak composition.  The primary elements of the photo are all bunched up on top of each other in one half of the picture leaving dead space, including a whole lot of out of focus area, in the other half.  Since cameras flatten the world it's good to avoid overlapping objects as much as possible.  I'd move the candle to the left side of the image to give better balance.  The framing is also very tight on the bottom, where the plate almost abuts the edge of the frame, not necessarily a bad thing, but it's out of balance with the framing at the top.  Overall I'd say you need to get closer (a common problem with beginners).  The table and the background don't offer anything, fill the frame with the subject.   There's nice light here so I can see why you wanted to make the shot, but it ended up quite dark in the right hand corner where you lose detail and get a weighty heavy feeling on that side of the image.  As for content from a product/food photography perspective, you have some problems. The paper plate is cheap and boring looking and the danish isn't all that well lit, needs brightening.  But the biggest problem is the hand.  What is it doing?  It looks like it got lost on the way to a wrist watch shoot and now it's fondling my danish.  Either have the hand doing something active like picking up or tearing apart the danish or better yet, don't have it at all.  Hands touching food is usually avoided in food photography for the same reason people  swallowing food is avoided in food commercials, it's a little gross.  In terms of deconstruction, textually this is a tedious image on its own.  A posed manicured hand with prominent wedding ring reaches for and tentatively touches a piece of decadent food while a candle burns weakly in the background.  What is this supposed to be about? Upper middle class food?  Marriage?  Female body image?  All these elements are present in the picture but in a haphazard fashion, they're unresolved and their cliche arrangement does not produce any kind of constructive ambiguity.  The image clumsily uses some tropes from advertising (shallow depth of field, soft lighting, etc.), but ends up feeling more of a snap shot than anything else; an attempt to capture and fix some moment in your life; uninteresting to virtually everyone but you.  This is an image that is lost in a sea of nearly identical instagram and facebook posts, clinging to a handful of polite ""likes"".  If you really dig down you have to ask yourself if the whole scene is actually compelling even for you or does it just bare some passing similarity to some advertisement that once left you with a feeling of lack.  You asked for brutal, but don't be discouraged.  You found some nice light, you have a great camera, compelling imagery is the next step and if you have the drive you'll get it."

Thanks again.

photocritique,3au7uz,Cha0sfox,2,Wed Jun 24 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"Beginner here too, so take everything I say with a pinch of salt.  First the subject matter is a little boring and doesn't really draw in my eye or interest me. Food pic's are a little over done.  The focus seems to be on the hand rather than the food with only the centre of the danish being in focus.  The bokeh looks nice, but because the star of the pic should be the food and its not fully in focus it just looks off.  I also might of asked the model/person to turn their wrist slightly so the wrist bone thingy isnt quite as pronounced.   Composition looks nice though."
photocritique,3au7uz,mbaran23,2,Tue Jun 23 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Some people may find food shots boring or unoriginal, but I disagree. It's nice to catalogue different foods you've experienced while traveling. This may be a nice memory for you and that's all that matters. For the critique, I would pay attention to the histogram, the shot is underexposed and by making these adjustments the image already appears more flattering. You can further the editing by adjusting curves, color palette, etc. But as you are a beginner I think this is a great point to start. Learn to master the main adjustments: highlights, shadows, setting the white and black point (hold down alt when moving the slider), exposure, WB, etc. Then move on to the next set of adjustments. Hope this helps."

We have a pretty standard ""man confronted with nature"" romanticist image, an image we've all seen before, but it's subverted by the cable in the sky.  We live in a world where the manmade and the natural are in tension essentially everywhere.  Personally I think it's a mistake to intentionally attempt to refuse this tension, but it's a mistake that's made in reams of photography."

photocritique,3as2ax,scrote_inspector,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"It is mostly the water, which makes up half the shot. The water just isn't interesting, so why should it dominate the picture? The rest of the elements aren't enough to make it feel balanced. I'd rather look at the model or other scenery instead.  What are you trying to communicate with this picture? All this photo has to say to me is ""legs"". I'm getting some atmosphere too (which I think you convey well given how little you show), but this image doesn't have a message, isn't particularly beautiful simply for the sake of beauty, doesn't tell a story, doesn't challenge the viewer, etc. At the absolute least, I'd like to see more of the model. Her pose and styling and maybe some props could go a long way towards telling a fantasy story.  Anyway, I think you're on the right track here. Kudos for creating some atmosphere; do you have other images from this shoot that might be interesting?"

photocritique,3as2ax,scrote_inspector,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:33:32 2015 UTC,"I think the ones where you can see the model's face are the most promising. I particularly like the head and shoulders portrait. These are pretty much all underexposed, but that can be adjusted in post. One thing I noticed (and I still struggle with this too) is that you tend to put the subject dead in the center of the picture. This can work sometimes, but it's more interesting visually to have them elsewhere. A lot of people will vertically and horizontally center a person's head in photos, leaving a ton of negative space above them. I usually try to get their head or eyes touching or intersecting the top third line (rule of thirds is a good place to start practicing composition).  Maybe try playing with different crops and definitely play with the exposures on these. One thing that has really helped me with values and exposure is to change the image to grayscale. Is there a good distribution of values, ex. some white, some black, and enough grays? Play with the image in grayscale until you're satisfied and change it back to color. You may be surprised by the results!"
photocritique,3as2ax,scrote_inspector,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"I don't understand. I intentionally underexposed them because I knew the style I was going to aim for with. I shot raw so yes there's room to fix it, but I was aiming for /u/bleeblu 's style of portraits. Uncomfortable, cold, dead. Obviously I didn't mimic it exactly, but I was pleased with the direction I went. Also, I don't quite know if I would want to put my subjects anywhere but center. Putting them on one of the thirds of the photo would make them more a piece of the scenery, which is not the aim of the face shots. The ""awkward"" shot is in that style, however I ignored the rule of thirds with that shot I believe.   Edit: looking back on it it seems ""awkward"" does appear to follow the rule of thirds to a degrees  Anyway thank you for looking them over and giving critique!"

Maybe it's because I'm on mobile, but I'm not seeing photo submission in their  history.  These photos are anything but cold and dead. If anything, I'm seeing warm and alive. You can't put such an active model in warm weather clothes in the middle of a verdant forest during the day and expect anyone to read it as cold and dead without really going all out on the creepiness factor, and these aren't the slightest bit creepy. Maybe the ham one is a little, but mostly just because the food looks really unappetizing. The closest you get to ""cold"" is the legs shot, but I'd say the posing suggests only a slight spring chill at best. Because these photos look so ""warm"", especially with the warm filters you used, the underexposure looks accidental, not deliberate.   You're free to disagree with me about the center placement; like I said, it can work, but such placement is a frequent beginner mistake, and that's what this looks like here. I think it works okay with the one where the model is turning backward to look at the camera, but only because you have such strong leading lines; I still think that one suffers from way too much negative space above her head."

Maybe he can point you towards some tutorials. I'd like to know how he does some of those composites too!  I can understand getting defensive, don't worry--I get a little touchy sometimes too. I try to be constructive with my criticism, but honestly, if you start taking classes and want to go pro, you are going to encounter far more scathing and far less constructive criticism than I've ever seen on this subreddit.

photocritique,3av95v,venomtruck,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"This picture seems like it's being torn between being a landscape and a detail and just can't pull them off at the same time.  There's a lot going on in this picture but I think it fails to gel into a compelling shot.  There are likely interesting Edward Weston style details on the rocks, the patterns in the sand and shells, but given how small they are in the frame they don't come through.  The same goes for the waves and big piece of drift wood or whatever it is sticking out of the water in the background.  Each of the elements might make a good photograph individually but when they're all forced to share a frame, along with a whole lot of featureless sand they don't come across well.    Speaking more generally, I'd try to tighten up your composition as well.  There's way too much out of focus sand in the absolute foreground."
photocritique,3av95v,EtArcadia,0,Wed Jun 24 01:13:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. And I agree on all points. This was more or less a test post to see if there were any serious people on this sub. As for the pic, snapped it on the beach with an iPhone. Spur of the moment kinda deal."
photocritique,3auyxz,Omariamariaaa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:44:14 2015 UTC,What kind of camera are you using?  This looks blurry and is heavily artifacted from jpeg compression.  Is this a crop of larger image?    Avoid overlapping objects.  Photos flatten things and these two bird merge together into a mutant.  It's a very common beginner mistake.
photocritique,3auyxz,EtArcadia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"Nikon coolpix p530. It only shoots in JPEG, sadly. And it is a crop, I thought the subjects needed to be closer. Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it!"
photocritique,3auyxz,EtArcadia,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:50 2015 UTC,You definitely don't have the horsepower for shots like these with that kind of camera.  It can make fine pictures but not of these subjects.  Avoid heavy cropping at all costs.

photocritique,3aqg4u,MrJezzaaah,6,Mon Jun 22 23:03:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. Angkor Wat needs to be well defined to make this photo significant. Just needs to be lower and closer as stated above.
photocritique,3aqg4u,Watergrip,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"Separation focuses on the subject, properly framed at f/5 or f4.5 would serve for a better image. If you just wanted the building, don't include the human, if you want the human, focus on them"
photocritique,3aqg4u,BI0WEED,2,Tue Jun 23 00:51:21 2015 UTC,The point of this image is to have both boy and building. I think that is pretty obvious. This is landscape image with foreground and background. Angle could be better though.
photocritique,3aqg4u,masterbeer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:13:32 2015 UTC,You would still have both of those elements in the image with a better looking setup. f/4.5 on a crop wouldn't separate the image to an extent where the background would be unrecognizable
photocritique,3aqg4u,BI0WEED,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"Or maybe the photographer wanted to capture the human, in the specific setting that he was in.

Not all subjects need bokeh behind them... The main criticism I have is that the image feels heavy on the left side. If the boy was on the lower right, it might feel a little more balanced. Although that may cause his head to move away from in front of those intersecting lines of the shore and boat, which I like. X marks the spot!"

There's something white in the bottom right background that needs fixing. But I really like the water and the petals. Pink and green are nice colors- maybe bring some shadows up.   The DOF is a bit shallow for my taste- I like to shoot f9 or f10 for this sort of thing and then adjust depth of field by moving closer or further back / adjusting my zoom.

If you're using Lightroom and don't know this trick, you should also take a look at your white and black points. If you hold the option key while moving the slider right or left (for white and black respectively) it will show you how much is coming through. This is a great technique for getting your contrast balance set. Obviously you want to check the effect on the photo rather than trusting just this technique, but it helps.  Overall it looks very neutral to me and I'd like to see more contrast. The highlights and whites seem especially dulled (maybe a cloudy day?)."

photocritique,3aqexg,leftlooserighttight,3,Mon Jun 22 17:44:51 2015 UTC,"Reminds me a bit of the famous Winogrand backflip especially being black and white, nice moment. Good use of photography's ability to freeze action and create a sort of magic scene where people hover head down.   What's actually most interesting to me are all the people photographing along with you. Almost everyone in the background has a camera out.  There's probably a security camera filming this too. What does this say about the decisive moment in the age of the digital camera?    Compositionally I think it's a little tight.  I don't love how the bending figures have there legs and hands cut off.  I think that movement needs a bit more room to breathe.  One of the performers on the far left has a compelling expression but he's cut off.  I am correct in assuming that this was taken with the long end of a zoom lens?  The space gets compressed here and it causes the people in the background to be larger than they could be.  I understand it's not always possible to get closer to the action, but here this might work better as a wider shot."
photocritique,3aqexg,EtArcadia,2,Mon Jun 22 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"The great thing about this kind of photography is you don't need to worry so much about composition, as long as the action is well foregrounded and the picture is clear. You've even avoided the standard issue of taking the shot from chest/eye height and used the background well for context. Street photogaphy shouldn't look overly composed, in my opinion. I think your shot is fantastic as is."
photocritique,3aqexg,oakum_ouroboros,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"For me it's way too tight. A shot like this isn't just about the subject, it's also about the surrounding environment, I think you should have opened up to include more of the crowd and the legs chopped off at the bottom, that really bugs me. A wider lens, 24mm, even, would have served you well here, opened everything out and added a lot of drama.  It's also not sharp.  it does have the potential to be a strong shot, you just need to work on the composition and focus."

photocritique,3aqe65,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to the  areas of the picture that are pure black with no detail: under his left nostril, left ear, left eyebrow etc.  This is also called ""shadow clipping."" Since you shot in RAW and only raised the exposure a quarter stop in PS there's probably some detail to be recovered in the file.  Using PS's RAW processor you could lift the shadows to the point where they are no longer clipped (the clipping warning function is useful for this).  Once you have an unclipped file you can tweak the contrast without losing the shadow detail. It's a subtle detail but will improve the picture and would be important if you plan to print."

photocritique,3aqe65,foxandowl,3,Mon Jun 22 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"I was in a room with very little natural light and a few lamps were on that were not too bright. I brought some extra lighting with me (65 Watt Fluorescent Daylight bulbs). For this particular shot, I think my wife was just holding one light maybe 6-8 feet away from the subject to his right. Exposure was set to 1/20 with F stop of 5.6 and ISO at 400. He was up against a wooden door. In Photoshop I desaturated the image, brought exposure up slightly (+.2), increased the contrast (+90), reduced the highlights (-35), increased the shadows (+15), increased the white level (+15), decreased the black level (-10), and increased the clarity (+25) [These are all RAW settings in Photoshop]. Also, I as using a Canon Rebel T3i.  I am in no way a professional and this is the first time I actually used the lights I bought, so I still have a lot to learn on how to use them effectively. However, these shots pretty much turned out exactly as I had envisioned them in my head, so I was happy."

Do you have a frame without it?  I really like the color you've got here however the cinematic frame isn't working for me.

Plus the direction of the sunlight is pretty strong and it doesn't seem like you were making an effort to work with that; can barely see blue shirt's face.   It's hard to give these ""20/20 hindsight"" critiques. I'd just encourage you to take your time in the moment and after snapping this shot, maybe asking the guys if they mind you taking a closer shot- there's a lot you could do by being in closer and several steps to the left to minimize the car.

photocritique,3apr17,Geruvah,4,Mon Jun 22 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that this picture is laden with symbolism (9/11, American flag, NYC etc.) and people are going to react to it in different ways.  When you publicize a photo like this you are making a statement don't be surprised if you get a reaction particularly in a global setting.  Beyond that, while it is technically reasonably competent with a solid composition, it's a pretty bland image with nothing unexpected about it.  If you're after purely technical criticism, I'll say that they color balance is way off towards the magenta."

photocritique,3ar9wr,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:25:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for feedback. I'm experimenting lately with capturing movement in pictures and find his pose, albeit static, embodying exactly that - movement. You don't know what he's doing/will do/has done; his torzo seems to be turning, his hands doing something. This very thing, the thing you said you're scratching your head about, is the thing I like most about this picture. Plus, his face is kind of badass. But I agree that in this 'grand aspiration' to capture motion in pictures, his gesture isn't exactly 'the embodyment of motion'. But hey, I'm practicing :)"
photocritique,3ar9wr,KDShark,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:21:06 2015 UTC,"What he's doing is thinking about what it would be like to cold cock that foreigner with the camera  :)  Agree his expression is bad ass. I would want to emphasize that. It's actually not as hard as it seems to get people involved in candid photos by talking with them and then asking for permission to shoot them (harder if you dont speak the language). One way to do this in foreign places is approach casually-- ask for directions someplace or ask what is in that building (""is this a restaurant""). you have to build a little rapport to get the most out of people, but that's what you want to do. Because it allows you to tell their story through the photo- which is what good photos can do.   All this is just encouragement to you to keep exploring the idea of 'motion' and expression. Some folks develop the notion that photographers have to become like ninjas or snipers to sneak around and get the good stuff without the subject realizing it. I go totally the opposite direction and it works. Sure, some people are going to start posing and ruin it if you simply ask ""hey can i photograph you"". But if you do it right, you'll make a friend, hear a story or two and then the camera comes out last. Keep it stowed in a bag until its time to shoot-- way easier to meet people that way. And then when you have the picture in mind, you can be subtle about it and say ""hey, this is a cool building, I think I'd like a picture.. no, no - keep standing there I'd  like you in it too 'for scale' or some BS""."

Doing that will allow the darker areas to have the most detail. Then in post bring the sky down and everything else up as needed.   You could also use a graduated ND filter to darken the sky yet leave the ground lighter.   Or you could do HDR.

If it's intentional I don't really get it and it's a little too tight to give the book much attention.  If it's just a back drop its distracting."

I think the most important thing to learn in photography is composition. A camera does not see exactly how you see. You, being a human, simply ignore what is not important in the picture; a camera sees everything in front of it. Hence, the pictures on the wall in the background might have been ignored by your brain as you saw your composition, but the camera saw them, and the result is a distraction in the background.

I think of black and white a lot the same as I do the preprogrammed filters that are available everywhere and I think they are used as a major crutch to mask other things. Try to perfect getting good color/contrast/exposure on your own and then when you have that, you'll be ready to use techniques like B&W well."

photocritique,3aqdbp,TheDogShouterer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see what you mean. For me the big difference is that shooting black and white on film meant that you were shooting with B&W in mind every single frame. For me the B&W I have used is normally some preset in lightroom that I am clicking through and I think, ""Wow, that looks different, maybe better."" In my case it seems it was a way to get around actually making my images what I wanted them to be and instead making due with what a preset could do."
photocritique,3aqdbp,iSpenc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:31:36 2015 UTC,"I never do that. I just shoot the shot, subject in mind and think about how it's going to look later. The decision to make it monochrome or not is made based on what's going to work best for it.  I don't think I've ever used Lightroom presets. I've saved them from time to time but then they've never worked for anything but the shot they were originally made on, so now I don't bother."
photocritique,3aqdbp,TheDogShouterer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:20:37 2015 UTC,"""shoot the shot, subject in mind""   Yes- this is good advice. Too much focus on post processing now. It's almost like composition has become secondary and when it is discussed, it is discussed against a rote set of guidelines (rule of thirds, level horizons, etc etc). I'm encouraged to see another old school mentality.   For OP's picture I think the B&W works, but I question the depth of field. Why shy away from the picture frames in the background? That seems to be relevant to the composition-- I feel like it had to be intentional to present the lenses and the finished product in the frame-- so I don't like the framed photos this blurry. You could also have put another little ""photographic tool"" in the foreground instead of the 3rd lens. But some people like symmetry and seeing things in 3's so-- whaever.

photocritique,3aqdbp,KDShark,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"For my mind I think there's too much obsession with quality and not enough whether the shot is actually any good. I see endless discussions about sharpness, 'bokeh' (screams silently) and nit-picking about which is the best lens and not a huge amount else. Somebody - I can't remember who it was but he was good - once said that an obsession with quality is an easy procrastination for those incapable of making pictures. I don't think that's always unfair.  I'm going off on one, aren't I. I'll stop or I'll start on 'boudoir' ... Jeez, there's a thing for someone who's given up on life.

I hear ya man- give me fresh ideas over a well executed checklist of ""elements of a good and proper photo""  I like only 3 things about digital photography 1) instantaneous feedback in the viewfinder 2) almost unlimited storage capacity (ie film) 3) ability to share photos online and exchange ideas.   It is really mind boggling to me that so many people here waste that with negativity and debate over BS ""you're photo sucks because xyz and I'll debate you on every point rather than try to help you out--- blah blah."""

I've had this for awhile but my friend in the photo was grossly underexposed and couldn't brighten him without a a lot of noise so I gave up on it. I was bored yesterday and started playing around with it in post and thought it looked great as a silhouette.
photocritique,3aq3va,Gwinn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"The clouds are interesting, but the silhouette just does not work for me. A silhouette needs some instantly recognizable posture / shape that tells a story or is interesting.  Also, there is no need to shoot with f5.6 and 1/2000, as I assume you wanted the clouds to also be in focus. F11 and 1/500 will give the same exposure and keep everything sharp."

The silhouetted figure isn't doing anything or posing in an interesting way.  What is he texting or something?  His legs are cut off at the mid thigh, not always a great choice.  The pole next to him also splits the image in an artless way without adding anything and whatever it is that is sticking down from the top of the frame is hard to read and distracting."

I am during this summer trying to complete my thesis in Serious Games, such as game based learning, edutainment or games for a serious purpose other than only entertainment. I would like your help to take my survey. (http://thesis.theden.se/)     I have chosen to post this on this subreddit, with the blessing of the mods. And I do think thigs subreddit is great for my survey, considering that this subreddit is focused on critique, and this is something that I am exploring in my thesis.    My goal is to explore what kinds of interactions are motivating when it comes to giving feedback and critique, in this case I have chosen to use already determined options for the user to choose from.    This survey is divided into to parts, the first part is a small demonstration of a system which contains 10 photos, you as the participant are going to evaluate these with the help of the categories which exists on the site. After you have been evaluating these photos, you will then be linked to a Google Survey, this survey is 4 pages, the last page is optional and lets you share what you might think is good for this system.    Short list: * Evaluate 10 photos on the site * And follow the link to the Google Survey    If you know anyone that would like to take the survey, feel free to pass on the link to them.    Feel free to take your time; http://thesis.theden.se/    I would very much love you to participate.    Regards, Jet_Nebula.    Ps. I also think that is important to note that I am not the owner of the photos found in the survey, they were found a public domain library."

This looks like it was done with natural lighting, which is great, but it would probably be much better if you shot from the other direction so the light was cast on her face rather than her back.  Window light is great, use it!  The pose is also unnatural.  She has the nervous ""I'm doing what you say"" look as she puts her hands on a wall for no apparent reason.  Keep shooting, let her relax and get used to the camera, find a moment when she lets her guard down her personality comes through.  It takes time and a lot of shots, thank god for digital.  I know some photographers who used to shot a ""roll"" with no film in it before they started to actually shoot.  Also, though it's outside of your requested critique for pose and lighting; those finger nails need to be redone especially if you are going to use a pose that emphasizes the hands so much."

It was the first thing I looked at.. lol ) Once she feels more relaxed she will be easier to shoot also have her Look at the Camera and not at you. It works sometimes but not in this Picture. I am sure as she relaxes it would look a lot better with her not looking at the camera :)
photocritique,3aqyhu,btherese77,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:00:26 2015 UTC,"Aside from her pose being unnatural, she needs to learn her angles.   Her neck is probably long and beautiful but she's turning it in a way that scrunches up her body and is not flattering.

photocritique,3apm92,gamma-ray-bursts,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"Much better. But you can o Ly crop so far. You see, in macro shots you want to show the subject as obviously as you want. Since typically the background is going to to be very blurred because of the shallow depths of fields associated with macro/close ups."
photocritique,3aqu3c,tvojastara_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"Can you provide exposure parameters when you get the chance?  You've found a nice place here, and the lines do a nice job keeping the viewer in the frame - a common problem is to have lines that wander out of the frame, but here lines that are leaving intersect with other lines, letting the viewer coast back into the image.  I'm not totally sold on the use of HDR in this image. The central hallway is blown out, which HDR should avoid. This can sort of puzzle the viewer; with the center so tremendously bright, the rest of the items should be lit as though the light is mostly coming from the center. I think letting the darker areas die down a bit would also add a bit to the sense of mystery.   This area leads the viewer to ask all sorts of questions about the people who were here, what they were thinking, how it must have felt to be in this place in a time of war. But the HDR treatment exposes all the shadows, showing every brick and every beam with perfect clarity. Of course, this is a very personal opinion. As a documentary photo, it's nice to show all the detail, and that could be what you want this photo to represent.   On a technical side, you've got serious converging verticals from tilting the camera up. This puts the viewer in the shoes of someone who is falling over backwards, adding an unwelcome sense of tension and imbalance to a photo that is otherwise very static and permanent. You can correct this in many programs (with some loss of image quality) and keeping your vertical lines vertical would, I think, improve this image substantially. You can also take a very wide lens, shoot it parallel to the ground, and then crop out the bottom of the picture."

A really basic concept of photography is the rule of thirds. If you haven't heard of it, go read about it online somewhere.   I would have put the dog on the right third of the frame since it's looking off to the left.   Instead of using the adjustment brush, maybe mess with the shadows instead? That probably would give you the same effect without giving you the glowing edges.   Last thing. ISO 800 and 1/3200 doesn't make a whole lot of sense in direct sunlight."

It's a common mistake to try and used filters and processing to make boring pictures appear interesting.    This picture occupies a middle ground between an environmental shot that's about the dog and its location and a close up portrait.  You should pick one.  If it's about the dog then get up close to it.  If it's about a dog by a pool than back off a little and get all of the dog in the shot with some more background.   Also watch out for the background.  Whatever it is that's in the pool looks like it's coming out of the dog's head.  Especially given the pink color."

It gives a very artificial look that just isn't that compelling from my perspective.  The technical execution is great.  Perhaps a little bright for my taste, but this could be interesting in the right context.  It looks like you have a mastery over your equipment so I'd push you to add something more to your pictures.  What is this trying to say?  Is this about public transportation?  Advertising? City life?  Right now it feels very empty, maybe a little lonely, but mostly it feels like a technical exercise rather than a photo."

photocritique,3aq73b,Gwinn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"There is honestly not much of interest in this picture. I don't think you can significantly improve it by shooting with different settings / composing slightly differently. One thing would be a more interesting sky (day with some clouds or blue hour). And then just walking around the station and finding an interesting subject and angle. Right now there is nothing in the picture which would say ""this is why I took it"""
photocritique,3alog1,ezzif,16,Sun Jun 21 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"Great job.   A few small things: the horizon is intersecting her head.  A slightly different composition would fix this.   Also,  the lighting appears natural and good up top,  but fades out fast on her lower half.  I am assuming this is clam shell lighting,  with each light to each side,  right? I would have considered a 3/4 or less shot.  She's got that fake smile going.  You know what I'm talking about :). Entice her.  Get her to open up.  IMHO expression is very important!"
photocritique,3alog1,cl0ckwork,7,Sun Jun 21 16:42:37 2015 UTC,Where (generally) should the horizon intersect in a shot like this?

photocritique,3alog1,cl0ckwork,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"She's got that fake smile going.    At 100% you can see the eye creases, so it's hard to tell.

Though what others haven't been saying, that irks me, is the processing. There is artifacts of trying to pull some blues out of the sky on the horizon line, and some things that just look unnatural, maybe some heavy noise reduction, I'm not too sure. For me, it looks a little too processed."

photocritique,3alog1,Rye631,2,Sun Jun 21 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"The whole thing is too bright.  Usually this lighting is used to make the background dimmer on a bright day, making the subject appear more luminescent.

photocritique,3alog1,unsolicited_critique,2,Sun Jun 21 20:03:40 2015 UTC,The color and lighting is great. Though the framing is very simple. Creates a clean image which might be what your going for but it lacks some complexity which could make it more interesting.
photocritique,3alog1,autopornbot,2,Sun Jun 21 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Even though you asked:  Very nice. Straightforward pose and framing for a full-length, which work fine here, but a bit safe.  It is not very clear what contribution the off-camera flash is making. Perhaps this could have looked more interesting with ambient at -1 EV, especially with all the specular sunlight reflections in the water? Basically what Neil vN discusses here: http://neilvn.com/tangents/flash-photography-techniques/dragging-the-shutter/  Shutter speed of 1/2000, so you were using remote high-speed sync? That is going to eat a lot of the flash power already, especially at ISO 100, so maybe the ambient light was too much for two 430EX II flashes to overpower. Here's another Neil vN article on flash in sunlight: http://neilvn.com/tangents/shooting-in-bright-sunlight-with-flash/  I definitely agree with /u/cl0ckwork's comment about the horizon. To answer /u/ItsMeLewisP's question, when faced with the situation, pre-visualization is key. Move around position and heignt and see how you can move things around in the frame relative to each other. For this location, getting lower would have moved the terrain in the background lower in the frame. Another example would be to back up and zoom in to 70mm (maximum length on the lens used) to slightly blur the background more.  As I always say, if it's a good enough photo of someone you care about, and they like the image, that is a perfectly valid measure of success."
photocritique,3alog1,Eloykwik,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"The way the mountains frame her head is a little awkward. A longer lens with a larger aperture would probably cure that. The light is a little bit hard but still flat, if that makes sense. I would use some variation in the brightness on each side instead of evenly lighting both, and use a largish diffuser on one or both. Her dress looks a little blown out, but that could be my monitor.   Sorry that was all harsh criticism - I like the composition, her pose, and you caught a good moment. The other things I mentioned could just improve on it a little."

The ambiguous moments captured in the others forces the viewer to fill in heaps of missing information.  They start to approach a Rorschach test, where the narrative added by the viewer is more important than the picture itself.    They remind me of surveillance photographs made by law enforcement, they're voyeuristic and a tread a good line between the creepy and mundane.    I'd ditch the grain and toning.  I know you are going for a cinematic look but I think you can achieve that without distracting affectation.  The wide format is enough to me.  Use actual film if you want it to look like film.  Things to look at if you haven't:  Cindy Sherman, Untitled Film Stills.  Similar evocation of cinematography, but they're self portraits.  Super good.  Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, Heads.  Similarly voyeuristic since the people were tripping the shutter themselves without realizing it. Also super good."

I'm trying to move away from ""grading"" my photos rather than just correcting for exposure and such but I enjoy it too much. I like my photos better when I find a nice stylistic look for them.

I agree with that tweaking philosophy. Believe me these are a whole lot more more tamed than looks I'd been experimenting with recently as far as ""style"" goes. For a while there I was getting stuck with the whole raising the shadow curve and crushing blacks to insane levels. At least I'm somewhat maintaining blacks heh!  I was going for a bit of a 16mm film look with this as I believe it's a nice aesthetic but the second I turn the split-toning (yellow highs/pink lows) and grain off the photos look pretty normal as far as colour grades go so my ""affectation"" goes as far as a subtle split tone - but I do understand how easy it is to make a photo look gaudy."

The one post that is actually in focus is over halfway hidden.  I think if you had used a shorter focal length to give a wider perspective, at least enough to see where the three posts in front of the one you have in focus meet the ground.  In addition, maybe putting the focal point on the post just closer to the camera than the one you have in focus so that the object of focus is entirely visible."
photocritique,3anscn,btherese77,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:03:52 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback! ill have to try and keep in mind to get more of everything in the shot while maintaining focus on the subject. dialing back on focal length while changing my distance from the ground as well
photocritique,3anscn,TylerLynnPhotography,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:07:50 2015 UTC,You pretty much need a subject to focus on. Then you would probably want the fence to end at about 1/3 of the way through the picture instead it taking up half. Its a bit more pleasing to the eye. You should try the rule of thirds. That's what I do most of the time and i tend to get somewhat good composition.  The contrast in colors is pretty nice.
photocritique,3apbs9,AnalogRocks,2,Mon Jun 22 12:12:04 2015 UTC,"I like the composition here and I think the vantage point is good for that town.

photocritique,3apo90,Caasi67,2,Mon Jun 22 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"Regarding this shot, I think the angle up towards your face as well as your expression both combine to make a less than flattering image. In addition, you have a waterfall behind you so it might be better to reframe and compose an image that incorporates more of that element.  As humans, we are drawn to images that contain a human element even in a landscape. So you are correct that you sense your landscapes are less interesting without people. As for portrait selfies, I think a lot of trial and error will result in something good but it's a PITA."
photocritique,3apo90,vmflair,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been doing some hiking and I like to try to get some portraits in since I get pretty bored looking at my landscape shots.  I'm always by myself so I setup a tripod and try to do timed shots, but it's hard to frame up, and it's hard to not look awkward as hell.

photocritique,3an58t,guptron,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:25:21 2015 UTC,"The lighting is far from great.   The darker tones are too compressed. Actually, there's a general lack of contrast and brightness, but the issues with the shadows stand out because of the figure in the foreground and how he is positioned (all manner of dark objects behind him; the dark shapes bleed into one another .. very messy).   I think the pose of the figure in the foreground is not at all a strong one. Maybe a redeeming factor is that he's not the real subject of the photo and he's looking, along with us, at the actual subject(s).. But, yeah, it still doesn't fully work imho.  The dude on the right looks great. I wish the picture were more about him.  The bum in the center-left isn't really pictured in a way that draws attention to him. Again, the poor lighting + poor contrast/brightness obscures some of the details in that figure.  The cool thing about this picture maybe, is that there is more than one thing going on at least. I love photographers who, after years of gaining experience, manage to find ways to vividly capture intricate, dynamic scenes..."

photocritique,3akn53,imjustjk,2,Sun Jun 21 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"I used an intervalometer to get a shot every 2 minutes from 7:50 to 10:15 (used the exsate golden hour app on android to get the sunset time from golden hour to the end of the blue hour). Shot in aperture priority, metering the tallest building and ramping up ISO when the shutter speed was getting to high, usually around 15s. Towards the end I switched to manual and kept the shutter speed at 15s to get a gradual fadeout of the sky. F16 to get the starburst patterns in lights and great DoF.  Afterwards I used lightroom and photoshop. LR first to do a batch edit of the photos in whatever style I want, then I choose a number of photos from the 100+ to match the number of slices I need Previously I had tried with 35 and 15 slices so this time around I wanted to see what 25 looked like. After loading up the photos as layers in photoshop, I resized the photo to 5000px wide and masked the layers one by one, increasing by 200px each time  (5000/25photos)   You can get an idea of what it looks like in LR and PS here : http://i.imgur.com/QbmID0B.jpg http://i.imgur.com/rWI27gP.jpg"

There are, however, two issues that immediately spring to mind. The first is that the angle makes the club look really really short, it looks like a toy. The other is that the golfer's face is too dark, almost certainly caused by the peak of the cap. Either throw a reflector in there or a fill flash."

Or from a different angle completely, with more negative space in front than behind. Look at other golf action photos for reference. This also looks like not peak moment. Again, look to other golf photos for reference.  Focus and depth of field are fine, but lighting not so much. From the shadow length and position, this looks like high noon, which is very harsh and generally unflattering. Look how the legs are in complete shadow. Not your technique but his, but the leading foot looks off and awkward.  Also your title could be ""How would you compose this shot of a golfer?"" or ""How would you compose this? Shot of a golfer."", though the second option leaves a fragment, so the final period is optional. Titles can be sentence fragments."

If you shot this in RAW format you can bring those back by tweaking the black and shadow levels. Part of the hood has a white reflection from the wall and blends in a lot as well, I'm not sure what the best way to fix this would be, probably some external lighting from a flash or two, or a different angle   I feel like it would work better with the car more in the center and the wall more in the background, since you are taking a picture of the car more than the wall"

photocritique,3aml8z,THRILLPOW3R,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"Just some thoughts...   1.It's a bit trivial, but I liked how I framed it and how their body is articulated (especially the left girl.)     The framing just feels pretty generic. It doesn't feel composed so much as it just seems like you raised the camera while walking behind some people. I've done this, so I know how easy it is - and how little effort I actually put into it.   2.Is it hard to find the two subjects? how is it possible, in this case, to make it easier to find the subjects?     I'm sure OP understands your intended subjects are the two girls backs but why? What's interesting about their backs? They're both looking out of frame at something apparently more interesting. Why not frame them so you can see what they're looking at. Otherwise you've just got two people not even facing you (so very little interesting detail to see in their face, clothes etc) and looking off at something else.  There just isn't anything happening in the photo aside from seeing some peoples backs in a very rigid composition and I say that as someone who generally advocates that a picture needn't necessarily ""tell a story"" or any of that shit. This just feels flat."

photocritique,3aloe7,EtArcadia,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:06:03 2015 UTC,Id try and incorporate more natural lighting. Looks like sunset over your right shoulder? Maybe sunrise over your left with the rays hitting your face?

I had the same thing in mind while shooting this as well, but with my back against the wall, there was little room to maneuver to a different position. Also, just after I took this shot, the monk dropped his phone and walked away."
photocritique,3aky3r,pragmojo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:28:24 2015 UTC,"Given what you have I wonder if it would be better to crop out the guy to the left entirely (and also a bit off the bottom to balance the space above and below the monk).  It's a little awkward to have him cut off at the shoulder, and it might actually be compelling to have the last guy engaged with something out of frame.  But yeah great shot as is."

photocritique,3aiiuh,Mocroth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"I think too much of it is the wall. It would be nice to actually see more of the sea. Also the focus is off, i don't know if it was intentionally or not, but it doesn't really appeal to me.  There is also some weird stuff going on with editing in the middle right of the frame, don't know what that is.   I'd manually set your focus next time, and if you want a bigger feeling of length, take some distance from your ""lengthy"" subject. Because now i can't really get an impression of how long this wall is, as it's almost 2D.   I like the colour tone in your image and the blandness of the sky."

photocritique,3aheax,xsx006,2,Sat Jun 20 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'd push the contrast around the face and muzzle a bit. It may darken a bit and you might need to push the exposure in the same area. If you're in Lightroom the clarity slider might do it for you.  You have a pale vignette in the top left that I'd personally try and lose and I might also whiten the background and introduce a slightly dark vignette but that's a personal preference, I just like a bit of vignette on a shot like this to pull the viewer focus to the subject.  The trick with shots like this in monochrome is to keep the blacks good and deep and the whites nice and bright. That's tricky  with black dogs, they suck light like a black hole but I think you've done a decent enough job here, you have all the detail you need and it's a good shot, it just needs a little bit of punch."

I would say that the left most sixth of the photo give or take could benefit from being exposed slightly more.

photocritique,3ahxs3,turboboob,2,Sat Jun 20 23:38:00 2015 UTC,The way i do it is select your 3 or 4 photos in lightroom then Right click on them and select Edit in > Merge to HDR pro in photoshop  When the window opens up to adjust the HDR before it is made move the dropdown Mode menu to 32 bit....pull the slider to the right so you get as much shadow information as possible then unselect the camera raw toning option.....once it goes into photoshop after that.....just hit save in the photoshop menu....it will automatically migrate your 32 bit file into lightroom.....now you have a 32 bit file with all the tonal ranges and exposure values to edit in lightroom which will give a very highly detailed and much cleaner look.....then burn and dodge to your liking   Once i started this method i never touched another HDR processing program again
photocritique,3ahxs3,hawleygriffin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! Can't wait to give it a shot!"
photocritique,3ahxs3,palad1n,2,Tue Jun 23 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"This is beautifully done. In my opinion, the trick to good HDR photography is that it shouldn't look like those pastely monstrosities one sees on the internet. It is OK, IMO, to have areas in which there is no detail. After all, you don't want to show the viewer everything, you want to leave some things to his imagination. Keeps up the interest."

photocritique,3aduqv,slippy_slidey,3,Fri Jun 19 12:55:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think the beauty of this shot is that it would work well without the jumper. It's like a landscape shot that has the added bonus of an interesting human element to it. Creates a sense of place to show how beautiful the scene is for the jumper.   Your version cuts down on all of this. It seems like you left an awkward amount of the arches and cut off too much of the boats.  That's my two cents, but I'm also into OPs kind of style. Reminds me somewhat of Chris Burkards landscapes."

Nice composition though, a quirky shot and the landscape around them fits nicely. I think dof is spot on, the background falls away nicely.   A great start in wedding photography I think."
photocritique,3ad75x,tclayson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:52:55 2015 UTC,"Hi! Great moment to catch, i enjoy the pose and the composition is ok. I'm not sure on the monochrome conversion, could be personal preference but does monochrome add anything, what does the colour version look like? Sky is a little overexposed I would drop your highlights in post processing."
photocritique,3ad75x,foxandowl,2,Fri Jun 19 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"Even though you implicitly asked:  You say you were second camera. Was this your pose? Did you direct it? Did you get permission (either in a contract or verbally) to post this at this time? Often second photographers get delayed posting privileges (a certain number or months or weeks after the client receives images), or none at all. Usually you don't get to promote your own business with images you captured while second shooting. Finally, you should never represent them as wedding you shot as lead photographer.  Honestly, the first thing that I notice is that I greatly dislike the way most sepia ends up looking. The processing would probably look better as regular black and white or full color.  Back to this photo.  Posing (assuming not yours, so this part of the critique only tangentially applies to you). As /u/tclayson points out, the manhole cover is a distracting element, but not a shot killer. The bride's falling arm looks a bit strange. Did whoever was directing have her try one with her arm up on the groom? Her neck muscle is very prominent as well; she looks quite tense in this dip.  Compositionally the leading lines produced from the line of cars leads above their head. Moving that converging point down, by for example squatting or kneeling down to get a lower vantage point, or several would draw the eyes to the couple. If the cars weren't as prominent (from depth of field), perhaps one even shooting from below with much more sky than cobblestone. The bright spot on the ground behind them from what appears to be sunlight adds a bit of interestingness to the background, but also distracts from the couple.  The relatively wide focal length (and close to normal perspective) is a bit wide for subject isolation, especially on a crop and stopped down. Your exposure settings (1/250s, f/4.5, ISO 200 and flash fired), looks like you were running with your built-in flash (inferred from the look of the other photos in your photostream, so the camera maxes out the shutter speed to the max sync speed of your flash. Turn off the flash (or use an external flash capable of high speed sync) and you can open up the aperture to make that DOF quite a bit shallower.  This isn't horrible, but it and the others in your photostream definitely look like this was your first time photographing at a wedding. If you want to eventually do this seriously you have a lot to learn. Because I link it this page so much and it's in my history, see this on how you can make flash not look like flash: http://neilvn.com/tangents/flash-photography-techniques Avoid direct on-camera flash unless it is your only chance at getting a usable exposure.  I hope this helps."

Always, always make sure your horizon is level unless it's a very obvious that your intention is to have a slanted photo. Try to do it while shooting if you can so there's less rotation and cropping in post.  As a second shooter, I'm not sure if this was under your control but the editing on this hurts my eyes. The sepia tone with blue shadows isn't pleasant, and something is off about the sky up at the top (crushed highlights?) but that's just one person's opinion.   However, it's a wonderful capture. Personally I disagree with the person who said you should've posed this (but agree that a more shallow depth of field would really have looked nice). This is such a wonderful, genuine reaction. Nice work on the photograph itself. The editing is really my only critique."
photocritique,3ad75x,diesel828,0,Fri Jun 19 08:33:38 2015 UTC,"The composition is rough. The photo is really messy, and the light is really bad. There's a solid patch of light behind them.   You could have put them there and posed them so the light is flattering on her (bride takes priority, usually) and shot it at a shallower depth of field to make the cars and all the clutter in the background more blurry."

photocritique,3aep4f,Kostas_Flou,5,Fri Jun 19 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"There's no social message in this aside from the title you've given it. If that's how this worked, I could say this shot is all about how we all support the 1% at the top. If your photograph was in a series, maybe, but even then, the connection is tenuous.  If you're going to head in this direction of using abstractions to convey messages, start with something that is fairly obvious, then move towards shooting more and more abstractly as you gain a deeper understanding of how an image can push an idea. Starting off with something like this is like jumping into the deep end and not knowing how to swim."

photocritique,3agkwv,macbookvirgin,2,Fri Jun 19 23:55:55 2015 UTC,There's a lot going on behind your subject so he kind of blends in with the trees. I think having this photo in color would really help pull him away from the background and add more depth to this photo overall.
photocritique,3agkwv,trentarant,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"don't use black and white when the tones are so one sided. this picture would've been better in color. Also the focus is a bit off, so just try to make sure you get your subject in absolute focus. Also your photo might need context because I can't tell what it's about from this."

He's bang in the center of the frame from top/bottom and left/right.  Maybe if you'd put him just a little off center or got a lower angle on him.    And I'm not sure all the negative space in the foreground is contributing to the image.  Also the detail in the trees is very distracting.  And like the other guy said, I'm not really sure what this photo is about.  Is he falling over?  Is he throwing something?  A bit unclear."

Maybe on your next play with curve adjustments with gradient layer masks with vector masks for each surface. Ultimately the goal is to create further interest by changing the exposure gradually over flat surfaces. Search fine art architectural photography and you'll quickly see how often this is done.

I think some jewelery - necklace, ear rings or bracelets or something could help add some interest. Add something to help create a story or a feeling. Even jacking up exposure to give a blown out dreamy feel or darkening it to give it a more melancholy feel could help make it more interesting.  Once again I think it is great photo.

photocritique,3ab0hu,Jcwolfe00,6,Thu Jun 18 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"You don't need a stylist really, just some props or something to help tell a story. Buy an old film camera and have that around her neck. Have her holding a cup of coffee. Have her holding a bag of groceries, shopping bags, a clutch.  Biting on some sunglasses. Holding  an old book. An apple. It can be very simple."
photocritique,3ab0hu,nimbusnacho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly think cropping this particular photo would add to the interest. What she's wearing is just sort of flat and doesn't show any dimension or visual interest,it's just a white field. The background is similar, which is fine, becuase it's a background. That leaves visual interest in how she's holding her arms and her face. So I'd crop up to right above her elbow and maybe crop in a bit from the left and take out the bit of green that is just sort of distracting anyway since it's not echoed elsewhere in the composition.  Of course none of this helps if what you're trying to do is show off the fashion?  EDIT: Also I see some people saying to blur the shirt due to the texture, I don't think that's necessary (though if you do, slide down the clarity tool, don't blur), but if you still are working in raw definitely bring up the exposure on her face a bit, it's too dark compared to her shirt."

Good eye for finding this.  What I don't like: are you having an inner ear issue because your horizon is off? The first arc way is cut off, it's just a little bit too tight.  Overall, nice photo you pulled off a center composition which isn't easy to do. I would suggest straightening your lines and cropping it a little tighter maybe from where it gets darker in the alley.

Keep your head straight and force your camera that way. I have this issue if I'm crouched down to take a photo.  I think this shot could work cropped tighter, give it a try.

photocritique,3acw6i,KDShark,2,Sat Jun 20 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"Looks great, thanks for posting. To me, there is too much white space in the foreground and diminishes the size of the dragon head. Wide angle lenses are tough because they distort and compress things in the middle of view and elongate at the edges. Not sure how possible it would be, but wading out closer, and filling the frame a bit more would make the rock feature less squashed looking. Jimmy McIntyre on 500px has links to a great tutorial for how to manage distortion with two exposures and the clone stamp tool - it's a very handy technique once you Learn it.   It's a hard balance of getting what you want out of the sunrise (you did great there) and the water effect (fwiw - I'm not a huge fan of long exposure water effect, so maybe I'm biased). I think you needed more of the main subject in the frame and let the other elements balance."

At whatever level you pursue photography stuff there doesn't seem to really be a ceiling.

It can be quite challenging to shoot it differently when every man and his dog has photographed it.  Composition wise I think you're on the money but for me, it lacks something to differentiate it from other people. I'd be inclined to shoot it around golden hour (before sunset of after sunrise) to capture nice golden light hitting the rock with some colour in the sky from the sunset or sunrise. This would also let you shoot at a slower shutter speed to capture some movement in the water."
photocritique,3ac6i3,wisie,2,Thu Jun 18 22:56:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, fully agree with golden/blue hours shooting, it's just hard to do that with friends/family around who are not photo-enthusiasts and want to move on ;) But said that I've already visited the place few times and I'm sure to be back there many more times so hopefully I'll catch it in some nice light eventually."

If you're using partial stops of ISO, the camera is artificially adding the ISO to make it 160 equivalent. 160 would give you more grain than ISO 200 because the camera takes ISO 100 than artificially adds the rest. I don't know if that makes sense. There's ever so slightly some grain where the flare is."

I don't use Canon but it does seem like their base ISO is 160 so OP couldn't have done anything. But some can be expanded to ISO 100, which is an artificial ISO level for that camera.  I couldn't find the original article but I found something similar.  Look at this image for instance: http://puu.sh/itlFj/31905992f7.png  These were taken with Canon, base ISO of 160. Notice how ISO 160 has less noise than ISO 100. ISO 320 has less noise than ISO 200 and so on. Nikon cameras generally have a base ISO of 200 with 100 as extended range, but you'll find that ISO 100 would be worse than ISO 200. Of course it's a tiny difference in real world shooting and you won't even notice. These are just only visible in tightly controlled lab tests.  My Pentax K5 has a base ISO of 80 which is fantastically awesome."

I'd recommend shooting to have the main subject more specified to your horizon vertically rather than having him run along your rule of thirds. His eyes should be your main draw otherwise I find him not being the first subject I see, rather the somewhat motion blurred people in your window.  I'd almost think this could be rectified by placing yourself 6 inches to a foot higher to shoot this as the subject and the lines contradict one another."

I think in Germany, I will generally have the problem of not being able to get people's eyes on my horizon, because at 5'10"", I'm considered short here. At least when I'm walking around and shooting people fairly up close. But either way, that is something that I had learned in design school but had completely forgotten about it, so thank you for the reminder, I'll try to consider it in the future."

photocritique,3aa49y,voterbomb,2,Thu Jun 18 12:58:14 2015 UTC,"I think this image would be greatly improved if the person in the back wasn't in the shot.   if the other guy wasn't in the shot I would say, bring down the framing to show guys feet, or at least show a bit more of it.   I like the edit on it, but it just looks like a snapshot."
photocritique,3a9iq5,isaiahgomez,2,Thu Jun 18 08:19:29 2015 UTC,"Firstly, welcome to the fun of experimenting with long exposures. I started playing with them when I first picked up my first DSLR and have been hooked since.    You asked for some honest advice so these just some thoughts that are more from personal experience and not necessarily how others might approach things but anyway:   Don't be afraid to get your feet wet (of course being mindful of the depth and layers of rocks on the ground). Some of my better waterfall/stream photos have been by getting wet which has allowed me to get a different angle to others and get a bit more creative. It can be risky though especially when the rocks are slippery/strong current Composition - Find something to act as your foreground composition. Sure, it's a pretty stream but nothing really grabs me and I don't know what to look at. I would have looked to use the rocks to the middle/right of the frame as my foreground element and then used the rest of the stream as the backdrop. This grabs your viewers attention with something that they can immediately connect with and then leads them to the background Processing - Have a play with curves and give the shadows a bit of a boost to bring out more detail. While also perhaps giving it a slight shift in temperature by warming it slightly.   Drop me a PM if you want any critique on any future shots. Happy to share my thoughts and help out if I can."

photocritique,3a9iq5,sh00tah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:31:27 2015 UTC,Meant to put f/18.
photocritique,3a9iq5,jackbauer616,2,Thu Jun 18 08:20:25 2015 UTC,The image is ok (on a phone sorry can't be more specific) but I'm wondering why you used a high ISO and small shutter rather than a low ISO if you were after a long exposure time?  ISO 800 and f18 you could have gone ISO 100 and around f10 with much less noise
photocritique,3a9t8k,rehmanjafar,2,Thu Jun 18 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"Try angling the shot. For example, maybe place the fan more in foreground and the flowers more in the background. Using a shorter depth of field, now pick your focus on one of the four objects so that the other subjects soften.   I really like the warm coloring, but the purple in the flowers and the blue in the vase is too cool for the edge of the frame. Try removing the flower vase or using it more boldly as a statement or accent.  Happy shooting!"
photocritique,3a9t8k,mrs_pots,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"Yes,I could always work and change the arrangement of articles.But I find it extremely hard to focus on a subject without a capable camera or say dslr.

photocritique,3a9t8k,mrs_pots,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:40:07 2015 UTC,"/u/rehmanjafar : are you using a smart phone?   If so, you can blur out the foreground if the subject is very close and you tap on the midground or background. It will also change the white balance but you can edit that in photoshop or another photo editting program.

photocritique,3a9t8k,TheCannon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:19:08 2015 UTC,Your lighting is great. My only criticism is that there is no real focal point - nothing draws you into the image or makes a statement. It just looks like a bunch of stuff sitting on a table.
photocritique,3a9src,gregsui,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:46:37 2015 UTC,I think this looks awesome. I don't know why you are not in first place
photocritique,3aacit,jackbauer616,2,Thu Jun 18 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"Well, your intuition is right. There's a number of things off here. Firstly, the composition. The two subjects of this photo are the seagulls. Both of them are sitting at the land/water horizon, which takes away from focus being on them. The one on the left - it's head (where it's eyes are and thus the region of major focus) is being bisected at the neck by the shoreline so that his beak is barely visible and his impact is lost. The second one is placed dead center and with the tree/sky horizon bisecting his legs. Be very mindful of the backgrounds behind your subject, because as you can see here, if you're not it can really detract from the photo. Had you stepped backwards or stood taller and shot downwards, you could have had just water surrounding the gulls which would have improved the shot a lot. However, the horizon isn't level and is crucial especially in seascapes as that shoreline is flat in real life. Always always always level the horizon. Lastly, the processing is a bit harsh - it  might be the image size but it looks like too much clarity/contrast/sharpening added on an image that maybe wasn't the sharpest to begin with."
photocritique,3aacit,oceanswell,2,Thu Jun 18 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"thank you very much, it really wasnt that strong to begin with I just wanted to see if I could make it work. I have a similar photo if you wouldn't mind giving your opinion on that as well. http://imgur.com/kSm9LlD"
photocritique,3aacit,oceanswell,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:18:18 2015 UTC,Im sure there are similar things wrong but maybe it works better with this crop ?
photocritique,3aacit,xXGuAcAXx,2,Thu Jun 18 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"The composition is a bit better here, but the horizon is still tilted. ALWAYS level the horizon. The earlier you learn to do this as one of your first quality control checks for every shot, the better. It's one of the most basic and simple fixes, but when left tilted it looks amateur or lazy. The composition would still be improved if the horizon didn't intersect the two seagulls on the left. The editing has  gone a bit overboard here, the saturations are a bit much, especially the pinks/magentas, which becomes really apparent on the houses on the shoreline."
photocritique,3aagw3,Fabe56,2,Thu Jun 18 14:49:59 2015 UTC,"Picture of the whole car? I just had to google it to even find out what it looked like and where that vent was. So even as an automotive enthusiast the perspective was hard to visualize for me. Also, it would've helped if it was cleaner. The grass under the trim and blemish around the body line is distracting.  Looking at other pictures of the car it's extremely interesting and this photo adds to the rest of the pictures I saw. I would put it in a collage photo or an album with other pictures of the same car. Detail photos of car need to stand on their own IMO or be accompanied by something else that gives them perspective.  Just think to yourself about a viewer who knows nothing about cars, or this particular one. Remember your photos always have to convey a complete, or at least, teasing message to the viewer that gives them some kind of answer.  Here is one of my ""minimalist"" automotive photos that I personally think can stand alone. Just enough information in the photo to let the viewer understand what they are looking at and from what perspective."

I suppose it's in focus, and the composition could be worse. In the end the subject is pretty uninteresting, it needs another element to make it cohesive."

The water looks nice and watery, and that is more of a splash than a wave but overall it's a boring picture. Nothing interesting about it, no real subject matter. I'm surprised you even think that this is a photo worth critiquing, there's nothing to it."
photocritique,3a7k94,Graxxon,2,Thu Jun 18 01:38:08 2015 UTC,The color is nice. The depth of field needs to be shorter.
photocritique,3a7k94,mrs_pots,2,Thu Jun 18 05:31:10 2015 UTC,ya its just kinda boring I think this same picture but taken at a lower side angle is more interesting than the top of the wave but thats just me

photocritique,3a9uzv,rstcp,2,Thu Jun 18 11:15:43 2015 UTC,"What's killing me on this shot is that ugly light at the top of the frame - I'd crop that out immediately. I also think this would be such a lovely moment, without the boy in it, or if he wasn't covering up the woman on the left. Had it just been the two women in conversation I think the image would have had a lot more impact."
photocritique,3a9uzv,oceanswell,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"Good points, thank you. I don't know why I left the light in, but I completely agree, now that you mention it. This is another shot I took of the same scene - how would you crop this one?"
photocritique,3a9uzv,oceanswell,2,Thu Jun 18 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"I like this shot much, much, much more! Go with this one over the original. The framing, composition, colors - they're all working much better together in this shot and really work to draw the viewer's eye to the relationship between the two women. And there's still other interesting but not distracting things on the edges of the scene such as the man and the boy on the bike. The monochromatic repetition of browns and beiges, and then the yellow of the man's kaftan and the yellow light, and the reflection of the pattern of the woman's dress in the mirror are all great. Color repetition is a great feature."
photocritique,3a9uzv,mobilebroadband4fun,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I also prefer this one, but I couldn't have identified those elements so specifically. Good composition needs some of that detached analysis, which is hard to do in a busy scene - but that's what makes street photography such an exciting genre."

photocritique,3a4uzk,oakum_ouroboros,4,Wed Jun 17 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"My only real critique here is that its just a very very busy image, between the rocks scattered around everywhere, and the texture of the water and the sand, its kind of hard to focus in on anything, especially since the contrast is rather high.  Otherwise, cool image and I like the angle. I do agree with /u/oakum_ouroboros that portrait might be a better choice for this image due to the angle and the leading lines."
photocritique,3a4uzk,mashuto,2,Wed Jun 17 13:35:39 2015 UTC,Can you explain to me why portrait?
photocritique,3a4uzk,stracted,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"Based on how everything in the scene is laid out I think it would just probably work better as a portrait. The main thing is the surf line, its vertical, it leads your eye, and to me again seems better for a portrait. Some of that extra distracting detail is also off to the side, so a portrait again would remove that and help lead the eye where you want it (to the person I assume)."
photocritique,3a4uzk,mashuto,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, that surf line draws your eye up and down.  I feel like I'm missing something just out of frame at the top of the photo (and the bottom to a lesser extent), but I definitely don't feel like I'm missing something out of frame to the left or right.  Part of that might be how the rock at the top left is cut off.  Makes me feel like there's something there to see."

Besides that, it's all practice. The more images you take, the more you start to see what works and what doesn't, and you start to figure out why which can help as you go forward and take more pictures."

photocritique,3a4uzk,stracted,2,Thu Jun 18 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"I like this a lot, though maybe I personally would have composed it a little differently.    One of my big things about photography is the coloring, and I like what you have going on here.  My only suggestion is that you tone down the harshness a bit.  Maybe reducing contrast would help?"
photocritique,3a4uzk,ToothpasteVEVO,2,Wed Jun 17 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"I'm liking the composition, the person does stand out in the lighter sand. It shows the vastness of the area and I like that.  Make sure the whites are white though, color is throwing me off. Or even try it out in black and white. Maybe next time try this a bit tighter or wait for a person when their shadow will be huge- little before sunset and after sunrise. That could make for an interesting photo.   You could also strive for subject more next time  Nice shot. Happy shooting"
photocritique,3a4uzk,amateur_samurai,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"I like the composition. Try setting the white balance. The sea foam is yellow - as is the rest of the image. Maybe it's sunset, but the image looks crisper when the whites are white. And a little sharpening."
photocritique,3a4uzk,extremekc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"Good composition, not too much of interest to focus on in the image. Maybe a contrasty black and white conversion could work?"
photocritique,3a8wki,JasonPawsUpp,2,Thu Jun 18 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"One thing, when framing portraits, don't go with rule of thirds.  Put the dominant eye in the center of the photo for a balanced feel.  The head will be slightly off center which is nice and there isn't a ton of unused space.   I'm on a shit monitor but it also looks like you could lighten up the shadows around the eye.   Tones look great!"

But anyway, I do agree with the comment about the plunging neckline, and basically, you have a V shape pointing almost right at the edge, and that just visually feels uncomfortable.  Points should never point right at the edge unless it has some purpose to it."
photocritique,3a8wki,mobilebroadband4fun,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:17:37 2015 UTC,"/u/jaexlee and /u/foxandowl : for something more in the school photo or professional head shot category of portrait photography, bras straps make the subject look cheap. This photo gives me the impression that it is for a more conservative organization.  There are plenty of settings in which bras and bra straps can/should be revealed or displayed in portrait."

Why would you put your practice work up here? What on earth is there for anyone to critique? Here we have a child's toy that you couldn't be bothered to move away from the couch or clean up the other crap on the floor that's next to it. Your first images from your first camera are going to be bad regardless, how about spending some time reading your camera  manual, looking up blogs, books and youtube tutorials about basic composition, subject, lighting, and post processing. Nobody wants to see your first shots from your first DSLR, because everyone at this stage is clueless and the shots inevitably suck. You wouldn't want to hear someone's first attempt at playing their first piano, would you? That's exactly what your title is saying. This isn't a place to throw up your work that clearly has no effort put into it, you'll get a harsh response for garbage. Here are some basic resources to get you started.

A simple toy on its own doesn't do it for me... I like the context of it being in the floor, showing that it was a room lived in, where kids had just finished playing.  That's what I was going for.  I can appreciate that's not your cup of tea and that my description pointed biasing responses towards a negative review (as if this was a random shot).    Cheers.  Edit: and thanks for the links!"
photocritique,3a8sd1,sub-merge,2,Thu Jun 18 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree with oceanswell, I am going to try and give some more constructive criticism.  First, since the only object that's entirely in frame is the child's toy, you're telling us that it's the subject. You put it smack dab in the middle of the frame. That's generally not the best place as it's terribly boring. (see rule of thirds, golden ratio)  You included three elements in the photo: a piece of paper, the toy, and part of the couch. These extraneous elements do not add anything to the composition and in fact, might weaken it. The paper and the couch are competing for attention because they're so close to the edge of the frame they carry a lot of visual weight and are perfectly in focus, but they add nothing to the idea of a toy. They tell us the toy is on the floor, which is usually where they are. Try some juxtaposition. A toy on a pool table say is more interesting. Why? It doesn't belong there.  If you include something in your image, ask yourself if it strengthens or weakens your composition. Try using depth of field as a way to isolate your subject and tell us what it is you want us to look at.  As a start, I am going to quote ben long on what a successful photograph should have. Explore from there   clearly defined subject and background sense of balance (how the graphical “weight” of the elements balance in size, shape, colour or tone) point of view (the height at which the photo is shot) degree of simplicity (only including the necessary elements to convey the story or emotion)"
