DarkFuturology,3dwpd2,danielravennest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"What about teleoperated self-rep, to start with? Machine tools, casting (centrifugal), metallurgical grade refining. For the first few replications, aim for 98% or so rather than full closure, since it's not going to be economical to print silicon wafers and harvest REEs or PGMs for a while.  Agree that it's not happening in 2015, but earth based factories with nearly full automation are sort of a thing already. Haven't seen an end to end dirt-to-machines system yet though.  FWIW /u/danielravennest (Dani Eder) has been chipping away at the problem here. It's not just about replication; there's also scaling and diversification to be considered (replication is more a system-wide phenomenon, but making different tools from given tools or bigger ones from smaller ones is also possible). Ideally, you would plan out a series of steps to bootstrap from a fairly simple system (that doesn't really try to directly replicate itself) to a much more elaborate one (which does quite a bit more).  Another less important point: propellant doesn't necessarily have to be differentiated or highly refined to be useful. You just need a way to accelerate it, e.g. use concentrated solar to turn it to plasma. Once you have space-sourced propellant, the rocket equation isn't such a big factor, so redirecting asteroids into more reachable orbits (small chunks initially) isn't reliant on that."

In case of Earth/Moon it is effectively all one system, so you can e.g. build TW and PW scale power systems, especially since you need very little mass to do so, and because photons for communication and transfer of power are not subject to the rocket equation."
DarkFuturology,3dwpd2,lsparrish,2,Tue Jul 21 06:38:23 2015 UTC,"No ores and no full Earth toolchains on the Moon.   There are in fact ores on the Moon, as revealed by the Clementine mission 20 years ago - Source: http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/clementine/images/    You don't need a full toolchain on the Moon to get started, merely pick a few useful processes to start and expand from there, with Earth support.  No place on Earth has everything either.  One particular useful item is the few tenths of a percent native iron in the Lunar regolith (the surface layer of broken rocks and dust).  The iron consists of fragments of metallic meteorites which impacted over time and got mixed with the native rocks, plus a small amount of native iron reduced from iron oxides. High energy sunlight and particles can do that in a vacuum.  Iron can be separated with a magnet, and purified by melting.  It needs to be purified because the iron bits are typically glued to other particles by glassy material created in high energy collisions.  Melting will cause the iron to sink to the bottom of the container, because it is a lot denser than the rest of the minerals.  With a local source of iron, you can then start making parts, assuming you bring with you a few basic machine tools and a robot to load and unload them.   (I know Dani Eder is aware of it)   Yes, I own a hardcover copy of the book, and digital download, which is easier to search.  I also have a paper copy of the 1980 NASA ""Advanced Automation for Space Missions"" study.   the only way to find out is to actually try. Very little of that design and operation space can be sampled from the armchair.   Agreed.  That's why the Seed Factory Project I work on has a progressive R&D plan.  A Seed Factory is a starter kit of basic machines, which upgrade to a full factory by making more and different machines for itself (plus useful products).  At first we will prototype the concept in an easy location (near Atlanta), but over time go to more difficult and remote locations, like oceans, deserts, and ice caps, and finally in space, which is more remote and hostile environment.  The progressive plan accomplishes two things.  First you gain experience with seed factories and running them in remote and hostile conditions in manageable steps.  Second, to get to space, you need factories and launch sites on Earth.  Those can be grown from starter kits too, reducing the upfront cost.  I'm not Elon Musk, and I didn't get $200 million in starter money from selling PayPal, like he did.  So bootstrapping from starter kits is a way for non-genius billionaires to get started.   But you'll need EM launchers to reach escape velocity.   That was the approach in the early space colonization studies (1970s-90s).  A centrifugal launcher is simpler and smaller to get started (i.e. need less than a million tons a year like those studies assumed).  Existing materials like carbon fiber are strong enough to make a centrifuge arm that can operate at Lunar orbit velocity.  The centrifuge uses an electric motor to spin up to speed, releases a payload, then operates as a generator to transfer energy to a second unit.  That way you don't waste the flywheel energy of the arm when you stop to load the next payload.  Basalt is a common material on the Lunar surface, and Basalt fiber is a pretty strong material.  So you can upgrade your centrifuges from local materials.   My view is that you spend a lot of mass for reaction mass with long transfer times,    You need about 2% reaction mass to bring Near Earth Asteroid material to the Earth-Moon system.  Oxygen can be used in a plasma thruster as the reaction mass, and typical rock is 40% Oxygen, so the process is self-supporting after the first trip.  It does take a couple of years per trip to deliver the material, that is a consequence of the orbits of NEAs (1-2 years) and electric thruster acceleration (low).  Your tug doesn't need to come all the way back to Earth, though.  It can inject a load to a transfer orbit, then go back for another one.  Nearly all known NEA's are a lot more massive than a tug can reasonably move.  A second tug near Earth can capture the loads and put them in the destination orbit.  After a while you have a ""full pipeline"" of materials en-route to Earth.  The Moon and NEAs have quite different compositions, and being at the top of a gravity well is an advantage: ease of getting to other orbits, full sunlight.  So my thinking is to use both.  There is no reason to limit yourself to one or the other source of materials."
DarkFuturology,3dwpd2,eleitl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:51 2015 UTC,"There are in fact ores on the Moon , as revealed by the Clementine mission 20 years ago   Titanium is a special case, of which I'm very aware. There should be also some volcanic ores, though probably not on the surface, but nothing else due to absence of tectonics, hydrosphere/atmosphere and biosphere.   One particular useful item is the few tenths of a percent native iron in the Lunar regolith   I'm also aware, and you can do many other things like mesh separation, vibration separation, electrostatic and of course also magnetic separation. The Moon has certainly advantages, but in terms of natural enrichment it is much worse than Earth.   At first we will prototype the concept in an easy location (near Atlanta)   It is a far more interesting problem to mine non-ore (granite, basalt, and the like) grade minerals with minimum energy input and small-scale/low complexity machinery on Earth.   A centrifugal launcher is simpler and smaller to get started (i.e. need less than a million tons a year like those studies assumed)   I would go with maglev in the inner crater rim of e.g. Shackleton. Especially if you can find high-temp superconductors that would work there without further cooling and there would be plenty of energy 24/7 by using illumination on the crater rim.   The Moon and NEAs have quite different compositions, and being at the top of a gravity well is an advantage: ease of getting to other orbits, full sunlight. So my thinking is to use both.

DarkFuturology,3dwpd2,OriginalPostSearcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"Good to see we are on roughly the same page. I've been going back and forth on the Moon vs asteroids. I was originally thinking we should focus on the Moon for the following reasons:    Constant, tolerable ping times for teleoperation. Ferrous metal ore (partly native iron) harvesting from regolith is fairly easy with magnets. Regolith can be sintered into structural materials/forms. Probably diamond and other carbon sources in craters of C-type asteroids. Also probably plenty cold-trapped CO2, methane, etc. at the poles. Reasonable delta-vee to launch stuff from the moon to lower orbits or to the earth in the later stages. Can use EM and even mechanical methods to launch/land. Existence of gravity means you can design more similarly to devices and factories on earth. Zero-gee manufacturing opportunities are still available in lunar orbit. The geology seems to be relatively consistent, so if you get a process working in one area of the moon it's likely you can get it working elsewhere as well. You might have a basin process vs highland process, but it's not as varied as the earth which has seas, jungles, etc.   Near-earth asteroids are also tempting though, so it is hard to say:   Lower delta-vee since they don't have gravity. Have to approach them at the right time, select target carefully, etc. Lack of much gravity means velocity shift can happen slowly over time, so high efficiency electric/thermal thrusters are more of an option for the whole trip, including launch for return trip. Certain materials (metal, carbon) are pre-sorted by asteroid type, to some degree. M-type could possibly be machineable. The extraction equipment requirement thus seems less. Despite the eccentric orbit, you can grab reasonable sized chunks and drag them into a more convenient orbit. Smaller chunks marked ""orbital debris"" already exist in convenient orbits (LEO, MEO, etc). These nearby orbits have a shorter ping time than lunar surface operations. Junk-pile asteroids (slower rotating, more massive) probably also have powdery regolith that could be sinter-printed without having to grind it down first. Gravity-needing processes can be done in centrifuges. Large centrifuges simulating a small amount of gravity allow for minimal redesign of existing equipment. Zero-gee is likely to be a more efficient environment for industrial processing overall, since it allows minimal structural support, but probably needs more specific equipment designs.   I'm not sure which way the balance of evidence points to being the cheapest/most reliable option really.   No ores and no full Earth toolchains on the Moon. Very different context, much harder.   Agree, but there's iron in the regolith that can be magnetically beneficiated, due to meteor impact fragments. For things like copper that are based on aqueous geology there's no ore (hence the proposal to substitute aluminum, which is ubiquitous, though needing much higher energies to separate). A hard vacuum is the main asset for refining materials that might make it ""easier"".   I'm aware. I've spent a lot of time thinking how do it on the Moon specifically, and the only way to find out is to actually try. Very little of that design and operation space can be sampled from the armchair.   True. But it's expensive to actually try, so there needs to be a lot of attention to what to try first, or very small devices should form the basis of early tests (with larger payloads delivered after they succeed). Up to a point, it might still be cheaper to test a lot of the stuff in an artificial vacuum chamber.   There's been plenty of prior work http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM.htm   Yes, sorry, probably should have mentioned that. Eder's is an active project, mostly focused on the issue of starter kits for bootstrapping. He has a space systems book as well (and the project started from there), but he's trying to solve the ""easy"" problem here on earth, of a factory mostly bootstrapped from local resources. I'm not entirely sure how productive the earth based aspect is, but ""why hasn't anyone build a self replicating factory on earth"" is something people keep asking me whenever I bring up the space/lunar version of the idea.  I notice there are some chapters I must have skipped last time I looked at that link, so thanks for the reminder.   Electric thrusters are really cheap and easy. But you'll need EM launchers to reach escape velocity. This is a lot of infrastructure.   You could get to an asteroid from LEO, by nudging to a higher orbit, so all you really need is a good surface to LEO + efficient thruster. EV from an asteroid is insignificant, unlike lunar surface. You end up with mostly just the cost of redirecting the selected mass, which can be bigger than a mountain. Solar sails could be used, but you'd probably want something with more thrust than that.   My view is that you spend a lot of mass for reaction mass with long transfer times, and it is much more sensible to just use the resources where they are. In case of Earth/Moon it is effectively all one system, so you can e.g. build TW and PW scale power systems, especially since you need very little mass to do so, and because photons for communication and transfer of power are not subject to the rocket equation.   If we suppose launch/landing infrastructure gets built on the Moon, the costs tend to be close to equivalent in my estimation. Whereas if the materials are launched from the Moon using chemical fuel sources to overcome the gravity, asteroid sources would make more sense.  When it comes to landing on the Moon vs asteroid, the lack of gravity means that you can pretty much always land cheaply on an asteroid given enough time and orbital maneuvering (slingshotting around planets, etc., like the Philae lander did to land on a comet) but if you select targets carefully it's doable on a more frequent basis with minimal thrust, which can be electric or thermal.  I have another idea for deployable infrastructure that could be used for lunar surface, lunar orbit, earth orbit, or asteroid. It's basically just a really long tether that functions as a track to land (match velocities) on. The coupling mechanism can be EM or (possibly) mechanical friction. Couldn't find a direct prior reference to the exact concept, although it has prior art obviously."

DarkFuturology,3dtew0,redspectacle,9,Sun Jul 19 10:22:24 2015 UTC,"Very simple (and I say this as a person involved in engineering, computing, etc. for the last 30 years):  this is the lie that ALL digital data about the world gives us.  So much is lost in terms of describing the world that what a digital replica gives us is very shallow and generally not particularly representative.  My view of this comes from a different example: doing things like ""social networking"" in meat space before the internet became a thing (again, I've been using the ""Internet"" daily since the early 1980s so it's not a new thing and this isn't about ""darn kids get off my lawn"").  And the thing is that ""friends"" on Facebook are nothing like meatspace friends.  Conversations on any online media are no where as rich and unambiguous (if you are meatspace skilled) as meatspace.  Negotiation behaviors on eBay are no where as nuance or economically efficient as meatspace.  Selling and buying is no where as economic efficient or quick as meatspace.  The dystopian aspect is that people actually believe that online is better in every way when the reality is that major swaths of humanity and experience go completely and utterly missing.  It's not that online tools aren't useful.  Certainly the telephone was useful and these are useful.  The problem illustrated in the article and which I often see with people online is that they think the online ""data"" is somehow ""reality"" when it's not.  Not even close to it.  But people have already started to think of digital reality as a real thing even better than real.  And from a perverted point of view, this is to be expected.  There is far less information (in the Claude Shannon sense of information theory) transmitted by digital/online sources.  So the world seems simpler and more predictable than it really is and people like this simplicity.  The problem is that reality is not that simple and if you delude yourself into believing that it is, reality WILL bite you in the ass someday and you won't see it coming.  If you are more grounded in the real meatspace world, you have a fighting chance.  Self-delusion is still possible but it's harder to ignore reality in your face."

How does one deal with the tragedy of the commons without private property, you create a government that manages property on behalf of the people, which makes people the property of the government. This gives the governors great power, creating a hierarchical structure. This structure has to be maintained through violence, as markets emerge naturally as a result of people making mutually-agreeable deals. Lacking the ability to own anything they create, no one has any incentive to work. The government provides incentive through violence, and something much closer to slavery than ""wage slavery"" emerges.    Everyone is poor and equal in their poverty.

However thus far, not a single monopoly has existed in history, that I am aware of, without State backing.   If a workers riot at a factory and try to take over the means of production, national guard gets called in. There are examples of bullying tactics and union busting done by privately employed agents in the past, but whenever there is a large group of strikers, state financed armies are called upon.   There's exceptions to every rule, but for the most part i do not see how private police forces could have enough power. Even today, allegedly 'private armies' are contracted and financed by States, not private corporations.   Protecting private assets requires an enormous amount of bureaucracy, administration, and policing. Having to pay for these privately would make investment in large scale operations cost-prohibitive. Concentration of wealth and capital requires out-sourcing administrative (read: Kafka) and security (read: Orwell) duties to the State apparatus (and thus passed off to tax-payers)."
DarkFuturology,3dmewy,monsunland,7,Sat Jul 18 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything about police forces, you don't need an army to create a functional monopoly.   However thus far, not a single monopoly has existed in history, that I am aware of, without State backing.   That's debateable.  The natural path of business is towards consolidation.  As businesses compete, some win and some lose.  As the losers drop out of the competition, the winners consume their market share.    As the winners grow, they begin to create their own barriers of entry for new competition to challenge them.  Capital requirements for entry into the market rise, the economics of scale kick in, and they grow to a point that they can control the flow of natural resources required for the market.  As those remaining players within the market merge and consolidate, collusion becomes more cost effective than competition.    People who support a free market ideology always seem to say that because government policies help create monopolies, that means they can't come into being without a government.  I think they willfully ignore that the government policies supporting monopoly formation come from the current market.  Those regulations don't happen by accident, they're bought and paid for by businesses because its the most cost effective way to maximize profits.  Take government out of the equation and you don't prevent those motivations from coming into being.  Capital owners will still be incentivized to use their capital to eliminate competition in the most efficient way possible (and competition is not efficient).  There will always be some way that bribery and corruption can exploit a human system.  Without some competing way to enforce collective will over the situation, the only mechanism to oppose the monopoly will be competing capital, and that requires buy in from an exponential number of ""individual actors"" compared to the consolidated will of the business entity preying on the situation, and they must overcome all of the barriers the entrenched entity has already created.     tl;dr - anarcho-capitalism is just another word for plutocracy."

Your ideas are all theoretical, because all concentrated wealth and capital that exists today is here with the express aid of state subsidy.   My example is backed up by this. Your example of capitalism existing without a State and taxation has never existed in history. All states exist funded by taxation, and all monopolies exist by way of the state.

In a stateless, capitalist society, capital will directly correlate to temporal power.  As money accumulates, power accumulates, and individuals and business entities will wield that power to further accumulate wealth.  If the organizational structure to support those endeavors doesn't exist, they will use capital to bring them into being.  Without some mechanism for collective will to oppose collective wealth, there is no method of enforcing rules necessary to restrain capital owners from actions which (while logical from point of view of the capitalist) lead to undesirable social outcomes.    As far as examples go, we have countless instances of cronyism to choose from.  The logic of the current corporate entity is to to seek maximum influence over the regulator. What evidence do you have that removal of the regulator would prevent them from seeking influence directly?  How would you keep the free market free when it is not in the best interest of the most successful actors within it to maintain a free market?"

What evidence do you have that removal of the regulator would prevent them from seeking influence directly?   What evidence do you have that they even could?  My argument is that because free market capitalism has never existed in all of history, then that is an indication that perhaps the two are not synonymous.    How would you keep the free market free when it is not in the best interest of the most successful actors within it to maintain a free market?   So far the biggest thing keeping a market from being free is the government. And the biggest thing keeping corporations in power...is the government.

The government is not ""keeping the market from being free"", the market is keeping the market from being free.  In the absence of government, the market would create government.  That's literally why we have government today.  Government is the immune response that keeps the many from storming the abodes of the wealthy few.  I am not against capitalism, I'm really not.  It is excellent at incentivizing things.  Some of those things are pretty good, and some are pretty terrible.  It's not a philosophy or a method of social organization, it's a tool for distributing scarce resources.  That's it.  Fetishize it as anything other than a means unto an end, and all you're doing is creating a government designed to brutalize the many for the enrichment of those smart or ruthless enough to exploit it.

An important digression, but a digression nonetheless.  We are back to my original point, that the capitalist class has an interest in maintaining the existence of the state until eventually, there is no discernible difference between the two. That is where we presently are. And they have us more woefully outgunned than ever, which does in any ""once and for all revolution of the bourgeoisie against the state"" theory. Even if such an endeavor could be successful, the rich would recreate state-like institutions in a privatized form; see the above paragraph for why this would be an issue. Democracy of any kind would cease to exist and one's capacity to influence the social order would be a function of their birth - or, said another way, their luck.

Capitalism assumes 2 things: 1. that people own stuff. 2. That people have to work to get stuff.  If you have both, capitalism will naturally occur as people own stuff that's hard to get and they will want to trade it. If you remove one, capitalism stops working, because either they don't own something to trade, or they don't have to work to get the things they want (and thus everything is valueless).

How those are enforced, or how they arise is irrelevant.   he rest of us know that the ownership of stuff is based on the state's threat of violence   Certainly. But there's more ways to determine ownership than that. This has nothing to do with capitalism. Communism, for instance, does the exact same thing (determine ownership based on centralized government violence).   and that what they call ""working to get stuff"" is actually a process of being born into the right pile of stolen labor value.    No. By ""working to get stuff"" I mean ""have to physically mine out X material to make Y thing."" You literally can't do that magically. Someone has to do the work. Until that is no longer the case, capitalism will still remain. Likewise, someone has to code the software. As long as it takes effort or 'work', someone's going to have to do it, and that person is going to want compensation.   You really think you can slip this by anyone whose read even a fragment of any Marx?   Please demonstrate how we're going to mine copper in order to make wires and other needed parts, if no one is getting compensated to do it? Because I'm at a loss.   Essentially, because the technological basis of everything valued under capitalism is information based, and information is not scarce and more free-flowing than ever, the state of ""valuelessness"" you describe is coming closer to actualizing.   Certainly. I've never argued against this. Information itself is scarceless, and thus doesn't work with capitalism. That doesn't mean everything is.  As I said, with renewable energy, more advanced 3D printers, etc. this will certainly become a reality and thus capitalism will no longer be necessary. But until then, capitalism will stay around.  As I said. Capitalism assumes two things (which are required for the system to work): 1. That people own stuff (this is mine, and that is yours). 2. That people have to work to get stuff (Rather than it being, say, printed for free).  If those two prerequisites exist, capitalism will naturally arise. Remove one (the second one will certainly disappear in the future) and you arrive at a situation where capitalism no longer works."

Regardless of what the average civilian considers ethical, governments have been doing things that the average person wouldn't agree with for as long as governments have existed. Personally, I think small scale drones, probably quadcopters, are the future of warfare and law enforcement. It's a natural progression, and it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, you're reducing the probability of human casualties, at least on your side. You're also possibly reducing unneeded police shootings by removing the officer's instinct for self-preservation from the equation. On the other side, many may argue that you're disconnecting and desensitizing the drone operator from the battlefield, possibly causing a more callous and insensitive attitude towards the opposition and bystanders."

As good as it might feel to just kick the door down and storm the fort, his servitude over time has brought him patience and wisdom and so he takes to the backburner with it. Well, later on he stumbles across this image, and the pieces click into place. He buys the quadcopter, has it delivered to a prefab house in a nearby subdivision, dead drop, fake name, prepaid credit card bought in a gas station in the middle of nowhere with no security cameras.

This is not due to technology, but the baby boomers retiring off. There isn't more millenials as % of the working population than the boomers in the 90's.    We have to fundamentally sever the connection between work and income.   Idiotic tripe put on the banner of every lazy underclass waiting for someone else to save them. There is a still a lot of work to be done and with the population growing globally as it is now, there has never been a better time to do it."
DarkFuturology,3cxj8s,Crash_says,3,Sat Jul 11 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"This demographic issue is precisely what predicted the Crash of 2008 as far back as 1990: too much real estate owned by too many aging-out boomers with not enough GenX, GenY and Millennial buyers having high income and low debt loads to soak it up.  It was apparent that far back.  (e.g. Peter Drucker in the 1990s)  Then add reductions in high value immigration thanks to 911 and construction bubbles that went on with cheap money and it really completely predictable except to those who chose not to see it out of greed.  If you look at the demographics of nations that are ""doing well"" in comparison, you find the demographic pyramid is the inverse of the US and developed countries having problems.  Long term that could be problematic in terms of resources but population demographics has always been a far better predictor of economics than any other parameter with resource availability being #2.     It doesn't always predict what people want to hear, however, so then they make up shit they want hear instead.  See also: Peak Oil, Global Warming, Overpopulation, etc."

DarkFuturology,3cxo4d,zxxx,2,Sat Jul 11 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"Sigh.  Yes.  This is generally the Epic Fail of using either Windows or Linux or any other high level OS as the primary embedded system OS for ANYTHING.  Here's simple rule:  if you are using any of these OSes for embedded systems, you are a failure as an engineer and product manager.  There are really no exceptions to this.  You are a failure!! It's always wrong as a product design strategy or architecture.  Why?   Because 99.999% of the time, the life cycle time of the product (years to decades with major feature changes as often as the latter) and the life cycle time of the underlying high-level OS (months to years with major feature changes as often as the former) are different by orders of magnitude of time.    And partly because of this, no R&D group nor their product management hierarchy, is generally amenable or willing to invest what it would take to maintain decent security of the product.  It. Just. Never. Happens.  An example I've had personal experience with is the Epic Fail of HP/Agilent/Keysight products using Microsoft Windows as an embedded OS.  This is not a medical device but it is representative of ""industrial products"" in general.   There is  stuff out there that I can't in good conscientious even mention because it's far, far worse in terms of security but more fundamentally in terms of customer value, satisfaction and cost of ownership.  Here is just one example: the HP 54845A.  Technically it's ""obsolete"" but honestly it was obsolete-on-delivery as a new product due to using Windows as the embedded OS.  Just a few problems that come with owning this dog (only a dog because of the OS choice - the actual electronics are actually superb but ruined by the OS):   Runs Win98 only Can not be upgraded to new Windows revs without breaking the product Data can be extracted from the instrument only by floppy disk or network connection Only old, unpatched, insecure versions of Windows file sharing works Can not be updated even with Win98 security patches without breaking the product (updates must be turned off and even blocked by firewall to avoid ""the catastrophe of updating"") Can not be safely connected to a network unless it is ""firewalled"" rather intensively (e.g. no web connections outbound from the instrument) Can not be turned on or be functionally used without a PS2 mouse being connected!! For this ""privilege"" you can pay $2K-$3K on the used market for this instrument. The official answer from the vendor (Keysight) is ""it's obsolete; don't use it; buy something new"" (on the latest Win OS that won't be supported/supportable for the operational life of the product because they've never learned). This from a company who's products routinely are used in everyday application for many decades - when I was an apps engineer I pretty regularly got calls from customers who were still using HP products sold in the 1940s and 1950s.  These products have very long useful lives.  The OSes they depend upon: not so much. Etc., etc.   Since I used to work for this company it's frankly embarrassing but again, yet another reason I don't work for this company any more.  The correct solution is to simply not use these kinds of high level OSes for this purpose.   And it's not just Windows that is wrong to use this way.  It would be equally wrong to use Linux or Mac OS X as an embedded OS for the same reasons.  The real reason for the vendor's choice is the convenience of the R&D or product staff in terms of cost and skills, NEVER because of security or customer quality/experience.   Using these OSes this way is a choice of laziness and customer hate.    The justification is always ""customers are familiar with the OS so ...""  But that's bullshit.  Customers want something that works and that is secure, but usually NOT specifically something that has a Windows GUI: they want a GUI that makes sense for their application, not a Windows GUI.  They may want Windows interactivity and data sharing but that's not the same thing.    It's all just another lie people tell themselves to justify decisions they've already made for more shallow, lazy and greedy reasons."

People are becoming reliant on algorithms that are difficult to understand because they're ""programmed"" by billions of examples of training data, not by humans.  If we don't understand the algorithm, it's much harder to fix it when it does something unexpected.  As another example, how should we handle racism in algorithms?  Machine learning algorithms are typically trained on huge datasets that are impractical to filter by hand.  If the content in the dataset is human-created and some subset of those humans have racist opinions, it follows that sometimes the algorithm itself will learn to be racist.  As these algorithms become more advanced we'll expect them to take over more tasks, particularly in cases where we want an objective and neutral third party making the decisions.  It's bad enough when you have racist human leaders calling the shots, but when they have racist algorithms justifying their actions it gives them more credibility."

That having said, evolution is relentless. While the large species will be lost forever, those that reproduce quickly have the potential to become new species, this happens. Ecosystems do not crash, new ones are being formed instead.  I am a pessimist and think that we will lose a shitload of species and that the current civilization will end in a disaster. After that life will continue, both human and otherwise."

Being able to refine and utilize fossil fuels stopped us from further exterminating whales for oil, and from cutting down the last tree in medieval Europe. Advances in fracking enabled the US to reduce carbon emissions by burning more methane and less coal.

Then we won't be able to build it again, and if we do, it won't ever look like what we have now again.  None of those sound remotely like reducing our carbon footprint. Fossil fuels are just another way of increasing it, even more than before. Solar power is collected and transported with materials made with fossil fuels that break down and need to be replaced.

DarkFuturology,3br0gn,zxxx,6,Wed Jul 1 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"So very true.  Add to this, however, that there is a Technology Amnesia happening as well which (especially combined with the digital amnesia mentioned) will utterly fuck the US in the next 10-30 years.  This Technology Amnesia is due to 1) manufacturing outsourcing, and 2) high tech knowledge is 50%-80% ""tacit knowledge"" that is only transferred by mentorship or internship or hands-on training, and 3) boomer engineer die-off is taking most critical technology knowledge to the grave without a transfer to younger generations.  The first is simple: the whole story of knowledge-service economics is a lie - it's not true: you don't move up the value chain to ""design, management, knowledge jobs"" by abandoning the icky, dirty jobs like manufacturing.  They are actually ""tied at the hip"": you can't design what you don't manufacture; you can't manage what you've never done yourself such as manufacturing; you can't contribute high value innovation without manufacturing because most of the innovation is manufacturing innovation which only is apparent in need, funded by need and justified by need when you are the person/corporation/nation doing the manufacturing.  Much of the knowledge and know-how can't really be written down.  Sure you can right textbooks or operations manuals but without the context of having done the job, such things are worth less than the paper they are written on because there are numerous subtleties that are NOT documented or included that you have to simply know from experience in the industry in question.  It's possible to relearn this knowledge ""the hard way"" by building a factory and losing money on it for a generation as everyone recapitulates the lost knowledge but no other nation is going to stop and let the US catch up (especially with how much the US has alienated the rest of the world over the last 20 years).  With the outsourcing of so much high tech manufacturing (e.g. all consumer electronics is gone; most industrial electronics is gone; most semiconductor is gone or leaving; most computer manufacturing is gone; and that's just the electrical/electronic high tech), the ecosystems that grew up around such industries that preserved and nurtured critical tacit knowledge have largely decayed and mostly gone now.  The same have sprung up in Asia.   As a result, most US corporation radically slowed their engineering hires in the 1990s-2000s to a degree that there is now a ""generational gap"" in EVERY engineering specialty in the US. You see this as most workplaces having mostly older engineers who will be retiring en-masse in the next 10 years.  Then there is a 20 year gap where you find relatively few between 30 and 50, and then there's a modest but much smaller cohort of under-30 engineers.   In general, most of these older engineers will retire or die before most of they they know about engineer, manufacturing or any other tacit knowledge is ever transferred.    You can contrast this with how the demographics is in Asian countries: generally there is both a balance of age cohorts AND usually a systematic process of ""raising up"" junior engineers by their elders.  This doesn't exist in the US.  Now combine this with even the loss of ""books and manuals"" that might give a sliver of a chance.  Suddenly the difficulties of computerizing Asian languages looks like a blessing. In places like Japan and China, faxes are still common for inter-office and intra-office communication because it's faster to write and fax than type and e-mail in many cases.  Books can still be seen as well."

That's not practical anymore with either modern US jobs or personal schedules/responsibilities.   The value from Rotary simply didn't match the cost of the time commitment required; there are easier ways of helping people.  Ditto for most of the other mentioned ""clubs"" or ""service organizations"". ALL spectator sports are very obviously and self-evidently, at best from their public value, nothing more than distracting Bread and Circuses with all the same purpose as in ancient Rome - an opiate of the masses to prevent rebellion.  And they are insanely expensive distractions for that privilege.  This is where anything electronic/online is a far, far better cheaper for both time and money with more quality if merely a distraction is desired.  The other value is being able to watch spoiled narcissists make fools of themselves.  But again there's competition.  And it's online. I will agree with the ""US is a totalitarian state"" to a large degree.  And that's why people atomize - it's the primary defense against centralization.  It's why people have ""cord cut"" and stopped watching the MSM if they have half a brain.  It's why they are not invested in things that the drumbeat of propaganda advertising or news claim are important.   None of those things matter because they aren't trusted and have no track record (especially with Millennials) to give indication that trust is warranted or should be given.  Hence they live online where a truth that works actually exists. Consider the economic realities of Millennials: greatest debt and lowest buying power per individual in the worst job market of any generation since the Great Depression generation.  This radically tinges everything.  This is why they statistically prefer city living to suburbs.  This is why statistically they don't have driver's license.  This is why they statistically value mass and alternative transit.  This is why they statistically don't own and may never own homes.  This is why they are statistically delaying marriage or altering its form.  What of these is being enabled by ""current values, government and society"" in practice?  Not a whole lot.  Infrastructure is fallow and rotting while racist wars of aggression are being waged for lies and fantasies.  But the propaganda of lies and denial is unmistakeable.  People on the ground know the US economy is a Potemkin's Village - there's no there there.  The cognitive dissonance is big enough to drive a train through.  And online is a refuge where you can earn money or find things you need despite the mainstream lies.   Note: I'm Baby Boomer and all these value propositions are pretty obvious to pick out for me.  I'm an old fart who doesn't game or Facebook, thus probably I don't really ""get it"" in terms of what makes Millennials tick but seriously, this part isn't hard to figure out if you merely open your eyes!

Anyway, enough of that.  Tiny houses are not as illegal as you think---it's considered a camper.  There is a legal exploit to the tiny house--it's that it's on wheels.  When it's built on wheels it's not a house it's either a mobile home or a vehicle so it can actually be anywhere if it fits that criteria.  Tiny houses are not typically considered a dwelling (hence not a mobile home) because they dont' fit the building codes requirement of I think 400sqft (dont' quote me on that).  If they are on wheels, aren't a mobile home then by law they must be a something else and so they are considered typically a camper vehicle.      There are subdivision covenants and/or HOA rules that disallow mobile homes, campers, RVs, where they can be seen, stored, etc.  There are zoning ordinances that don't allow multifamily homes.    So generally what people do is pay rent (and utils) at someone's place where they are allowed to have the tiny home.

What would be cool is if we could build developments that were right up with the street, had no parking, small rooms, really limited electric/heating/etc. I just don't see it happening, industrial construction is very expensive, the cost of land is expensive, and you just can't get around that with all the zoning and regulations we have on buildings.  My dream is to be an earthen building, and do things like have a composting toilet, gasifier, just enough power for computer+phone, and along these lines. Once I pay off my debt, this is my plan.

And cars are expensive as hell. Car payment, maintenance, gas, insurance. All that added up and for most people is easily $750 per month."
DarkFuturology,3bmn1z,spacemanspiff30,2,Wed Jul 1 12:36:27 2015 UTC,"You're drastically underestimating. You have to get data from reliable sources, like AAA. You're making up a scenario thinking you can pay $3000 cash, have liability insurance, and low maintenance costs.  AAA even has average cost of used car ownership. It's much higher than you suspect.  I believe you're using anecdotal evidence, I hear it all the time about how owning a car can be so cheap. In certain situations, maybe. However, on average, the cost of car ownership is well known, and it's high.  Also, someone has to buy the new cars to give people a steady supply of $3000 used cars. You must concede that not everyone can have a used car, or the prices would skyrocket!!  Do you know about the federal mileage rate? It's like $0.55 per mile! That's closer to the cost of ownership.  Here's some data, it ranges from $0.46-$0.72 per mile driven. Adults typically drive at least 15,000 on average (across all age groups of adults), so that's $575 to $900/mo, then you need 2 cars for 2 working people, so you're looking at $1150 to $1800. Ok, let's assume the low end of the spectrum. You're still talking about $1100 a month! A bicycle is very cheap, and a bus for two people would be like $300/mo. Also, living in the city you can often walk places, which is free. Think about this.....  http://newsroom.aaa.com/2014/05/owning-and-operating-your-vehicle-just-got-a-little-cheaper-aaas-2014-your-driving-costs-study/  Like I said, obviously buying used and holding on to your car works, but not everyone can own a used car for obvious reasons.

There are tons of used cars out there and tons more that end up going to a junk yard that could probably be repaired if someone with a brain got a hold of it.   A doctor making $300k a year doesn't need to worry about driving a car that is $3k. Someone making $30k a year straight out of college  (or in general) should still be driving a $3k used car with 100-120k miles that is still in reasonable condition. I was driving a $1,500 2000 Corolla with 200,000 miles and put 30,000 miles on it and only had minor issues. You can use google and figure out how to fix damn near anything on your car these days. I figured out a wiring issue that a guy spent $2k chasing down with a mechanic. He came to the forums to let everyone know if they have such and such issue, just do this. All I needed to do was run a new ground from a relay.   I currently drive a 15 year old Audi that isn't nearly as expensive to fix if you do the repairs yourself. I recently had to do the brakes on it, I called the dealership and they quoted me $1,200 (I called out of curiosity) and I did the brakes myself with a friend for $160. Maybe not a skill everyone can learn, but a lot can.  And I am aware that cars owned and traveled have peaked, so have drivers licenses for kids turning 16. Peak oil is changing a lot of shit, but we're still on a pretty flat decline.   And I'll go ahead and address the city living thing here too. I know you say my evidence is anecdotal, and that's fine, but it's also observational. I've been to a lot of cities and the ones that live downtown, outside of the yuppies living in towers (like that article talks about), are usually artistic types. I run across way more people that are radically left and interested in environmentalism in downtown areas. Your basic white people that know nothing about peak oil or climate change still want to live in the burbs (cause every basic white person I know is still living the American dream). All those statistics are just conglomerating data from a bunch of people. It tells you nothing about the actual people and the breakdowns in who is choosing what, where and why. It is very impersonal.   So you say my data is anecdotal and not worth bringing to discussion, and I say go sit in a coffee shop downtown for a couple days and come back and talk to me."

I just can't afford that, but I can afford a payment on a 5-10 year old car w no issues.  Also, the used car scenario is still more expensive than you imagine. Major things start to go out on a car that age, you start to regularly have high bills.  Doing your own car repair just isn't feasible for many people. You might need to buy expensive tools, and you may need it fixed immediately. My job requires I have a car daily, so I'd need multiple cars."

Kolko has a theory: As American cities have become safer and more expensive, they have become increasingly dominated by the affluent and well-educated — exactly the people who drive the media narrative.""   Basically, gentrification.  These affluent and well-educated types are the ones pushing sustainability and green capitalism nonsense. They're very eco conscious. However they're not educated in science enough to know how hypocritical their own behavior is, flying around all over the world in airplanes, maybe even to go participate in some feel-good volunteer project. They know climate change is bad and that we should try to limit it, but they really have no idea what that means for their own life.  So I guess in light of that I'll concede the climate change bit, though the study said that the younger generations did believe that humans were a contributor to climate change at a higher rate than the old farts. As for not thinking it'll affect them, that is likely because you're more self-absorbed at a younger age, trying to figure out your place in life. I think as millennials age they'll definitely become more concerned about it. Far more concerned than their parents are right now.   I still want to read how they framed the questions too.

The most popular environmental book of all times is ""Limits to Growth"" from 1972, now most people haven't heard of it, and get VERY defensive if you try to explain the book.   I just think it's all about money, the move to cities is due to the concentration of modern industries and peak oil. Look at oil prices since WWII. They have been relatively low except around when US production peaked in 1970s, then when global oil peaked around early 2000s. Both has big consequences. Funny thing, the bike boom had little to do w/ the 1970s spike in oil prices, instead that was people choosing to ride bikes because they saw the writing on the wall.

I guess you forget too that the cost of gas has been way above historical averages, or that housing prices are way up.   People are far less interested in the environment now that in the late 60s through early 80s.   Things like Netflix are popular because it's incredibly cheap. If people could afford it, they'd rather have cable and go to movies. People go out to eat because their jobs demand so much of their time that they can't cook.

If the U.S. is totalitarian, that word has largely been stripped of any meaning. Compared to most places in the world, the state has an extremely limited impact on the day to day lives of most people in the U.S., and we are able to openly challenge it on a regular basis while suffering at worst mild consequences in the vast majority of cases. Most people in the U.S. seem to have no real idea what it looks like to live in a state that is legitimately totalitarian. Believe me, it is fucking worlds apart. The world not conforming to your personal ideal of justice is not totalitarianism. If this is a totalitarian state, it is the most flexible, responsive, rapidly evolving totalitarian state in world history. The U.S. has plenty of problems, but totalitarianism isn't one of them.    Hence they live online where a truth that works actually exists.   Or they retreat to little echo chambers that just reinforce what they already think. Skepticism of authority is one thing. The outright antagonism towards any information issued by an authority is almost pathological at this point though. It is to the point where people are more willing to trust random internet bloggers over professionals with literally decades of experience and expertise simply because the blogger is fighting against a perceived form of authority. It is like some sort of reverse appeal to authority sometimes. They ought to have an Aversion to Authority fallacy.    greatest debt and lowest buying power per individual in the worst job market of any generation since the Great Depression generation.

OP just sort of takes it as if it is a given without even bothering to establish was a totalitarian state actually is nor the ways in which the U.S. actually conforms to such a definition.

And that isn't conspiracy nonsense, that is what the so-called Founding Fathers specifically set out to achieve in the pursuit of avoiding what they called ""mob rule.""  Furthermore, it isn't just that it isn't ""responsive to personal politics,"" which is probably actually a good thing, but rather it is a system that concentrates disproportionate amounts of power in the hands of relative minority groups.

Representative democracy is a well established form of democracy, and no actual political scientist ever says this nonsense about the u.s. being a republic, not a democracy. The only reason we even talk about the U.S. being a republic is because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the term because of interest in Roman forms of government during the formation of the United States. This misunderstanding has carried over into the present day and is frequently parroted by    And that isn't conspiracy nonsense, that is what the so-called Founding Fathers specifically set out to achieve in the pursuit of avoiding what they called ""mob rule.""   That was a concern of some of the founding fathers, most notably Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and this is why we ended up with a Senate specifically. Hamilton also wanted the President to be a lifetime appointment. Obviously he didn't get that wish because guys like Jefferson had a very different perspective on this issue. Contrary to popular belief, the founding fathers were a very diverse group of fellows with a wide range of opinions on how the government ought to be organized. They often outright hated each other, but they were reasonable enough to compromise and come up with an effective system of government that fulfilled many of their wishes without perfectly representing any of their idealized visions. One might say it was almost democratic.

Furthermore, it isn't just that it isn't ""responsive to personal politics,"" which is probably actually a good thing, but rather it is a system that concentrates disproportionate amounts of power in the hands of relative minority groups.   All political systems in history suffer from this problem. The question is the degree to which the system mitigates the tendency of a few to accumulate power at the expense of the many. The U.S. political system, while far from perfect and always showing room for reform, does a very good job of accommodating a very wide array of interests. Too many people mistakenly imagine that there is some ideal world that can be a reality without bothering to consider whether such a world is possible, and whether such a world is actually desirable to any but a narrow group.

It's also become clear that lobbying has short-circuited and thus made irrelevant representative democracy and created the emergence of the deep state--the shadow government that is the corporate controlled military-security industrial complex that is creating an ever increasingly disempowering political atmosphere that is causing people to simply roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders and continue this incredible ruse resentfully.  The average, affluent middle class american knows that they have no political power now, but they still continue to think and act like they do because this cultural landscape has created a deep cognitive dissonance to maximize confusion because--at the end of the day--confusion and disempowerment make for a great combination to extract the most economic value out of people in terms of consumerism (they buy more) and labor inputs (they work more as a distraction).  The only way out of this is for people to realize and quickly, transactionally (all at once) that true direct democracy is in fact, possible because of the internet.  The internet enables us to vote on things.  There could be a semi-representative democracy that is like a self-driving car that allows a user to drive: a voted rep will make decisions by default, but people can override that decision.  Everyone gets one vote on every issue, and if they don't vote the rep will do it for them.  This model is entirely possible and the only reason electronic voting over the internet has not been considered is because some high level technical people were coerced into making statements that it's not possible.  Enough time has passed that the experts have come out to say that it is in fact possible either with the internet or a low tech print approach that uses the internet securely.  I myself am an expert on this matter and was asked my opinion by a court regarding security of voting machines and found there was no security because of an exploit a child could easily find to open the database and alter votes.  This was on a microsoft access database on windows, so that should tell you something already about security.  The real problem is that our representatives are now having to make judgments on technical issues they have no background or capacity to understand.  They will find just anyone who is a expert that they know will represent their view and then make them testify in congress for them.  This is essentially another form of lobbying really.  It's cherry picking your experts to the exclusion of others such that you get what you want.   I designed on paper a sound internet voting system that uses encryption, separated databes for metadata and the vote, publication of your vote anonymously as a means of parity in tally, peer tallying (to prevent quantuminsert attacks), and this is done through a torsite/eepsite that is mirrored several times in countries outside of the country in which the vote is done, thus preventing tampering from intelligence communities by sharding the jurisdictional administraion, making it extremely obvious if anything is changed."

As soon as you can show it works, and isn't just a nice sounding ideal that fall apart in practice, then I am quite sure more and more places will start adopting it. Frankly, based just on the ballot initiative process in Oregon where people lower taxes, make new taxes nearly impossible, strip critical infrastructure funding to pay for pet projects and then pass ballot initiatives for unfunded liabilities, the idea of an internet based direct democracy horrifies me.   As a group, humans are reactionary and tend to show little in the way of foresight. This problem is bad enough with a representative democracy where leaders feel the need to respond to the whims of their constituency. That problem would be amplified many fold in a direct democracy. Direct democracy sounds nice and all in theory, but I am quite sure in practice it would be a complete cluster-fuck.   Hell, ancient Athens was a direct democracy for a decent stretch, and they did plenty of horrible shit. This despite being a very small population that was tremendously rich by ancient standards and with a good amount of leisure time due to the prevalence of slavery. There is a reason guys like Plato looked longingly to the actual tyranny of Sparta and tended to be rather dismissive of their brand of democracy. Representative democracy legitimately solves many of the problems of direct democracy by providing space for (comparatively) sober debate while still providing citizens a voice and a vote."

I think as a roadmap you have to dismantle lobbying and the only way to do that is to do it better than the powers that are already using that exploit.

It is a piece of evidence towards that claim, but it is far from being sufficient to establish that claim.   Also, in many other developed countries this kind of spying not only exists, but is in fact completely legal. In the U.K. for example, they have CCTV that monitors nearly every minute of every day of people's activities in public spaces. France recently approved a sweeping domestic surveillance bill, pretty much of the same scope as the NSA spying in the U.S., with the key distinction that it is about to be legally codified by their own legislature. In general, European spy agencies have been cooperating in similar domestic spying activitiesd. So the belief that what the U.S did was completely unique is misplaced. The main difference is just the sheer amount of money that the U.S. pumps in to the NSA, and that is mostly just because the US has such a massive economy and a large budget set aside for such programs.   In general, the U.S. has stronger protections for privacy rights and in particular for due process rights than many European countries. Certainly since 9/11, spy agencies have really pushed the boundaries of what is legal, but that problem isn't really restricted to the U.S. and we have the benefit of Constitutionally enshrined civil protections that don't exist in many other countries.  While it is fair to say a lot of those protections have been eroded at the margins, it is simply wild exaggeration to call the state of affairs totalitarian. We still have strong individual civil rights as citizens that provide us due process and which protect us from the state, and those rights are regularly upheld in the courts despite opposition from the government. That would never happen in a totalitarian state."

DarkFuturology,3bmn1z,chayhaus,6,Wed Jul 1 07:48:15 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not a millenial, I'm part of ""generation x"" - I think.  I also think this has a lot more to do with opportunity cost, an abundance of new recreational choices and life paths, a social network that isn't reliant on organizations or schedules, and rapidly evolving social values -  not ""totalitarianism"" or any politics (unless those 7 paragraphs were meant to be Snowden-ish /r/conspiracy material.)    Millenials don't buy into the ""mainstream lifestyle"" crap. Why go to a (overpriced!) race when you can stay at home and race your friends (or hop in a car or on a bike and do it yourself on the street after organizing it online)? Why spend an entire days wages on nose-bleed seats and over-priced food when you can have friends over and watch on your widescreen, splitting the price with your friends or by streaming the event online?  Who gambles or bets anymore, other than oddballs who identify as being gamblers?  Why would anyone join a rotary club? What is a rotary club and how would one ever be exposed to one in the first place?  I personally can't find any religion or social club that lines up with both my priorities and my schedule.  As most Americans do these days, I have very little free time, familial obligations, little money, an established social network that is not insular, and many interests - all which has absolutely nothing to do with any organization, much less the ""totalitarian"" government."

This is my mindset right now. I'm going to be voting for Bernie in 2016 because he wants to break up the ""too big to fail"" corporations. However, he's not president yet, and even he has admitted that it may be too late to curtail the corporations' power. If we can't peacefully handle the wealth inequality situation, we'll handle it in the way you describe.

In the world as it is, it is simply because the wealthy do not want to extend their wealth towards public works.  Areas that must be maintained for optimum business, are.  So the shiny areas set aside for cafes and Apple stores are generally pretty clean.    But if a large portion of the population were unemployed (as envisioned in this film) there wouldnt be any money to fix, maintain, or clean the places where all of these jobless - and thus poor - people lived.  Even now, you dont see the rich trying to gussy up down and out areas in Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, or L.A. out of the goodness of their hearts.  These areas are where the poorer segments of the population live.  Increase unemployment, you will increase poverty, and you will then increase dilapidation.  This is all doubly true for the areas where stuff is made.  The mines, smelters, refineries, and chemical plants that would all be necessary for all of this robot labor would be a massive blight, and likely quite toxic.

Here is what dark futurology is about: Wealth inequality is worse than it's ever been, the ""haves"" are financially benefiting from technology far faster than the have nots and that is serving to condense power onto a small number of individuals while disenfranchising the majority of the worlds population. Soon these people won't need us, automation technology will make us superfluous and then we will either survive on the scraps they throw to us if we are lucky or watch as they leave us to rot while having no recourse as they are in control of technology that can effortlessly and perfectly suppress us.    OR, from the sidebar:   What is the Dark Future?  The global ruling class is indifferent to the needs and dreams of the global masses. But when we're no longer required to reproduce, work, consume and pay taxes, what's next? Automation, natural limits, and new inequalities will be the gamechangers of the 21st century. Our well-schooled world leaders maintain absolute silence on such crucial matters.Imagine the ferocity of competition for wealth and status if the rewards were material luxury and extended lifespans and perfect offspring and supercharged intelligence/emotions."

I do all of my development and debugging in a windows IDE that communicates with the embedded DSP over a JTAG interface.  On the other hand, if you're merely suggesting to get him acquainted with those lower levels I can't agree enough, I believe that all aspiring programmers/software developers should start their education with boolean logic, digital circuits, and processor architecture and move up to machine language and assembly language and then and ONLY then to compiled higher level languages.

And on a side note, probably isn't a strong enough warrant for that conclusion.  Newspapers, books, and magazines all have narrow focuses. Even with something as diverse as the news, a Wall Street Journal or New York Times newspaper is a static creation that covers a predictable set of stories. There isn't any additional functionality that the printed word provides other than to convey meaning impressed by someone at a previous date.  Compare that now to any desktop PC, or even better, a tablet. The device is multifaceted and dynamic. It can do just about anything you can damn well imagine, from playing games, reading, chatting with friends, solving math problems, coding software, etc. In fact, all of this can occur real-time -- and does. I work in IT, and I can assure you that I do in fact multitask (even though multitasking is less efficient than doing one task at a time, but I digress).  The point? The comparison between the printed word and a computer is simply not valid. Technology encompasses so many different things that it can and does substitute or act as a surrogate for human companionship. There are many dimensions of interactivity that you can achieve with a computer that you simply cannot do with a book. And whether this -- which enables people to spend longer periods in front of a computer screen -- is a good thing is debateable."

DarkFuturology,3a36jg,Infosopher,2,Wed Jun 17 08:38:10 2015 UTC,"If the brakes broke down, then the computer will apply the Emergency Brake.  That's why it's called the Emergency Brake.  If a school bus is crashing towards your car then you would die crashing into it anyway, because IT'S A BUS.  Not to mention, you seem to be assuming that somehow the bus will suffer an even more catastrophic failure before your car has to make this decision, because Think of The Children (TM, Patent Pending) School Bus Driver 4.9 would have to lose control of the bus in the first place.  The first rule of self driving vehicles is that they automatically obey the rules of the road.  That means they don't speed, they slow down for corners, they are travelling at 20mph or less in school zones, etc."
DarkFuturology,3a36jg,CambriaPAGAN,2,Wed Jun 17 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"This brings up a really key point. If ALL cars on the road are automated, and if they all communicate with each other automatically, these scenarios can only happen if there is a mechanical malfunction, in which case the other cars on the road will all adapt to that situation. So if a car suddenly has no brakes, other cars on the road will simply adapt and allow that car's velocity to die out due to surface friction and gradually come to a halt safely.  If all vehicles are automated and communicating there will be no  issues. In a world of automated/semi-automated cars, the biggest danger is the moronic fleshbags behind the wheel. The problem will be making the transition through the upcoming stage of semi-automated cars, but as it starts to happen and insurance companies and car manufacturers get real statistics and see how less frequent crashes occur while the ""automated mode"" is turned on, the transition should happen quite quickly.  During that phase there likely will need to be a utilitarian approach to dealing with problems, balanced with a sense of liability ie. if some idiot runs into moving traffic and the only options are to either swerve and hurt the driver or try to stop even though the calculations say there will still be a collision with the pedestrian, let the collision happen (especially considering the improved collision safety ratings of modern cars, crumple zones etc.)"

It won't have any survival instinct, it won't be programmed to accept the risk of endangering other people in order to save your own. You and anyone in your vehicle will be seen as an acceptable loss because no other legal entity (automaker, programmer, state, or insurance company) will accept the responsibility for making any mistakes when the most rational choice is to accept your fate and die without risking the lives of random people on the other side of the road."

DarkFuturology,39new9,pherlo,4,Fri Jun 26 08:05:10 2015 UTC,"AI is still a pipe dream at this point. We're still early in the process of discovering the tools that intelligence needs to think, but we're nowhere near producing an AI that can learn in a self-directed manner, and deal with novel input. No one knows how to do that.   As an example of what I mean, consider this paper which shows just how little current AI understands what it's looking at.   We aren't working on intelligent agents able to replace us right now, except in very specialized domains that were never really hard problems in the first place (hard for us maybe, but not essentially difficult). At best, we're replicating various modules and specialized functionality found in the brain, but the overall structure of mentation of a housefly is beyond our current state of the art, and i see no evidence that the problem has been cracked yet.   My guess given the rate of real (exponential) progress on this problem is that a working model of a minor intelligence like a mouse is still two decades away at best. We're limited by how we think of computation as a sequence of steps, and I bet biological intelligence has many nonlinear and temporal aspects (heck, maybe even quantum aspects) that we completely fail to model, and don't even know how to think about yet.  As an example of this problem, consider how self-driving cars get into more accidents. It's not because humans around them aren't following the rules of the road like some suggest. It's that there are far more rules of the road than we initially thought. These are communicated via side-channels created between drivers and between pedestrians, like glances, momentum changes, and body weight shifts. These are subtle and cultural rules that self-driving cars are blind to, and they are why a self-driving cars will probably never drive in a complicated and busy city with few signs and traffic signals. To be able to understand these rules, you have to be raised a human, and learn all of our cultural and contextual cues, how our body is affected by gravity. And all of this feeds back in real time through various layers of attention systems.  The solution I usually hear to this problem is that we need more rules of the road, so that the automated drivers have a chance to succeed, and boo to anyone who breaks the rules. But that's not artificial intelligence. Such machines will not be replacing us and our civilization any time soon. qed."

No one can give someone else self-respect; people can only acquire that for themselves. The rest of can influence whether they can do that - Source  Addiction to power is always about emptiness that you try to fill from the outside. - Source  I believe this lack is result of living in a competitive environment (see ""No Contest"" by Alfie Kohn and ""Non-Violent Communication"" by Marshall Rosenberg.   Meat-bags have always been murderous, en masse, impelled to violence by rulers who seek retribution due to age-old feuds   Revenge is not universal, secondly it's not that easy to kill (see ""On Killing"" by Dave Grossman) and third: have you ever noticed that our means for conflict resolution are competitive?

Not saying many don't enjoy the easy money and select their punters carefully, or with cams, not have punters at all.  But sex should, as far as possible, be something we do voluntarily, and not for money.

A big plate of tacos can be better if I fry my own tortillas and pick my lettuce fresh from the garden. That's not gonna stop me from whoring my money out to Taco Bell for the convenience.  I challenge this whole notion that sex is something valuable that should be put onto a pedestal. What if I told you that having sex for fun doesn't have to ruin your life? Not if you protect yourself against any unwanted consequences.  Our society has this bizarre and twisted view on sex, as if it's this big life altering decision that should be made carefully or else your whole life comes crashing down. It's doesn't.   There is nothing at all intrinsically harmful about safe sex. It's just an activity. It's just something people do for pleasure. Just a penis in a vagina leading to stimulation of the good ol' dopamine receptors. Just like eating a damned taco. That's not to say that its not a lot more enjoyable when you partake in it with someone you care strongly about. Then again, the same is true of sharing a taco with someone that is extra special to you. Just because I haven't met that extra special someone yet doesn't mean I'm going to deprive myself of tacos. I'm very thankful to Taco Bell in the mean time for making my taco acquisition a simple and straight-forward task."

All you have to do is compare the average ""crack whore"" to a high end escort. One is addicted to drugs, and has no money. The other lives a rather lavish lifestyle, and is emotionally sound. The only thing they have in common is prostitution.   By demonizing prostitution, you make it a terrible profession. If you look at countries where it is legal, and accepted, you will find much healthier, happier prostitutes. They have unions, healthcare, legal protection (they're not afraid to call the cops if trouble ever arises). They don't have pimps taking all their money.   A prostitute is like a doctor, a therapist, or a masseuse. They solve a problem in a caring, yet detached manner. In Britain, there is a group of prostitutes who sexually service those with physical disabilities, who would never have sex in any ""natural"" way. These are people who would spend the rest of their lives never knowing physical pleasure or intimacy.   Is it right to demonize a person who would be so giving? Isn't it more archaic to think that there is something wrong with a person who could be so giving?

It's basically saying ""We're not fucking enough, which is bad because we're not popping out enough babies"". People aren't breeders. It isn't their duty to have children.   In reality, we do have an abundance of ""sex"", just not traditional, reproductive sex. Hell, if I get a VR headset, an awesome sex toy, and some spare time, I could satisfy any sexual need I ever had (or at least, technology is heading that way). Would that make me ""sexless"" or ""undersexed""? No, it just means I'm not dumping baby batter in a vagina."
DarkFuturology,395tro,Syphon8,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think you quite understand what sex is, my friend. As other commenters have said, sex has never been free and abundant. Not for humans, animals, or otherwise. You have to examine what the role of sex is in the first place - it is the primary means of reproducing and transmitting oneself into another generation. In no animal society do females mate freely with any male. The males compete viciously to prove their superior vitality and, in the higher species, superior capacity to care for the female's young.   Sex has always been a transaction: something is gained, to the exclusion of the others. The layman's term for this is the distinction between Alphas and Betas. This distinction is important for a reason, and that is that it is a pretty useful (if overtly simplistic) term for natural selective behavior in nature. Males and females have always vied for prime specimens to mate with. By that principle, there is always a certain level of sexual scarcity."

Sex was never 'free and abundant' on the plains of Africa, and this false argument to nature doesn't help your case.  Unless you consider rape a better alternative. Even monkeys, when introduced to the concept of money, will learn they can exchange sex for additional coins.  Prostitution, especially open and regulated prostitution as you are in Aus is absolutely not a sign of something broken, it's acknowledgment that we're finally getting over Judeo-Christian biases in western society.  The bottom line is that saying there's something wrong with prostitution is tantamount to telling women what they can and can't do with their own bodies. Which is a bad thing."

Here is the situation with conventional taxis in Melbourne: - there are not enough of them - they refuse fares that they consider too small or inconvenient  - it is impossible to order them by phone, as there is a 30-40 minute phone queue.  - if you order them online you have to factor in at least 30 mins wait time, and of course they won't even turn up for a small fare. - half the time they will not show up at all and when you call to find out where they are they say that they went to the address and nobody was there - clearly a lie, they just couldn't be fucked. - they are racist against aboriginal people - they are very expensive - their transactional costs are about 10% of their gross income at least - most cab drivers have to pay a daily car rental fee of around $140 - to make the minimum wage those taxi drivers have to work about 60 hours per week at least, so their hourly rate is ridiculously low - drivers are often rude, will not take directions, or complain to customers  - customers are anonymous and there are few consequences for them behaving badly.  On the other hand, Uber in Melbourne: - rating system keeps driver and customer behaviour mostly in check. - drivers typically make at least $15/hour.  - drivers can't refuse fares, which mathematically works to their advantage over time (when left to the individual, self-defeating choices are made, that's part of the reason cabbies don't make enough money) - customer has all the certainty that real time geolocation technology combined with smartphones can provide, and rarely have to wait longer than 10 mins.   My point is that taxi drivers and taxi customers were both being exploited under the old regime, so while we should certainly look out for emerging problems with the Uber system, I don't think we should be giving credence to the spin of taxi industry advocates who claim to care about workers' rights."

I'm not having bad luck, the problems I've described have happened over years and I still have to call cabs for clients so I still have a perspective of both options. And I can tell you that Uber most of the time in Zone 1 takes about 5 mins to arrive, and in very busy times or in the wee hours when not many drivers are about, it takes about 10-12mins.

We've only been able to do it because we have plentiful access to cheap energy: oil, coal and uranium.  Our coal and oil deposits are the result of unlikely circumstances: plants and algae were allowed to decay for tens of millions of years without rotting, simply because bacteria hadn't invented the correct enzymes yet. That doesn't seem very likely to occur on other planets, and definitely won't happen again on ours.  So what if other civilizations didn't have the luxury of millions of tons of energy in the ground? They would have to develop rocket science from solar-powered energy (essentially, burning plants and harvesting animal labour). It may take a very long time until society agrees that collecting enough energy for space travel is worth it."

They might live on planet with a dense atmosphere, opening up the possibility to use blimps as sky-cranes to significantly lower the energetic requirements to reach escape velocity.   They might be more successful at hydrogen-fusion then we are. They could use a direct fusion drive or use the energy from fusion power-plants to synthesize chemical fuel.  Individuals might have significantly longer lifespans, or their species might have a hive mind, making long-term fuel collecting projects possible.  One thing is clear if you don't have the luxury of Billions of tons of energy in the ground, it must be a very appealing prospect to put up solar power harvesting technology into space once you exhausted all the surface area on your planet."

Being on the student end of things at a large state business school I can relate to how bland and devoid of thought university class rooms typically are. The customers (students) paid their fuckin money, so give them a show. Join Greek life, 'network', get some bullshit degree and bam you are set. Business professors were the rockstars with the highest pay and those with tenure could blab on about whatever crazy ideology they were taken by at the moment.  Of course don't forget all the international students who paid a premium to attend a top US business school. Doesn't matter if they can't read or write for shit. Pass them, just like they pass all the cheaters.   Science courses and the humanities were my only salvation and I was lucky to find some great professors in those departments. But those students overwhelmingly become a part of academia itself. The scientists who go to BASF and Dow rarely have the 'skills' or social acumen to be big enough assholes to break into management positions of any significance. All the Eichmanns coming out of business school are the cogs who keep this grand show ever rising towards the heavens.

To give an example: One of my history teachers brought Mein Kampf to class. He had us read and do an analysis (read the text, explain it, talk about the author, relate it to it's historical context). Several students complained, and went to the headmaster. The teacher explained why he had brought it, and that he wanted us to read it to feel uncomfortable.

The police in this world have to affect disney-style holograms of stuffed animals, so their presence doesn't upset the population, who have become so mentally fragile that anything less than a mediated, cartoon, reality could cause them to devolve into near psychosis.   So, you have to imagine this trend continuing through an entire generation, and creating a whole generation of people who've never discussed any important issues in an academic setting, who think that being the most entitled to hurt feelings is the most important issue, and who only need to have the most verifiable solid claim on the most powerful 'identity' to be recognized as an authority."

Narcissism is much more than ""loving oneself"", Freud popularized only half the story and missed the moral. Narcissus' mother was tricked into cursing her son, in exchange for a long life he was cursed with the inability to ever truly know himself. He created an idea of himself which he fell in love with, but was Incapable of actual introspection, leading to his death.

It's the identical technique that was invented in 1862 called ""Pepper's Ghost"". There's nothing high-tech about the projection, and ""hologram"" is just a marketing term.  The article even says:   Technically speaking, it's not really a hologram. It's just a reflection with a holographic feel.   A real hologram would be so much more, and such higher tech. Probably 50 years away at least. It wouldn't bug me so much if it weren't such an extreme exaggeration. It's as if I jumped a bicycle off a ramp, and people said it was a cold-fusion Mars rocket."

Dr. Who did something similar in an episode where people induced artificial bliss in their bodies and all died.  However, even more terrifying to me is the idea of a virtual consciousness experiencing pain, insanity, extreme loneliness, terror, or something like that if we screw up.  Speaking of AI and mind uploading though, I believe most people's expectations of near future breakthroughs are way overblown. I say this based on nothing but the fact that we still have no real idea how consciousness in our own brains works, how can we hope to ever create an artificial consciousness while barely understanding our own? When I see some significant new insights in neuroscience or some such field explaining how we actually work, then I will start to worry about self aware AI and mind uploading."
DarkFuturology,3845qz,working_shibe,4,Mon Jun 1 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly most ""singularity"" fanatics know nothing about neurology.  Nor have they thought through the implications very deeply.  For example:   How much of ""experience"" is already synthetic - our bandwidth from the real world into our brains is incredibly low - so low that it's a physical impossibility that we human have ever had ""a live feed"" to reality.  Most of what we think we see or perceive to be ""real"" is actually nothing more than what our brains predict/imagine/assume we should see hinted from the low bandwidth cues we manage to percolate through our senses  How human intelligence is largely defined by our sensory connections to the world (cut them off and things go wonky) How human emotion and biological instincts (even in introverted, hyper rational minds) is inseparable from intelligence and actually create most reasons for both desires and ethics/morals - omit that part or try to suppress it and it won't end well. How this is all backed up by millions of year of evolution that isn't going to sit-up-and-die because someone says it should by ""uploading"" into a ""rational computer"".  Our brains are not rational and can never be made so - rationality is a fleeting emergent result of training; not an inevitability. How the reliability of semiconductors (or specifically the lack thereof) will not allow economically viable ""uploading"" - if you have to replace your physical ""host"" every 5-10 years, what are you doing to pay for the privilege while ""inside""? How the same goes for energy consumption to run your computer ""host"" - the human brain is far more energy efficient than any computer, current or hypothesized.  So again, what are you doing inside to justify this cost? How related to this, what exactly prevents you from becoming a slave in the machine or even the fly that gets its wings torn off for kicks by people who own the physical hosts and are still physical?  Once your body is gone you have no recourse.  This relates to your justification of real world cost to host you. How if literal/physical mechanisms of human intelligence are somehow duplicated, all the pathologies will not only come along for the ride but will actually be likely to be far more amplified - possibly dominant.  Psychopathy.  Sociopathy.  Narcissism.  Obsessive-Compulsion."

If this stuff gets to the bliss amplification level, good luck setting an alarm clock to get people out of the box to go to work.  How much of a market for a small one will there be so you can at least tolerate a bad job while nobody's looking?  Kind of like everybody watching TV in the movie Brazil.  The second the boss isn't looking, whole office watching the show.  When he peeks out, everybody working diligently.  On amplification of all of the bad mental processes, that's an interesting point.  I can imagine the early iterations of this technology will require a doctor present just to keep the system tuned.  Maybe in coordination with some pharmaceuticals being introduced to balance the bad thoughts.  This is kind of a wild topic.  I keep reading how everybody thinks that VR is going to be the ultimate technology because people will just drown in it.

Many car keys have a fob on them that has to be close to the car to be used.  Now there are amplifiers that thieves will use.   They walk up to the target car parked out front of a store/house, turn on the amplifier, and hit the door handle.  The handle says HEY KEY, ARE YOU OUT THERE?  And now the amplified signal replies YEP.  Car opens, and in some cases can be started and driven away.  Now apply this to your finances.

So roughly 90 times the rate of death by car crash than by heatwave.  Which means the heatwave could get 90x worse before it gets to the same level as car crashes in the US.  Two points. While a lot of people die in car crashes in the US, nobody considers this ""thinning the herd"" and it's effect on population density is negligible.  And having people you care about die in a car crash/heat wave does nothing to improve your quality of life.
