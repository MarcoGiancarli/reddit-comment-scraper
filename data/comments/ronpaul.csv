If we have an agreement with them on nuclear issues, sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program can't stay for ever and 5 and 7 years sounds very reasonable because until then we know if they are cheating or not.  we can always impose more sanctions for other reasons like sponsor of terrorism,  but we can't have a deal on nuclear issue and keep the nuclear related sanctions forever."

ronpaul,3ddvgi,mars4rp,11,Wed Jul 15 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Then you're an idiot. Rand Paul is playing this perfectly.    He's playing the game. Rand wins nothing but alienation from the base by supporting this. And for what? This thing is as good as a done deal. This 60 days is nothing but a dog and pony show. Rand wins nothing by supporting it.  Instead, by coming out against it, he gives cover to the conservatives who don't like the deal, and becomes a lead Republican opinion on what is wrong with the deal. If Rand Paul doesn't like it, it's worth noting why he doesn't like it. Every leftist newsie with a camera will want to ask him about his position. And the ones on the right will roll him out like royalty and talk about what a smart guy he is. And It turns out that his points are pretty salient: 1) sanctions relief precedes evidence of compliance 2) Iran is left with significant nuclear capacity 3) it lifts the ban on selling advanced weapons to Iran  Rand Paul's opposition to this makes him look like a reasoned statesman caught in between the ravenous Lindsey Grahams of the world, and the ever persistent perception of a capitulating Obama among conservative voters.   People don't really understand how brilliant Rand Paul has run his campaign so far. Especially the old Ron Paul folks who would rather be right than win the presidency. That time has passed. Now is the time for playing the game, and Rand has the best show on the road in that regard. Rand Paul isn't in this game to merely spread the libertarian message the way his father was. He's in it to win. Whether he will or not remains to be seen, but that is clearly the goal, and he's pretty well positioned right now, all things told.  Over the next 60 days, this deal is going to be hammered. Rand Paul would gain absolutely nothing either pre-presidency or post-presidency, by supporting this deal. He gains plenty, and actually has a chance to considerably elevate his profile by coming out against it."
ronpaul,3ddvgi,MorningLtMtn,7,Wed Jul 15 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Iran is left with significant nuclear capacity   Not that this contradicts your main points, but maybe it's worth pointing out that as a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran actually has a right to develop peaceful nuclear capabilities."

ronpaul,3bxxgj,plazman30,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"But vaccines are not 100% effective on their own.  With the ""herd"" approach, they become almost so, but individually, someone still is at risk.  The polio vaccine is 99% effective, which sounds good, until you consider that my old school has roughly 5,000 people, which means 50 people who were vaccinated are still at risk."
ronpaul,3bxxgj,brentwilliams2,0,Fri Jul 3 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"When do you trade acceptable risk for rights though? Those 50 people have a very low risk, and the effects of herd immunity applies at a lesser effect when a large portion of the people are vaccinated. But if our only goal was to completely avoid any chance of the disease we would all go the bubble boy route.   Some people just have different standards of acceptable risks, especially when at risk of losing a fundamental pillar on what their rights are."
ronpaul,3bxxgj,zennaque,0,Fri Jul 3 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"The thing about it is that I believe that people have the duty to take reasonable precautions about not impacting other people.  For example, we would not allow a person to drive a car with giant metal spikes on it (I'm assuming at least) because it could cause fatal damage if in a car accident.  A libertarian might say that they should have the right to drive with a massively spiked car, and that he/she has not gotten in a wreck yet, but ultimately, sometimes things are out of their control.    So all in all, I don't think I have the ""right"" to live in a risky way that could impact other people."
ronpaul,3bxxgj,brentwilliams2,2,Fri Jul 3 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"I agree we have those duties, I just don't think they're legal duties. Certainly not federal legal duties.   There are many cases where this could lead to a slippery slope into a loss of rights because no one has drawn a clear and concise line for why it should be applied. If you think that, ""living in a risky way that could impact other people"" is the line you're going to have a very bad time. This case in particular is dangerous because it is about what goes into a persons body.   I'm not going to picket this Law or anything, it's at the state level and there are other education options. Getting a vaccine is the right choice by any means, but I worry about the precedent set by this action.  Anyways, have you taken your mandated online respect course prior to posting that? Without certification, you are not eligible to communicate on online communities as your comments may have a risky impact on other people."
ronpaul,3bxxgj,zennaque,0,Fri Jul 3 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that they're not 100% effective because the vaccine doesn't ""take"" in some people.  If you have blood drawn and get an antibody titer done, you should be good to go.  The only other option I can think of, is to somehow mark the house of unvaccinated families and children, so those of us that care about the safety of our children can make informed decisions about whether we want to expose our families to the risks associated with hanging out with these people.  The last measles outbreak, I believe, only infected unvaccinated kids."
ronpaul,3bxxgj,plazman30,0,Fri Jul 3 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"A choice for whom, exactly?  If a grown adult wants to believe in pseudoscience and not get a vaccine themselves, then no problem.

ronpaul,3aersh,robpbb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:26:46 2015 UTC,So what happens if you can't make a payment?
ronpaul,3aersh,jstock23,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:37:10 2015 UTC,It's automatically deducted from your payroll. If you lose your job you are required to pay back the balance to your 401K account generally in 30-90 days or it counts against your income at a larger tax rate (I believe 10%).
ronpaul,3aersh,robpbb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:33:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so it may not be traditional debt, but if some random event causes you to not be able to pay, you're still screwed.

But if you think that your purchasing power will erode over time or the market will tank, you can take that money out now and use it to buy tangible assets like PMs, guns, food/water etc. Not for everyone just making a suggestion."

I get what you're saying and I hate debt as much as the next person who aligns with Austrian economics, all I'm saying is a 401K loan is an alternative option for those that have the ability to take it and IMO far outweighs a traditional loan from a bank or home equity line of credit."

ronpaul,3aersh,matts2,2,Sat Jun 20 05:29:46 2015 UTC,"His work for the past few decades is about how complex systems like a stock market are only roughly approximated by random walk models and that they do not follow the accompanying gaussian curve. While they may appear gaussian over a certain time period, they regularly make moves that should not be possible given the standard deviation for the existing data. The stock market is like a random walk that every decade runs straight to the crapper."
ronpaul,3aersh,jstock23,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"Which does not really conflict with what I said. Because while it does run to the crapper, it also seems to climb out again.

That the market may follow some other model as well is not a conflict."

ronpaul,3aaaey,thedesertlynx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"Why is this? How did a movement whose central philosophy is personal responsibility, private charity, and individual goodness come to contain so many people so far from these key virtues? For a few reasons:   This is your problem right here. Liberty is not about any of these things, it is about the Non-Aggression Principle.    The only persistent moral standard seems to be the Non-Aggression Principle, and while this serves well to weed out abject violence and theft, it still leaves a lot of wiggle room for scummy behavior.    The Non-Aggression Principle doesn't leave any wiggle room to be a good or bad person because it has absolutely nothing to do with morality. It is a system designed to facilitate human interaction without violating the individual sovereignty of the parties involved. It leaves the door wide open for gross immorality on the part of individuals.  In point of fact, some people beleive that the NAP leaves the door so wide open that it can even accommodate groups of people who redefine the word non-aggression to mean non-hostility.  And lastly, I bet if Chris Cantwell had something bad to say about you, he wouldn't waste any time beating around the bush. I bet he would just say it."
ronpaul,3aaaey,titanshub,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to the first word of those: personal, private, individual. Point being, liberty is a philosophy of dealing with society's challenges that way, not through collective coercive action.  The problem with NAP worship is it falls short. You can adhere to the NAP and still be a terrible person, just as you can get rid of public charity and if no private individuals or organizations step up, the poor will still be wanting. To go no further than the NAP would be to build the foundation for a house you never finish."
ronpaul,3aaaey,titanshub,0,Fri Jun 19 05:52:08 2015 UTC,Liberty is not a God proxy. It has nothing to do with morality. It is about respecting the natural rights of others and that is it. It is the philosophy that allows two radically different people who loathe one another to live next to one another in physical peace. It makes no provisions for getting along.

He plays a bit of politics here and there, and I agree Ron was more appealing because he just stood his ground and never would bend.  But the direction of our country seems really bad. I think Rand Paul has a real shot at the presidency and to help turn this ship around in the right direction towards liberty and the principles the country was founded upon.  Perhaps it can help spread awareness among the grassroots type community that was so energetic for his father.  Rand could really use to harness some of that grassroots energy in his campaign."

ronpaul,392asi,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Soros Pushes US Bailouts and Weapons for Ukraine-Wanna Guess WHO Gets The Bill?  By Ron Paul - June 08, 2015  If you look at the track record of the interventionists you might think they would pause before taking on more projects.   Each of their past projects has ended in disaster yet still they press on.   Last week the website Zero Hedge posted a report about hacked emails between billionaire George Soros and Ukrainian President Poroshenko.  Soros is very close to the Ukrainian president, who was put in power after a US-backed coup deposed the elected leader of Ukraine last year.   In the email correspondence, Soros tells the Ukrainian leadership that the US should provide Ukraine ""with same level of sophistication in defense weapons to match the level of opposing force.""   In other words, despite the February ceasefire, Soros is pushing behind the scenes to make sure Ukraine receives top-of-the-line lethal weapons from the United States.   Of course it will be up to us to pay the bill because Ukraine is broke.  But Soros seems to have the money part covered as well. In an email to Ukrainian leaders, he wrote that Ukraine's ""first priority must be to regain control of financial markets.""   Soros told Poroshenko that the IMF would need to come through with a $15 billion package, which was confident would lead the Fed to also come through with more money.   He wrote: ""the Federal Reserve could be asked to extend a $15 billion three months swap arrangement with the National Bank of Ukraine. That would reassure the markets and avoid a panic.""  How would the Fed be convinced to do that?   Soros assured Poroshenko: ""I am ready to call Jack Lew of the US Treasury to sound him out about the swap agreement.""  So George Soros will use his influence in the US government to put the American people on the hook for a bankrupt Ukraine -- forcing us to pay for weapons, more military training, and Ukraine's crippling debt.  Who is thrilled with Soros' drawing the US government into more intervention in the region?   The military-industrial complex for one is happy at the prospect of big weapons ""sales"" to Ukraine.   The bankers are thrilled.   Washington power-brokers are thrilled.   There is something in this for everyone who is politically well-connected.   The only losers are the people who will be forced to pay for it, the American taxpayers.  No one seems to ask why we are involved in Ukraine at all.   Is it really any of our business if the east wants to break away from the west?   Is it a vital US interest which flag the people wish to hang in Donetsk?  One thing we should be sure of is that Ukraine's debt will not be paid.   As in other bailouts, much of it will be transferred to the US taxpayer through the IMF and the Federal Reserve.   All of this is only possible because of the perception that the dollar is still the world's reserve currency.   But this too is coming to an end. US military and financial interventionism worldwide are only speeding up the process.

From preposterous to unbelievable to believable to expected. This is how my opinion of the Obama administration and the whole charade of government has progressed since 2008.  Thank you Ron Paul, antiwar.com, and everyone working to shed light on these issues."

Half of the delegates had pledged to vote for Ron Paul, but they all (except for one or two perhaps) voted for Romney once they got to the National convention. The other delegates and party leadership went to each of them and said, they had to vote for an ""electable"" candidate, and persuaded them."
ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,2,Mon May 18 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting this? It's simply not true.  I was there. The Paul delegates abstained almost unanimously. Ryan Call could have voted them for Romney if they had voted for Paul, but by abstaining they took those votes away."
ronpaul,36a26a,chasonreddit,0,Mon May 18 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"I was there too, and I spoke to the ""supposed"" Ron Paul delegates after the convention."
ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,0,Mon May 18 06:34:18 2015 UTC,"I will say, I know a few true blue Paul supporters who either abstained or voted for Paul anyway, but most of who I talked to, who had promised me they were pledged to Paul, ended up voting for Romney."
ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,1 point,Mon May 18 06:43:13 2015 UTC,The only reason I voted for them was because they pledged to vote for Paul all the way to National.
ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,1 point,Mon May 18 06:43:42 2015 UTC,"One of my close friends at the time was actually a Romney delegate elected at that convention, and we were sort of ribbing each other because he was SO over-confident, and proud that the whole delegation would be a Romney delegation, and as the delegates were announced, his demeanor changed, because we were actually going to send a 1/2 Paul and 1/2 Romney delegation, and he seemed very awe struck at what was happening. So, going out of State, the Paul people were thrilled, we went and celebrated, but then National happened, and they all voted for Romney (Or at least most of them). So we felt soft of hood-winked."
ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,1 point,Mon May 18 06:47:19 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, in the 2008 convention when McCain got nominated, the party gave all the small factions 5 minutes of speaking time, but when it came time for the Paul people to get their 5 minutes of speaking time, they voted us down! We were much smaller then, perhaps 10% of the crowd, but still larger than many of the factions that got speaking time. In other words, the GOP wouldn't even let us speak for 5 minutes! Like everyone else. We actually protested that convention, and almost got into a fight at the end of the ceremonies. Many people came up and said they were with us, but for some reason they didn't have the courage to actually vote to give us the same courtesy speaking time as they did the Log Cabin Republicans and the Hispanic Republicans, both of which were probably only about 1% of the crowd. So they dis-respected 10% of their crowd, and this is why I hate the Republican party to this day."

ronpaul,36a26a,redditvm,0,Wed Jun 3 20:07:06 2015 UTC,0;  the delegates who go to the national convention are required to vote for the person who won the nomination.  they are selected at the state convention to be national delegates because they fall in line with the party and will behave at the national convention.
ronpaul,36a26a,Hey_Jackie,6,Sun May 17 17:48:53 2015 UTC,It actually depends on the state.  The vast majority were indeed required to vote for the winner of the state party primary/caucus on the first round.  This was not true for a handful of states.
ronpaul,36a26a,Boehemyth,1 point,Sun May 17 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"In our state at least, delegates refused to vote on the first ballot.  By state rules, if the candidate's name was not on the nomination ballot (as Dr. Paul was taken off by state challenges) the state chairman could change a vote for that delegate.  So several delegates abstained, not allowing the chair to cast that vote.  We have a new state chairman now."

ronpaul,36a26a,Hey_Jackie,2,Mon May 18 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where this misinformation is coming from, but to my knowledge no one was ""persuaded""  to vote for Romney.  But rules can allow votes to be cast different than the delegates choice.   First of all, Dr. Paul got 190 votes in the first round. Second, each state has different rules for how delegations can vote. In many, including my state, a delegate can not vote for a candidate not on the nominee ballot.  Dr. Paul was removed from that ballot by removing the states he carried to a number less than 5.  The RNC tried to raise that limit to 10, failed, but removed Maine and a couple others to get Dr. Paul below the 5 state minimum.   Given that he was not on that ballot, delegates in my state abstained rather than give the vote to whomever the state chair would pick."
ronpaul,36a26a,chasonreddit,1 point,Mon May 18 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"I know of the Ron Paul delegates who were asking for votes to go to National, I spoke with them, and I asked who they would support at convention, and they all said, ""Paul"". Then afterward, after Romney got the nomination, I asked them how they voted, and they all said, ""Romney"". The main reasoning was, that the other delegates and leadership came to them and said, ""Paul was un-electable, and they must vote for Romney otherwise the democrats would win."" Which they ended up winning anyway. Shows you how ""electable"" Romney was. I wish they would have just stuck to their guns. Colorado sent half of our delegation full of Paul supporters (at least pledged privately), and they caved, and then lost."
ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,1 point,Mon May 18 06:40:20 2015 UTC,"Well half the elected delegation would be 12.  We had 11 abstentions.   As I explained, the rules forbade voting for Paul, so they abstained.  Perhaps the delegates you spoke with misinterpreted your question and and told you  the delegation's vote (17 Romney, 11 abtained). So they voted for Romney.  Or maybe they weren't real Paul supporters.  But you can't ignore those abstentions."

ronpaul,36a26a,ParkingLotRanger,1 point,Mon May 18 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"I was keeping a close eye on the state nominations throughout the 2012 primary - chasonreddit has it right. The RNC leadership negated Dr. Paul's successes in as several states (Louisiana, Maine, Massachussetts, Nevada...I forget all of the specific states now, but it was all in the news at the time) to ensure that he would NOT have a plurality in 5 states, which was the number required to get his name on the ballot. The leadership reallocated delegates to Romney, even though Ron had won them according to the state convention rules. Romney's grassroots support was laughable compared to Ron Paul's. At the Louisiana state convention, when it became apparent that Paul delegates were set to overwhelm Romney delegates (a majority elected a Paul supporter as chairman to run the meeting), hired goons forcibly removed the new chairman from the hall for 15-20 minutes. When they newly-elected chairman was returned to the meeting hall, several of his fingers had been broken. Louisiana approved the delegates for Paul, although they were later stripped and reassigned to Romney. It had to have been illegal/unethical. It was in the news. I was outraged.  I live in Massachussetts (winner-take-all), and Ron Paul officially won the 25 delegates for my state at the state convention.  Soon thereafter Reince Priebus, the then-chairman of the Mass GOP, overrode the vote and gave them to Romney.  Surprise! He is now the chairman for the RNC.  Corruption. What else can explain how this could happen? Watching the sick drama unfold, I felt deeply dissappointed with the state of our nation."
ronpaul,36a26a,bart___,2,Tue Jun 2 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  And remember the Maine.   Party leadership challenges, delayed caucuses, and finally delegates getting replaced at the convention.  Probably the classiest thing that happened in Tampa was when the Texas delegation alternates gave their passes to Maine delegates who had been ""disqualified"".     I use the term ""Reince Priebus"" as a swear word.  Slightly below the ""c"" word.   But you can have Ryan Call in an even swap."

All Russel needs to do is go to Cambodia, and look at what the Khmer Rogue did to the people in the name of Agrarian Socialism.   Stealing from the rich class quickly turns into exterminating the educated class. Shit, all Brand needs to do is study The French Revolution to see how his ideas can go horribly wrong.

From The Discovery of Freedom by Rose Wilder Lane   FOR a dozen years the rebellious Americans had been stripping their Government to its naked reality: force. Then the Declaration of Independence abolished all Government in the colonies.  The Royal Governors had governed by the authority of charters. A charter was a written statement of the Authority that British Government granted to the Governor of a colony, and the liberties it granted to his subjects.  Because these charters were grants of freedoms, the Americans at first had struggled to keep them. British Government of course had a right to withdraw its grants, and sometimes it did so. The people of Connecticut, when their charter was revoked, stole the charter and hid it in a tree—to keep their liberties!  Now they saw how absurd it is to believe that a Government can give anyone liberty. The Declaration of Independence was also a statement that men are naturally free."

ronpaul,34ymog,Hoenhoff,2,Tue May 5 21:46:35 2015 UTC,Same. Honestly I'm just happy to vote for someone who's record and rhetoric match. Why all of those people are instantly branded as fringe or un-electable I think should be pretty clear by now after that transparent media smear campaign against Paul in Iowa.  Let's hope the democrats don't have a primary circus this year so it will be harder to miss when it comes for Bernie (I'm looking at you Vermont and Maine).

Then later on say he :   floated several conspiracy theories, including ... the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was connected to Russia   Then in the link they give for that, it directly concludes with:   The real point is, it's very difficult to get accurate information so everybody engages in propaganda. At this point it would be unwise to say the Russians did it, the Ukrainian government did it, or the rebels did it. Is it so hard to simply demand a real investigation?"

ronpaul,332g1y,guntario,3,Mon Apr 20 10:20:50 2015 UTC,"Which is the truth, that he is not a libertarian (as he says) or that he and his father agree?  Which is the truth, that he is against legalization of marijuana (as he says) or he is for legalization of heroin (as his father says).  Does he support a harder line against Iran that Obama or is he for letting other countries do what they want?  Which Rand is the true Rand?"
ronpaul,332g1y,matts2,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:59:34 2015 UTC,I've never been confused. Are you actually reading the articles instead of the headlines? Perhaps you might want to link a couple of these articles that have you so confused so we can nail down where this confusion lies.
ronpaul,332g1y,guntario,2,Mon Apr 20 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did read the articles. Did you?  On foreign bases:   ""There are some who want to come completely home. Some want to stay forever. And the answer might be somewhere in the maiddle that we'll still have bases in places, but we don't necessarily have to maybe have 900 bases. Maybe we have less,"" he said.   On legalization of drugs:   Paul said he believes in freedom and wants a “virtuous society” where people practice “self-restraint.” Yet he believes in laws and limits as well. Instead of advocating for legalized drugs, for example, he pushes for reduced penalties for many drug offenses.  “I’m not advocating everyone go out and run around with no clothes on and smoke pot,” [Rand] said. “I’m not a libertarian. I’m a libertarian Republican. I’m a constitutional conservative.”  “He made it very clear that he does not support legalization of drugs like marijuana and that he supports traditional marriage,” [said Brad Sherman of the Solid Rock Christian Church in Coralville, Iowa].   OK, so now that I have quoted the relevant passages do you still say that Rand agrees with his father?"
ronpaul,332g1y,matts2,0,Mon Apr 20 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, these are very easy to explain. He believes that progress is good. He understands how politics work. You can't stand up there and propose changes that will be taken by the media and portrayed as undo-able and end up being labeled as a loon. The media is already calling him sexist and an isolationist. He understands that in order to not be completely shunned by the establishment, you can't offend them. He has to work with them. Otherwise, nothing will ever be accomplished.  Do I wish that Ron Paul's ideas could be immediately implemented? Of course! But do I think it's possible? Absolutely not."
ronpaul,332g1y,guntario,2,Tue Apr 21 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"So he is lying about what he thinks. OK. You just hope he is lying to them, not you."
ronpaul,332g1y,matts2,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"No. He's just not coming at it as hard-lined as you would like. You see, Ron didn't want to legalize drugs either. He believed it wasn't the purview of the federal government to even weigh in on this topic. So, I think again, that Rand has done something amazing here. There is not going to be any solution made about drug legalization any time soon, as this argument has been going on for decades. I think it's brilliant for him to sit back and let the states make the change."
ronpaul,332g1y,guntario,2,Tue Apr 21 05:11:39 2015 UTC,"You see, Ron didn't want to legalize drugs either.    Ron said he would legalize heroin.   He believed it wasn't the purview of the federal government to even weigh in on this topic.   So as I keep saying: not libertarian, just states' rights advocates. It is not liberty for people that he cared about but power for states.   There is not going to be any solution made about drug legalization any time soon,    Actually I think you (and he) are absolutely wrong. He could have taken a big brave step and did nothing. I suspect that by 2018 there will be full on legalization efforts in the Senate getting significant support."

ronpaul,332g1y,guntario,-1,Tue Apr 21 03:45:16 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. Rand Paul is almost a neo-conservative, his foreign policy is basically everything Ron was campaigning against. Rand's no genius, he is an angsty entitled brat."

But I do find the slivers of differences that people argue over to be kind of silly. Ron Paul wanted to end all foreign aid immediately; Rand Paul says end it to countries that hate us immediately, and end the rest gradually. Ron Paul wanted to close all overseas bases, Rand Paul says to close most overseas bases. Ron Paul said to legalize drugs, Rand Paul says to end the war on drugs. Etc.  Sure, there are some differences, but when compared to all other candidates, their views are so close to each others' that they might as well be the same."

And I'm not sure about Dr. Paul, but I'm concerned with Rand's stance, specifically regarding his view on homosexuals.   It's kind of been a closely guarded secret, but some private footage of an interview he did after a speaking engagement surfaced and it didn't make him look very good. He had said that he doesn't agree with it on a fundamental level, so it wasn't something he could support.   You know, the same old, 'he/she had the right to chose to be gay', yadda yadda yadda bullshit. Just seems a Lil late in the game to still think in these terms.  Basically, you can think whatever you want but what you can't do is disagree with constitutional discrimination protections for an entire demographic just because you don't approve of their lifestyle.   That's not how this works... that's not how any of this works."

ronpaul,332g1y,matts2,0,Mon Apr 20 06:49:18 2015 UTC,"I say this in the kindest way that I can... You're an ideologue and need to wake up. I say that Rand is brilliant because he's trying to make progress and not be considered a loon. I love Ron Paul, but there was no way he'd ever have been taken serious because he didn't want to work with the party to advance our beliefs. Ron was about the spread of ideas and didn't even have any illusions of getting the nomination. There is a real possibility that Rand can pull this off. He just can't be bull headed. He needs to work with the party, and I think he's doing it wonderfully."

ronpaul,332g1y,matts2,0,Tue Apr 21 04:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. Your complaint about Rand is that he's not going at it hard-line enough, as his father did. I do believe that Rand is like his father, but has a better understanding of how politics work. I wish people weren't so easily influenced by the media and would weigh out ideas instead of letting their emotions lead their decisions, but the reality is that people react first, and then think later. I'm grateful that Rand understands this."

ronpaul,32cynj,paulalt88,3,Sun Apr 12 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"No. Rand is a politician willing to sell his principles for a shot at the presidency.  The absence of that feature in Ron Paul is what inspired many of us here to support him in his bid(s) for the White House.  If you are looking for Rand Paul supporters, try r/RandPaul.    There may be some overlap supporters, but you also need to be aware of the population here that see the son as nothing like his father."
ronpaul,32cynj,SurlyMcBitters,9,Sun Apr 12 23:53:07 2015 UTC,I believe Rand is playing the political game. I'm voting for him on the very possible chance that he's lying about his more mainstream beliefs.
ronpaul,32cynj,KonDon,7,Mon Apr 13 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"I understand that that's your point of view and that's fair. I don't think Rand Paul has sold out on his principles- maybe his messaging and rhetoric isn't as idealistic as Ron Paul's but I think his record is still pretty solid. Who else led a senate filibuster over unconstitutional drone strikes, for example?  And it's not everyday that you get a viable candidate that is really for limited government in economics, personal affairs, and in foreign policy. None of the other Republicans are quite like that, and they certainly aren't nearly as passionate as Rand is about domestic spying and criminal justice reform. Realistically your choices are to either vote Rand, vote for someone else (anyone who might be more Ron Paul-like will be a 3rd party fringe), or not vote at all. I understand that you may choose one of the other two options and that's fine, but I hope you guys at least consider Rand as a possibility. For me, I'm happy that Ron Paul warmed me up to libertarian ideas and now I feel I can vote for someone who embodies those ideas but is also a pragmatist with a shot at the presidency."
ronpaul,32cynj,fuweike,3,Mon Apr 13 07:01:39 2015 UTC,"Could a politician exist who has libertarian ideas, but who also has a chance of actually winning?  If not Rand Paul, then who?  Libertarians only have power to change the system if we actually lend our votes to one side or the other sometimes.  Otherwise our ideas will always be marginalized and never implemented.  Rand Paul would end bulk surveillance and make tons of other positive strides.  Isn't that worth supporting?"
ronpaul,32cynj,richertai,3,Mon Apr 13 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Too many people responding to articles about him with ""Yeah, but he's just doing that to get elected.

I remember one time I posted that I was worried about my sis who was being abused by her bf at the time. I had hundreds of people messaging me offering to sneak her out of NYC. Other people were offering support and suggestions. Even though I had never met anyone, I knew that the Ron Paul/libertarian community was full of truly good people.

Or that r/RonPaul should be eliminated as he is not generating enough news without filling this sub with libertarian-leaning submissions that clearly belong elsewhere?   What's the focus of this sub? I argue this sub should focus on Ron and not Rand as clearly their political views are diverging as Rand pursues the Republican nomination. The son is not the father. The son has his own sub for those interested.   Or rename this sub more accurately as r/RonPaulRandPaullibertarianstuff.

There is no focus because if the focus was Ron Paul we would have one piece of news every week (if that) and it wouldn't even be relative to anything because Ron is just a retired man living the senior dream now and focusing on family. Relax and if you don't like the other libertarian/Rand stuff that gets posted on here (many of the news actually relates to Ron and his principles even if it's not directly about him) then never come back. Its actually pretty simple.   You are arguing for something that would essentially kill the sub because you are too lazy to look through a few posts of the front page and pinpoint the ones that are about Ron.
ronpaul,3224bl,lambro101,-5,Fri Apr 10 15:22:00 2015 UTC,Please go to r/RonPaul right now and come back and tell us how many posts in the first 25 are Rand Paul-centric.  Well? We're waiting.  Edit: And why should I have to look through a sub dedicated to Ron Paul to find the submissions that are actually about Ron Paul?
ronpaul,3224bl,derangedlunatech,3,Fri Apr 10 15:43:09 2015 UTC,You didn't even address (or maybe understand) my point which is either way this sub is essentially fucked because of how irrelevant Ron Paul is directly towards politics right now. So fight your little heart out all you want to get rand posts out of here but enjoy your monthly updates on Ron because you ain't gonna find much. That's why I find it funny you seem to care so much.  Edit : and you basically proved my own point by saying you ain't gonna find much on Ron on the front page... Its because there is BARELY ANYTHING NEW TO TALK ABOUT with him anymore so please help me understand why you even care if his son is allowed to be a topic here besides your own personal vendetta against his beliefs I assume?
ronpaul,3224bl,alcapone444,-1,Fri Apr 10 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"""Or that r/RonPaul should be eliminated as he is not generating enough news without filling this sub with libertarian-leaning submissions that clearly belong elsewhere?"" My statement from above which addresses your point.  Then perhaps this sub has run its course or as you so eloquently stated ""this sub is essentially fucked because of how irrelevant Ron Paul is directly towards politics right now.""  Listen, I am a Ron Paul supporter.  I gave money for his campaign in 2008 and 2012.  I have #278/500 ""I Support Ron Paul"" lithograph signed by the Michael Nystrom framed in my living room.  I am a registered as a Republican so I can vote in the Republican primaries.  So it is not like I'm some random Reddiot tilting at windmills.  I subscribe to r/RonPaul because I want to find news about Ron Paul.  I don't feel that I need to filter out the 80%+ of the front page of r/RonPaul that is not Ron Paul.  If this is a dead sub, so be it.  It is not helping this sub to fill it with submissions that belong elsewhere."

ronpaul,3224bl,Unwanted_Commentary,4,Fri Apr 10 22:15:09 2015 UTC,Rand is Ron's son. Rand champions his father's core ideas and policies. Both share a significant follower base.  It's nowhere in the rules that posts talking about Rand Paul are not allowed here.  I don't see your argument here.
ronpaul,3224bl,TelFiRE,6,Fri Apr 10 00:31:02 2015 UTC,A champion of his father's ideals? Really?  http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ron-paul-leave-rand-paul-camp-116439.html  It would seem that I am not the only one that sees differences between the two.

ronpaul,3203nn,Orangutan,9,Thu Apr 9 14:40:30 2015 UTC,His proposal for an increase in military spending was him making a political point and trolling Cruz & Rubio:  http://rare.us/story/rand-paul-just-trolled-the-hell-out-of-cruz-and-rubio-on-the-defense-budget/
ronpaul,3203nn,Cputerace,-2,Thu Apr 9 18:13:44 2015 UTC,And a damn stupid way to do it. When you need to explain why black is white in politics you have already lost the battle.
ronpaul,3203nn,matts2,6,Thu Apr 9 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. In the primaries folks like Cruz will tout their fiscial conservatism. Rand Paul will be able to say ""You wanted a 200 billion dollar addition to the DOD but you didn't want to pay for it.""  It's actually a pretty savvy move."
ronpaul,3203nn,Yumm_Yumm_the_Man,-1,Fri Apr 10 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"Rand has not found a set of positions that appeals to a large group. Rather he has tried to find ways to say things that sound different to different groups. So he says to one group ""I want to raise defense spending"". Then to another group he says ""don't believe I want to raise defense spending, it is a trick"". This worked for Bush in the pre-Internet days. He could give one message to evangelicals and another to the mainstream. At the time there was little cross-communication. Today a speech for one is reported for all. So you just have to hope that Rand is lying to them and not you."
ronpaul,3203nn,matts2,9,Fri Apr 10 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"The video started out presenting straight examples of flip-flopping (though most of them have pretty valid explanations, at least one of which I posted here), but quickly disintegrates into the narrator venting his personal beefs with how Rand treated him and a co-worker when they attempted to ambush-interview him."
ronpaul,3203nn,Cputerace,7,Thu Apr 9 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this seems to have become a personal resentment for him lol"
ronpaul,3203nn,Assasta,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:21:50 2015 UTC,Are ambush/gotcha questions wrong for all politicians? I could swear I've seen support for Breitbart's approach here.
ronpaul,3203nn,matts2,4,Thu Apr 9 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"No, they are not wrong, but when you get shot down for doing it, and post a video bitching about it, your video carries no use."
ronpaul,3203nn,Cputerace,-3,Thu Apr 9 19:53:37 2015 UTC,So basically the problem is that no one should try to ambush interview Rand because he is pure.
ronpaul,3203nn,matts2,7,Thu Apr 9 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"Again, they can try an ambush interview, but don't be ""outraged"" when one dick move is responded to with another."
ronpaul,3203nn,Cputerace,5,Thu Apr 9 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"We should expect opponents of rand to use all of the related forums and media that has come up for communication among his and his fathers supporters to put out attacks on him to try to undermine the morale of his supporters.  That is the least we should expect.  The ""Establishment"" he says he's fighting have a lot of power. Power they would like to keep.  This isn't tidlley winks we're playing people end up dead and it looks like suicide if they see gain in it."
ronpaul,3203nn,rufrignkidnme,7,Thu Apr 9 22:15:18 2015 UTC,"If you changed your mind based on this, you weren't very informed to begin with. Luke has a personal vendetta against Rand and most of this stuff is the same tired crap people keep trotting out, which has all been addressed specifically by Rand. His intentions have been quite pure all along."
ronpaul,31uozy,AbrahamSTINKIN,12,Wed Apr 8 08:15:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm also opposed to supporting the ""lesser of two evils"", but I don't think it applies to Rand. Voting for Romney or Obama would have been choosing the lesser of two evils. Both are completely opposed to my viewpoints and offer no progress in the right direction.  Voting for Rand is a possible chance for progress. You can't go from Obama to Justin Amash overnight. The purists who won't vote for Rand are choosing no progress and the status quo for the foreseeable future. But at least they can whine about it and take the intellectual/moral high ground."
ronpaul,31uozy,Rickster885,2,Wed Apr 8 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"To me the idea of voting for the ""lesser of two evils"" is when both candidates want to take the country in what all-in-all is the wrong direction, and people are trying to convince me to vote for the one who'll do it slower, or destroy the country less. Such candidates will never get my vote.  But Rand Paul is a candidate who will take the country in the right direction, ending warrantless wiretapping, the war on people who use drugs, over-militarization of the police, out-of-control military spending, etc. He may not be perfect, and he may not go far enough, and I may even disagree with him on some things, but he's not even close to the ""lesser of two evils"" category."
ronpaul,31uozy,zugi,26,Thu Apr 9 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"Libertarians should vote for Rand Paul because he is useful, and serves a purpose. If you want to pave the road for libertarians like Justin Amash, etc. then Rand Paul is the way to do it. Much of this country is brainwashed by the partisan rhetoric of the mainstream establishment, and don't care what ideals the politician has, they vote for the (R) or (D).  Rand Paul is your libertarian Trojan Horse. Get him elected, start deprogramming the masses, and then elect Gary Johnson or Justin Amash in 4-8 years."
ronpaul,31uozy,hexydes,9,Wed Apr 8 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"You need to realize this: Most mainstream public don't even know what a ""libertarian"" is and because the media is painting Rand as ""THE LIBERTARIAN"", their entire idea of libertarianism will be based on Rand. And man let me tell you how dangerous that is.  At this stage, I'm having a hard time figuring out if Rand is a conservative or a libertarian. Cut education, social security and health care, but INCREASE MILITARY SPENDING WITH THAT MONEY?  Now he's gone back on his anti-war policies and would vote to intervene in Syria against ISIS in a heartbeat  Is this what you support? This guy is a complete conservative with very FEW (if any) real libertarian principles in mind.   He's a fiscally conservative republican first, a libertarian second. Ron had principles, Rand has none that he would truly stick to if it meant he'd get more money and votes.  If this is the idea of ""libertarianism"" that you want the mainstream public to have, you can kiss Justin Amash and Gary Johnson's chances of ever winning presidency goodbye. Rand Paul will destroy the libertarian movement because his only agenda is to rename Conservatism to Libertarianism. And true Libertarians will pay the price if Rand gets what he wants."
ronpaul,31uozy,TAEHSAEN,10,Wed Apr 8 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"He's not going to save the libertarian movement by talking about how he's a ""libertarian."" He doesn't even call himself libertarian. Let's say he gets elected and does what he says. If that happens, we'll see criminal justice reform, marijuana decriminalization, reduced domestic spying, departments such as Education completely scrapped. We'll see a real shift toward small government.   And that's what he'll do for the libertarian movement. When Americans see small government not just working, but making our country noticeably better, then maybe they'll be more comfortable shrinking it even more. He's not going to destroy libertarianism by renaming conservatism. He calls himself a conservative. But if his agenda becomes the baseline for conservatism, then libertarianism starts to look much more reasonable to the average voter."
ronpaul,31uozy,MirkwoodRanger,6,Wed Apr 8 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"The problem with libertarians and Ron Paul supporters who refuse to support Rand is that they think, with one election, they can change the entire system. That's not gonna happen. Let me tell you, Rand is the best shot you have and you are wasting it. If you want more libertarian ideas in DC, then you need to start voting for people who make be even 20% , 30% or 60% libertarian. The point is, at what point is a person not libertarian enough to not support him or her? Rand definitely has many libertarian principles and deserves your vote and support."
ronpaul,31uozy,Nostraadms,-3,Wed Apr 8 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"Scrapping education whist a huge portion of the population is poor is a mindnumbingly bad idea and any reasonable Anarco Capitalist would even agree with that. Keep widening the rich-poor gap until the bubble pops right?  As it stands, ALL of Rand's policies seems to benefit the rich. He could cut military and secret service and Israel funding to help offset the tax cuts, yet he goes after Social Security, Healthcare and Education?  Does that sound reasonable to you? Is that something you would support?"
ronpaul,31uozy,TAEHSAEN,9,Wed Apr 8 17:35:42 2015 UTC,"Scrapping education whist a huge portion of the population is poor is a mindnumbingly bad idea and any reasonable Anarco Capitalist would even agree with that.   See, you don't actually understand Rand's policies. He's not interested in scrapping education. He's scrapping the federal Department of Education. Schools are paid for, primarily, by state and local taxes. He also supports giving students school choice, which would allow for students in poorer areas with failing schools to attend better schools that are actually serving their students.   He wants to fix education for everyone. The rich don't need their education fixed, the poor do. Fixing education helps the poor."
ronpaul,31uozy,MirkwoodRanger,-4,Wed Apr 8 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"What happens when they can't afford good education? We need to IMPROVE public education for now, not remove it.  What is a pauper supposed to do with his choice between a Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce when he can't afford either?"

He's scrapping the federal Department of Education. Schools are paid for, primarily, by state and local taxes.  If Rand Paul destroyed the Department of Education tomorrow, public education would still exist. It does need to be improved. Rand Paul believes that this would be a step in that direction, by giving state and local governments more control."
ronpaul,31uozy,MirkwoodRanger,3,Wed Apr 8 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"ah thanks for the clarification. I take that back then.  As long as he doesn't defund (or contribute towards) defunding public education, I won't count this against him.  But he still has too many other flaws for me to look past."
ronpaul,31uozy,TAEHSAEN,2,Wed Apr 8 19:32:06 2015 UTC,Considering that you were unaware of his real stance about the Dept of Education - maybe look at his other policies that you might not be fully understanding?  I'm willing to bet there is more that once clarified you would agree with.
ronpaul,31uozy,swd120,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"Canada has no equivalent to the Department of Education.

He could cut military and secret service and Israel funding to help offset the tax cuts, yet he goes after Social Security, Healthcare and Education?   This was positioning. The other candidates all supported a plan for increased defense spending and aid, but didn't cut spending elsewhere to pay for their proposals. Rand's amendment allows him to position himself as being the only fiscal conservative in the bunch.   It's all about the sacred cows: Rand is just saying, if you want these sacred cows, then we must protect the most sacred cow of them all. He'll be able to beat this over his opponents' heads throughout the primaries. And the follow-up question is: ""why cut social security?"".   To which he answers, ""I don't want to cut social security. But if you're going to spend money we don't have, you've got to cut somewhere else, and this is something my opponents have ignored or forgotten."""

ronpaul,31uozy,TAEHSAEN,2,Thu Apr 9 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"It's the Republican candidacy they're going for, not the Libertarian one.   If Rand Paul had voted against the increase in the defense budget, it's pretty much game over for him. I don't know if he was specifically being targeted, but he might as well have been. The whole point is, the other candidates will desperately be trying to out Rand Paul as a libertarian.   Rather than walking into this trap, Rand Paul turns it back on them. He provides his own amendment. It accepts everything they've asked for, but actually pays for it with real cuts.   The cuts themselves are hypothetical. It really doesn't matter at this point, because the whole point is to paint the other candidates as a bunch of garden variety borrow and spend dilettantes. He's hoisted them on their own petard, so to speak."
ronpaul,31uozy,exoriare,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:44:16 2015 UTC,"He could cut military and secret service and Israel funding to help offset the tax cuts, yet he goes after Social Security, Healthcare and Education?   Rand Paul wants to cut the military by closing hundreds of bases and previously talked about making big military cuts, though he hasn't been advertising that lately.  Rand Paul visited Israel and while there called for cutting funding to Israel.  Rand Paul calls for cutting ""Healthcare"" as you put it because that's heading towards a government takeover of 20% of the economy - any libertarian has to oppose that.  The Department of Education has grown to a $100 billion/year waste. It subsidizes education loans that just drive up the cost of college tuition astronomically, and passes standards that meddle with elementary education in a way that has them constantly testing instead of learning.  And saying he's ""going after Social Security"" is disingenuous since most people think that means retirement programs. He's said he thinks too many people take unfair advantage of Social Security's disability insurance, which is supported though he did exaggerate the numbers of fraudulent claims."

Paul is making big issues of warrantless surveillance, ending the war on people who use drugs, ending over-militarization of the police, ending civil forfeiture - most of these are issues than even Congress' most liberal members won't touch. That's far from a ""fiscal conservative first.""  He's certainly a clever politician, and this turns people off. For example, he got mainstream conservatives riled up against extra-judicial drone killings of Americans overseas by castigating and blaming Obama for it. Sure, Bush or McCain or Romney would have done it too, but by casting it as being anti-Obama, suddenly he got a bunch of conservatives cheering about the need for warrants and due process! I think this strategy has the potential to move a sizable share of conservatives over to more libertarian positions. He won't get the war-hawks, and he won't get the southern hard-core religious conservatives, but he doesn't need them; he just needs to placate them enough that they don't start an ""anyone but Paul"" movement."

Rand is not his father, and he's not a libertarian, that's for sure, but honestly do you want Rubio, Cruz or one of those other shady asshats winning the primaries?! I sure as hell don't!"

Even after 13 years of stupefyingly misguided war against Iraq, Rand is pro-war. And instead of avoiding the corrupt money that fuels corrupt elections, he's cozying up to it.  I'm not saying that I won't vote for him if there's nobody better come election time. But we should be looking - and looking hard - for somebody with principles."

Also, i agree with many of the things that you have said except that we shouldn't support him.

Abby on WRC  Abby on LipTV  And this is Rand running away when being confronted on why he tried to get Abby fired - Looks like a guilty politician to me.

However, I would love to see another party gain more prominence in the political arena, and start bringing in some alternative viewpoints to the status quo of the current 2 sides, and I believe that the LP is the closest to aligning with my values, as well as the best chance at being that party for real change.  With that said, however - while I will never find a candidate that I agree with 100% or disagree with 100%, I find myself disagreeing more and more with the TP-hijacked GOP.  And in my view, Rand is almost pure, unadulterated TP/GOP in my eyes.  Yeah, like my grandfather used to say, even the blind bird gets a worm every now and then.  I agree with Rand on a few things - his hatred for TSA, his displeasure with domestic spying, and his (alleged) desire to get money out of politics.  But outside of that, he's everything that libertarians should be rejecting - just another authoritarian statist with little interest in the freedoms of the people, and more interest in government control.

I've listened to quite a few of his speeches on the floor of the Senate from 2010-2013, those are a lot better than media sound-bites that you get these days. He actually sounds a lot like his father but even more articulate:   Single-handedly holding up the defense authorization bill to ensure that the Constitution's right to a fair and speedy trial apply to citizens detained by the military Cosponsoring hemp legalization legislation with Oregon Democrats Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden Speaking passionately from the Senate floor about ending the Patriot Act Speaking passionately from the Senate floor about the shame of NDAA's indefinite detention Constitutionally and historically arguing to the Senate that Congress needs to take back the power to declare and wage war to limit the war-waging power of the executive Introducing legislation to abolish the TSA and establish a Passenger Bill of Rights Wanting to require warrants for domestic drone surveillance Arguing in Israel that we should end all foreign aid including aid to Israel   More recently he's turned to trying to attract minorities not by pandering to them by offering them handouts (as most others do) but by finding areas of common interest and emphasizing those: ending police overreach, economic empowerment, reining in the war on people who use drugs, etc.  Yes, he's disappointed me on a few things as well, but all in all I can't find anyone else even remotely better to vote for than Rand Paul."

He could be doing it beause Ron did basically the same thing - but he could also be going along with his GOP buddies and their typical ""anything to make Obama look bad"" strategy) He has voted against almost every bill that would have been helpful to veterans, as has the rest of the GOP.  And while I know there may be some valid idealogically justified reasons behind some, there were some that were good and proper, and were self-funded, that still got shot down.  Others, such as expanding tricare coverage to autistic dependants is just mind-boggling as to why that would be opposed. He has voted against nearly everything that would have strengthened the rights and protections of individuals that is more targeted than just the broad ""end TSA and domestic spying"" type stuff that he bases his campaign on.  Of course, these are but a few specific votes or specific areas where I disagree in terms of his votes.  His full voting record can be found in a few different places; I personally like using ""Project Vote Smart"" to track the votes of congresscritters: https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/117285/rand-paul/?p=1#.VSkpAkY6z4Y  I find tracking votes can be very  enlightening  - it's shocking (at first, after a while you get used to it lol) how they all seem to say one thing but vote another."

As much as I hate it, I may be willing to tolerate it in this case. For all the dumb things Rand has said, his voting record doesn't do much to back them up."
ronpaul,31uozy,Rickster885,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's a secret agent, I think he knows what has to be done to get elected and where those limits are."
ronpaul,31uozy,smartfbrankings,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:07:59 2015 UTC,"No, supporters of Rand aren't going on some ""secret agent"" theory. We are judging him the same way we judge other politicians: by his record and not his rhetoric.  What he says is mostly irrelevant (though I must say, I agree with the vast majority of it anyway), but his record is really, really strong. So he gets my vote and support.  On the other hand, there is a theme with the Rand-haters. They seem to value rhetoric over action. Would you rather see WWIII than vote for a liar? Would you put words over lives? If so I don't think you ever understood a word Ron Paul spoke."
ronpaul,31uozy,TelFiRE,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:36:23 2015 UTC,There are many things I like about Rand Paul and he is certainly better than most politicians when it comes to his words and especially his voting record.    But he voted FOR sanctions in Iran.  Sanctions that harmed the Iranian people.  Sanctions that made food and medicine unaffordable for Iranians.  If you think that it's ok to do that to people of a nation that we all know is of no threat to the US then I don't think YOU ever understood a word Ron Paul spoke.
ronpaul,31uozy,yourslice,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with sanctions. I believe in a completely non-interventionist foreign policy. However, I don't look at these things in a vacuum. Rand Paul took a stand to actively block sanction in Iran. I respected him for it. But when it became clear that the momentum was impossible to overturn, he negotiated for less sanctions than what would've otherwise passed. That's exactly the kind of leader we need. Not someone who, if they can't get their way, gives up and accepts backward progress when forward progress is an option.  The bottom line is that if Rand weren't in the Senate, the sanctions would still exist, they would be worse, and they would've passed sooner. The crux of Rand's involvement in these sanctions was to delay and reduce them, and it is hard to see how he could have possibly had more impact by simply voting against them."
ronpaul,31uozy,TelFiRE,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"Rand Paul took a stand to actively block sanction in Iran.    Not calling you a liar but do you have a source for this?  I am trying to look into this matter and what I have found so far is that he demanded a line added to the sanctions that this was not a declaration of war and that no troops would be sent into Iran.  To be sure that is a good thing, but it is hardly him taking a stand to ""block"" sanctions.  In the end he voted for sanctions, and if you think that his voting record is how he should be judged then it is only fair to judge him as somebody who supports sanctioning a nation that has done no harm to us.    Please show me how he weakened the sanctions, if that is in fact a true statement.  Many thanks in advance."
ronpaul,31uozy,yourslice,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"He actually blocked the vote itself in order to add the line you're referring to. So, to be fair you have a point, this is more of a rhetorical victory after all.  Essentially what I'm saying though is that, Rand could not have prevented this any longer than he did. He would have been overturned in a matter of time. Maybe he could have done more, but I ultimately still see it as a net benefit.  You're absolutely right though -- he should be judged on his record and this is part of that. But one should still ask the question, what feasible alternatives did he have and what would the net benefit or detriment have been?"
ronpaul,31uozy,TelFiRE,2,Thu Apr 9 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"Regarding voting for sanctions, here are the possibilities I can come up with:   He voted for sanctions because he believes Iran is a threat to the US.  This makes him badly informed or stupid.  Personally I doubt that is the case.     He voted for sanctions because he wants to protect/appease Israel.  This makes him an interventionist, and shows that he will put another ahead of the US He voted for sanctions even though he is personally against them, because he wants to win the election.  This makes him dishonest.     I am not really comfortable with any of the above reasons.  I may plug my nose and vote for Rand in the end anyway (depending on who else is running and who is viable) but I don't consider his candidacy a continuation of the Ron Paul Revolution by any means."

Liberty can't have multiple definitions.   I love the Pauls, fundamentally, but not politician one is perfect. This just happens to be my main beef with this one. I apologize for the downvote accusations."
ronpaul,31qw6i,alcapone444,7,Tue Apr 7 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the gay agenda can also run pretty counter to liberty. There are those who want their lifestyle legitimized by removing choices from others. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the government has no place in marriage. At most, they should offer domestic partnership status to any two consenting adults, same sex, siblings, etc. Marriage is a religious rite, and nobody should have to be party to any religious ceremony that doesn't align with their personal beliefs."
ronpaul,31qw6i,zimm3rmann,-1,Tue Apr 7 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"lifestyle legitimized   This suggests that homosexuality is a choice. Pursuing life, liberty and happiness is not a lifestyle, it's what everyone wants."
ronpaul,31qw6i,DoodleDew,0,Tue Apr 7 22:39:47 2015 UTC,"This suggests that homosexuality is a choice   That's tangential to the proposed solution. The solution is to not discriminate at all and give no preference to one particular lifestyle (e.g. heterosexual partnership) over another (e.g. homosexual partnership).  Even so, a homosexual lifestyle is a choice just like a heterosexual one is. The problem is that one lifestyle is discriminated against and, like racism, I doubt this will ever go away. Homosexuality itself was not brought up (a heterosexual may live a homosexual lifestyle and vise-versa if s/he so pleases).  I personally don't agree that homosexual marriage should be recognized because I don't really see a benefit in any marriage being officially recognized by the federal government. The main benefits I can think of are right of attorney, taxes and insurance. The first can be solved through a legal document, the second should be abolished anyway and the third is a private business matter that shouldn't be regulated as long as it's based on statistics and not purely for discrimination."

ronpaul,31qw6i,halfNelson89,0,Tue Apr 7 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"He opposes it because he sees marriage as being between a man and woman and something under God. It has nothing to do with ""choice"" or whatever your trying to project on him.   A gay couple can get MARRIED in any state at the moment. It just won't be recognized by the state in all states. This shows how marriage itself isn't controlled by the government, they simply choose to acknowledge the marriage as a governmental contract when they decide to do so.   Rand wants marriage to be a religious thing for personal use and supports civil unions or some sort of state contract for ALL for state use (which includes all the perks and such).  Disagree all you want. But at least know his stance if you are going to oppose it."

That's like me saying everybody in this thread can have pizza, except you. I'm gonna give you bread and cheese and you're going to call it pizza and like it.   It's a real slap in the face to the gay community. They aren't trying to play house. They want to be recognized just like us, by the state, and be MARRIED. Fuck a civil union.   We did nothing to be born the way we are, yet we reap the rewards. They did nothing to be born the way they are and they're punished for it."

Rand endorsed Mitt Romney because Romney was going to be the nominee and Rand knew he needed to align himself with the establishment in order to have a chance at a successful bid for the Republican nomination in 2016.  Same idea goes for the ""war on Christianity"" thing. Don't know if you realize this but the Paul's are Christian. It makes sense for a Christian to say things like that when radical Islamic terrorism is involved and it makes even more sense when you're trying to court the establishment of the Republican party which I'm sure is overwhelmingly Christian as well. I was all for Ron Paul not trying to court the establishment a few years ago but ultimately, that would never have gotten him elected.  There is this thing called politics that someone has to engage in in order to become President. That's just an unfortunate fact.  The only proof of any of the stuff about Abby Martin that I've found and you've linked to in hearsay. I thought she was a journalist so why wouldn't she publish and report her email communications with the people from the Capitol? Or anything remotely concrete outside of just her word?  Never donated or signed up for any Ron Paul emails or anything so I can't speak on that.

ronpaul,30posf,galt1776,39,Sun Mar 29 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"You can call him an idiot, but he is actually right. If you read the wording in the first amendment, you can see that it is set up to say that the government cannot interfere with religious practice, but it doesn't say anything about religion as practiced by people in government. It also bans an official state religion, and last time I checked, we still have no official religion.  This leads to the Libertarian position on marriage. They don't think government should be involved in marriage whatsoever. If both gay and straight marriages are not recognized by the government, you avoid the gay marriage debate altogether. If the government decides who can marry and who cannot, they are interfering with personal liberty.  If anything, Rand is carefully dancing around this issue to appeal to evangelicals, even though if you look closely, he is saying nothing. His position that the federal government should have no control over marriage is the correct one. Everything else he says is just fluff to get evangelicals on his side, and can largely be ignored. Just playing politics."

""If the government decides who can marry and who cannot, they are interfering with personal liberty""), then it just leaves the Christian Conservatives feeling like they are right by thinking they can use their religion to base laws upon (Indiana?)."
ronpaul,30posf,lilbp,3,Sun Mar 29 23:34:04 2015 UTC,Where does morality in laws come from in the first place?  Is the prohibition on murder purely emergent or did things like the Ten Commandments influence the laws we created for ourselves?

Which is pretty much keep the religion out of the government. Having the government enforce a religiously purposed marriage law is having an official religion, it is having the church in the state. Rand is wrong."
ronpaul,30posf,matts2,3,Mon Mar 30 07:25:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what marriage law you're referring to in the article. I don't see one. He just says he doesn't think the federal government should make laws regarding marriage.
ronpaul,30posf,Rickster885,-1,Mon Mar 30 13:42:42 2015 UTC,Rand has made it clear that he says that only because the anti-gay marriage stance will lose. Like his father he would support a federal anti-gay marriage law.   But what I meant was those state level anti-gay marriage laws. They have no secular purpose. That is the finding of multiple federal courts. The defenders of the anti-gay marriage laws have failed to convince the courts there is anything but religion and animus behind the laws.   So to hold Rand's position you have to think it is acceptable for the states to violate the Bill of Rights. Is that actually his position?
ronpaul,30posf,matts2,3,Mon Mar 30 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"In that case, we pretty much need a federal law banning states from recognizing any marriages."
ronpaul,30posf,Rickster885,-1,Mon Mar 30 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"Nope but thanks for playing. Marriage has been around across cultures for all known history. It is not religious in intent. Plenty of non-religious folk get married, plenty of people have religiously mixed marriages. We can easily present a solid non-religious argument for marriage. There is no valid secular argument against gay marriage except ""gays are yucky"". And that is not really valid."
ronpaul,30posf,matts2,3,Mon Mar 30 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"But if you're going the route of government being involved in all marriages, you need to legalize polygamy and things like that too. Which shouldn't be a problem, but it's a tough sell."
ronpaul,30posf,Rickster885,-1,Mon Mar 30 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"But if you're going the route of government being involved in all marriages, you need to legalize polygamy and things like that too.    No actually you don't. This is a 1st Amendment issue for this discussion (it is actually a gender issue for the courts, but I'll leave that for later). The point here is that you can't have the government imposing a religious rule and anti-gay bigotry is coming from religious rules. The courts have been asked for a non-religious secular purpose for the laws and no one has presented anything approaching a valid rule. So these laws are government imposed bigotry that Rand supports. Let's make that last bit clear, Rand is saying he is fine with the government imposing religion on people.   As for your polygamy claim, that is just a strawman since no one is actually out there working for legalizing group marriage. There are people who promote polyamory, but no one does the actual hard work of trying to get it recognized under the law. If and when they do we can have a real discussion on this issue.  Furthermore you question shows a misunderstanding of the actual cases involving gay marriage. The issue is not ""allow all marriages"", the issue is ""don't don't discriminate on the basis of gender"". This is an equal rights issue, there is no valid secular purpose served by the state declaring the appropriate genders for a marriage.  That's it, no more. If we go to group marriage, and to be clear I have nothing particularly against group marriage, we have to re-write laws. Removing gender from the marriage laws was done over the last 100 years and so is an easy step today. But we have no idea how to actually implement group marriage/divorce. Someone needs to write the rules. If and when they do we can consider that change. But it is not a rights issue at all."
ronpaul,30posf,matts2,4,Mon Mar 30 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Sigh, this again. Watch the 1.5 minute video for yourself. He's definitely pandering to the religious right by pointing out that the Senate opens daily with a prayer (true!), but he also tells them not to look to government to solve ""moral crises"", and not to look to the federal government in particular."

I hate this can't blame them attitude.  If people want to ignorantly walk around with ""good intentions"" that's fine.  Just don't be surprised when you land a job at HSBC and end up laundering drug cartel money.    In the same way, don't be surprised if you join the military in ignorance and end up fighting for corrupt politicians instead of democracy.    The troops know better than anyone all the bullshit happening right now, yet they still continue to stay.  Why?  A paycheck is more important than anyone's morality in today's age."
ronpaul,2y9nfr,daveywaveylol2,4,Sat Mar 7 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"Or... or, hear me out... once they realize whats actually going on, they can't leave, because as you may know, the military requires contracts usually of 4+ years, and leaving before that time is up is a very serious crime.    Also, the entire US military and everyone in it is not evil.  A lot of its members and missions are important for world peace and even if you support an isolationist US, only a fool would think the US military could just drop all of its global obligations on a whim without serious repercussions."
ronpaul,2y9nfr,snubdeity,3,Sun Mar 8 00:18:59 2015 UTC,"Anyone who extends their contract definitely gets the blame.  You get the excuse of being young and naive.  Once you are a part of it and you still don't see it, it's on you.  Isolationist isn't the same as non-interventionism."

I reflect not only on the difficulties of war they must have gone through, but also upon the nature of a government they were coerced into fighting for.  I also think a sort of respect is owed to people who signed-on before a particular line of foreign policy is established and well understood.  I have little time or respect to people who join in the midst of a clearly immoral conflict. There's no pride in that.  I hold most of this true to soldiers of foreign countries, too. I feel terrible at the though of all the Russian farmers sent to their deaths on the Eastern front during both world wars."
ronpaul,2y9nfr,34Mbit,3,Sun Mar 8 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"""As much respect and praise"" as they receive today? No. After Vietnam, soldiers came home and were spit on and constantly harrassed for serving, even though many of them were drafted against their will. As a society I think we decided that was a mistake, so now like everything we've gone too far in the opposite direction and today we seem to worship ""the troops"" as superheroes.  The right approach is probably somewhere in the middle. Individuals join the military for a lot of different reasons ranging from wanting to defend the country, to wanting to kill infidel brown muslims, to family tradition, to needing the money. It's probably best not to apply any single stereotype to the millions of individuals who serve in the military."
ronpaul,2y9nfr,zugi,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:55:12 2015 UTC,If someone's stance is totally 'anti-war' then draftees should have been sympathized with and the current 'volunteers' should spit on. It is almost ironic how the pendulum swings in such an illogical manner.

Ultimately a few things are important here:   If you joined the military in peace time, this is a different decision that joining during wartime/conflict.  We are ALL implicated in the actions of our soldiers and elected officials. We sit around and gripe on the internet and do nothing more. We have to look in the mirror on this one. Rich people do not go to war. The children of rich people rarely go to war.  GW Bush and countless other of our social elite have been shielded from combat action due to their status. It has always been thus - unless you go back in history and pull out the few dozen kings and military rulers who had the balls to actually fight. But those are the exceptions. In other words, desperate and poor people see the military as the only way out of their mess. It may have little to do with nationalism -although for some folks this is a big part of it."

A pretty decent sized bank in Puerto Rico has failed and the FDIC is picking up the tab to the tune of 700 odd million.   Considering some of the horrible macroeconomic stats coming out of the US lately...and all the ""fake"" money being pushed into the system. Do you think that more banks are going to fail as the economy worsens.  I think it is high time the FED was held accountable for their awful activities. I swear Ron Paul should have been president!"

But honestly the collapse of the third largest bank in puerto rico is not an indication of instability in US banks at all. 700 million is nothing relative to a real bank's balance sheet. I'd be much more concerned of a European Bank collapsing before any large banks in the US."
ronpaul,2xfs5j,firmness,0,Sat Feb 28 22:21:42 2015 UTC,"I try to pay attention to Finance and Economics.  It is surprising that we have not yet experienced rampant inflation.  The FED is not evil.  We need them.  One problem is our treasury printing dollars and our inability to measure how much currency is circulating.   If we knew the true amount of M3 money supply, everyone would go nuts and the system might collapse.  That is why they are so secretive.  When one person dumps a worthless currency, it is rational - when 10 million people do it, it is a ""panic""  No easy answers here.  The dollar should have collapsed a decade ago, but demand from other countries and the ignorance of most Americans regarding how it all works is keeping us afloat."
ronpaul,2xfs5j,unrealy2k,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"As long as the Greenback remains the world reserve currency the Fed can keep printing. The other reason we haven't seen rampant inflation is due to hoarding dollars, as long as the rest of the world continues to buy US dollars & debt we can continue with what we are doing. I used to be real doom and gloom on the US economy up until 2013. I realized that the rest of the world is in far worse shape than us, therefore barring any unforseen changes we should be able to keep doing what we are doing from a monetary policy standpoint into the foreseeable future. Is it the best choice, I don't know."

Like the 1st amendment protecting free speech, this is to protect the free net from being abused. It sucks congress couldn't do anything about it but they're not good for much of anything."
ronpaul,2xbi5k,panjadotme,10,Fri Feb 27 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"It all depends what the decision ends up being, which we should be finding out in a few weeks. My largest fear is the term ""legal"" and that it might be used to block all encrypted communication (well, all that the US government can't read) at some point soon; because if you are using a VPN, TOR, SSH, bit torrent, etc. then you must be either a terrorist or producing kiddie porn.  Net Neutrality rules should always read ""all traffic from all services"" because really, if it is encrypted they have no idea what you are doing and don't know if it is legal or not.  Edit: Also RP has a point that this gives the regulation to the government and now they can just add more regulations and so on. It would have been much more productive to deregulate the lines to the houses or at least the poles so that we could have meaningful competition, the current solution does nothing for the mono/duopoly issues we have in the US, which is the real problem and the reason that we need NN.  Edit2: Look at the FDA; I would have nothing bad to say about forcing companies to say what is in their products, for the research and finding to be transparent, make sure that they don't harm or kill me, etc.,  but the FDA, even though it started with these goals, now serves to protect companies by limiting liability, and blocking competition."

I've been screaming for a true ""level playing field"" w/r/t cable and broadband infrastructure for years now; it's absurd that these massive companies like Comtrash, who essentially hold a government-enforced monopoly because they're the only ones allowed to use the broadband infrastructure that the government facilitated, are allowed to exist in their current form. In a true free market, there would be competition, but right now, for broadband, my options are Comtrash and, um, Comtrash. Gigabit Fiber is starting to shake their foundations a bit, but they (Comtrash and TWC) still have a firm stranglehold on most of this nation. I would love to see a world where the broadband infrastructure all the way to the pole is a virtually unregulated highway, owned by the state, where many providers can honestly compete for customers.   Anyway, like I said, don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. This is still good, and it doesn't preclude the FCC from actually creating that level-playing-field marketplace in the future...though, if you though Comtrash, verizon, etc. fought net neutrality tooth and nail, you ain't seen nothing yet. They will cling to their monopolies/duopolies for dear life. Competition is the last thing Comtrash and their ilk want."

ronpaul,2xbi5k,Lurkingredditatwork,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"The second amendment gives us the right to bear arms, that does not mean the government provides us weapons it means they protect our right to own them. That is how I see net neutrality. It is, or should be, the government protecting our right to a free and open Internet. Not free as in cost Free but free as in without manipulation of packets - government or private. Now, when an ISP provides access to the internet they can not create fast lanes or slow lanes.   That's one of the main reasons why this sub has become unbearable for me now..its almost as if people are just anti government. I want a small and efficient government that passes meaningful legislation. It seems that even though this is a win for liberty and competition people still want to complain.

Just to be clear, I too want to keep the Internet free and open, but not by force.  Competition will always regulate itself, and if you claim there's no competition in your area, it's most likely because of contracts/regulations the ISP already have in place with your local/state government.  More government is not the answer.  I'm not anti government at all, we just have different views on what the role of government should be.  I honestly believe the Federal government should never enter in the free market.  Companies regulate itself through competition."

If Comcast doesn't want to build infastructure to provide broadband to a remote location in the desert, they can't be forced to.  If they don't want to accept you as a customer because you use too much data or haven't paid your bills in the past, they have a right to do so.  But if I as individual have the means to access the internet (either through my own network, a friends network, public hotspot, etc), nobody has the right to block my access.

Expanding food stamps was a centerpiece of their 2015 budget proposal:   The Congressional Black Caucus's budget proposal would spend $3.26 trillion, reverting the cuts to food stamps and lengthening the time period over which people can receive unemployment insurance.    I'm also not sure why pointing this out would be controversial.  Every group has its motivations.
