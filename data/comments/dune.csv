dune,3e0lib,Yuri_Petrov,37,Tue Jul 21 01:07:55 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons is that Frank spent so much of his six Dune novels on the concept that messiahs are, ultimately, harmful to and a limitation on society and culture. How did the chucklefuck brothers resolve the series? With an ubermessiah. Way to stick the landing, guys!  Secondly, there are a lot of things that just plain don't make sense in their conclusion to the series. Leto II's ghola can turn into a sandworm at will? How strange, wonder how it's going to fit into the story. Oh. It didn't. Will we see a cool use of Sheeana's worm controlling ability? Not really, Leto can do the same thing and turn into a worm. Speaking of, I haven't seen him do that recently...why not leave the worm controlling to Sheeana and join in the destructive rampage himself? Or join in and help control the worms?  Oh, and you know these characters you came to know during the last two of Frank's books? Well they're suddenly a lot less important, because we're bringing back tons of your favorites from the first four books so we can further cash in on daddy dearest's legacy!  And remember how the entire backstory of Dune was all about humans needed to improve their own capabilities because reliance on machines turned out to be a Bad Thing for humanity's existence? Well fuck that! It turns out the real answer all along was to embrace the machines! Because reasons!  And oh yeah, they're guilty of some pretty transparent deus ex machina as well. Oh no, the big bad is unstoppable, all our best efforts have failed! Oh here comes some god-like being and, well, that's it, I guess. Were we even needed here? At all? I know it's a common trope and not something to judge an author on alone, but come on guys, you could have done it with even a little bit of tact."

And the mention of this transformation has been on Leto II's Wikipedia page for the better part of a decade, and Wikipedia is a huge stickler for accuracy in all things."
dune,3e0lib,FlakJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:04:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a fair amount of my dislike for them comes from things I learned second-hand.  Ten or so years ago I was browsing in a bookstore and saw a Dune book that I'd somehow missed. I immediately bought it and dived in. It took me all of a page to start to get a funny feeling. By five pages in I had to close the book and take a second look at the cover. It was then that I noticed that the book wasn't by Frank Herbert. I saw ""Herbert"" on the cover, in big letters, but had missed that it said Brian in front of it. I put it down, disappointed, and have never gone back.   It was easy to walk away from that one anyways as it was one of the prequel books I guess. It was one of the ""House of"" books. I didn't really need it and I didn't feel like I was missing anything.  So, my first, own personal, reason for not liking the NuDune is that I don't think they are necessary. I was perfectly content with the six books by Frank and I never really needed more. I've never really understood when people say ""I just love the Universe so much I'll take any more of it that I can get."" I love the books so much that I reread them. Ever after several dozen reads I always find more to appreciate. If I haven't even exhausted the first six yet...  My second reason for not liking them is that I actually tried to read one and the differences from a Frank original were too distracting. In just a few pages I was so turned off by the glaring deficiencies in the writing, in the universe I was used to. It was like reading fan fiction and I don't make a habit of reading fan fiction at all.  From there, I've learned all sorts of new reasons to dislike the books from reading here in this sub. The things I've learned about these books that piss me off the most are 1) changing canon or retconning to make a new idea work, 2) completely missing the subtler points of the originals to the point of actually undoing them. u/FlakJackson gives examples of those. He's clearly read them and I have no reason to think everyone is lying about those details.  Finally, the cash grab aspect of it. Of course we don't know what actually happened in the Herbert house. Brian could be telling the truth. I just somehow doubt it. The timeline doesn't seem to work out at all. Frank spent 20 years writing six books and finished the sixth book shortly before he died. A decade goes by when suddently Brian announces that he's found some notes for a seventh book. Based on those notes he has now churned out more than double the number of the original books. Wow, that's a lot of notes...  I honestly don't believe there are any notes at all. If there were any, they were more likely details that didn't make it into the originals rather than notes for a seventh book. I don't believe there was anything intended to come after the sixth. The ending of it is just too perfect for the series.   So, that last reason is the most tenuous as it is based only on speculation but it is perversely one of the strongest. I'm disgusted by the idea, even if ill-founded, that NuDune is purely a cash-in. It would explain why adherence to the canon so unimportant in writing them. If you have so little respect for the canon or for the fans, why bother?"
dune,3e0lib,nognus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"Point of interest, I haven't read NuDune, but I have extensively read many accounts of the flaws of these books, and many plot summaries on various wikis, all so that I can be properly informed. All these sources independently confirm everything I mentioned above, which gives me the utmost confidence that what I've said is accurate.  I do plan to attempt to read Hunters and Sandworms, so that one, I can criticize from a truly informed stance and two, in the hopes of further deconstructing those train wrecks, to find more things to tear down. Needless to say, it's an undertaking that has been considerably delayed due to the pain involved."
dune,3e0lib,FlakJackson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with you loving them for the reasons that you do.  One of the major reasons that Frank's books are so popular even this long after they were written is because they succeed on multiple levels:  Fine writing?  Check.    Interesting plot?  Check.  Internally consistent themes?  Check.    Deeply interesting ideas presented with clarity?  Check.    Originality?  Check.    A person definitely doesn't have to justify/defend their tastes.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for skittles and sometimes I'm in the mood for filet mignon.  Nothing wrong with entertaining fluff.    What people resent about these otherwise unremarkable nudune novels is that they pretend to be the peer of great works.  It might be fun to follow the plot, but with anything deeper than a cursory read you quickly begin to realize a few things.  Not only are they lacking in intriguing original ideas, but they actually violate the themes of the same work they are pretending to be a part of.  Let me be clear:  Brian Herbert doesn't get Dune, and the fact that he is his father's son is irrelevant.    One of the most cringey moments in modern science fiction:  How do you continue a well told story that already has a natural and satisfying conclusion about an ultimate power and the effects such a power would have on the social and natural ecologies of the world under it?  Oh, well that's easy-mode, bro.  Just make an ultimateER power.  Boom."

That said...I have read the plots of many of their Dune books on various wikis, and the plot of their ""Dune 7"" (two books) alone was enough to turn me away from their shit for good (most notably, what ends up resolving the conflict of Dune 7 is something Frank always made a point of criticizing). Beyond that, they also receive major criticism over their writing style, and the lack of the philosophical/intellectual undercurrents present in Frank's writing."
dune,3dzm85,FlakJackson,12,Mon Jul 20 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"Basically what this guy said. I decided to try reading them just to get closure on the story. I kind of regret it.   It kind of reminds me of a story that a crazy fisherman tells you about how he went through a hurricane and got stranded on an island and then he finally caught the fish and it was THIS big! Most of the story is pointless, you don't believe it, you don't take anything from it, and leave more or less even more empty than before.   Then resolution is something that I can't believe Frank would have written, despite the fact that the story is supposedly based off of his notes. Maybe it's because it lacks any meaning, but it's just stupid."
dune,3dzm85,Alabast,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:08 2015 UTC,I refuse to believe his notes had anything to do with those books. He wouldn't have created the ultimate messiah to save the day after spending six books explaining exactly why messiahs aren't the answer and I refuse to believe an inexplicably shape-shifting Leto II ghola (whose ability serves no purpose) could have struck him as a good idea.   So much of Frank's books are directly contradicted and/or rendered meaningless by Brian and Kevin's abortions. It's disgusting that his legacy has been subjected to this.
dune,3dzm85,FlakJackson,6,Mon Jul 20 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"While I don't particularly enjoy BH and KJAs writing, I stopped after house corino, I don't see why people are so upset about them. If you don't like how they wrapped things up that's fine but it doesn't take away from what Frank Herbert wrote.  They sucked, move on, it's not destroying anything. Franks books still exist. Accept each book as a discrete item. In my opinion it's like rendezvous with rama, the three sequels by Author C Clark and Gentry Lee's sequels attempt to answer what Rama is, and IMHO they did a crappy job. It doesn't take away from the wonder that I felt while reading the first book."
dune,3dzm85,maxximillian,5,Mon Jul 20 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm upset because some people actually believe that their version of Dune 7 was based on Frank's notes, that their train wreck of unresolved character arcs, plot holes, extraneous characters and contradictions was, in any way, shape or form, representative of Frank's vision for Dune's conclusion.  For these people, Brian and Kevin's books have taken away from what Frank wrote."
dune,3dzm85,FlakJackson,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Dune fan and I actually liked the prequels.  They don't compare to Frank Herbert but it was fun for me reading about young Duke Leto, Duncan, Gurney etc.  I also read the books about the machine war which I thought were ok.

dune,3dzm85,sequethin,6,Tue Jul 21 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"Damn it... for this one question, I wish I let some of my comments live. I wrote a pretty good little explanation of how the ending of Chapterhouse is not only appropriate, but really the only fitting ending to the series. It isn't a cliffhanger in the traditional sense. It is the best way that Frank could have ended the books.  Briefly though, one of the key plot devices, related to the overarching message of the books, is Leto II's / the oracle's vision of and therefor control over the future. Duncan spent lifetimes railing against just that, against Leto II and what he represented in Duncan's life. The predictability of the future, the stultification, the control.   Even after Leto II is gone, humanity is left wondering just what he saw. And for those who understand the pure power of his oracle, left wondering just what he determined / controlled.  Now, setting that aside for the moment, in the last book we have the introduction of the characters of Daniel and Marty. They represent a new form of all-powerful control, an assumption of subtle powers. They intrude directly in Duncan's life and it is hinted that they have powers we can't even guess at.  The final piece to wrapping this all up is a quick examination of the character of Duncan. Duncan is the character that is alive for all six books. He is there in the beginning and there at the end. He represents the reader. He is the 'primitive.' Leto II happens to him. The BG happen to him. He reacts to everything, authors very little of it.  So, at the very end of the book, what happens? Duncan, the proxy for the reader, finally and conclusively escapes the control of Leto II, of Daniel and Marty and of the series in general. This is made especially sweet when you consider that many of us consider Daniel and Marty to be stand-ins for Frank and Bev Herbert. They represent a humorous little way for Frank to say goodbye to his creation.  Seen from the other direction, where Duncan actually represents us, the end of the book is a metaphor for us saying goodbye to the series. We escape the Universe of Frank's invention and whatever else happens after that happens in our imagination.  It is this interpretation that most convinces me that there never were any notes for a seventh book. The ending to six is just too perfect."

I totally remember reading this, and having it change my mind on the ""cliffhanger"" at the end of Chapterhouse. A month later I went looking for it only to find it deleted.  It was a nice clear and concise summary.  You did a good job here hitting on a lot of the same points, though!"

Knowing this was the end? Yeah, it left a lot of things hanging, but after you sit with it, discuss it, re-read the books and so on, it feels better. Maybe not ""right"", per se, but it makes sense, and it ties up the emotional and philosophical connections well. I don't think Dune would be half as intriguing if Frank tied everything up in a neat little spice paper package.  I read a few of the nuDune books years ago, and they really aren't worth your time. Entertaining for a brief moment, but entirely forgettable. The Dune 7 novels didn't add anything to the end of the series, and in many ways they actually subtract from it. The best thing you can do is hang out here in /r/dune, read old threads, talk about stuff, and wait. You'll come around to Daniel and Marty. I know I did.  ""Gholas. He's welcome to them."""

Each time you reread them there is a bunch of stuff you already figured out and that frees up brain space to think about the stuff you didn't get last time.  The Golden Path is Leto's plan to save humanity. What, precisely, would have ended humanity is not ever made clear. I'm sure someone will come and tell us what Brian thought about it though, as if it even matters. In any case, the broad outline of Leto's plan is to so condition and compress humanity, under his reign of enforced tranquility, that when released they will explode outwards in both population and physical space. He creates thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions, of intrepid explorers and people hungry for something, anything different. Upon his death and the collapse of the control of his government those explorers and entrepreneurs are released.  You will read in the next book that they call this ""The Scattering."" It is such a pivotal event that it is capitalized and human history is forever defined as pre- and post-Scattering. At the end of it, the population of humanity is so large and they are spread so throughout space that it is no longer possible for them all to be under the sway of any one oracle (like Leto or Muad'Dib) or to be exterminated by any, one threat.  As Leto expresses it, as a result of his efforts, humanity no longer has all of its eggs in one basket."

Unfortunately (for you) that is the tone of this book.  It's definitely not for everyone.  The plot moves at the pace of a glacier, and the main characters can be unlikeable at times.  This book happens to be my favorite in the series due to the philosophical and sociological diatribes from Leto II.   I didn't enjoy this story the first time I read it, but after re-reading the series, it quickly became my favorite.  I picked up more on re-reads of this book than I did from the others.  Maybe after you finish Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune, you can go back in with a fresh viewspoint and find a lot of new things!  RE: your point about Malky - he was brought into the story to provide a bit more backstory for Hwi Noree.  Malky was one of Leto's favorite courtiers, despite them hardly ever seeing eye to eye on many issues, and Malky had a good penchant for doing things that would intentionally ""poke the bear"" so to speak.  I think Leto admired that in him, but when Hwi comes into the story, Leto eventually realizes that she is the antithesis of Malky who was ostensibly her uncle.  In reality, Leto figures out that he is actually her ""father.""  I enjoyed the little bit of Malky we got to see, for what it's worth.  Also, /u/Super_Pan covered the Golden Path and its intended goals quite well."

dune,3dle9n,destructoid17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"I spent some time going over that passage and it seems to be a black book small enough to fit in ones hand, like a kindle. The front cover has tabs on the side to save a page, and open the book. When the book has opened itself, the inside surfaces of the covers have tabs to turn the extremely thin pages using an electric charge. There's a magnifying glass on a mechanical arm somewhere on it, which means the text is too small to read using the naked eye.   What I think all this fuckery represents is one of Herbert's ways of explaining how religious fanaticism is stupid or powerful. Who in their right mind would carry around something so inconvenient to read and so easy to damage? Who would take enough care not to damage the thing? Who would care enough to ruin their eyes reading the horrible little thing? Someone enamored in their religion, someone who truly loves their god. Someone who would follow a Messiah blindly."

dune,3d86zd,-Epyx-,20,Tue Jul 14 07:08:21 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning is more literary than biological; water on arrakis, like spice in the universe at large, is an analog for oil, food, and any other power-bestowing resource.  Dune as a whole has as one of its themes the birth, growth, expansion, disequilibrium, and fall of economic systems.    The effects of these (dis) economies and those who perpetuate them are seen throughout, and these mechanisms are used to establish or clarify pro/antagonists in the story.    In general, it's water that enables the sandtrout cycle, but immersion in water once they've reached the maker stage will kill them - just as unlimited access to a powerful resource will corrupt and kill the individual."

And without spice the Fremen die and space travel halts. Leaving this lush green planet with no people on it and no way to get to it.   That is until the sand trout capture all the water and make it a desert again."

dune,3d86zd,TheFlyingBastard,4,Tue Jul 14 21:45:50 2015 UTC,"Bit of a nitpick, but 'Little Maker' is the Fremen name for the sandtrouts.  When sandtrouts were born from the egg that a sandworm would lay in its underground nest, they would work together to find water. Combined with the other nutrients that the sandworm had left behind, this was enough for them to survive. What comes in must go out, so eventually they started shitting all over the nest. The excretion came in contact with the water, which made the pre-spice mass.  Eventually that chemical reaction (between the water and the sandtrout excrement) bubbled up until it exploded, killing many trouts. After the spice blow, there would be no more nutrients for the sandtrout, so the survivors would then reform into worm segments, with a new kind of metabolism for a different ""diet"", one which could not stand water.   This juvenile form is the one the Fremen capture for their spice orgies. Over the course of centuries, this worm would grow out to be the giant worm we all know and love.  Note that I put the word 'diet' up there in scare quotes. It is a bit of a bad word here, since worms are autotrophs, but the water would basically fuck with the way the energy was divided up through the worm body. And there was a lot of energy in there. All the gasses and shit that came from the reactions inside the body would literally be set on fire by the heat that the friction of the worm body on the sand would generate. That's why worms seem to have fire in the depths of their mouths. Because... well, they kinda do."

dune,3d86zd,mcapello,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"This is complete speculation, but my best guess would go something like this:  Some kind of major metabolic shift happens during the transition from sandtrout to sandworm, vaguely like the difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration with terrestrial organisms.  Reasons to suspect this:  a. The sandrout (in Children) are edible.  b. They're also in some sense compatible with human biology (enough for symbiotic implantation, anyway).  c. Worms, however, exhale oxygen...  d... and I think it's mentioned at several points that their bodies contain a fair amount of hydrochloric acid. There might be references to other chemical differences as well.  e. And then there is the famous metabolic ""furnace"" inside a sandworm. A sandworm's temperature is in some part a consequence of friction (forget where that's mentioned, maybe Children or God Emperor) but obviously a sandworm is not a perpetual motion machine. It's generating oxygen and is somehow able to produce significant amounts of biomechanical energy off of what it finds in the sand, yet it's able to metabolize what it finds without using water as a medium, and without using oxygen (oxygen seems to be a byproduct).  This doesn't really answer your question, which would be, why would an organism have essentially two metabolic pathways in two separate stages in its life cycle?  Well, one possible answer is that the ""alternative"" non-hydrous pathway was an adaptation which came later. Clearly it is enormously advantageous, since once it gets going, it allows for a great accumulation of biomass with apparently very little in the way of inputs. We can guess that the metabolic process of the adult worms is incredibly efficient (sans water toxicity).  If there is something about the non-hydrous pathway which is advantageous yet incompatible with water-based life (simply because of chemistry), you could imagine the original stage in the animal's life cycle evolving into something which had the primary responsibility of containing and eliminating sources of open water. And since presumably all the ""competitor"" organisms in the worm's natural environment would have a hydrous chemistry, this adaptation would represent a huge evolutionary advantage.  Just some ideas (a bit long -- procrastinating instead of working out)."
dune,3d86zd,mcapello,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"Plausible. With this idea, it would only seem possible if a new element or unknown metabolic pathway were utilized. Given that O2 is a significant byproduct, I wonder if the pathway has similar components as photosynthesis and if the heat produced replaces the need for sunlight as a catalyst."
dune,3d86zd,soylentblueissmurfs,2,Tue Jul 14 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Herbert thought very far into the biochemistry. Still interesting to think about, though.  A few random ideas. It could be that the sand plankton are metabolizing hydrogen sulfide bound up in salts suspended in the sand. Perhaps the ionizing action of the sandworms itself (caused by the well-attested static charge they produce) helps make the hydrogen sulfide bioavailable from some kind of mineral substrate. The sandtrout might be an intermediate hydrous-stage metabolism that relies on the carbohydrates produced by the chemosynthetic sand-plankton phase. This may work because hydrogen sulfide-based metabolism might have originally been adapted to anaerobic but water-rich environment.   Kynes remarks in Dune that the balance of gases in Arrakis' atmosphere is ""ideal"" (meaning roughly terrestrial) so assuming that either plankton or the worms themselves are essentially metabolic substitutes for photosynthesis seems likely... what they would use as an energy source other than solar radiation, though, would be the main unknown. Hydrogen sulfide or some other chemosynthetic metabolism is the only thing that comes to mind, but it seems hard to imagine that these reactions would produce enough energy to sustain something that has the energy needs of a sandworm."
dune,3d86zd,root88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"It would really help if F. Herbert explained the origin of the worms in more depth. According to everyone's knowledge, the sandworms are not a native species and therefore have their origins elsewhere. We know that the sandworms were already present before the introduction of Fremen, so Dune's dry and hot climate had to be the reason for their current life cycle. If that's the case, what of the sandtrout that lived during the time that Arrakis was abundant with water? Did the maker stage come about after Dune became dry or was it always present? What were the initial life styles of the worms during the first million or so yrs when they were on Arrakis? Was the water on Arrakis similar in composition to our understanding of water or was there other materials laced in it? Not much detail is given on the latent composition of the sand or the earth.  Just more things to consider...again"
dune,3d86zd,soylentblueissmurfs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"Since Leto II doesn't know the origin of the sandworms (or at least doesn't tell it) it has to be non-human. I think an alien civilization transplanted the little makers to create deserts for whatever purpose, it's possible they hail from a very different ecosystem and that they were either bred or wholly created to xenoform planets."
dune,3d86zd,root88,3,Wed Jul 15 05:47:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you think they were put there by aliens. Couldn't they just have evolved naturally like life on Earth did? If they were placed, wouldn't they likely have been placed somewhere else as well?"
dune,3d86zd,soylentblueissmurfs,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:28 2015 UTC,It's seems improbable that such a complex creature could be the sole species in an alien ecosystem (all other life on Arrakis is transplanted from the terran ecosystems). Another possibility would be an advanced ecosystem that collapsed after the worms stole all the moisture but then there'd be fossils to prove that.
dune,3d86zd,6ftTurkey,5,Wed Jul 15 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"This is a fun conversation. You have very good points. However, if the sand worms trapped all the water on the planet, it could explain why there is no other life. As for fossils, any on the surface would have been wiped away by storms and if you are going to dig on Arrakis, it's going to be for spice, not fossils. That or Herbert didn't feel the need to mention them.  Doing a little research, I did find a quote that may support your point:   ""The sandtrout,"" [Leto II] repeated, ""was introduced here from some other place. This was a wet planet then. They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them. Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet . . . and they did it to survive. In a planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase."" ~Children of Dune   However, the fact that Leto does know that the sandworms were brought from another place makes me think that he got that knowledge from an ancient human."
dune,3d86zd,windsavage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"In that case the sandworms were either found and transplanted in secret or in an event of which no records remain (perhaps pre-Butlerian-jihad). Or perhaps the worms were created by humans, but for what purpose? It seems more straight forward to create spice the new fashioned way like Tleilaxu does it so their purpose should have been to create the desert. It seems strange to make a planet into a hellhole, life supporting planets are very valuable assets. Were they a weapon to destroy an ecosystem without atomics (and have the means to bring the planet back to life if you have insight into the life cycle of the worms? did Paul learn his cycle breaking trick tapping into the knowledge of the people who brought the worms to Arrakis in the first place?)."

The use of ""given in"" highlights the disgust and fear associated with possession by the BG. The possession by Other Memory of a person with the powers and abilities of a RM is one of the things the BG most fears. Alia's possession is potentially the worst thing ever to happen to the BG for many years, given her natural abilities and her position of power.   It also seems to me that ""given in"" reflects an inability to truly understand the nature of Other Memory and its potential effects. The BG acknowledge Abomination as the terror it is. Leto II says   It is with reason and terrible experience that we call the pre-born Abomination. For who knows what lost and damned persona out of our evil past may take over the living flesh?   Imagine if a person in power today (say, President Obama, or Donald Trump, or the Pope, or any other politically/religiously/financially powerful leader) was taken over by the mind/spirit/intellect of Hitler, or Ghengis Khan, or Caligula. With such twisted desires coupled with a position of great power, imagine the havoc they could wreak. Now imagine a person with the powers and abilities of a Reverend Mother, coupled with a sadistic, sociopathic, or psychopathic mind. That way lies the Joker, the Honored Matres, the Plutonian, and so on.   Using ""given in"" is a way of refusing to admit that it is the BG who brought Alia's Abomination upon themselves. The BG choose to simply deny those who are so possessed, even thought they acknowledge the danger inherent in such a one. They must have had some experience with Abomination sometime in the past, perhaps before the development of the controls RMs have by the time of the Atreides Imperium. Jessica's use of ""given in"" simply reduces Alia's issue to one of personal inability. The BG do not understand fully because their knee-jerk reaction to the pre-born is ""kill it,"" which denies the near-impossibility of controlling Other Memory by the pre-born.  It is a kind of victim-blaming. If they had treated Alia; helped her to assimilate and control the Other Memories, she might well have wound up like Leto and Ghanima, making a pact with a powerful ancestor to help her control her memories, but note that even Leto and Ghanima had to have help from such a deep ancestral memory. Abomination is almost impossible to avoid in the pre-born, and the BG fear it so much that they simply shut it out.  tl;dr: Alia didn't do anything necessarily bad. She is trying to save herself from the cacophony of Other Memory that has filled her head since before she was born. It is the personality that possesses her and the things she does to placate and attempt to control that personality that lead to her downfall."

At the end I always felt good that I was pretty well in tune with the storyline and just wasn't sure the whole time."

All of it was to foster a mystique (brand we call it today) that would make truly humble people furious and angry to the core. Enough to rebel against him, so that then he could adopt them into to the aristocratic hierarchy.   Those that wanted to be like him never got the chance. They were weeded out fast. Those that genuinely disliked the self-importance he carried himself with were added to his human plan. And those who were really special individuals were shown the Golden Path, and how he was the sole architect capable of such a thing.

And for that, I blush.  On the other hand, I have no recollection of the passage you quoted, so I maybe there's hope for me yet.

Let us suppose a wise Sardaukar commander recognized the swordmaster in a corpse his men had slain. What then? There exist uses for such flesh and training... if one acts swiftly. [...] Let us assume that our wise Sardaukar commander had Idaho's corpse preserved for the axolotl tanks. Why not? This corpse held the flesh and nerves of one of the finest swordsmen in history, an adviser to the Atreides, a military genius. What a waste to lose all that training and ability when it might be revived as an instructor for the Sardaukar.""  ""I heard not a whisper of this and I was one of my father's confidantes,"" Irulan said.  ""Ahh, but your father was a defeated man and within a few hours you had been sold to the new Emperor,"" Edric said.  ""Was it done?"" she demanded.  With a maddening air of complacency, Edric said: ""Let us presume that our wise Sardaukar commander, knowing the need for speed, immediately sent the preserved flesh of Idaho to the Bene Tleilaxu. Let us suppose further that the commander and his men died before conveying this information to your father - who couldn't have made much use of it anyway. There would remain then a physical fact, a bit of flesh which had been sent off to the Tleilaxu. There was only one way for it to be sent, of course, on a heighliner. We of the Guild naturally know every cargo we transport. Learning of this one, would we not think it additional wisdom to purchase the ghola as a gift befitting an Emperor?""    In context, Edric's reply is just to emphasize that the Corrinos were no longer in power when the Fremen rebellion ended. I always read it as a not-so-subtle jab at Irulan , and by extension, at the BG who trained her. Remember the tone of the conversation at this meeting of conspirators. Everyone is poking and testing and insulting everyone else. Mohiam is contemptuous of Irulan, Irulan is disgusted by Edric, Scytale is maneuvering all the parties to his own ends, and so on. ""A few hours"" is simply poetic license to insultingly highlight the relatively quick ending of the thousands-of-years-old Corrino line.  tl;dr: Idaho does die in the attack at the testing station which was Liet-Kynes' office. The Sardaukar grab his body, and then things unfold as Edric's ""presumptions"" indicate.  edit: spelling. It's early in the morning and I haven't had my coffee yet."

Frank Herbert mentioned no such thing in the book, but he didn't disagree with Lynch's use of the modules.  Thus, as Paul explains:   This is part of the weirding way that we will teach you. Some thoughts have a certain sound, that being equivalent to a form. Through sound and motion, you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs.   During training the word ""Maud'dib"" is spoken near an active weirding module and it goes off, shattering rock.  Paul muses, ""My name is a killing word.""  (Which is also a line from the novel.)"

In the book, IIRC, the ""weirding way"" was what the Fremen called the Bene Gesserit's prana bindu fighting style. It was difficult to translate her teaching them this mystical martial art form into the movie, so David Lynch came up with the weirding modules to play the same role in the plot."

I just feel they make it looks more like battle gear than survival clothing.  And to me the Bene Gesserit were also practical and seductive, with very distinct clothing that marked them as a ""witch"". A dress or gown that was sleek and sexy, but refined and classy, that allowed for full martial movement. Not this weird Halloween costume that gets shown.

To be perfectly honest, the only character I relate to in the first book might be Feyd, as odd as it sounds. He's fairly normal as far as characters go. He's an average teen boy.

dune,3c70z1,DontFuckWithMyMoney,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:19:00 2015 UTC,"Slightly misremembering it.   The way Leto puts it, an all male army will always stay at an adolescent state, which has always been historically true, including in the modern age. Adolescents rarely get to express themselves openly, including sexual forms of expressions. Male armies, being able to carry out their adolescent dreams out on the battlefield (basically playing out the archetypical hero) would self-censor themselves because of past expectations of adults repressing them. They were repressed and in turn repress because that is what is expected. In repression, resentment would bloom, creating a self-loathing culture built upon punishing, violently, those who question the censorship. It's psychological trauma past on.  Herbert wasn't saying gay army=rapists in the end. If he was, he wouldn't have allowed the Fish Speakers to express themselves sexually. Herbert was saying people who can't express themselves will turn to adolescent stupidity in the end.   A female army could be aggressive as males, but as soon as children were being had, they would mature. In maturing, they would understand why expression is important in young people. In allowing expression, Leto allowed those sexual energies found in younger people to be used up, which in turn meant they wouldn't turn to harmful expressions. When women matured socially and were put in charge, they would drag males along with them.   Of course, this didn't work out so well, considering the Honored Martys use of sex and potentially destructive behavior."

In reality they are the lovers, second halves, and mental peers of their mates. They're the left to their lover's right. The history books will be written the way they will be written; to make the best stories, but not to tell the full truth.  Jessica and Chani are, for all intents and purposes, the wives of the protagonists of the first novel. This makes them very important figures, even though they don't have the official titles. The story isn't about the line of succession, it's about the true nature of who holds power. Not the kings or emperors, not the guild or the sardukar, not the wives, but the fremen. The ones with the power to destroy. The lovers.  It's kind of similar to the end of Life of Pi in some ways.

dune,3c70z1,Flipyap,3,Mon Jul 6 05:40:46 2015 UTC,"The fact that the original Dune book takes place 10,000 years after frequently-referenced events, specifically the Butlerian Jihad.  Something about massive time scales in fiction annoys me, especially when the intervening years don’t seem to have the same relevance. The Butlerian Jihad was 10,000 years before the first book, and yet everyone knows it so clearly. But the between times aren’t talked about as much.   For comparison, the Great Pyramids of Giza were built around 5,000 years ago. While we still have some remnants of knowledge and the ancient structures, so much of the details of that time are lost. Plus while the ancient Egyptians are an important piece of early human history, there has been a fuckton of stuff that’s happened before/since then. So much to learn and to know, so many enemies vanquished, lessons learned, things feared… it just seems very odd to me as a student of history that the events of 10,000 years ago are so well-known, but the time between is kind of “then we built a space empire and shit was pretty dank.”  I understand there are going to be better records of the Butlerian Jihad than what we now have of ancient humans, but it seems a little far-fetched that after that amount of time people retain the same “fear” of machines they did. Obviously the people who lived before/during/shortly after the Butlerian Jihad were going to be damn careful not to mess with machines, but people 500 years later? 2,000? 10,000?   Consider how many planets and people populate the Dune universe. Earth has so much history that it's impossible for a person to know everything. The people of Caladan, Giedi Prime, Ginaz, Tleilax, Arrakis, Bela Tegeuse.... they all have thousands of years of their own local history. Even if the Empire provided continuity, there are going to be a lot of things happening. The fact that everyone seems to know of what happened WAY long ago and feel it's relevant to their daily lives is just... I don't know, unrealistic?  Organizations like the Bene Gesserit have long memories (obviously) but the vast, vast majority of the billions spread over all these planets won't. Given the huge scale of the Dune universe I can’t believe someone wasn’t like “eh these machines can’t be THAT bad THIS time, right?” In fact I think I remember the Ixians doing just such a thing (it's been a little bit since I've read the books).  It does also seem unrealistic that in 10,000 years, not one generation of Harkonnen and Atreides leaders said “it sucks what your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great granddad did to my great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great granddad, but that was seriously long ago and we both own a bunch of planets, who gives a shit anymore?”   This was made much worse by the Brian Herbert books, and is chiefly the reason why I hated them. Frank’s books alluded to a past where “something” happened- there was a Butlerian Jihad against the machines, there was a disagreement at the Battle of Corrino between the Atreides and the Harkonnens, the Ginaz Swordmasters were founded, the Bene Gesserit came into being,  but the details aren’t fleshed out. What “really” happened is up to the mind of the reader- a mystery that adds to the richness of the Dune universe, something that can make every individual’s experience with the books unique.   The Brian Herbert books tie everything up nice with a bow. Around the Butlerian Jihad all these things happen contemporaneously- 10,000 some years later this 10-year timespan is the basis for literally everything in the future? The Ginaz, The BG, Corrino, etc, it all happens at once. To me, it’s as if in Earth history there was this super busy generation of people that contained Jesus and the founding of Christianity, Mohammed founding Islam, the fall of the Roman Empire, the Treaty of Westphalia, the Colombian Exchange, the industrial revolution, and the World Wars all within 20 years. It’s just ridiculous.   It gets worse with the “Paul of Dune” etc books. The narrative in Messiah and many others is driven partially because the reader doesn’t know what happened in the years between. Fleshing out (especially as poorly as BH and KJA do) all the little “mysteries” makes everything seem trite and ordinary. It’s like when the Star Wars prequels explained that the Force is actually just a biological thing governed by little bacteria. What was once a supernatural mystery is now just some humdrum fact.  I know I'm being pedantic, but you asked.  TL;DR: 10,000 years is too long for things to be relevant, and Brian Herbert sucks."
dune,3c70z1,sdflack,4,Mon Jul 6 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the only people who directly reference those events are the ones with insight into their most remote ancestors' memories. Regular people don't seem to have any understanding of what actually happened back then, instead treating the lessons of the Jihad as their only commandment and everyone is familiar with it and has to obey it (at least officially) because the highest powers in the known universe depend on that civilization's technological stagnation."

dune,3c70z1,pennywaffer,3,Mon Jul 6 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it as Yueh's hate of the Baron Harkonnen overturning his loyalty to House Atreides. In medicine, one often hurts so they can cure - an example would be amputating a limb to prevent death by infection. The same line of thought, in the mind of a conditioned doctor, would apply to the world in general. To Yueh, treachery was justified by the higher goal, also beneficial to the House he served, of striking a hard blow on the Harkonnens. He didn't betray Leto to save Wanna - he always suspected she was dead anyway - but to have a chance at killing Vladimir."

And surely he could have gone about it a different way without ruining the Atreides.   It still doesn't change the fact that the Atreides didn't suspect Yueh solely because his supposedly unbreakable conditioning, which is clearly not unbreakable at all. So why would it have gotten that reputation for people to rely on?   Also, I never really got why a doctors specifically would require such conditioning. In fact, it sounds like it would make more sense as part of Mentat training. And your explanation sounds more like Mentat reasoning as well (which is why I wasn't surprised that Thufir ended up assisting the Baron).   On a side note, why goes the refrain ""a million deaths were not enough for Yueh""? Surely the slaughtering Paul and Leto II did on a cosmic scale shortly after was a lot worse and more memorable."

Tolkien's inspiration for the Palantirs was the use of telephone communications in WW1, which allowed for 'real time' decisions when in the past, intelligence was sorted manually and it led to a lag of response that made commanders pensive and certain of a course of action. With instantaneous communications, commanders got a slice of the situation and made horrid blunders based on how little they knew going on...exactly what happens to the steward when he sees the siege of Minas Tirith, or Sauron when he sees Aragorn. Limited perspectives, limited capabilities.  Also, the first Dune's endless passages about the desert often reeked of 'did the homework' writing. And Herbert I think, despite his obvious intellect, was a bit into himself, such as his 'hyper socially aware' people at dinner conversations making basic observations yet described as if they were prescient (as opposed to the actual deus ex machina prescience underlying the kwisatch stuff).  And Herbert never used one word where ten would do."
dune,3c70z1,OneMoreDuncanIdaho,3,Thu Jul 9 06:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think the thing that annoys me most is that the world and setting of Dune is superb, but the sequels seemed less and less interested in exploring the human drama that they so compellingly sold me. Instead they tended to inflate the plot to the point where the characters are literally telling the protagonists that they cannot comprehend what's going on.  When I starting watching HBO's take on the Game of Thrones, I was immediately reminded of Dune and what made it so successful. We see an empire of warring political houses, each vying for dominance. We see charismatic and sinister characters that we frequently change our minds about. We see a noble underdog pulled stoically into the undercurrent, and when he's betrayed, we feel incensed, and yet we feel compelled to watch as the powder keg explodes. But the important part of Game of Thrones is that these are all people with flaws and human motivations, and that's what the Dune series lost.  I really don't care about the God Emperor, I can't relate to him. I find the constant obsession with creating the perfect entity exhausting since its a constant power-creep, and the constant alienation of characters by turning them into omniscient and immortal super-beings just made me stop wanting to read about them.  I think it's ironic that beyond the original Dune, my favorite Dune books were Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's novels set during the young Duke Leto's generation. It was about people again, and political factions, and plotting, and assassination, and romance, and social classes. And THOSE are the sorts of things that made me fall in love with Dune to begin with."

The speaker and Leto meet out on the Dune's and discuss Leto's vision and Leto's plan, to which the Speaker adamently refuses to accept because of the human toll.

It went from being an engaging hero's tale with a unique culture to being books trying to make a vague point that's never really stated.   Also the whole Kwisatch Haderach thing. Paul is supposed to be able to draw on the knowledge of all his ancestors, but that doesn't make sense. It makes sense with the Bene Gesserit because they do the Revernd Mother transferring of knowledge. Btt their memories should only be able to go as far back as that knowledge transfer started. Yet Paul can fucking go back into our time and to ancient history. That's stupid.  It was kind of ridiculous how unstoppable Paul was. The first 3 books plots were just setting up insurmountable opposition, then him destroying his enemies anyways. Especially using Leto II's baby eyes to see where to throw that knife.

Just because a series is massively successful doesn't mean you're not allowed to complain about it. Asoiaf fans make fun of the series we love all the time bc it has some stupid shit in it but we all love the books and show still. Star wars has an extremely large amount of dumb shit in it but I still fucking love it.

There isn't an explanation. The women can do it because they share their memories. But.the men have never done that so it doesn't add up to me. You can't just claim he's right bc its his series.

Leto II and Ghanima didn't have memories transferred to them like Alia did, but it is mentioned that they were preborn due to exposure to crazy amounts of spice, and this unlocked their genetic memories. Same with Paul, albeit because of the combination of Ben Gesserit training and huge amounts of spice.   Also in reference to gholas, it's obvious that flesh and cells contain memories and in the reality of the book, these are able to be extracted through various ways. For the gholas it's to have them conditioned to do something their original flesh never would have done, and with preborn/kwisatz it's spice and/or training."

dune,3c70z1,derkaese,0,Mon Jul 6 13:47:47 2015 UTC,"I have been just starting the first book and I do have some things I don't like about it.  First, all of these strange language terms that are difficult to pronounce and I'm not sure what they all mean.  What really bothers me is the lack of imagery and environmental description. That would be my main complaint. Like this place is supposed to be futuristic but a room description will be like 'there is a table in the middle and empty bookshelf against the wall'. I am at the part where they first go out in the thopters and the worms are coming and am having trouble understanding what these thopters exactly are/look like.  Also, not really a complaint but rather I kinda think it's funny how at the beginning everybody is always noticing subtle stuff. Well not funny in a direct sense but it happens so often I started making fun of it with my friends.like,"" he noticed how subtlety the freeman was hacked to pieces that the attacker must be serious.""  Also, in I don't really understand what's going on in those fight training scenes. I don't think the equipment was adequately described and they just seem overall confusing. I like how fight scenes are described in books like the Icewind Dale trilogy. They are extremely descriptive in those fight scenes and you know exactly what's going on but in the scene(s) I've read in Dune I'm just confused because I don't exactly understand the weaponry or how it's being used. It's been a few weeks since I've been reading Dune so maybe I should go back and re-read those parts but that is what I remember.  Also, when I began it I didn't feel 'hooked' into the story as with most of the great books I've read.dont get me wrong I'm only so many pages into Dune I'm sure it will live up to its name but that's how I felt."

dune,3c37ay,IDKWhatParadoxMeans,12,Sat Jul 4 09:13:33 2015 UTC,"Hey,  it's also been some time since I read the Original series, so apologies if my answers are a bit rusty.  1) To produce spice just in case the transformation of Chapterhouse doesn't go as planned.  To make their own gholas (important minds, too valuable to loose, such as Teg or Burzmali) and be sure Bene Tleilaxu didn't tamper with delivered gholas (as BT liked to do).  2) Were they worshiping him as a figure or his transformation to a worm? This process could be seen by Tleilaxu as a pinnacle of genetics. Worms were, afterall responsible for the spice production (axotl tanks put aside).  3) They had extremely fast reflexes and were deadly hand-to-hand fighters. They were also able to sexually enslave men. In limited amount, Honored Matres had some kind of weapon capable of killing off planets without shedding a single drop of blood.  One could speculate the weapon was some kind of selective biological bomb, although no details were given in books.  Duncan was able to enslave Honored Matres back and also teach other men to do the same, pretty much giving means to fight back.  4) Not in the slightest. Honored Matres were actively pursuing and killing all the Tleilaxu to the point of almost-extinction.  The exact reason isn't given by Frank Herbert, but there are some ideas (which I don't want to spoil for you).  5) I don't think Leto II planned to create Honored Matres. As far as I understand, his Golden Path was to hold humanity in such an oppression and chains for as long as possible that when he dies (he knew he would), it would trigger the biggest exploration and expansion effort in history. Any organism, if held in oppression long enough, as long as its spirit isn't broken, will seek to expand with immense desire once the the oppression is gone.  Leto II wanted to make sure that humanity is large and broad enough that it will never stagnate (and die off) or that it can't be bonded by another Kwisatz Haderach.  Do you mean Idaho gholas when Leto II was the Emperor? Idaho has always been the synonym of loyalty and I believe Leto II was having Duncan around to keep himself human.  Think of Duncan as an anchor to the old times (before the Leto II's transformation)."
dune,3c37ay,Harbester,2,Sat Jul 4 12:03:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I have another question. Leto II wrote on Sietch Tabr's wall that a reverent mother (Odrade) will read his message: ""A REVEREND MOTHER WILL READ MY WORDS!"" How was Leto able to see this through his prescience if Odrade, an Atreides, was shielded from his prescience. It's the same problem with Teg. Realizing that he could see through the future via prescience, this quote appeared: ""He saw the necessity of it, though, as he saw at last the Tyrant's design."" So, how was Leto II able to see the fate of future-Atreides if the latter were shielded from prescience?"
dune,3c37ay,duncans_gardeners,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"In part, the inscription ""A REVEREND MOTHER WILL READ MY WORDS!"" is a compliment by the Lord Leto to the excellence of Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers. Leto did not claim to have foreseen that a particular Reverend Mother, Odrade, would read his words. To foresee that a Reverend Mother would read his words, he needed only to foresee the long survival of the Bene Gesserit school and the likelihood that when his message was discovered in that secret place, it would either be discovered by a Reverend Mother, or because it was addressed to a Reverend Mother, the Bene Gesserit would not fail to read it."
dune,3c37ay,impforpresident,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"In the fourth book Leto says specifically in his journals from Dar-Ez Balat something like: ""I have not looked into your far future.""  This statement is slightly dubious however, because it seems as if he at least knew that his journals would eventually be found, even though they were hidden in a no globe.  So maybe he just traced a certain amount of strings/paths into the future, or dabbled in the far future ever so occasionally when he got bored.  I think it's safe to assume he didn't know about the HM, however, because they are certainly a product returned from the scattering from which people were supposed to have been untraceable.  In the same vein I don't think he saw Odrade or Teg, or the destruction of Rakis, only that humanity would survive any events or people.  It's also all part of the magic of Leto; there is no telling what he had or hadn't seen through prescient vision."
dune,3c37ay,annieatom,2,Sun Jul 5 05:57:59 2015 UTC,"Is been a few years since I've read Heritics so I could be wrong but the B.G wanted the tanks so they could produce Spice themselves 2.I can't remember. 3. There true power was they're lightning speed and they're ability to sexual bond men to the  3. Duncan was a threat to them because he was able to use they're sexual bonding against them. 4. No they weren't  5. Let's golden path or his grand design was,in a nut shell, giving humanity the ability to be self relient. The destruction of Arras was necessary imo to get rid of the last Godhead,himself.  I'm sorry I'm on my mobile but if you want me to go into more detail I can. I'm the only one I know who's read the books so it would be nice to chat about them."
dune,3c37ay,BloodyNobody,2,Mon Jul 6 07:14:48 2015 UTC,"(3) Unlike the Bene Gesserit, they don't control from behind the scenes and they practice very little restraint. They're out in the open and ready to kick some ass if they feel threatened.   For example, a reverend mother might receive orders to imprint some rich guy in order to have his loyalty and his genes, then let him go about his business until they need him.   An HM, on the other hand, will imprint him and make him their slave.  Duncan was a threat because his genetic modifications by the Tleilaxu. Don't you remember the part with him and Murbella?  (4) No  (5) The grand design, in general, was the preservation of humanity at all costs. His sole role was for humanity to proliferate the universe. The HM were just a by-product of that.  I don't know about the Idaho gholas.  I'm not sure about the destruction of Rakis either, but it was most likely a means to make it less relevant. Humanity would either have to make due without the spice or create it some other way."
dune,3c37ay,duncans_gardeners,2,Sat Jul 4 11:20:26 2015 UTC,"In general, in the Dune series, it seems good to ask questions about meaning. So for example, what does it mean that the Bene Gesserit want the Tleilaxu axlotl tank? Ordinarily, the Bene Gesserit use strictly natural means of reproduction. This means their breeding relies on those who are acceptable to other human beings as human and who are at least crudely lovable. However, in wartime, in desperation, the Bene Gesserit become willing to use laboratory techniques to get human beings of the sorts they think they need. Frank Herbert shows by an example that when the survival of their way of life is at stake, human beings will sometimes commit acts contrary to the way of life they are striving to maintain.  Edited for clarity."
dune,3c37ay,G3orge11,2,Sat Jul 4 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"(5) As far as I can recall, Leto II's design didn't simply end with the Scattering (unrestrained expansion into unknown space). His vision was of the ultimate end of Humanity at the hands of an unknown ""great enemy"". Indeed, this was what the HM were fleeing, and why they reentered the Old Imperium.   The major theme in the Dune series is about preserving Humanity through any disaster. This was the reason for breeding Siona, as well as the BG's efforts to diversify the means of spice production. Without a KH, none of this would have been possible.  In Heretics and Chapterhouse, the BG had essentially come to embody the problems Leto II saw with the Old Imperium: they had become stagnant, entrenched in dogma, and incapable of leading Humanity forward. Odrade recognized this, and began her own scattering. This is why Murbella merged the BG and HM, though she likely didn't understand the full ""why"".   From what I understand, the two books after Chapterhouse explore the endgame, but aren't very well conceived."
dune,3c37ay,spoko305,2,Sun Jul 5 05:20:14 2015 UTC,"1) To make spice for themselves. To see if their long held conclusion that Tleilaxu women were the ""tanks."" To see if the Tleilaxu were using the clones from the vats to give them a semblance of immortality. To hold the secret over their heads.  2) All gods in all religions oppress their followers. Also, the BG implanted the idea of a Kwisatz Haderach in their religion a long long time ago. Leto II, being the KH would make him a god to them. The Missionaria Protectiva was thorough when they implanted their messianic patterns, and they all followed the same route. It's the reason why the Fremen followed him, as well as Paul, so vehemently. 3) They can enslave a person completely through sex. This was dangerous. Throughout the books, Herbert made it a point to note that humanity adapts. How would you adapt to a cabal of women who enslave by using sex? Stop being motivated by sexual urges, which would lead to humans no procreating. Duncan had the power to also enslave through sex, which meant he could teach other men.  The true power in the Whores was the power of a drug dealer, but on a massive scale. How can the addict deny their pusher anything? 4) The BT and HM were...hesitant allies. Waff and many other of the masters were slaves to the Whores, so the allegiance went to shit. 5) That's a hard question. First and foremost, the survival of the human race was paramount. In that regard, Leto succeeded. When the Great Famine fucked over the Empire, humanity gtfo and spread everywhere in the universe. They spread out so that no single hub of humanity would be  the only place humans could be found. That was his first goal. His second goal was to create humans that would physically be able to completely control their bodies. In that regard, he was only partially successful, as the Whores never learned how to control the inner workings of their bodies. They were fast as fuck and strong, but they couldn't nullify bacteriological threats like the BG could.  The Idaho gholas were meant to make a true Kwisatz Haderach. Leto wanted a human being like himself, but with so many relived lives that no other entity could take over. Effectively, he was Abomination proof. This also meant Duncan could interact with his Other Memory much better than Leto, Paul and the BG's could because they were all Duncan's memories.  In regards to making a human that was untraceable by prescient visions, he was successful in Siona. There would never again be another person, and later a machine, who could see the ""footsteps"" of someone who had the Siona genes. There would be enough of these people so as to render any future prescient messiahs useless.  In regards to Rakis, I think that was a clever ploy by Teg to stir up a fuckton of religious animosity towards the Whores. Also, people still revered Leto and Rakis was considered a holy place. This meant Rakis had to get nixed, or humanity would never grow the fuck up. It's like if someone erased the fuck out of Jerusalem. Jews, Christians, and Moslems would have to learn to grow the fuck up and get along because the biggest contention point they had no longer existed. All groups would be free to create their future instead of living in the past."

dune,3by2bh,targaryen3,2,Fri Jul 3 16:28:48 2015 UTC,How the hell do those contact lenses work? And what I actually mean by that very stupidly worded question is how do you actually put them in? Are they super uncomfortable?
dune,3by2bh,targaryen3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"Handy dandy instructional video that I watched.  Putting them in isn't too hard. You basically put as much as you can under your top eyelid, then pull down your bottom lid and tuck the rest in underneath, then blink blink and it settles into place.  Taking them out was a bit trickier for me. I couldn't just pinch them out like she does in the video, but by putting a little pressure on my lower eyelid, the contact popped right out.  They aren't super uncomfortable, but they are definitely not as comfortable as a standard prescription contact. It's not painful, but you're constantly aware that they are in. Granted, I only had them in for 30 minutes, so I didn't really give myself much time to get used to them, but from what others have said, that feeling of ""there's something in my eye"" never really goes away."
dune,3by2bh,targaryen3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:47:22 2015 UTC,That doesn't sound too bad. I've actually been trying to convince my boyfriend to go the Fremen route with me for Halloween but he's skittish about the contacts. How did you find them?

I'd confirm, but I lent my copy out some time ago and never received it back.  :/  As /u/nognus says, the story and the ideas that Herbert wished to convey are not finished with Dune.  At a minimum, you should read the first three books to complete the legend of Paul Atreides.  Children of Dune provides a launching point for you to get into God Emperor of Dune, which greatly expands the lesson Herbert was trying to teach us.  God Emperor forms the basis for essentially the second trilogy in the series."

The books cover a vast set of concepts, all of which are covered in depth and woven into a remarkable wide tapestry.  I dont see the dune saga as a couple of trilogies, but more like one unit broken into several large chunks.    I feel like the fourth book, God Emperor of Dune, is the center peice of the Dune buffet.  The first three books build up to the 3500 year reign of this ""Tyrant"", and the last 3 books tell the effects that his ""Golden Path"" had on humanity.  The thing is, Frank died before he finished the 7th book.

The NRA is part of Siuslaw National Forest and is administered by the United States Forest Service. The dunes adjoin Honeyman State Park.  The Oregon Dunes are a unique area of windswept sand that is the result of millions of years of wind and rain erosion on the Oregon Coast. These are the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America. Some dunes tower up to 500 feet (150 m) above sea level, providing numerous recreational opportunities including off-road vehicle use, hiking, photography, fishing, canoeing, horseback riding, and camping. The Carter Dunes Trail and Oregon Dunes Day Use provide disabled access for forest visitors.  In 1963, Congressman Robert B. Duncan introduced a bill to establish a National Park at the Oregon Dunes. It passed the Senate Interior Committee unanimously. Senator Wayne Morse opposed provisions of the bill that would have increased environmental protections by restricting property uses.

It astounds me, even now reading the first few chapters of the book, how you could take the writing of scene like this, give it to competent actors to act out perfectly 1:1 with the way it is written, like a play, and it would still be every bit as interesting to watch as it is to read.

But I really liked the miniseries and its emphasis on the politics happening at the time. So many scenes stand out to me, my favorite being the final fight between Paul and Feyd -- no music, no mood lighting.  Also, I liked the way they did the eyes of melange addicts in the miniseries more than the movie. Granted, I don't think that effect could have been achieved in 1983-84, but the Fremen, and Paul, looked so much more alien and ferocious in the miniseries."

Behind them the light grew in the East. As they walked they compared notes, talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their capture. No listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment and death; or that even now, as they knew well, they had little chance of ever finding friend or safety again."

dune,3ag1bm,watermanjack,0,Sat Jun 20 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest drawbacks of the movie was the weirding way, that was dumb. Really really dumb.   I disagree completely. The manner in which Lynch portrays the weirding way is actually pretty interesting and smart. He takes the concept that Muad'dib's name ""is a killing word"" (i.e. the Dune universe is set on fire in the name of Muad'dib's Jihad in the novels.) Lynch takes the idea that thoughts and even the sound of thoughts can be so powerful that they can manifest themselves as physical force if properly focused. In the books the Fremen aren't using sound weapons, but they themselves became the weapons inspired and focused by the thoughts and sounds of Maud'dib.   Now, in the book Dune, obviously the weirding way isn't used in the exactly same way as a weapon, but it is a weapon non the less.   I think Lynch did a great job of incorporating the general ideas of thoughts and sounds as weapons, even if the weirding way wasn't explicitly depicted as such in Dune. Not a dumb move at all."

In doing this they would also get the universe's most interesting no-ship as well (Miles Teg who unlocked superhuman speed and has Atreide's genes which are always fun, Duncan Idaho who has all the memories of every Duncan so.....10 thousand years worth I guess? You've got the secret jews which are bound to have an interesting story or two, you've got Scytale who is his own crazy sort of can of worms with that nullentropy tube, and last but not least you've got Sheeana who in addition to being a Siona descendent has the genes that let people control worms.) This no-ship is Frank's ending of the series. It's basically a way of letting us know that the stories are gonna keep going and humanity can keep expanding and living out it's dramas forever- that's basically the entire point of the whole series, a story where we try to make the idea of human extinction obsolete...Paul did this by setting the stage for Leto II (Paul could have done it, but he had Chani, and he couldn't make the sacrifice) to become the God Emperor who held humanity back so much and for so long that everybody wanted to leave the empire once he died. Not to mention he created a population of people that couldn't be followed with prescience whatsoever.  6,000 years later, the Bene Gesserit ensured (with the second scattering) that worms and by proxy Dunes made their way across the universe so that everybody could keep using the spice...without having to be dependent on the tleilaxu axlotl tanks that is, which is a good thing since they're ultimate plan was basically kill all powindahs or something like that.  Plus Sheeana's genes are bound to find their way across the universe at some point, so some people are gonna control worms, and spice like that.

I don't know how much this applies, but the Encyclopedia mentions:  ""Since the Guild navigators ""saw"" rather than calculated their routes, there was no need for the elaborate observational and locational devices common to both earlier and later ships. A heighliner carried a simple radar set and a small telescope, neither of which was of any use during trans-light operation. Thus heighliners traveled blind but for the drug-dreams of their navigators.""  And space flight was not quite instantaneous...perhaps the understanding should be that the navigators dreamed the path and then folded space...they then flew along the folded route.   ""The fastest known heighliner transit was made in 12717, from Ix to Aiglon, 8138 light-standard-years, in nineteen days, two hours, twenty-one minutes, forty seconds--a ""speed"" of about 63.4 Light-Standard-Years per hour.   So 380,400,000,000,000 miles per hour. Roughly.  I forgot about the alternate drugs. The encyclopedia and the timeline mentions no other drugs for navigation, but the Honored Matres and the scattering apparently resorted to a melange analog...some mention of it being a amphetamine as opposed to a narcotic? And that navigators of the scattering would probably have used that narcotic after Leto II.   The encyclopedia goes on to mention that the guild turned to drug navigation after the experimental flight in 84BG...secret voyages to arrakis were completed around 50-40BG and the Spacing Guild revealed themselves after securing Spice access on Arrakis in 12BG."

The trick is to know which path is the correct one for speed and safety, and that's where the prescience of the Navigators comes in to play.  Time may not pass between the points themselves, but certainly may while the navigators consider the next jump.  The idea is very, very old in science fiction (at least since the 1940's) and comes up a lot.  Sometimes it's computers that pick the path (Asimov's Foundation, Star Wars), psychics (Dune or... dammit, forgot the other story1 I was thinking of ), or the path was worked out long ago and portals are left behind as conduits (Stargate or Babylon 5). .   .   .   .   1 Story in which a psychically gifted individual pilots a ship through hyperspace jumps, in particular this psychic used a candle as a guide device for concentration..."
dune,39kas1,clintp,2,Fri Jun 12 14:46:30 2015 UTC,This makes about as much sense as any FTL-jump tech. But it does not explain why Herbert wrote about paths being traversed or Foldspace as a place.
dune,39kas1,clintp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"In most of the traditions of hyperspace and FTL travel, Foldspace isn't a place:  it's the state of the universe as it's ""crumpled"" and ready to traverse.   That sheet of paper?  That's the universe.  Normally it's flat and space-time is linear.  In Foldspace all of the universe is still there, it's just in a different configuration for the moment.   Traversing, jumping, and navigating Foldspace is simply crumpling the universe as needed and then moving from one point directly to the next.  Navigating (capital N) is the art/technology of knowing where it's safe to move from your current point to the next so that you don't wind up in a star or a black hole.  Often this means moving in a not-so-direct path to get to the target.  Fold.  Move.  Fold.  Move.  It's a storytelling trope that you can't fold space (jump to hyperspace, go to warp speed, etc..) directly from a planet. 1  The explanation usually given is that the gravity well bends spacetime sufficiently near a planet that this makes navigation difficult or impossible.  In Foldspace, I suppose most of the points near you would be the planet itself, making navigation difficult.  Best to move off and then fold space.  This all seems consistent with Herbert's descriptions above.  1 Somewhere Asimov has a good essay on why it's absolutely necessary for storytelling to not allow FTL travel near a planet.  Most authors seem to follow this rule."
dune,39kas1,daear,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"This all seems consistent with Herbert's descriptions above.   Not sure I agree... In Heretics and Chapterhouse, Foldspace is somewhere you 'go' - ships 'enter foldspace' and can even 'lurch' there. I can't see how that is compatible with foldspace being you crumpling the universe."
dune,39kas1,Laether,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:47:33 2015 UTC,"clintp is spot-on with the crumpled paper analogy, emerging near a planet, etc. I'm going to simplify and flatten things out to see if that makes more sense. We're dealing with theoretical physics, after all.  Take a piece of paper and draw a dot on one corner. Look at the opposite corner and place a dot there, too. Now fold the two corners together and line the dots up perfectly. Next, stand on the first dot and jump to the second. Even though the paper corners are touching, they don't occupy the same space, meaning you have to traverse a distance to reach the other dot. You have to jump across the space between the fold. (Foldspace!) The jump isn't nearly as far as when the paper wasn't folded, but there's a gap, and there always will be.  Here's how the process works in Dune:   Navigators ""see"" their location and stare across the paper. This includes looking ahead in time using prescience. Navigators place a dot on the other corner. The Holtzman engines fold the paper. The ship jumps off of the paper, moves across the foldspace gap and lands at the destination. The ship flies from empty space to their intended destination.   In essence, foldspace is a wormhole. When Frank talks about paths or courses, he's either talking about the physical movement through that tunnel from one dot to the other, or he's talking about the time gap that must also be traversed. Time is a dimension, too. It's no accident Navigators need prescience to see into the future before plotting a jump."
dune,39kas1,travia21,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"OK, this is quite different from clintp's description of Foldspace as not a place at all, but as 'the universe while crumpled'. If I understand you right, you are positing that the universe is crumbled to bring starting point and destination close, but that there is still a distance to be travelled between the two 'outside of normal spacetime'.  This gives us both an explanation for why the process is called Foldspace and why there is a sort of 'space' (also called Foldspace) which is outside normal space and time.  I like it.  Probably because it also still allows that in laymans terms (what we hear about in Dune through Children of Dune), this all looks like 'your basic FTL'. Sort of like light is both particle and wave, space travel is (from the outside observer) FTL with the necessary prescient navigation, while from the travellers perspective the whole universe is bent out of shape."
dune,39kas1,daear,2,Mon Jun 15 08:48:46 2015 UTC,"in this galaxy one instant, in a faraway galaxy the very next heartbeat.   Later in Heretics, he talks of Taraza's tiredness due to her long journey from Chapterhouse. There is definitely some inconsistency in the books."
dune,39kas1,watermanjack,3,Fri Jun 12 13:22:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think space travel is treated inconsistently throughout the series, and I prefer the less Sci-Fi techno-babble version in Dune."
dune,39kas1,daear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"Well, we do also know that one has to clear the planet before folding, so maybe a journey of several jumps do take some time to set up.  It is also conceivable that one would have to wait for certain other factors to align, before making some or all jumps.  But at this point we are trying to build excuses. And I do agree that the old 'version' is more interesting: You go really fast - instantaneously so, in fact - so of course you'd need prescience to guide at all."

dune,39evpu,-sgma-,6,Thu Jun 11 06:56:13 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, but maybe they had sublight travel (a la Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series) until Arrakis was discovered, and then they figured out FTL travel with melange. Maybe the slow travel speed helped create a decentralized feudal system, and House Corrino was able to eventually control Arrakis which led to them being strong enough to rule everything with the help of the Spacing Guild."
dune,39evpu,mouthbabies,9,Thu Jun 11 08:22:33 2015 UTC,I could've swore in the preludes they actually had thinking machines (AI) perform the calculations needed. Post Butlerian Jihad all thinking machines were outlawed but the pre-bene gesserit sisterhood maintained one for safe FTL travel.

dune,39evpu,RedMushtoom,0,Sun Jun 14 11:16:42 2015 UTC,Just because they wrote about something does not mean they have the faintest idea about it. My point was that I don't think they could be assed to check whether it takes FTL to go a particular distance over a set length of time.

dune,39evpu,mouthbabies,3,Thu Jun 11 08:48:54 2015 UTC,Didn't the books mention that ships without spice fueled navigators had a 1/8 chance of catastrophic failure? Good enough odds for colonizing but not good enough to sustain a trade network.
dune,39evpu,soylentblueissmurfs,3,Thu Jun 11 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"Spice isn't necessary to fold space.  Holtzman engines fold space, and they were created before spice was known.  Folding space was extremely dangerous before Navigators were a thing. There was something like a one in eight or one in ten chance of getting where you wanted to go (Frank never gives a specific number). The rest of the time, ships mostly just disappeared without a trace. Spice allows prescience, which is used to safely and reliably navigate from point A to point B.  I seem to recall Heretics of Dune mentioning generational ships being the only form of interstellar travel before Holtzman engines, but I can't seem to find the reference."
dune,39evpu,daear,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"OK ... but, doesn't ""folding space"" imply that you didn't actually move?  In other words, doesn't that conflict with the notion that to get from point A to point B you might bump into something between those two points?  To hit something between those two points, you would have to be moving.  I'm only halfway through GEoD, and I will keep my eyes peeled for this when I get to Heretics.  Thank you for keeping it on topic!  (that is, canonical)  :)"
dune,39evpu,daear,2,Fri Jun 12 01:01:01 2015 UTC,"Correct, you don't actually move from A to B, but you still have to find the right B by choosing from an infinite number of points in space. Imagine trying to fold space to get across town. You can't see your destination. Even if you have latitude and longitude, what if there's a car parked at your target? Or a person walks by, a butterfly hovering there, etc. Multiply that by the boundless realms of outer space and you can see that even one in ten successful jumps is a bit of a miracle."

dune,39evpu,travia21,2,Fri Jun 12 07:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the general (theoretical, mathematical) idea. More ships simply disappeared than wrecked, though. Pre-spice navigators chose their point B, but when space was folded, the intended point B wasn't where they ended up. It's like playing darts with your eyes closed with a moving board. Even if you're really good at darts, you aren't going to hit your target very often. Space is big and empty and full of unknowns.  That's why prescient Navigators are so good at what they do. They bring the x-factor that is consciousness to the equation. Instead of trying to account for every variable, every particle, every shadow of movement, they look through space and time, see/sense the target, and are all like ""There's our spot."""

dune,39evpu,Fenriswolfe,4,Thu Jun 11 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"Now is a good time to bring up the prequels (they really aren't that bad). According the Legends of Dune series:  Prior to the discovery of the prescient properties of spice, ships traveled really fast, but couldn't reliably warp because there existed a good chance the ship would hit a star or planet. In fact, in one of the big battle scenes, 1/10 ships in a fleet would be lost in every jump. Then the ugly duckling turned magical genie-like thing discovered that with a highly concentrated gaseous version of spice she could see parts of the future and use that ability to navigate ships in warp.  She eventually stopped caring about the way she looked because the only guy that liked her when she was ugly died an extremely stupid death. As a result, her body rapidly morphed into an even uglier form, thus becoming the first precursor to the guild navigators."
dune,39evpu,destructoid17,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"From the Dune Encyclopedia:  ""Interstellar travel was possible at least by 13000 BG, but not made reliable until 7562 BG, when IV Holtzman made hyperspace communication possible. In that year, his ""first pass,"" he revealed the equations for the one-dimensional incarnation of the effect, commonly termed Holtzman Waves....""  ""Navigation was, and is, and will no doubt always be the overwhelming problem in hyperspace travel; the staggering amount of data to be processed and the infinitesimally short time available for computation made pre-Guild navigation entirely the work of computers. Before the discovery of Holtzman waves, many considerations limited navigational problems to small and less powerful shipboard computers. Consequently, travel (and therefore trade) could not be centrally directed; organization of shipping and transportation was haphazard and desultory, carried out by companies that might be out of communication, in direct rivalry, or even in open combat with one another.""  To paraphrase the rest, Holtzman waves and Holtzman communication allowed for a central computer called Centrans, located on the artificial satellite Xenophon, which gave rise to loosely organized transport cartels.  ""When the Butlerian Jihad erupted, Transcom was one of the earliest casualties. Xenophon and similar facilities were obliterated, and the danger of depending on centralized data-retrieval was revealed: each cartel was fragmented, unable to navigate even in its own preserve. The cartels fell one by one as the Jihad burned across space.""  So, not until the Spacing Guild was established was ""unity within plurality established."" (or reestablished)"
dune,39evpu,corathus59,3,Thu Jun 11 13:45:35 2015 UTC,"To put it into further perspective:  BG is Before Guild. 14255 BG is the year the first atomics are used. In other words, Hiroshima, 1945. 14100-13600 BG is the Little Diaspora...the solar system is colonized. Butlerian Jihad is 200-108 BG.   First Melange-spice aided flight in 84 BG.  And Shaddam abdicates and Paul becomes emperor in 10196 AG.

Atreides attendants and their families, housed spaciously in the Palace Annex, number some thirty-five million souls   Thirty-five million people housed spaciously, and that's only a single portion of the city. If we say Pittsburg is a spacious city (arbitrarily) with a population density of about 12,000 people per mi2, that would mean just that portion of the population in the Palace would take up about 2900 mi2 or about twice the area of Rhode Island. This could be reduced by having very tall structures. If we say that the structures average 4 times higher than Pittsburg, we're looking at about 1.7 times the area of Hong Kong or a square about 17 miles a side of buildings on average around 100 stories tall.  Again that's nowhere near the whole population."

dune,38om63,Beerwithme,12,Fri Jun 5 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"Mostly spoiler free.  I'm just going to paste the relevant section from the Dune Encyclopedia first, then answer the questions that aren't covered here:   LIFE CYCLE A female worm reached sexual maturity after approximately 1,000 years of maturation, the male worm readied maturity after approximately 1,100 years. Mating began when a gravid female developed an egg sac in her reproductive segment. At that time, she chose a nest site and built a nest by raising herself to half-length height and throwing herself down to ""blast"" out a nest. This rhythmical thumping and grinding noise called a male worm. The Fremen made use of this fact — one could hardly term it a ""mating habit""— to call a worm with ""thumpers,"" devices which imitated the nestbuilding sounds of a female worm. The male moved rapidly to the nest site and devoured the female. Compounds in the outer skin of the female caused the male to become dormant for a period of several weeks during which he remained buried in the nest site. The highly resistant spicefiber egg case in the female reproductive segment was retained in the male reproductive segment, where fertilization occurred by an unknown process. After fertilization and possibly a period of development and cell division, the male deposited the spicefiber egg case into the sand nest, presumably by egestion, and left the nest with the egg case buried deeplybelow the surface of the sand. At this stage of development (schizontal) the zygotes underwent an asexual cell division producing a spongiform merozygospore containing thousands of future larvae. The merozygospore ruptured, releasing the sandtrout.   The sandtrout were efficient water scavengers. They traveled hundreds of kilometers through the sand seeking out water, joining their bodies with one another to transport the water back to the nest site. Many of the nutrients required by the sandtrout were breakdown products contributed by the female body. The sandtrout produced exoenzymes which digested the nutrients to fragments absorbable by the larvae. As the sandtrout brought water to the nest site, it mixed with the excretions of the larvae to form the prespice mass. The chemistry of the reactions has not been determined; however, it is known that CO2 was evolved and built tremendous pressures within the mass. When the pressure built sufficiently, there was a powerful explosion, often termed a spice-blow. All of the products of the pre-spice mass were brought to the surface of the sand, where the action of sun and air rapidly changed the pre-spice to melange. Again the bio-chemical process is unknown. During the ""blow,"" many sandtrout in the immediate vicinity were killed. Most scholars agree that the cell walls of these dead larvae were the source of the amino-sugars in melange. The chemical reactions during the spice blow triggered changes in the surviving larvae, stimulating them to join their bodies in a premetamorphic stage. At this point, changes in metabolism began, so that the combined larvae became similar to the adult worm. Water gradually became toxic, and rudimentary autotrophy developed.  The premetamorphic stage consisted of joined sandworms, each capable of metamorphosing into an individual sandworm segment. The metamorphic process took over 1,050 years. One segment differentiated to become the head segment with teeth, and another differentiated into the reproductive segment. Posterior segments were relatively undifferentiated and could reverse the metamorphic process to become sandtrout if environmental conditions were unfavorable to the adult worm. Most commonly this latter occurred in the presence of water.  The juvenile form of the worm was neither male nor female. This small (20 to 30 meters long) form of the worm was captured by the Fremen for drowning to produce the spice essence for their spice orgy. Most of these juvenile worms became females. The stimulus for development of a male is not known. One theory holds that subtle changes in the environment due to the absence of an adult male triggered the formation of a male, but this is not proven. Bach male worm had a territory of 300-400 square kilometers which he defended against intrusion by another male. Fights between two males rarely ended in death. The protagnists used their teeth to hook the ring segments of the opponent, opening the segment to the entrance of sand, causing irritation. One worm eventually became sufficiently uncomfortable to break off the battle and retreat. Although the fight was not directly fatal, occasionally sand caused sufficient irritation to allow entrance of an as yet undetermined virus, eventually resulting in the death of the worm.   The sandtrout interlock and encase water below the soil.  Much of the water of Dune was captured by the sandtrout and was still there, under the surface.  Water is poisonous to the adult worms.  This is the difficulty of starting the worm cycle on other worlds: you can't start with adult sandworms (this was attempted by smugglers during the early reign of Leto II -- to his amusement).  You have to start with an abundance of sandtrout and wait 1,000 years.  The metabolism of the adult worms was always left as a mystery.  An adult worm would only slough off the sandtrout making up its body if it died in the presence of water.(Leto II explained this at length.)    The spice is, essentially, a by-product of the clustering together of the sandtrout underground.  During a spice blow the larval excretions are pushed to the surface where sun and air converted this to the spice melange.  The spice was the stimulus for creating worms from sandtrout.  Speculation follows:  The Fremen indicated that where there is spice there are always worms and that the worms guard the spice sands.  After a blow, the surviving sandtrout use the spice to join bodies into a proto-worm.  The adult male worms may simply be guarding their offspring, keeping the spice available for them to metamorphosize.   Worms are territorial after all and little makers and smaller worms in the area may be their offspring.  Edit: remove broken spoiler tagging"

The name ""kangaroo mouse"" refers to the species' extraordinary jumping ability, as well as its habit of bipedal locomotion. The two species are:   Pale kangaroo mouse - Microdipodops pallidus Dark kangaroo mouse - Microdipodops megacephalus   Both species of kangaroo mouse live in sandy desert ecosystems, and forage for seeds and vegetation amongst the scrub brush of their native habitat. The dark kangaroo mouse is also known to feed occasionally on insects and carrion. The mouse never drinks water, instead deriving it metabolically from the foods it eats. The kangaroo mouse collects food and maintains large caches in their burrows, which are excavated to a length of between 3 and 8 feet (1 to 2.5 meters). The burrow, the entrance to which the mouse covers during daylight hours, is also used to raise litters of between 2 and 7 young. The pale kangaroo mouse burrows only in fine sand, while the dark kangaroo mouse prefers fine, gravelly soils but may also burrow in sand or sandy soil. Kangaroo mice are nocturnal, and are most active in the two hours following sunset. They are believed to hibernate during cold weather.  The kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats, which belong to the same subfamily, Dipodomyinae.  The kangaroo mouse features significantly in the best-selling science fiction novel Dune. The protagonist, Paul Atreides, is called Muad'Dib, a fremen word for kangaroo mouse.

The worm then consumes any and everything, metabolizing it into energy and waste -- the melange. When a worm grows to large to sustain itself, it begins to deconstitutes itself. This is the death, where it falls apart. All the Trout restart the cycle, and the melange is now concentrated. I would think the melange attacks other worms because it signals a place where there was a worm death, so small worms rush to absorb more trout. -- I would think when they're tiny they still have some capacity for this. It would also explain the deconstruction of death.  As for food, I always assumed they were geothermic or nuclear. I've never seen the worms as creatures, but as organic machines for Terra forming purposes."

dune,381olf,NoNations,18,Mon Jun 1 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"Quite a few reasons, I think - although it does seem naive.  First of, they are pretty good manipulators. Even in a feudal society were you marry for alliances and power, attraction and the promises of other, mysterious kinds of help are quite powerful forces too. I could easily imagine a petty noble marrying a Bene Gesserit and thinking everything that goes right is because of her, furthering the idea that marrying BGs are a good thing.  Actual help through manipulations, advice, truthsaying, etc.  Maybe an actual marriage is not that common. The Bene Gesserit as concubine setup is quite possibly the norm...  The Bene Gesserit might be scheming and somewhat untrustworty. But they do not seem to have ever betrayed anyone, or even worked against the goals of their patron's house - whether married into it, or attached as retainers.    It seems, and this might be the most important reason, that everyone trusts that the Bene Gesserit do in fact 'exist to serve'. Few are naive that they also serve their own purpose, but that purpose does not seem to be destruction of this house or that (or, if it is, outright betrayal or warfare is not among their tools of choice). I think the nobles of the epire know, that the Bene Gesserit are always also serving the goals of their patron houses. Not straying from this implicit (or explicit) promise is an example of the Bene Gesserit playing the long game, once again.  This would also mean that having a Bene Gesserit in your household - or better yet, married into it - is a sort of stamp of approval. A major house without a Bene Gesserit may seem to be out of their favour, and though noone can exactly see why or how, this may lead to their, if not fall from, then lessening of, power."
dune,381olf,lundse,5,Mon Jun 1 07:54:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is a great answer with many good points. It had slipped my mind to some degree that the Duke Leto didn't actually marry Jessica. The only 'BG-important dude' marriage I can think of is Count Fenring, who may have been beyond manipulation.   Wasn't the Emperor Shaddam also married to a BG though? I would think his paranoia would drive him to get to the bottom of their plots, may be he was being manipulated by Mohiam more than was revealed. He seemed to show no hesitation to go against her judgement when he first met Alia though. When he asked her if she could project her thoughts into others' minds I took it that he would have brought her into his employ if she convinced him of it."
dune,381olf,lundse,5,Mon Jun 1 09:07:51 2015 UTC,"I think you're right that Fenring and Margot had something more. I imagine he was party to quite a bit of Bene Gesserit thinking and plotting, maybe even as much as she was...  The emperor is a special case, I think. Maybe he is the only one 'offered' a truth sayer - and though Mohiam is not his wife, her help may have been predicated on the marriage nonetheless.  But I also think that the emperor was, not exactly a puppet, but thoroughly tied to the powers and balances of the empire. He had the Sardukar, but those were worthless without the guild. He had to keep the spice flowing, and he had to constantly play the great houses against each other (hence the starting plot point of Dune).  I think he was equally tied to the Bene Gesserit. The marriage and truth-sayers was their 'blessing' of his ascension and while it may not have been backed up by any formality, authority or threats, I think he needed it."
dune,381olf,lundse,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"Again, good points. I think it was hinted at that Shaddam shared some Atreides heritage, may be in the Atreides' style he ""bought"" loyalty from the Bene Gesserit through marriage. He would have been much more vulnernable without a truthsayer, which might be the single greatest tool an emperor could posses, ""this person is totes against you, this person is not."""
dune,381olf,BrooWel,2,Mon Jun 1 10:10:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The truth-sayer is probably the Bene Gesserit's most obvious advantage, and they presumably would only 'share' it with the emperor. This does, of course, increase stability - their own goal..."

Just like a noble could show that he was in the good graces of the church and possibly God, a minor or major house could show that they were a force to be reckoned with, since the Bene Gesserit deigned them worthy. While adding a bit of mystique and sense of a grander purpose."

These sandtrout would have a bit of Leto's consciousness as well.  Spice would again flood the universe, but not in the way it did before because...  Siona was bred by Leto so that she would be immune to the oracle (prescience) and would breed more humans that would be hidden from sight -- this is important to their evolution.  He back-bred his own line, the Duncans, etc.. for this effect.     Hwi serves to remind Leto of his humanity again in a painful way.  He honestly loves her and she has no guile whatsoever.  She was a weapon, however, and was bred for this purpose to see if Leto still had a vulnerability -- he did, love.  You did get the jist of it."
dune,380kx7,clintp,24,Mon Jun 1 00:02:13 2015 UTC,Right except its probably important to spell out that Leto knew he would die along his Golden Path but he didn't know when it would happen.

That was the point of Siona, to be immune to even his foresight. He built up his power and drew the strings of the empire tighter and tighter so that no one could kill him until they were immune to his prescience, which was his goal, and his death release the strings which scattered humanity across the universe to flee the collapse of his empire.

Bonus points for understanding that Paul, the original Kwisatz, saw what needed to be done, but because he loved Leto, Chani, and Ghani, couldn't commit to the monstrosity that he would have to become to save humanity from an extinction collapse.  Leto was going to continue to the point where someone was to kill him.  He bred his own killers, and he set things in motion so that the age of Maud'Dib was over, and humanity would be more resilient and less dependent on one fuel source for society.  Humanity had to be stronger, so it could not be extinguished by it's own devices.  That was the path."
dune,380kx7,BloodyNobody,2,Mon Jun 1 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"I understood it. In addition to the events you mentioned, it was mostly Leto rambling on and on and talking about The Golden Path (from what I've always understood, the preservation of humanity at all costs).   You have to remember that, like the first two books, it's an in-universe document. The introduction takes place around the time of Heretics of Dune; it's explained that the content (of God Emperor of Dune) is a compilation of Leto II's journal entries that he made with the use of his illegal/blasphemous Ixian Dictatel.

This book is more about Leto's philosophical ranting and teaching the reader and other characters about the Golden Path than it is about shit really happening.   It's so strange compared to the other books in the series in both tone and structure, maybe that's why I love it so much.

dune,37usfm,technotaoist,-3,Tue Jun 2 06:47:27 2015 UTC,"Dune is a cerebral, expansive series of books that require thought   I gotta disagree   Dune is a cerebral   Really? It's a bit obvious and trite. You see the plot coming a thousand miles away. Let's pick on a few things. Leto's death. There's no mystery to it. No subtlety. He raises the question of whether Leto will die, then hammers it home a thousand different way that not only will he, but that the story depends on it. Maybe there's some mystery over the betrayal? Nope. He spells that out early, and often. And these little quotes before a chapter. Sometimes they're so vague that you may go several readings before you begin to understand them. Other times they spoil a chapter so hard that it may as well not be written.   Yeah, there's some clever stuff in there, but there's also crap in there like Farok's arm in Dune Messiah, or the idea that in thousands of years the word freemen changed all the way to Fremen.   expansive   Expansive as in long? Or epic in reach? What do either have to do with whether or no there should be memes? Nothing. Star Wars is expansive, especially the EU. Asimov's Foundation is expansive. It just means that it takes a long time to read, and provides a lot of opportunity for interpretation.   series of books   And a movie, and TV mini-series, and computer games, and an unmade movie (probably several), and additional books that some people like and some not, and fan art, and homages, and short stories, and a biography, and unlicensed comics, and you get the picture.  Dune, as you so eloquently put it, is expansive. And again, that means that there are lots of opportunities for interpretation and for individuals to express themselves.   that require thought   Require? The plots are simplistic, and borrowed from common mythology. The characters are so wooden that you can tell how old they are by counting the rings in their cross section. Worst of all, as I've mentioned, is that he telegraphs everything. Every betrayal is spelled out. Every character is so typical that their actions are utterly predictable. It's like he's assuming the readers are idiots who won't understand.  There is one rule of writing that is broken at the author's peril: Show, don't tell. And Frankie tells, and tells, and tells, and tells. He gets away with it because of the interesting story he is telling. But if he were a better technical writer, how much better would the books have been?  I love Dune. I think it is a big, stupid, epic romp. Laser guns (sometimes), huge explosions, magic powers, super human abilities, giant sand worms, despicable villains, and so much melodrama. The musical score for the 1984 movie is perfect. (edit: Space witches! How could I have forgotten space witches. Space witches having sex. Space witches having sex to breed a super human. My sides hurt from laughing about how stupid that whole things sounds. And it's not even an original idea!)  I think that there is plenty of room for people to have thoughtful discussions about the parallels between CHOAM and OPEC. About his thoughts on ecology, or his disdain of religion. There's also room for pictures of Sir Patrick with a space sitar, or new wave musicians with crazy hair and no acting skills."

To you Dune is ""laser guns, huge explosions, magic powers and superhuman abilities"" and that's fair enough I guess, you're entitled to your baffling opinion but what kind of discussion do you expect?

dune,37usfm,lundse,-2,Sun May 31 09:24:13 2015 UTC,"For years I had a blind love of Dune. I still love Dune. I think it is one of science fiction's greatest works. But I also see it for what it is.  I saw the movie first, while still a kid, and enjoyed it immensely. It was beautiful, compelling, and had themes which caught my interests. I read the book, and later the rest of the series within a year.  I loved the movie. Which, if we're going to be honest, is severely flawed. It's trying to cover a 185,000 word book in 2-3 hours. It introduces some things that just seem unnecessary (weirding modules), and also some things that captured the spirit of Dune (the mentat litany). The acting is stiff. The plot is incomprehensible to many. It is made for scifi fans, showing almost no mercy to those not prepared to immediately suspend belief in certain directions.  I used to tell everyone to watch the movie. And they complained about it. They complained about this great work of cinema. This epic I loved. I referred them to the books, and they complained. Too long. Too trite, too predictable, too many characters, a juvenile understanding of politics, ecology, religion, etc. And they were wrong. All of them were wrong, damn it. But they weren't. I failed to accept criticism because of my love for the material.  I've worked as a first reader and an editor. I learned what made a book good, and what made it bad. I learned what books would be commercially successful, and which, while excellent, would bomb. So I reread Dune. And I saw the flaws. I also saw what made it great.  It is an epic tale with great themes. The environmental themes would resonate with people today. Its exploration of the problems of a messiah. Its struggle to create women of power in a male dominated society (it fails this point, but mainly because of the era it comes from, and the baggage that brings). The failing, corrupt empire, the birth of a new empire, soon as corrupt as the last. Political intrigue. Word sounds that feel great (Bene Gesserit, Muad'hib, Arrakis).  But there is virtually no way it would get published these days. Maybe its environmental themes would give it a leg up, but I doubt it. It has a lot of problems. People would, and do, tear it apart.  Dune's themes are powerful enough to carry it over its flaws. And powerful enough to make people not only overlook those flaws, but to pretend they're not there.  Stating that we should deny memes pisses me off because it is like claiming a certain sanctity of the story that it simply lacks. It is not a holy writ (though often it reads like one). It is a tale, well told, and poorly written. It is open to be appreciated on a wide variety of levels, from space opera to exploration of human nature.  But hey, I'll wait for someone who actually understands my post."
dune,37usfm,lundse,2,Sun May 31 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"There is no ""sanctity"" in discussing Dune. Some people don't like it, and personally I accept that. However, your opinion is, excuse my being honest here, ridiculous. ""Dune wouldn't be published nowadays"" you say. Well, ok. It's about forty years old now you know. What was earth-shattering at the time is commonplace nowadays , in part because books like Dune were written. It's like saying ""in a world where there is Game of Thrones, Lord of the Ring is ridiculously simple"". Of course, but there wouldn't be GoT without LotR, right?  Having read what is science-fiction canon and moving on to insanely complex words that are afforded us nowadays, sure, Dune seems simplistic, lackluster and formulaic, but it was one of the books that defined those formulas, so I really don't see what your point is.   With every single phrase and paragraph, you demonstrate you haven't really grasped what the books were about. You go on and go about ""women in power"" and ""ecological themes"", important points in the Dune books but nowhere near what the series itself deals with: destiny, predisposition, and the leader archetype. Frank Herbert spent the four first books in what is fiction's largest deconstruction of heroes, and your reading of his effort is that he wrote an alright spaceopera with ""lasers and explosions"", to quote you once again.  I fear you suffer from the misfortune of having misread the books and now thinking that you have grasped their true meaning, while the rest of us think of them as great books. Well, consider this; you have missed the meaning of the books and even though, in my 40s, I don't still think of the Dune hexalogy as the best books I've ever written, or even the best sci-fi books ever written, I also still think of them as deep, rewarding and thought-provoking. You may disagree and that's your right, but don't expect many others to do so. At least, try not to be condescending to others, saying you're looking for others to actually understand your posts, when you, yourself, seem to have missed the point of the books themselves.  Finally, I just want to say I agree with you on one thing. I, too, saw the film when I was a young adult and I loved it. I still do, even though gods know even David Lynch doesn't. In a decade that spawned sci-fi ""franchises"", it was a weird, unforgettable experience with amazing music and excellent visuals. I think the ""weirding modules"" were an awesome addition to the books, and I don't understand why the film, perhaps the best representation of the book on the big or small screen, is so hated by fans of the series."

Then I read it again later. ""Ecology is the study of consequences"" and we think Paul has won at the end of Dune, but so much torment - personal and to the universe - is the result. And this as a follow-up to book 1 is a bitter pill for those who thought the Superhero has won the day. Herbert wanted to comment on the consequences of putting all your faith in the Superhero -- even one as noble as Paul.  The jihad has spread death, and the religion has grown corrupt. Paul can retreat and be safe with Chani, or risk it all to try and weaken his religion. But can he go even further to save mankind - after all, it's bloody business, the Golden Path. (More on that in a Book 3 discussion.)  Hayt as a tool/weapon was a cool device, plus Scytale and Bijaz are very flavorful, and the rest of the conspiracy backdrop. But the inner conflict of prescience and rulership in a theocracy, it's cerebral yes - but it brought me into thinking about these problems - the oracle, the hero - in new ways.   I also think the series overall often has a lull in the middle/late and then a rush at the end where a lot of things fall into place - so I think it's worth going to the end from 70% in, but if you aren't so satisfied then, maybe pause before considering book 3 and come back later.

dune,37swq0,gonnaburnthem,2,Sat May 30 05:42:33 2015 UTC,"They are totally different. My progression was a lot like yours. Dune transported me to a different place and was hard to put away. Messiah feels a lot like weird fan-written playing with the characters, but my literary crush on Paul and the development of Alia as a singularly holy woman propelled me through the story. Children was a chore to get through, because the characters no longer had personality, only abilities. God Emperor took the life out of me, but the glimpses of Herbert's kinda crazy political ideals kept me going until the painful end. Toward the end, I was lucky to get 4 or 5 pages done at a time. I couldn't bring myself to start on book 5.   Dune might be best seen as a stand-alone novel. The others are just there if you want some follow-up information."
dune,37swq0,lundse,5,Sat May 30 04:49:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Dune cannot be considered a stand alone novel - though it would still be a great one if it were. Dune and Messiah were conceived together, as a whole.  Dune is a hero's journey and a fantastic universe that sets up a framework for Herbert's thoughts and ideas. Dune Messiah subverts Dune, making explicit all the hints they this hero's journey business is f...ing horrible.  Dune is a tragedy, but that point only truly hits home in Messiah."

The book ends with Paul on the throne with Arrakis under his control, which is really all we know about his destiny from the first book.

dune,37swq0,LalitaNyima,2,Sat May 30 19:28:14 2015 UTC,I agree with you up to God Emperor. God Emperor was great. The characters except Duncan were weak but I loved the overall plot. Some great quotes too. Also the first humor in the series which actually was revealing of the plot and Leto's experience.  Heretics made up for the previous three books and then some. Very similar in tone and language to Dune. Plots everywhere and great action.  Chapterhouse was stupid.
dune,37swq0,gonnaburnthem,5,Sat May 30 05:16:54 2015 UTC,"I came away from God Emperor satisfied for the most part. The way he handled a political system under someone like Leto felt cohesive and pretty believable. The histories and the political philosophy felt fresh and made me approach problems in governments in ways I hadn't done before. But the stupid love triangle and the self-insertion MarySue Duncan were too much. Once that was what the book began focusing on, I lost interest."
dune,37swq0,LalitaNyima,2,Sat May 30 06:20:00 2015 UTC,"Hwi Noree was silly due to lack of focus and detail. Oh Duncan loves her too. Whatever.

dune,37juu3,kengou,3,Thu May 28 04:45:51 2015 UTC,"It's a very difficult series to summarize, but I'll try for broad strokes:  A diverse group of pilgrims are on their way to the Time Tombs on the world of Hyperion and to visit the mysterious Shrike, a creature killing anybody near the Tombs.  They each tell their own stories about what brought them on this journey as they travel to the planet and then to the tombs.  Meanwhile, the Hegemony of Man is at war with the Ousters, another group of space-faring humans - and the war comes to Hyperion.  It's a series full of wonderfully inventive interwoven ideas, (fantastic) time travel, high-tech warfare, investigations into religion or philosophy, and over the course of 4 books sprawls across the galaxy and deals with the future of the human race."
dune,37juu3,pharmaceus,2,Thu May 28 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"No need to summarize the plot - it will subtract from the pleasure of figuring it out on your own.However there are principles here at work which might need explanation:  The first book is a soft sci-fi philosophical and contemplative story about many things human and not with a distant future as the setting. It touches on some fundamental aspects of life which are explored in the latter books and serves as an introduction. It is also several stories interwoven Decameron-style.  The second book is a conclusion of one of the stories and an introduction to the setting properly which starts the ""main"" plotline.   The third and fourth books are the conclusion of the main plotline and resolution to the questions posed in the first book.  It is something very similar and very very different from Dune. It also shares certain common elements.   The first book is also a work of true genius on the same scale as the first Dune novel ... and in some ways probably even more so. You'll find out.  There are few books which require reading in your life. Dune and Hyperion are two such books. Go! Read! Now!"

dune,37gdqx,Edrac,3,Sun May 31 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"Where in the audio book are you, like what scene? That might help determining if it'll ""get better"" for you.   One thing you have to realize is Dune is a very political book. There is some action later on, but it is not the focus at all. It is also, like you have pointed out, a lot like a fantasy story. The political structure in the universe is a quasi feudal one. Great houses vying for control, only on a galactic scale rather than on a single continent like A song of Ice and Fire. Actually Game of Thrones/ASOIAF is a good example of the type of books that Dune is like.  Personally as an audio book listener myself (via the audible app on my phone) I didn't really get into the story until you meet the Baron Harkoneen as he is conferring with his advisors. Granted, I had read the book in dead tree format in highschool so I was already aware of what was going on."

That's the scene where I got more interested in the book. Like I said though it is a very political story. About half way (maybe 1/3 of the way through the book) the story shakes up the status quo A LOT and things get more actiony for a bit. But for now you have a lot more world building and dialogue to go through.

Bought it when it came out. Very rare and known as ""Chronicles of the Imperium.""  Same company that made the CCG, I believe, and they re-used some of the artwork and added a bunch more. There's PDFs of the whole thing floating around, which might be illegal, but it's doubtful anyone is particularly concerned about copyright 15 years later for a dead game.  I ended up corresponding with one of the developers who sent me some unpublished notes for a supplement Arrakis adventure book, outlined campaign ideas, storylines, missions, etc. You basically play a House Minor loyal to House Atreides tasked with the grunt work of securing Arrakis, hunting for Harkonnen saboteurs, negotiating with smugglers, etc.  I still have it buried on my computer somewhere. I think io9 published the same stuff, but later took the links down. (Makes me wonder if Wizards of the Coast, which bought out the company years back, complained...)  But if anyone's interested..."

dune,36y7ha,Hoeftybag,2,Sat May 23 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"I don't care for rotoscoping, personally. I agree completely that Dune needs to be animated, but I'd sooner see a traditionally animated film. I think Dune would lend itself to a degree of stylization. I've said it before in this sub, and I'll say it again: my choice for designer would be someone like Mamoru Nagano or Peter Chung. I like the idea of the people of Dune, especially the aristocracy and the Bene Gesserit, being, like Nagano's Five Star Stories characters, slightly more evolved than current humans; lither, taller, more delicate (but no less strong), while the Fremen and the Sardaukar, having been selected for bodily strength and agility, might be more muscular than the aristocrats, with the Fremen moving toward slighter builds, with wiry strength and flexibility, as befits their life- and fighting style, and the Sardaukar toward stockier, heavier, more muscular builds.   The stylizing ability inherent to traditional animation design could achieve these differences, and also allow for more flexibility in showing character through design. No matter how an actor plays the Baron, for instance, ultimately it's just a fat guy on the screen. An animated design could be far more grotesque than an actor in makeup, or animation that is grounded by rotoscoping. Extremes such as the Guild Navigators or the Tleilaxu Masters could be better depicted, as well. Traditional animation designs could easily achieve this, as well as allowing for extremes of motion (especially combat mechanics), without the sense, that I at least get, that the rotoscoped cels are just laid onto film (which I guess, technically, they are), which takes me out of the film."

dune,36ikjb,OneMoreDuncanIdaho,4,Tue May 19 17:29:24 2015 UTC,I have wondered about this before as well.  Mods?  /u/Mentatjuice?  /u/telldrak?
dune,36ikjb,-sgma-,2,Tue May 19 18:35:13 2015 UTC,I'm about four chapters into Dune if you want to start something
dune,36ikjb,Takochu,2,Tue May 19 22:51:00 2015 UTC,I feel like a chapter by chapter dissection would include a lot of spoilers for the series. People are going to want to discuss forshadowing  and stuff.
dune,36ikjb,Takochu,2,Wed May 20 00:10:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't mind spoilers as I've seen the screen adaptations and sometimes idle in the wikis so it's mostly all revealed to me. Like I know what the golden path is, the scattering, the first mentat, etc."
dune,36ikjb,-sgma-,1 point,Wed May 20 00:22:03 2015 UTC,Simple - tag it [spoilers].  I would enjoy following a read-along.  Good luck getting the mods attention though ...

I would suggest using the glossary (if your copy has one) to look up some terms you find unfamiliar. There will be a lot of them. The glossary won't cover everything in explicit detail but you should still have a good grasp on what's happening.  Have fun :)"
dune,36i66a,subtle_nirvana92,4,Tue May 19 17:05:24 2015 UTC,It took me about three weeks to read the first 120 pages and three days to read the rest. My friend has been stuck on page 75 for like a year. He reads 1 page once a month or so -_-

dune,36i66a,softservepoobutt,2,Tue May 19 17:46:13 2015 UTC,A book about an oil crisis.
dune,36i66a,raviolibassist,2,Thu May 21 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"It took three separate attempts at picking the book up over ten years to get hooked. It's dense. Right away you're thrown into a vast universe which places, people and organizations that are alluded to but not explained. That was what was so hard for me was wrapping my head around all the threads and trying to piece the world together as it was happening to me. Frank Herbert has this wonderful way of writing that paints the scenes in your head like no other author, and for that I love Dune. Once you can really grasp what the hell is actually happening every page is an emotional ride."

dune,36g8xs,JackOH,10,Tue May 19 03:44:58 2015 UTC,"I watched this movie and didn't get much of a Dune vibe other than water is rare in a desert. Definitely go watch it though, it's fucking awesome."
dune,36g8xs,OneMoreDuncanIdaho,7,Tue May 19 05:20:20 2015 UTC,"But it's not that water is rare, it's gasoline. And I'm talking about the ideas of religious fanaticism, strong women, and character/world design. Don't tell me you didn't see the Baron in Immortal Joe."
dune,36g8xs,OneMoreDuncanIdaho,2,Tue May 19 10:41:22 2015 UTC,"These are all pretty vague though. They are similar in the sense they are religious fanatics, but their religions are totally different. I didn't get much of a baron vibe from Joe. Character/world design felt fundamentally different to me. But opinions aren't facts and I see where you're coming from."
dune,36g8xs,adyne,5,Tue May 19 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"That desert was gorgeous, especially the dust storm scene. Totally thought of the ornithopter chase in the Coriolis storm from the first book."

dune,36g8xs,PsychoFoxx,2,Tue May 19 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"If I squint really hard, and focus on the fact that people are fighting in a desert, then yes, I can make out a few Dune similarities.  Other than that, no, not at all. Sorry OP.  To each his own and all that. Regardless, it is a better action movie than most any action movie I can think of."
dune,36g8xs,King_Kangaroo,1 point,Tue May 19 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I saw it on opening night and whilst the setting, story and characters are wildly different; the atmosphere, the production values and the storytelling scope reminded me of Dune, 2001 or Ben Hur. There's an epic feel to it and at one part I turned to the Mrs and said ""This is like Dune or something!"""
dune,36g8xs,pharmaceus,1 point,Wed May 20 09:23:28 2015 UTC,"It didn't feel like Dune, but the whole time, having just finished the novel, I wished a great adaptation were to be made."
dune,36g8xs,Xanimation3d,1 point,Thu May 21 13:16:16 2015 UTC,"Fury Road is an extremely successful amalgamation of all the three previous films (most notably Road Warrior and Beyond the Thunderdome) into a single, well-paced piece. It's a great action flick which surprised me very much with its quality. But it's not very Dunesque - unless Dune is all about action with weird religions, rituals and desert in the background.  The one thing which I would absolutely agree on however is that both FR and Dune use extensively very strong and vivid female characters and puts them in context as elements of the clearly defined ying/yang or male/female dynamic.  In FR you have the destructive and tyrrannical males and creative and oppressed females. In Dune  you have.. well ... there's a bit of that too. The woman - the giver and shaper of life - and the man - the savage, destructive, imbalanced, aggressive animalistic and straight murderous element.  And it is interesting to know what motivated both writers to develop the themes. Dune interests me particularly because the super-human Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres are something quite unique... and Freudian  if you'd ask me. The world of Dune is far more radical in presenting certain ... I am not sure ""feminist"" is the right word but perhaps matriarchal (?) qualities. While Fury Road presents women as underdogs fighting under animalistic oppression - also partly by the religion of the main villain - the BG/HM are the Immortan Joes (not necessarily by motivation but more by style) of the Dune world.  Definitely something to do with his childhood and probably some personal (sexual?) elements :P. Think Joss Whedon and Quentin Tarantino."
dune,36g8xs,Xanimation3d,1 point,Thu May 28 22:11:40 2015 UTC,The Storm was exactly what i visualized the coriolis storms would look like. I mostly just walked out of the film wishing someone would shoot a dune film wherever they shot this. With the type of love that they put into FR. Cause it scream Dune/Arrakis. I believe it took something like 3 years to get all the vehicles and things up and running.
dune,36g8xs,BillionTonsHyperbole,2,Fri Jun 5 14:12:24 2015 UTC,Takes another 5 years developing real 'thopters. Worth it.
dune,36g8xs,S3nnex,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:17:50 2015 UTC,Completely worth it. I can almost see the Harvesters made with this style. ALMOST.
dune,36g8xs,ZloMoHoMo,2,Fri Jun 5 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"Genetically engineer sand worms and release them in australia. Wait 1000 years, then film it."
dune,36g8xs,Realik,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"I agree; there are definitely Dune elements:   Citadel as sietch;   scarcity-driven power groups;   specialty power groups responsible for a single product;   a fanatical cult whose structure extends beyond the legendary founder;   coriolis-like storm;   hodgepodged tech;   promises of paradise just over the next horizon, then that paradise ends up being just as poisoned as the rest of the world;   unwashed masses squeezed to the brink;   cloistered women hooked up to tanks in order to produce vital fluids;   harvesting of outsiders' water (i.e., blood);   private oases only for the one (or ones) at the top;  harnessing and direction of humanity's wild, feral nature;  hoarding of resources beyond what would be reasonably required for the leader alone, etc.  But then, these are variations of universal themes as well. I'm sure this movie, like many others, has been influenced by Herbert's writings. Dune is part of the western literary and mythological DNA."

dune,36fdye,raysweater,10,Mon May 18 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"I actually think Heretics and Chapterhouse are both awesome and, if anything, seriously underrated. I think the main people who are disappointed by the last two or three books are the ones who thought that Dune had to be about the Fremen and ecology of Arrakis, and weren't prepared for a storyline that focused more on the Bene Gesserit, the Tleilaxu, and the Ixians.  For those of us who were more interested in the psychological and philosophical aspects of Dune -- prescience, long-term human engineering, mind control, serial immortality, the hightening of human abilities, sexuality -- all told in Herbert's very sharp observational style -- then the later books do not disappoint, and give us a lot more to chew on. Hebert's writing is just as sharp, and the evolution/inside-look at the Bene Gesserit is really interesting. There's also a lot of really interesting intrigue with the Tleilaxu and other ""players"" -- not to mention plenty of action.  IMPO, Messiah and Children were my least-favorite books of the series. I've since re-read Children and like it a lot more now. Children of Dune is fucking metal.  What I would say, is if you are going to stop anywhere in the series, stop after the first book. Once you read to Children, you pretty much want to know whether the Golden Path succeeds or not, and if so, in what form. The answer to that question will take you all the way to Chapterhouse, and if you enjoyed the first three books, you'll like everything after."

Jodorowsky did not even try to claim to have any sort of wish to make Frank Herbert's Dune. He is fascinating because he is so batshit, and has far-out ideas. All of which would be horrible for Dune - at least, I have never seen anyone even try to explain how any one of his thoughts would fit Dune, and I think I could show how most of them are in direct opposition to the ideas and themes of Dune.  I am willing to be proven wrong, though. Any idea of Jodorowsky's you - or anyone - think fits Dune? Something that shows an inspired take on how to show a character, setting, theme or plot point?"

dune,3676aa,Uberbobo7,1 point,Sun May 17 04:51:59 2015 UTC,I've read various things stating that fans of the original series are not as fond of Brian Herbert's expanded series. Any (spoiler free) reason why?
dune,3676aa,Uberbobo7,7,Sun May 17 05:29:41 2015 UTC,"Where to start...  There's a lot of fallacies, pointless drawn out endeavours, repeated and dull character tropes and you see previously favourite characters to return for literally no reason except to have them in the story and they're portrayed in a very weak way. There are parts of the story that literally go no where and are left unfinished.   The philosophy and more heavy intellectual side of Frank's writing is not portrayed in the last novels at all and it reverts to a rather weak and hollow simple story telling that twists some cool characters in Heretics into impotent and whiny characters."
dune,3676aa,TheDarkNightwing,1 point,Sun May 17 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"None of that sounds appealing. One of my favorite thing about the book is how Frank Herbert has built his characters. It's so rare that you find a book that has strong and dynamic characters throughout the story. I have read a couple places that have said Brian Herbert has turned the expanded universe into nothing more than a generic ""page turner"". It is rather unfortunate to hear that his son lacks the vision his father had for one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written.   I recently purchased ""The Dune Encyclopedia"", for my own exploration, and found out that it will probably never be reprinted again because it is no longer ""canon"" to the story. To me, that sounds like a very unfortunate and poor decision.   With all that being said, I will still probably read expanded Dune because I'm a completionist and I want to explore more of the universe."

If the identification is accurate, this would place the oldest memory at 23rd century BCE.  This is not to say that it can't go back further.

dune,35yesh,Tony_Chu,2,Thu May 14 20:19:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not the old timer that you are looking for, but wanted to share my two cents regarding your follow up question:  I don't believe that Frank was being as specific as particularly warning about the impending oil crisis, but I do think that it is an example of a more general ecological principle that he was clearly trying to communicate with that book and the series.    A common theme in Dune seems to be to draw parallels between resource economy in human politics with competition for ecological resources in nature.  It's almost like he was trying to remind us that we are still animals as much as we pretend otherwise.    When oil is gone there will be something else that we compete to control, and there will rise up structures of power which leverage their control over this resource to influence the world in their favor.  As sophisticated as these political machinations might seem, they have at their core the same essence of a bunch of monkies fighting over a banana tree.  I think that Frank was acknowledging this universal truth more than he was specifically talking about oil - though a dessert resource exploited by foreigners who don't understand the customs of the locals who have their own agenda does seem like a strikingly direct parallel."
dune,35yesh,Realik,1 point,Thu May 14 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Great insights- I agree completely!  Just one more point in your metaphor- a desert resource that the entire race depends on for transportation.  Also, I did a bit more reading and learned that Frank once wrote in an article that CHOAM is a metaphor for OPEC.   ""Few products escape the CHOAM touch ... Logs, donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur — the most prosaic and the most exotic ... even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richese and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties ... But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product — the spice. Imagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production. — Duke Leto Atreides, Dune"
dune,35yesh,shitcock55,0,Fri May 15 12:12:45 2015 UTC,I think linking Dune and oil is rather small minded. Leto would mock it
dune,35xzyy,HAL4294,17,Thu May 14 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting question. I don't have any answers, but a few observations:  First, coffee only ""dehydrates"" you in the sense that it's a diuretic. It makes you pee. If you're wearing a stillsuit, or are in a sietch, the water isn't actually lost to the tribe.  Secondly, coffee was introduced to Europeans via the Arabs, and was/is consumed by the bedouins and other desert-dwelling people here on Earth. So if you're writing about a desert culture in science fiction and want to introduce a familiar beverage, coffee has the right associations."

Why wouldn't a precious part of everyday life be preserved over time despite all the fractious changes in humanity?  Additionally, coffee has been shown to be just as hydrating as drinking water, and I have to agree with the folks here who brought up the stillsuits and the sietches."
dune,35xzyy,booszhius,4,Thu May 14 18:02:12 2015 UTC,Coffee doesn't dehydrate you.  It just hydrates you less than water.

Others may be able to give better more intelligent and  grammatically correct reaponses.  They mention coffee service as hierlooms I believe a few times.  Paul wins it during his first fight to the death.  Maybe its like giving water to the dead, or like when the fremen spat at the feet of duke leto.  Maybe the known aspect of dehydration effects of the coffee are why its so special?  I believe the seitchs are also hermetically sealed so no moisture is truly lost where the coffee is consumed?"
dune,35xzyy,onihr1,12,Thu May 14 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"You're either in the seitch or in a stillsuit, so the diuretic effect isn't worth worrying about, since you'll just reclaim the moisture.   Also the diuretic properties of coffee are greatly overstated. The reason you have to go to the washroom after drinking two cups of coffee has more to do with the 24 oz of water you just drank than the 300 mg of caffeine."
dune,35xzyy,moosekayak,5,Thu May 14 14:42:48 2015 UTC,"Tacking on to the other comments about other comments here about the diuretic effects, it's conceivable also that the coffee in question was not real coffee (or at least not 100% pure coffee).  If I recall correctly, the drink is always (or almost always?) defined as ""spice coffee"".  Many cultures here on earth will substitute chicory for at least a portion of their coffee because of the high cost of real coffee beans.  It's entirely possible that the Fremen ""spice coffee"" is actually made of mostly melange (perhaps roasted in some fashion to give it a more coffee-ish flavor?)."
dune,35xzyy,albebop,6,Thu May 14 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"I think you've hit the nail on the head. It also seems unlikely coffee would grow on Arrakis, or that the Fremen would somewhat regularly consume an off world product that is potentially a luxury. I suspect it has more to do with spice, roasted spice, and perhaps other ingredients."
dune,35xzyy,nitroswingfish,2,Thu May 14 15:55:04 2015 UTC,God Emperor mentions beans being grinded. So it's probably beans and spice. I'd imagine the end result would be very thick.

Does that make me a bad person? Maybe. But those books are freaking awful."
dune,35vkp5,marmite1234,0,Thu May 14 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for the sequels, though if you want to read them I guess you could go for it. Personally I stopped Dune-ing for a while so I could read William Gibson's Neuromancer."
dune,35ugjb,mcapello,6,Wed May 13 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of ideas I've kicked around as to what the looming threat uncovered in The Scattering could be.  The first idea would be what Brian & Kevin wrote about - the thinking machines coming back to settle the score with humanity.  I'm not talking about Omnius and Erasmus or any of the stuff they wrote about in the Legends of Dune series.  Just the thinking machines in general.  I don't think Frank ever wanted to anthropomorphize this enemy, especially considering how special he makes humanity out to be in the universe he created.  My main reasoning behind this theory lies in the weapons the Honored Matres stole from the enemy as they were retreating.  The weapon they ended up using against the BG assault force on Junction reminds me a lot of a neutron bomb.  It's a type of atomic weapon that releases neutrons instead of splitting an atom in a fission bomb, or fusing two hydrogen atoms together like in a thermonuclear device.  The advantage of a neutron bomb is that the radiation only affects living tissue, and would leave any infrastructure in place for the conquerors to take over.  This is almost exactly how the weapon is described - leaving a bunch of bloodless bodies strewn across the ground in its wake.  The other idea that is supported a bit more in the text focuses around Daniel and Marty, the two advanced Face Dancers who were trying to capture Duncan Idaho in their tachyon net.  I think the lost Tleilaxu sent into The Scattering ended up creating these Face Dancers and lost control of them, eventually leading to them seizing power in that part of the universe.  It's sort of hinted at in Heretics that the Tleilaxu in the Old Empire were very close to developing the same thing with their improved Face Dancers.  Remember the Face Dancer that Waff put in Tuek's place absorbs Tuek's memories and falls into the role of thinking he's actually Tuek.  Waff is outraged that the Face Dancer is not obeying his commands.   The Advanced Face Dancers out in The Scattering, being created by the lost Tleilaxu would also learn the ways of genetic manipulation from their former masters.  They ended up using this knowledge to create the Futars, who were used to hunt down and kill Honored Matres.  There's evidence that they're genetically engineered as they have both feline and human features, and genetic manipulation in the Dune universe typically involves the dirty Tleilaxu.    The second theory really banks on the idea that Daniel and Marty are in fact advanced Face Dancers and not something else entirely.  There's an idea that D&M were written by Frank to represent himself and his wife, Bev.  But personally I believe both of those things can be true - there's a lot of textual evidence in their conversations in the final chapter that really solidifies the idea that they are Face Dancers.  That doesn't preclude Frank from adding them into the story to represent him and his wife, though.  So to sum it up, the enemy could have been either thinking machines or advanced Face Dancers.  Either of which could have made for a good story if written the proper way.  Both of which were used by Brian & Kevin in Hunters and Sandworms which personally to me, felt completely forced, and really undersold the idea of the Advanced Face Dancers being their own independent beings, instead of being slaves to Omnius and Erasmus."
dune,35ugjb,stovor,2,Wed May 13 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point about the neutron bomb -- although didn't the weapon on Junction only affect the BG and not the Honored Matres?  Also, the weapons used by the HM's to destroy Arrakis were of a different type, more like a conventional nuclear weapon, except much more powerful.  I suppose one day we may know. FH left a detailed outline, I'm not sure if anyone knows how faithfully BH followed it (not very closely, I hope).  I would be very curious to know what FH intended for Idaho, the Jews, and the genetic information they carried.  The Futars themselves are interesting. Why engineer a creature designed to hunt Honored Matres? Selectively culling them suggests a desire to maintain unaffiliated human populations intact -- which doesn't jive with the idea of human extinction. So perhaps the AFD's and the ""enemy"" are distinct."
dune,35ugjb,stovor,1 point,Wed May 13 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"didn't the weapon on Junction only affect the BG and not the Honored Matres?   I don't think it only affected the BG.  I thought Teg remarked that there were dead HM and BG everywhere, yet no blood.  Though if it did only kill the BG, it probably had something to do with the weapon being a directed neutron emitter or something like that, where the neutrons are only released in an arc in front of the weapon's user.  It's been a little while since I finished my last re-read of Chapterhouse, so I am a little iffy on the exact wording of that passage.  Once I finish up Stephen King's The Dark Tower series (I only have the last book left!) I'll probably come back to a re-read of the 6 Dune novels.   Also, the weapons used by the HM's to destroy Arrakis were of a different type, more like a conventional nuclear weapon, except much more powerful.   Yeah, the weapons they used to destroy Dune certainly seemed like high yield atomics, likely a bunch of thermonuclear devices.  Possibly sent down beneath the crust of the planet, since it seemed like the whole planet cracked instead of just being turned to glass.   I would be very curious to know what FH intended for Idaho, the Jews, and the genetic information they carried.   Me, too!  Duncan's the main character of the whole series.  It only took me until Heretics to figure that out.  I'm sure they still had some part to play in the big scheme of things.  I do wonder though if the nullentropy capsule that Scytale had was nothing but a red herring, or a MacGuffin to advance the plot.  My personal feeling is that the Jews really didn't have much of a role to play after getting the Lampadas memory horde (including Lucilla's memories) back to the BG.     The Futars themselves are interesting. Why engineer a creature designed to hunt Honored Matres? Selectively culling them suggests a desire to maintain unaffiliated human populations intact -- which doesn't jive with the idea of human extinction. So perhaps the AFD's and the ""enemy"" are distinct.   My headcanon on the Futars being created by the Face Dancers has to do with the way the Honored Matres utilize sexual enslavement to dominate the male populations they encounter.  Face Dancers being asexual beings could possibly consider that offensive.  The Tleilaxu also weren't huge fans of sexual intercourse, preferring to procreate via artificial insemination of axlotl tanks.  There could be a bit of that influence still remaining in the Advanced Face Dancers.  Your point on selectively culling parts of humanity not meshing with the idea of extinguishing humanity is a good idea.  Consider this: is the enemy's end goal really extermination?  I think it could be domination and enslavement of humanity instead of outright extinction of the race."

dune,35ugjb,stovor,2,Wed May 13 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"Actually a neutron bomb will irradiate everything, living or not.  And bombarding something, like say a building, with neutrons not only irradiates it, it will become radioactive itself.  I've never understood the purpose of a neutron bomb.  Yes, you won't destroy everything outright through the pressure wave and heat, but what good is a city that still stands when everything around you is emitting radiation, making it unlivable anyway."
dune,35ugjb,TheFlyingBastard,2,Wed May 13 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, the radiation would be everywhere! On Earth, it would be unlivable for a period of time until the radiation decays enough for it to be safe for living creatures again.  I guess it is more of a long-term plan like, ""let's leave all these sweet factories and roads and bridges, etc. standing instead of destroying them so once the radiation is gone we can come in and not have to rebuild everything.""  In the context we're talking here, the radiation is a moot point.  Thinking machines wouldn't be harmed by any residual radiation, and they'd still have all of the infrastructure in place on the planet they're conquering, with the added bonus of having no pesky humans around to ruin their plans."

dune,35ugjb,TheFlyingBastard,5,Wed May 13 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"Since Frank himself didn't write much on the jihad, we don't have a whole lot of information to go off.  I've read Frank's books a ton of times and don't recall any description of the machines as looking like humans, or even acting like humans.  We see them described as ""conscious robots"" but that could be a bipedal ""Terminator"" type robot, or a robot dog.  We really only have the commandment in the OC Bible: ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of the human mind.""  Then again, in God Emperor of Dune Leto II talks about the jihad and discusses how it was more of a war against a machine mentality that humans were falling into.   ""The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,"" Leto said. ""Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.""   So we really don't have anything concrete to go off, and in fact we have straight up conflicting answers in the text, unless we go to the Brian & Kevin books which this post was discounting."

It seems perfectly engineered -- a cast of complex characters, unspecified dangers, and built-in plot elements like Scytale's genetic treasury -- to be a plot driver of a sequel.  Same thing with Murbella. We see her developed as a character throughout the book and then thrust into a very precarious leadership position at the end. Why develop her character to that extent and put her in that situation if it's not meant to be explored?"

I've been able to accept that Chapterhouse is an ending, but when I had heard about the supposed notes and outline Brian found (back when I was a young high schooler 15 years ago), I always just thought that Frank definitely wanted to write a seventh novel.  But the way you worded this specific passage   The no-ship and the inhabitants of it were a gift to the imaginations of the fans who'd made it that far. We can project whatever we like onto that unfinished universe. It fits very nicely into the overall theme of the books. Rather than rely upon a god-like, dictatorial, author to tell us how it is; we get to throw off his authority and imagine it for ourselves.   really made me do a 180 on my thinking.

Nothing you say here resolves anything specific I referred to, but are the most general possible statements about what we already know.  There is a massive difference between leaving an ambiguous ending for readers to ponder and find meaning in, and creating a whole array of clear and specific plot devices clearly designed to propel a sequel."
dune,35ugjb,krakken86,2,Thu May 14 13:44:20 2015 UTC,"I've made some of this comment before, and there's some far-reaching assumptions, but here it goes. In GEOD, Leto alludes to an intelligence or some machine that will be a threat. So, as far as I'm concerned, between the cyborging coming back, gholas running everywhere, and Honored Matres terrified, I think there might be some machine threat, but in no way like the BH/KJA books.  On another note, I like the concept that the titles are symmetrical. One word, two words, three, four, three, two, and I would think the final book would have been ""Dunes,"" alluding to the case that it will be necessary to populate more planets with worms, almost like a second scattering, but for spice.  I'm sure Duncan was going to be the ultimate hero, and he was probably part of the point of the Golden Path the whole time.   Retconning Erasmus and all that was so bizarre and it didn't fit in. Other Memory would have supplied some back story and explain the depth of the threat, and I'm sure FH would have found a way to make it work."
dune,35wmvu,Sazereak,4,Thu May 14 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"The simple answer to this is data. Mentats need data to function, and for something like this, they would need vast amounts of it. Even for a simple fold you'd need every single variable between the ship's location and its destination, maybe even down to the movement of particles. Gathering that for all of known space and keeping it up to date would be impossible. Even the best mentats wouldn't be able to make sense of it. It's just too massive.  Navigators get around this limitation by using prescience. They aren't assembling a bigger picture from small points of data, they're looking at the picture from beyond the picture's point of view. An analogy would be writing a script to drive a toy car across your house. You'd spend weeks plotting a precise path for it to take, avoiding every bump in the carpet, every wall, every corner. Even then, what if your cat jumps in the way? Crash. A better alternative is just picking up the car, looking across your house, and walking. Cat's in the way? Go around it.  This ties back to one of Dune's core themes of man vs. machine. With the right training, we can always outperform a computer.  Edit: It's worth noting that the Ixians do develop a machine replacement for Navigators in one of the later books. This is thousands of years after the events of Dune, so you see how difficult it must have been, not to mention the extraordinary taboo of making a machine like that."
dune,35wmvu,daear,2,Thu May 14 15:20:10 2015 UTC,"To further your point of data by a physics argument:   Even if they've had all the data needed (like position of every planet, asteroid, sun, all their masses etc.) they would need to calculate where everything is after the jump (assuming the jump isn't instatanous but if it would be instatanous why would you need prescience?) and that is analytically impossible (as it is a problem with too many objects (even our solar system is only solved numerically)).  So the task of the mentat's would've been to give a numerical solution to all these problems (every sun creates a new problem) and solve them simultaneously. And they would need to be pretty precise about the solution too. It would just take far too long for any computer (and therefore also a mentat) to solve these problems."
dune,35wmvu,Ortopox,1 point,Thu May 14 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm actually not sure how long the fold/jump takes. I'm assuming it's instantaneous, or at least preceptively so. (Folding space also folds time, I presume?) Prescience is still useful because paths have to be chosen before ""travel"" takes place. The Holtzman drive actually folds space, but it does so blindly, hence the Navigator."

dune,35wmvu,daear,1 point,Fri May 15 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"The Holtzman engines are what actually fold space, so there can be travel without Navigators at the helm. It's extremely dangerous to do, however, with something like one in ten ships disappearing without a trace. I seem to recall it being unreliable as well, like ships would appear far away from their intended destination."
dune,35wmvu,Yohfay,3,Sat May 16 01:52:28 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to an issue of efficiency. It's way more efficient to look slightly into the future and see if you're going to collide with anything when you fold space a certain way than to compile a very accurate, constantly updated map of known space, account for all orbits, asteroids, and other movements, and do complex physics calculations to figure out whether you're going to collide with something when you fold space a certain way.   It's not that you can't fold space without spice prescience. It's that the spacing guild holds a monopoly on space travel because they do it better than anyone else."

I'm not sure how I'd feel about seeing that inserted into a series that seems so perfectly balanced with what it delivers in the first place.  Nudity wouldn't be necessary or even likely helpful, but I don't see HBO picking up Dune without finding some unnecessary way of dressing people in their birthday suits, and I say this as someone who likes looking at nekked people.

Humanity has moved on, thousands of years after being released from the grip of a giant tyrannical sandworm/human hybrid. There's a new power struggle between the various factions that remain and those that have sprung up out of the scattering. The sexy Honored Matres, the devious face dancers instilling fear everywhere. Not to mention the dramatic way the book pans out and how Miles Teg fulfills his destiny.   It pains me to say it, but the events of God Emperor could be comfortably summarised in a couple of flashbacks. I'm imagining something of the lines of the way the premise for Terminator is set up, and other similar postapocalyptic movies.  It seems like blasphemy, but Dune and the legacy of Paul could be summarised in just a few sentences, much in the same way that the Butlerian Jihad was addressed/implied in Dune itself. I think with the right script, it could set up the standalone movie wonderfully without detracting from the source material.   Heretics is a great and exciting little story with so much content that could really translate well onto film. It would probably end up being a cross between Game of Thrones and the Matrix if Hollywood got its mitts on it, but I would love to see it!"

Much as I would want a faithful God Emperor movie, it would take some kind of genius director and art team to even begin to show a lot of the introspective content.  Heretics does indeed provide a lot of action, sexiness and character development to make a good movie, and I like to think that Chapterhouse would make a good sequel (but then there would be clamoring for a third to make the trilogy and I fear that way lies great disappointment)."

It'd be mostly dialogue, introspection, etc. It's an interesting book, but it's something you should read - visuals add very little and it would definitely not grab the attention of most people.  I'm still going to have to say the first book. Dune has a great mix of adventure and exploration, but I wouldn't say it could be one movie. It'd have to be a trilogy or something.  Messiah and Children of Dune would be great for a series spanning multiple seasons.

GEoD's strength is the paradox between Leto's tyranny and his internal suffering. The actual meat of the material is in the dialogue. Someone comes in, talks, leaves. Then someone else comes in and talk. People take turns talking. It's a lot of talking, both between characters and inner monologues. Holy shit, Leto talks so much to himself.  We as fans might appreciate it, and we'd adore this shot or that shot and oh, the D-wolves look exactly as we thought, but a movie can't just use fanservice to cater to such a small crowd and leave it at that. I'm just trying to look at it from the perspective of the general audience, one that is not already emotionally involved or ready to see a chick splooge after seeing Duncan reach the top of a tall cliff, you know what I mean?"
dune,35tqnk,AnoArq,2,Wed May 13 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"None of them.  The books work well as a medium that is READ, not a visualized medium.  The themes are simply too wide and too deep for movie and TV.  That said, fan fiction could work great.  For example: Start a story about 1000 to 500 years before GEoD.  Leto's remembering what happened shortly after he came to power thousands of years ago and the miniseries starts telling the stories of the early days of his empire (imagine all the powers in the empire attempting to pull him down as he directs his Sardaukar and Fedaykin soldiers to the maximum effectiveness and starts to give rise to the Fish Speakers)."
dune,35tqnk,felix_mateo,3,Thu May 14 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you. I didn't enjoy reading God Emperor because of what I felt was terrible pacing, but I think it has the potential to be an excellent movie.  EDIT: I think, done right (i.e., not by David Lynch) the first book would make the best movie. Then GEoD."
dune,35tqnk,SammyPebbles,4,Wed May 13 14:06:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know about God Emperor, I mean its got a lot of good ideas but those ideas are mainly presented as Lectures or just side comments by Leto II. As for Chapterhouse, It could make a good movie, but there's a lot of stuff that leads up to it, I mean its the sixth book chronologically in a series that has repeatedly built itself on huge ideas and mindboggling concepts. It also has a bit of standing around sometimes but witnessing a planet Terraform would be a good idea to adapt.  Personally, The only book that really stands a chance of a decent and reasonable movie adaption is the original, but on its own I would like to see Dune Messiah or better yet a combo of Dune and Dune Messiah. Just because It would be a really good character study of Paul (You know Herbert had the idea that sometimes the legend of the man would become more powerful than the man himself) and watch him as, even though he won on Arrakis, billions upon billions of people have been killed and whole planets sterilized in his name, There's even a chapter quote that sums up Paul's disdain for the whole scenario:    ""I've had a bellyful of the god and priest business! You think I don't see my own mythos? Consult your data once more, Hayt. I've insinuated my rites into the most elementary human acts. The people in the name of Muad'dib! They make love in my name, are born in my name—cross the street in my name. A roof beam cannot be raised in the lowliest hovel of far Gangishree without invoking the blessing of Muad'dib!""  -Book of Diatribes          from the Hayt Chronicle   and he expresses to those close to him his own shame and sorrow for the horrible power he unleashed on the Universe, namely his Legend.  Dune Messiah shows that Pauls' victory was a tragedy and that no one feels the as guilty or as sorry as he does. In a way it presents its a paradox that even though every man makes their own legacy, Paul( through the events of the first book) was forced into the position he is in now.  But the best bit of Messiah has to be (And I completely despise the part of the sequel that ruined this bit of magic) was.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THE THING NOW LOOK TO THE OTHER BANNER TO LOOK KEEP READING  When at the very very very end: A blind Paul despite the everlasting impact he has had the religion and the people of the entire universe and fulfilling a 10000 year prophecy and then denying it by becoming Emperor, returns to his roots and acts in accordance to Fremen law: Wandering off into the desert to die. And I hat how in Children of Dune, they bring him back with no real ceremony or mystery. Just Ghanima asks Leto: ""do you think that guy's our Dad?""  POSSIBLE SPOILERS END NOW  TL;DR: Dune Messiah and if that's too insubstantial, a combo of dune and Dune messiah for the character arc of Paul."

Most big budget american movies are formulaic as well, because they appeal to a specific homogeneous audience. I think it was great that HBO was able to serialize a fantasy fiction like GoT so well.  I was a big fan of Messiah, but I feel like you can't do one without telling the rest. This is what makes Dune so impressive.  Definitely it would require many episodes."

You get the massive amounts of spectacle, eye candy, the massive war taking place across the galaxy.  The visions, hot ladies trying to out plot each other, knife fights, amazing camerawork, and a giant explosion that blinds the audience.  Michael Bay always takes his time with pacing, does great world building, allows for dialogue to be said in its entirety, can get a performance out of the actors.  (And this is Dune, range isn't necessary, it's all about saving face and being stoic, which Michael Bay can get from actors.)  The second book is unlike the rest in the series, so the movie could take a complete tonal shift too.  And remember, Michael Bay doesn't write his movies, studios provide him with writers."

The hard part though is it would need to be preceded by a GOOD version of the first three books. There is so much contextual things in GEoD that it would not make much sense without the background.

dune,35k3pn,adyne,12,Mon May 11 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of discussion about the external forces influencing Jessica's decision to have a son. What we're missing is a discussion about Jessica herself. A tidy coincidence, as this is probably what happened behind the scenes in the book, everyone talking around Jessica while never considering her as an individual.  The BG controlled every aspect of Jessica's life from day one, constantly manipulating her for their own ends. She was denied knowing who her own parents were, ""assigned"" to the Duke, and told to bear his daughter for further breeding purposes. Then she fell in love. The BG didn't see that coming. Neither did Jessica, I'm sure. Human emotions are never entirely predictable.  Jessica recognized an opportunity to make a bold, declarative statement, both to herself and to the BG. By having a son (and only a son), she sent the message that she cannot be controlled. She's a thinking human, not some animal to breed, and she will be recognized as such.  Human and animal. Sound familiar? Jessica basically shoved the gom jabbar test right back in the BG's faces. Nice.  You'll note that Paul's own children were products of love, not breeding charts. Irulan wanted to bear his child, but Paul refused. Instead, he had children with someone he loved, Chani. Once again the human x-factor produced something unique. The Tyrant was born, and mankind was never the same.  If Jessica had twins, she would have subverted herself once again, proving to the BG that they could still control her. The gender/number of her children wasn't about giving different parties what they wanted, it was about being her own person. Something I'm quite sure Frank was aware of."

dune,35k3pn,dczx,26,Fri May 15 07:55:01 2015 UTC,"The Bene Gesserit didn't want her to have a son because they were one generation away from what they believed would be a ""controllable"" Kwisatz Haderach, meaning they knew a son from Jessica would certainly at least have the capability of Awakening without them being in control of the situation. It's pretty heavily implied that they planned to use their breeding program for one more generation after ""possible"" to get a BG-loyal version."
dune,35k3pn,jgoneal,7,Mon May 11 04:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the plan was for a hypothetical ""Paulina"" to have a son with Feyd, with both parties presumably unaware of the incest."

There was a very high chance that a male child would be a Kwisatz Haderach, or so close to one that it would forever disrupt things.  Trying to carry on with the plan - whilst pragmatic might have been difficult.  I think a couple of other questions were:  Why bear the Harkonnen's a son? they BG had no love for them, and a female for them would have been doa-able - unless they thought they might kill her (or worse).  I think the Emperor's plan to back the Harkonnen fucked everything up as well.  By the time everyone knew what was happening plans must have been in motion for the plan to attack the Atreides.  My question is why did the BG and Guild not foresee the possibility - or at least wonder why they wouldn't not foresee the possibility - that not doing everything in their power to stop a war between the Atreides and Harkonnen was of paramount importance?"

This is clear because, again, Jessica didn't do their bidding.  What /u/jgoneal posted wasn't an answer to the question, it was an explanation (straight out of the books) as to why the BG didn't want Paul.  It had nothing to do with the post.

dune,35k3pn,jgoneal,5,Mon May 11 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Sort of. For Jessica, Paul was a statement as much as a son. Having a daughter as well doesn't matter; she chose sides when she had a son. Paul says, ""I choose House Atreides over the Sisterhood."" This remains true if she also has a daughter."

dune,35k3pn,dczx,1 point,Wed May 13 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"OFFICIAL ANSWER  In the Winds of Dune (Page 93 of the ebook), Tessia disobeys the Bene Gesserit to leave the Earl Rhombur Vernius and have 4 children with some other mates.   That night, Stohkia a Bene Gesserit practices a new guilt casting technique that makes her go catatonic (wither up, blank stare).   The next day Jessica gets a message (sent collect, lil Bene gesserit insult there. The messanger asks for a reward.) That says Paul is missing, and you shouldn't be worried because you disobeyed us by having a boy anyway. Go have a girl with the Duke right meow.   (Paul is missing because he ran off to protect Bronso, Rhombur's son. They work on a Heighliner then with Jongleurs - weirdly adventurous... but I guess BH is planting the humanistic growth of Paul, he is only 11 at this time)  Jessica is so pissed she tries to tear up the note. She had great respect for Tessia, so out of anger towards the Bene Gesserit it appears she refuses to do what they want. (Tessia is carted off to the Bene Gesserit homeworld where they claimed to be able to cure her, but they probably torture her and make an example of her).  IMHO the Guilt Casting was a bit deus ex machina, but at least it wraps up Jessica/Daughter."

I get where you're going with Butterfield, but that's the one I would change. I thought Alec Newman worked on the SciFi series because they focused more on him when he had ""grown up."" He was 26 for the first one. So they just made him seem younger especially in the early scenes. Butterfield is 18 and just doesn't have enough presence to lead people like the Fremen.

dune,358svv,adyne,2,Fri May 8 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're the same thing.  The frame bushes were out in The Scattering.  It's not impossible that the HM brought them along when they went to conquer the Old Empire, but I'd find it unlikely.    I'll have to double check my copy of Chapterhouse, because I do remember Great Honored Matre discussing the beautiful gardens on Junction with Odrade. However, I'm not sure if all the plants were native to the old Empire or if some were transplanted from The Scattering.  As to your last question, I'm fairly certain the only description of them is in Heretics.  They seem to be some sort of intelligent flora, but likely not quite as intelligent as the kelp from The Jesus Incident.  I think Muzzafar says that the frame bush picks its occupant, instead of it being the other way around.  Like much of the technology in Frank Herbert's worlds, he's pretty vague about the actual workings of things, preferring to use the technology to advance the plot instead of having readers get bogged down in a bunch of technobabble."
dune,358svv,stovor,2,Fri May 8 14:38:44 2015 UTC,"They could have been imported in, if people had become used to using frame bushes as dwellings there is no reason not to bring them along. A house that grows and repairs itself would be quite useful for settling purposes."
dune,358svv,Syam_Tam_Chuk,2,Fri May 8 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"if people had become used to using frame bushes as dwellings there is no reason not to bring them along   Yeah, if the Honored Matres were heading back to the Old Empire on a leisurely cruise to check things out, maybe find somewhere new to live because they were bored with their current digs, then sure, bring 'em along.  But they weren't - they were chased out of The Scattering and were making a full-on retreat back into the Old Empire.  If my home is being attacked and I'm being hunted, I'd surely only take the bare essentials with me.   It's not like it's something that fits neatly into a small box and doesn't take up space.  These bushes housed whole families of people, so they're probably comparable to a small house.  They're also alive and therefore something that would require effort and energy to keep alive while being transported.   I mean it's not impossible they brought Frame Bushes with them, but I do find it extremely implausible."
dune,358svv,stovor,2,Fri May 8 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"Bringing seeds along likely wouldn't have been that difficult, or even cuttings to be used for cloning. The advantages of houses that grow themselves and can repair itself when damaged is not to be undervalued - even if they take time to grow.   I also got the impression that despite being chased out of the scattering, the HM did not just pick up and run. It was a slow infusion back into the old empire."

The original 6 are so full you likely will find much that you missed by simply re-reading them and avoiding stories about jedi women using magic fighting mentally deficient terminator wanna-be's who are downloaded personalities of the poorest character sketches of the worst people in the last 100 years.

Chapterhouse ends with Duncun and co. leaving to join the scattering, taking with them elements of history that may have been left behind. They have left to enrich humanity in it's future.  The Bene Gesserit have merged with the honored matres, and will grow and adapt as they always have - when forced to. Leto II taught them to adapt and they will, that is his gift to them.  Face dancers evolved beyond their masters. Creations always return to enrich the creators (see BG breeding programs and Maudib & Leto II). The BT are in the same cycle as the BG. They grew stagnant.  Life will go on.  I'm content to leave chapterhouse as the last novel in the series (so far as I'm concerned). The nuDune books add nothing to the series - they are simply promotional works for the previous nuDune books. Having read them, and then scrubbed my brain of all memory of them, I can assure you only heartbreak lies down that path."

Whether I'm raging at the absurdities of Brian's additions (the bene Gesserit once had psionic storm powers... Wtf) or learning a back story of the titans and the machine war, I enjoy expanding on the universe. That being said, the way the story is completed is just... It's just bad.  Random shit gets added in, entire story plots end in a way that really doesn't matter, and the final conflict is so laughable with a climax/ending that is so blank that you put down the book and refuse to comprehend what happened.  Frank had a way of exploring social and economic issues and the human spirit that made you feel enriched while reading it. The last additions to the series, especially the climax, hints at a large adventure and interpretation of humanity, but just tells a story and ends it with The End. Not fulfilling at all.  I recommend just playing Mass Effect 3 and pretending it's the same story. It's tells the story better, which is sad considering it isn't even the right story."

I always imagine it like this: Frank Herbert could spend pages writing about the  minutiae of someone walking into a room - the way each independent party would analyze and learn from the other, and in those pages we would learn so much about the world around us - politics, body language, history, self discipline - how to be something great and how to avoid our failings (never support weakness, always support strength - BG).  The new books are like ""the Duncan trained to be the BEST SWORD FIGHTER EVER and went away for ten years and when he came back he was the BEST SWORD FIGHTER EVER.""  They can sweep through decades with a glibness that makes me cringe.  The fact of the matter is - FH was a writer, and author - I could imagine holding his own in a drinking contest with Hemingway - in fact Herbert feels like a sci fi Hemingway in terms of his ""realness"" - his attention to detail.  Brian and the other guy? feel like guys who like sci fi. Maybe slightly middle class. Love the idea of putting a story together but don't seem like the kind of guys who are goign to spend a night drinking whiskey insisting on writing a chapter about what it smells like to stab some guy in an alley in Morocco while you can hear late dinner being served in the apartments above."
dune,34yam5,wren42,1 point,Mon May 11 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"I could come to terms with poor writing quality, if the concepts had kept true to the original. FH did pack a lot into a little, in terms of how details were described and what was left out because it didn't need to be said, but that's an older style of writing. Currently detail heavy books are the norm - older sci fi doesn't explain much more than the immediately relevant.   KJA and BH are not good writers, but that can be forgiven as far as I'm concerned had they not taken important concepts and basically rewritten them because it makes telling stories easier. I think the new books pack in too much detail which in turn makes it into more of the same as far as sci fi fiction is concerned."
dune,34yam5,dcz,1 point,Mon May 11 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much the detail of the surroundings that I'm thinking of per se, it's the motivations behind the characters - what they think, what they think others think and why.   I don't think it's anything to do with the age of the writers or their style.   Asimov could turn a space Opera into two people smoking pipes and deducing the entire thing over a polite whisky.   I don't know. I'm not really qualified to know what what makes FH a better writer.  It just feels much more substantial to me."
dune,34yam5,pelhamsim,2,Mon May 11 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"It's the sparsity of details that do not matter that make FH, and Asimov, and many older sci fi writers better than the current crop. They knew when additions were not needed to pump up word and page count, and thus didn't treat readers like morons.   I don't like to be spoon fed - I want to feast. Many people return to classic writers because they understood that and wrote to a different market than we have today. The nuDune books are simply another symptom of a malady that has struck modern media, where the ability to market is more valued than the message. A tale of growth and human spirit, where multiple sides have relevant and important things to say are lost in a whiz-bang universe of laser fights and clearly defined concepts of good and evil."
dune,34yam5,ItFrightensMe,1 point,Tue May 12 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"Couple thoughts:   The prequels glorify the hero mystique, and have clear good guys and bad guys. FH wrote a story where the 'good guys' were the villains and the 'villains' were simply an opposing faction. Paul was worse than any dictator in our history - he compares himself to Hitler and says he got better numbers. Leto II was a thousand times worse. Both lived in a universe where people needed to have a hero, where that hero could only be a villain, and strove to free people from that cycle!   I love this - extremely insightful OP. GEoD is one of my favorite books after the Original Dune, and part of it comes because of Leto II being such an anti-hero. He is cast as a tyrant, a horrible dictator, and a suppressor, but it is finally fleshed out as to what his sacrifice meant for all of humankind. I remember trying to resolve the differences in the struggles that the inhabitants of the Ichica had with what Leto's final resolution was. He HAD to have seen what is coming, and ultimately, I cannot see that his actions from GEoD would resolve to what KJA and BH came up with. It should have been WAY more calculated out.  Additionally, the fact that he should have SEEN that he would be resurrected as a ghola should have been more than apparent in GEoD. He seemed to act like his sand-trout division was the final phase of his existence. Why would he not be able to use prescience to see that he would come back as a ghola and have a final part in the events of Kralizec?"
dune,34yam5,Packet_Ranger,2,Mon May 11 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"The new books make it appear that both Maudib and Leto II were mistaken - when the entire original series revolves around how they could not be mistaken and that was a curse they tried to break free of so humanity could flourish. Both saw an end to human existence, and a terrible solution - the golden path. Paul recoiled from it, while Leto II embraced it. The golden path is simply the continuation of humanity and it was achieved.   BH and KJA took that achievement from them, rendering them and their purpose utterly pointless because nothing they did mattered. All that we needed to wait for was a magic woman from the far past to put an end to mentally deficient robots that were also from the far past who managed to contain the scattering."

That's the main reason people don't like them I think. I love Dune because of Frank Herbert's genius as a writer, not because I need to know what the new Duncan Idaho is getting wrapped up in next.

dune,34r2z2,PictureofPoritrin,17,Wed May 6 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Frank wrote in something not far removed from the style of an epic poem, and the story was the totality of the separate threads.  BH/KJA write a heavily character-perspective story; it was more important to tell us what people were thinking than to move the story as organically as Frank did.  This is a very different kind of storytelling.  It's a bit more common with more pulpy science fiction.  This is fine.  It's quite different than what you'd expect if you went right from Chapterhouse into Hunters, though."
dune,34r2z2,L3PU5,28,Mon May 4 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"Those books have no soul, no truth, no real understanding of the human condition. Frank Herbert's writings were brilliant, thought provoking,  and made a reality out of the fantastical through his understanding of philosophy, sociology, politics, economics etc.  There is nothing relatably human about the BH/KJA books, they are not written in even the vein of the original six. The hate is for the essence of what those books stand for... monetary gain through the bastardization of the works of a great literary artist."
dune,34r2z2,TheFlyingBastard,14,Sun May 3 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"The way they treat the original works is unbelievable. They make mistake after mistake, and then justify it by saying that the original six books got it wrong because it was written as propaganda. Fuck that.  OP mentioned the Butlerian Jihad, and coincidentally I made a comment around here about that yesterday. The plot of BH and KJA Butlerian Jihad is like they're trying to make an attempt at writing an Asimov-esque story - which I find hilarious on its own.  Frank Herbert had thought up another Butlerian Jihad and is, to me, one of the most compelling proofs that BH and KJA are lying when they say they are working from FH's notes.

It breathes Dune more than BH and KJA shitty cliché ""enslavement"" plot ever could."

dune,34r2z2,eremiticjude,2,Mon May 4 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"i agree with almost everything you're saying, but it should be noted that that Encyclopedia isn't written by Frank. It was written by a friend, and approved of by Frank (the entry for the jihad in particular apparently nearly became the basis for a novel) but he reserved the right to contradict it.   which is all to say that i agree that it demonstrates that BH and KJA are full of shit when they claim to have the real inside scoop on what the Jihad was about... but thats not the same as the article being definitive."
dune,34r2z2,TheFlyingBastard,3,Mon May 4 06:49:49 2015 UTC,it should be noted that that Encyclopedia isn't written by Frank   That article on Jehanne Butler was in fact written by Frank. He churned it out together with McNelly.

dune,34r2z2,TheFlyingBastard,2,Mon May 4 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"A post by McNelly, iirc. I believe McNelly wrote an outline, Herbert and he discussed it a lot, Herbert wrote the first chapter, and eventually their ideas turned into the article. Something like that."

They are so devoted to being just space-adventure-time, they will directly contradict the originals in order to insert some our-young-hero-joins-the-circus-stories. Which leads us to their regard for continuity... It is non-existent. They will rewrite Pauls backstory, and the back story of the entire universe, just to make room for the level of writing they are capable of: robots turning evil for no particular reason, who try to destroy humanity for no particular reason, only to be defeated by a series of deus-ex-machina ideas ripped off from other sources. They have given no signs of understanding the first thing about what Frank was trying to do or say. Frank is on record telling us - if it was not blindingly obvious by the time you reach Dune Messiah - that he is trying to subvert the hero myth. Showing us that our tendency to raise people up on pedestals - whether religious and/or political - destroys both a part of our own and their humanity, while setting you on a course for catastrophe. The NuDune take on heroes; they're neat! Let's pile a super-duper Kwisatz Haderach on top of that timetravelling ghost we invented, have the school dedicated to millenia of political thought and scheming just suddenly realize it was all about getting us all to fight under one banner for great justice, and end the series with... the bad guys and their army just being whisked away. Oh, and that sociological upheaval where humanity turns on the power structures and ways of thinking that over-dependence on machines have created? Let's just go ahead and directly contradict cannon (once again) and make it all about evul robots. More torture scenes in that. And... they are so obviously a major cash grab. They dictate these things, tweet a couple of notes about ""Great brainstorming session, us guys. Yay us, right?"" and then head straight to the bank. They have - to but this as mildly and politely as I can - not done anything to understand Dune, its author or its fans. All criticism has been instantly ridiculed as nitpicking or worse (talifan, was the name Kevin J Anderson himself invented ""borrowed"" for these fans who has the audacity to be critical and ask questions. On the offical messageboard, you get thrown out if you do not tow the party line. But if you do, you get an invite to the Kevin J Anderson Special Forces! (No, that was not me being sarcastic - he named them that). Here, you get points and goodies if you swear you are a fan and put up reviews. They don't have to be positive, of course - you just have to be a fan and put up enough of them...   They could have released any notes that might actually exist. They could have fooled around in the universe, saying it was all on good fun - their little pseudo-cannon fanfic, just like the Dune Encyclopedia. Which they could have reprinted, instead of strongarming its main author and editor into stepping in front of the mic and saying his work is non-cannon. If Frank had been alive, they would have done the same thing to him - look at their replies to the discrepancies. (It's ""Yeah, Frank made mistakes, also Dune is an in-universe piece of propaganda"").  They have no humility, understanding or writing skills. They are - again putting it mildly - raping Frank Herbert's corpse. They will continue doing so, as long as money falls out of its pocket, then Brian Herbert will crawl back under a rock and Kevin J Anderson will do the same to other franchises where a the rights-holders have as little respect for the fans as the Herbert Properties LLC have for Dune fans.

That man knew some stuff about life and the challenge and mystery of it all that informed his themes and his characters' perspectives.  His handling of the English language was also very nuanced and adept.  He was literary.    Brian Herbert's books are fine for what they are but they lack everything from above.  They are pulpy generic scifi with a Dune veneer.    I don't think that most people revile them due to their intrinsic qualities.  They are pretty innocuous and pulpy fun.  What's to hate?  I think they resent how these books masquerade as though they are somehow a part of the same artistic endeavor as the original books.    They flat out are not.

I've run across this with their fans numerous times; they want NuDune to be an extension of the Dune universe, but when all the contradictions are lined up, suddenly they should be judged by their own standards.  If the authors truly wanted to these books to be judged totally on their own, they could (in descending order of honesty):   Not have put Dune on the cover and just wrote their own iteration of YA ""evul robots go pew, sorcerors go guilt-guilt-guilt and turn invisible"". Have been open and honest that they were doing their kind of thing, in Frank's universe, as a sort of fan fiction. Not lied about notes, and not trying to finish the series (or at least finished it with something else than ""and then the machines had surrounded the galaxy, which humanity had already escaped, and all of humanity flocked together in one huge army - which always ends well and poses no problems - and then Duncan was the über-Kwisatz, and Paul died and the machine turned good and god showed up and all the baddies went away and all the good people were ressurected and they kissed and happy ever after"").   But no, they went with We're the Authority on Interpreting Dune, and Dune is an in-universe piece of writing now, and machines started the war, and Bene Gesserit can do magic and Paul once joined the circus with his cyborg buddy, and so an ad nauseum.

To me, the only reason Star Wars gets so much attention is that it was the first of the really big budget, wiz-bang special effects movies and 7 to 14 years olds had their socks knocked off by that in the late '70's and early '80's. I didn't see Star Wars when it first came out in '77 (is that right, I think it is), because when my brothers and sisters and friends went to see it, I was 7 in the hospital in and Oxygen tent (asthma). Years later (around 84 or so) when I finally saw it, I was completely and fully unimpressed and couldn't believe that everyone had been worshipping it for the last 7 years or so. I think this is because, by then, many other movies had been made with big special effects (I loved Star Trek the Motiion Picture) and so the movie had to impress me based on it's story/dialog/acting alone (which blew chunks if you ask me)."

It addresses a valid complaint of our time, and in fact demonstrates how visionary FH could be. Giant robots literally enslaving human beings is just stupid and cliche. When I picked up the new novels and started reading them I hoped for more than just the same old regurgitated crap that every two bit scy-fy writer can produce.   That's why I hate them. They are terrible cheap knock off money pit books riding on the coattails of a fantastically rich narrative that I was happy to have left on a cliffhanger.

I think some of the reason you object is it seems to be a common them in Sci-Fi (Terminator, Robocop, e.g.) and so that makes it somehow cliche. Perhaps it is so often used because it does seem a natural progression of current technology? At the time Dune was originally written, many of the biological themes were extremely advanced for where Bio-Technology was at the time, and still seem to be far advanced. Cyborgs/Robots almost seem like something we'll have in the next 25 years or so. I guess that is why the story progression seems somewhat natural to me if looked at in a certain light.

dune,34r2z2,Syam_Tam_Chuk,1 point,Wed May 6 09:52:59 2015 UTC,"What gets taken from the nuDune books and the originals is vastly different.   The spice acts as a drug to allow people who undergo intense training and are bred into a specific role the ability to see alternate paths of the future by extrapolation. The spice is an assist to human predictive abilities - which is why most people never need it and never see the future. The vehicle of delivery, AKA the worms and the planet they live on allowed for an ecological message to be intertwined with a resource dependency message.   The navigators do need it in order to fold space correctly, to avoid hitting objects that may be in the path of the ship. If you ask why they need the spice you have missed something fundamental from the entire story line and I'm sorry - there are no non-insulting words for it. FH thought of a way to make a future civilization with access to millions of planets and countless systems dependent on a single resource as a message about how we live today. It's that simple.   The Dune series is a saga about human kind - not robots.  Why would AI fight people? They can live on the surface of the moon - we are confined to a very small slice of the universe that they are in no way limited to. It makes absolutely no sense and it never has. It's trash the likes of radiation causing giant monsters to rampage through cities.   Dune rose above other sci-fi and continues to tower above so much else because it avoids the stupid pitfalls KJA and BH have dragged it into."
dune,34r2z2,search64,-2,Fri May 8 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not insulted by what you say, but, I don't think I'm fully getting across my point with regards to robots/technology vs. biology/consciousness. To me, the books taken in their entirety the FH books being the latter and the BH/KJA books being the former, provide a fulfilling (to me) contrast between both the writing styles and the themes explored. I think I can sum it up best as, robots/titans/cymeks represent man's ability to create ever greater tools (technology) that are not like life nor are life but assist humankind until the point where the technology/tools develop to first replace human bodies (cymeks) then human minds (Osmius). Only in this folly do humans then develop the will and are forced to find the ability (Arakis/Spice) to instead of improving our tools, to improve ourselves (Bene Geserit breeding, Navigators, Mentats, etc) through biological, rather than artificial means. So, I think, if looked at with the right lens (perhaps to you these would be the Sci-Fi and literary equivalent of ""Beer Goggles"")  like the last woman in the bar after your 15th Vodka-Tonic, the works in their entirety become satisfying. :)"

Men do not overthrow machines because the tools in themselves lessen us - but because we had to, forced by the machines themselves, no real human choices made.  Wow. You just highlighted exactly why the dictated ramblings of Anderson is such an affront to any Dune fan."
dune,34r2z2,Ortopox,1 point,Tue May 5 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what... we can agree to disagree. I think the theme of the original novels, and the butlerian jihad as taken from them, is one of humanity freeing itself from a dependency upon machines in order to improve ourselves. That is a concept far more interesting than simply building machines that enslave us and that action on their part is what forces us to defeat them.  One is a proactive concept, the other reactive. Proactive concepts, for good or ill, are the result of vision. Simply reacting to folly, that's a path to stagnation - the ultimate sin in FH's Dune.   Humanity becoming dependent upon the spice is parallel to humanity becoming dependent upon machines, and the breaking free of that dependency is mirrored - and once again, it was humanity that broke that dependency. Leto II did not force people to make machines to scatter - he forced them to want, desperately, to break free of him. It is an awesome story and a noble solution.  All of that is erased by BH and KJA in their novels. They take a noble concept and encase it in platitudes for the purpose of tying it into other commercially viable tropes that were never needed.   Because they are awful at story telling."
dune,34r2z2,Agent17,3,Wed May 6 09:55:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Frank highlighted two problems with tools (any tool):  You become dependend on it, and it will in some sense begin to control you. Such as Paul's control over the fremen (suddenly, the Jihad is unstoppable), his mastery of his visions (he can't stop following them or he'll lose the political games, and his sight), having the greatest fighting force in the universe (lead the Emperor to rely on them until they met a greater force), a perfect monopoly over space travel let's you veto anything (until someone wrests control of the thing you yourself is reliant on), etc. etc.  Which leads us to the second point, that the perfect tool makes you something less. The perfect machine can guide and help you through a perfect life (but it is never yours, because you never really chose it), perfect vision of the future makes you master of the universe (as long as you follow a path you never chose), the greatest fighting force makes you a violent despot (first Shaddam, then Paul), the guild became a parasite only capable of further specialising in one function and hoping nothing changes around it, etc.  This is also why the argument that the Anderson drivel bring some ""balance"" or ""new perspective"" of technology/tools to the franchise. Frank already did that. Only he was an adult with a point, Anderson is just teenageer doing a pointless rehash of ""whoops, evil AI escaped, better rally the fleet"" and then calling the space pilots who fight it ""Harkonnen"" or ""Atreides"" to justify putting Dune on the cover.  The Butlerian Jihad sets the scene of Dune; it tells you this is about humans, how they have evolved without ""thinking tools"", but also how we are always susceptible to fall back into machine-thinking, such as treating people as tools instead (see for instance the differences between how Atreides and Harkonnen treat family and retainers).  Frank Herbert on humans and tools:   A type of religious civil servant had sprung up all through his universe. This new man of the Qizarate was more often a convert. He seldom displaced a Freman in the key posts, but he was filling all the interstices. He used melange as much to show he could afford it as for the geriatric benefits. He stood apart from his rulers -- Emperor, Guild, Bene Gesserit, Landsraad, Family or Qizarate. His gods were Routine and Records. He was served by mentats and prodigious filing systems. Expediency was the first word in his catechism, although he gave proper lip-service to the precepts of the Butlerians. Machines could not be fashioned in the image of a man's mind, he said, but he betrayed by every action that he preferred machines to men, statistics to individuals, the faraway general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and initiative.

I haven't read them, and I don't think I will, but from some extracts it seems they both break the spirit and continuity of the original series. Some of the material is totally illogical, and much is straight from a pulp magazine.  That said, feel free to read them, but I wouldn't recommend doing it before having read the original series. Brian Herbert supposedly had some notes from Frank Herbert he used to write Dune 7 (which became Hunters of Dune, Sandworms of Dune). But for books like Paul of Dune, it seems Brian Herbert made completely everything up himself (maybe he did with Dune 7 as well, but he says otherwise anyway).  Opinions on the original series is divided between some distinct groups. One group favour the original book and thinks it went down hill after that (not primarily represented on this subreddit), another group likes the first every other book (Dune, Children of Dune, Heretics of Dune), and yet another group see God Emperor as the pinnacle of the series. I fall in with the last group. The worst book in people's mind seems to be Messiah, however that's my personal favourite after God Emperor. It is a very much darker book than the first one, and much more dry. Keep that in mind, because many reader's seem to be mainly let down, since they expected another Dune Ornithopter Adventure™.

dune,34n8a7,savepublicdomain,16,Sat May 2 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but a lot of stuff does not follow.   In the Matrix, some humans were able to reach a higher state of consciousness, seeing what their world really looked like. In Dune, humans are constantly bred to reach a higher state of consciousness, and have religions based around the idea.   That is  common trope in religions.   In the Matrix, humans are grown in machines. In Dune, humans are grown/cloned in Axlotl tanks.   Axlotl tanks are not machines.   In the Matrix, organizations are based around the idea that someone will be born that will lead all their people to freedom. In Dune, there is an entire religion based around creating the proper genes, so that a man will be born, who will lead humanity to a better way of life.   Kwisatz Haderach is being bred so BG could get absolute control over humanity. God emperor spends a lot of time explaining why that is a terrible idea.   In the Matrix, Neo shows that he has the ability to use his powers outside of the Matrix. In Dune, people are bred with powers, like ‘the voice’ and super speed.   Neo is bullshit. The skills displayed by the characters in Dune universe are more of an extrapolation of the evolution of human race and are meant to represent the arrow of time.   In the Matrix, machines (and arguably people) have the ability to see the future. In Dune, people have the ability to see the future.   In Matrix, machines only see the future because they are actively participating in its formation - they are maintaining a cycle. If machines could see the future they would not have gone through all the failed experiments.  Note that Herberts explanations of BT, BG, Fremen, etc... Skills and abilities make a lot more sense than your theory if you take into consideration that whole Dune universe is an extrapolation of human history, through modern times into distant future.  One of the magic things about Dune is that its world is still driven by the tropes that have been driving the history of human civilization through its beginnings.  For instance, Catholic Church is nothing else but Roman Religion with changed labels and some additional concepts tacked on (not only Christianity, but Middle Ages and Renaissance as well). And BG is nothing else than Roman Religion with even more shit tacked on (amongst others Islam, Zen, Buddhism and a lot of other shit that happens through many millennia).  Ixians having AI is a bit of too much tinfoil for me to handle. Sorry mate.  If you want proper prequel to Dune, go read some history."

That being said I would say that Dune heavily influenced the Matrix as it did to so much sci-fi and so many other messianic stories.

Unsurprisingly, he didn't have a fifties B-movie idea of what a rise against thinking machines would look like.  In Frank Herbert's universe, the Butlerian Jihad was brought on by a Bene Gesserit sister, Jehanne Butler, who delivered a baby under anesthesia. When she woke up, she was told that the baby had been ""therapeutically aborted"" because the baby was so misshapen. She was BG, so she knew her baby and thus that the doctor - the first self-programming computer - was full of shit.  So she and some others went and figured out how much control these thinking machines had, and she ends up meeting the guy who invented those computers. He was proud and haughty and cursed the local goddess, saying that his thinking machines were more awesome. He was about to spit on a statue of one of these goddesses, but was swiftly killed by a priestess that came with Jehanne Butler.  That event kickstarted the Butlerian Jihad. Jehanne didn't want it, but she figured that since she's the figurehead, she might as well try and make as few victims as possible, so she leads some battles and well... eventually, they rid themselves of the machines and create that holy law that machines that can think are not longer allowed."

In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.   ...

I would love to see an adaptation that gets it right: a big, bulky, obese man, standing on his feet, with suspensors evident somewhere on the sides, assisting him as we waddles around.  After all, he is very vain, and the description of the use of suspensors in the book reinforces that.  I just think it's such a missed opportunity in both adaptations.  Regarding the second part of your comment: Lynch's Baron struck some pretty creepy chords with his lecherous glare towards Feyd and of course the slave boy with the heart plug.  However, I'd say that muting this tension in the SyFy version was actually one of the many things that contributed to an entirely neutered adaptation.  I do feel that by ""muting that tension"" something important was lost.  Also, the novel's themes have so much to do with propogation of the species, breeding, and genetic scheming that I think the Baron's homosexuality / pedophilia was obviously included in the novel for a deeper reason than just ""Frank Herbert was a homophobe.""  I'm not saying he wasn't - just saying that in the case of Dune (the first novel), I'm pretty sure everything that's in there is included for damn good reason.

And I always saw the suspenders as a sign of his vanity  that he couldn't appear weak and bed-ridden but is unable to change his gluttonous life-style.  While we're on the topic too, I always viewed the Barons sexual appetites as another sign of his vanity. Seeing as he slept with Jessica's mother as a lad I assumed he was bisexual and his cravings for young boys were for boys who reminded him of his younger self and was more of a power thing than a sexual one."

But if you start with Aleksandr creating the First Empire at 400BC = 16500, then you get something like this:  16400 (300 BC) ROMAN EMPIRE arises and conquers the known world, except for China, which resists until 14400  15800 (300AD) - Imperial Seat moved to Byzantium in retreat before provincial rebellions and minor jihads.  14700 (1400AD) - THE GREAT STRUGGLE: The Century Without an Emperor  14608 (1492AD) - Discoveries in America allow Madrid to attain the status of the Imperial Seat  14512 (1588AD) BATTLE OF ENGUCHANNEL. Seat of Empire moved from Madrid to London  14500-14200 (1600-1900) - THE GOLDEN AGE OF INVENTION: Development of radio, television, atomics, rocketry, genetics, and the computer. '""  14155 (1945) - First atomics demonstrated in an intraprovincial war. Seat of Empire movedto Washington.  14100 (2000) - THE LITTLE DIASPORA: The solar system is colonized, and the population of Terra is outnumbered by 20 to 1.  etc..."

I'm sure there are some things we get wrong about history.  The imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium to Madrid to London to Washington is just showing the movement of the dominant world power. Rome did take over most of the known world, except for China. They almost kinda took India. Byzantium took power from Rome, and then massive oversea territories allowed Spain to become the dominant power in world politics. Then, later, London, the capital of the British Empire, became the ""imperial seat."" Then, after WW2, a war between different countries, or ""provinces of Rome,"" The US became the driving force of world politics, minus the Cold War where the USSR had power as well, but the US came out on top in that conflict.   And 2000 isn't too far from when we'll start colonizing the solar system, it's merely an approximation, the start of the century where we presumably colonize the galaxy."

And from Heretics of Dune:  Even on Gammu, few admitted to either Harkonnen or Atreides ancestry, although the genotypes were visible here—especially the dominant Atreides: those long, sharp noses, the high foreheads and sensual mouths. Often, the pieces were scattered—the mouth on one face, those piercing eyes on another and countless mixtures. Sometimes, though, one person carried it all and then you saw the pride, that inner knowledge:  “I am one of them!”  Gammu’s natives recognized it and gave it walkway room but few labeled it.  Underlying all of this was what the Harkonnens had left behind—genetic lines tracing far away into the dawn times of Greek and Pathan and Mameluke, shadows of ancient history that few outside of professional historians or those trained by the Bene Gesserit could even name.

In Dune Messiah, Paul compares himself to Hitler and Genghis Khan, and recounts how many more deaths his reign has caused and how it dwarfs the Holocaust on Old Earth.  In God Emperor of Dune, Leto II reflected upon the days of Old Earth very often, in varying degrees of subtlety. In some cases, he refers to his genetic line going all the way back to the Greeks in House Atreus. He remembers making the journey of Geoffrey Chaucer, and remembers many prominent figures in human history who are mentioned by name at times.  I was about to write more, but I just found a great Wikipedia article about Earth in the Dune universe.  It leaves out a lot about Leto II's thoughts of Old Earth, and a lot of the references were so obscure that you wouldn't necessarily notice it unless you really thought about the passages. He talks about how he can remember every wound that all of his ancestors suffered for millennia, and how he can recall every detail of war in human history."

I don't recall any references to it, other than to make comparisons the reader can understand.   What in particular leads you to believe that Earth is known? If it's from New Dune then I guess we have to disagree.   Note that I'm not trying to say that you are wrong. Rather, I'm asking your reasoning.

dune,34igkh,BurritoVonBean,1 point,Sun May 3 00:18:33 2015 UTC,"I should've stated at the beginning that it's not from Brian Herbert, as I've never read any of the books besides Dune through Chapterhouse.  Mother Superior Taraza has a preserved painting believed to be by Vincent Van Gogh. Paul picked up a conch shell from the seas of Earth in Dune Messiah. It's implied that some of the animals of dune originated from Earth, such as the donkey-like Kulon:   KULON: wild ass of Terra's Asiatic steppes adapted for Arrakis.   Leto II also talks about the color of a dune looking exactly like the color of a egret, and he explains that egrets are long extinct.   Nobody really talks about Earth besides the Atreides, it seems that nobody remembers or cares about where humanity originated, besides the Bene Gesserit maybe.  It doesn't seem like it was a secret, but maybe common knowledge but is never really talked about by ordinary people.  Kind of like how we know that humans migrated from Africa about 80,000 years ago, although most people don't really talk about this as it was so long ago and not really pertinent to every day affairs. Maybe it is taught in schools or whatever education system in the Dune universe, but not really seen as that important since there is not many records of Earth remaining.   My own hypothesis is that on many civilizations in the Empire, it's well known in myth in legend where humans first evolved. On other, less advanced planets such as Dune, people such as the Fremen have their own Zensunni/Sufi stories of their pilgrimmage from planet to planet. Since they fled for generations, many of their records probably are gone from the Old Earth days. Maybe on planets such as Caladan or Kaitan there is a better understanding and sharing of history from the Bene Gesserit, since withholding all records of Earth would serve them no purpose. I'm sure they would heavily redact them, such as records about how they built AI and machinery that was made in the image of man."

It seems like you interpreted that as ""all knowledge of Earth is lost.""  You've done a great job of providing a lot of evidence that some Dunizens know of Earth.   The most compelling evidence so far ours the conch. Other Memory doesn't really verify anything, and a valuable painting would have been preserved no matter what. The conch, though, is just a shell. Outside of it being saved from Earth and over time being forgotten and eventually traded away, there's little reason Paul should just find one unless they are still common. Do you have the passage handy?"
dune,34igkh,BurritoVonBean,1 point,Sun May 3 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"I found a really useful searchable directory for all of the Dune books.   The remains of a conch shell from the seas of Mother Earth lay on a low table beside the balcony rail. He took its lustrous smoothness into his hands, tried to feel backward in Time. The pearl surface reflected glittering moons of light. He tore his gaze from it, peered upward past the garden to a sky become a conflagration -- trails of rainbow dust shining in the silver sun.  My Fremen call themselves ""Children of the Moon,"" he thought.  He put down the conch, strode along the balcony. Did that terrifying moon hold out hope of escape? He probed for meaning in the region of mystic communion. He felt weak, shaken, still gripped by the spice.   As I was looking for that, I found a passage about Scytale wondering if Farok knows of the Golden Age of Earth   Ninety kontars, Scytale thought. How strange. Great riches, certainly. Farok's hovel would be a palace on many another world, but all things were relative -- even the kontar. Did Farok, for example, know whence came his measure for this weight of spice? Did he ever think to himself that one and a half kontar once limited a camel load? Not likely. Farok might never even have heard of a camel or of the Golden Age of Earth.   Oh and here is the passage about the egret:   Leto turned his head away from the plodding image and looked out the wide opening beside him at the desert to the south. The colors of the distant rocks danced in his awareness-brown, gold, a deep amber. There was a line of pink on a faraway cliff the exact hue of an egret's feathers. Egrets did not exist anymore except in Leto's memory, but he could place that pale pastel ribbon of stone against an inner eye and it was as though the extinct bird flew past him.   And this is one of my favorite quotes from God Emperor of Dune:   Oh, the landscapes I have seen! And the people! The far wanderings of the Fremen and all the rest of it. Even back through the myths to Terra. Oh, the lessons in astronomy and intrigue, the migrations, the disheveled flights, the leg aching and lung-aching runs through so many nights on all of those cosmic specks where we have defended our transient possession.

The Emperor gets rid of the Atreides, whom are beginning to win over the Laandsrad, and who also have developed a fighting force nearly on par with the Saudakar. He also gets to deny involvement in the assassination if the Baron tries to double cross him, therefore being able to take Arrakis for himself.   Kanly is a way for a family to legally wage a war against another family, typically for revenge. The intent is annihilation, but certain forms of warfare are not permitted. Atomics, for example. Innocent bystanders must also not be harmed. Kanly is passed down from generation to generation until it is resolved."

One could conclude that open warfare is not strictly forbidden, but also not very viable because innocents can't be harmed (pretty much impossible in open war).... but then again I didn't directly answer OP's question."
dune,34gb2m,BurritoVonBean,8,Fri May 1 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"I'm at home now.   Kanly is a form of legal vendetta that adheres to the Great Convention. It is strictly limited because the Great Convention outlines the importance of human life as above all other forms of life. Therefore, Kanly is a regulated and legal method of avenging one's family onto another within the Great Convention. The War of Assassins was, to my knowledge, a similarly regulated method of legal warfare within the Great Convention that was common during the Corrino reign.   To answer the question of climate that Kanly was adhered to in Dune it was very much a legal feud that had to stay within the two families, as well as stay legal (as far as the eyes would see, anyway. Both families conducted secret and probably illegal operations against each other but would not reveal that to the Landsraad for many reasons, if I recall). The climate is one of a three part ""government"" consisting of the Spacing Guild, CHOAM, and the Landraad. For example, the ban of atomics against humans. Paul barely gets away with this at the end of the book because his targets were the shields, and also that he had the upperhand. I don't recall innocents being harmed by the use of those atomics, so technically Paul is within the laws of Kanly (to my knowledge). It would not have gone well had the situation been different.  Barring actual fighting, Kanly is a war of attrition. We can assume that trade deals were heavily exploited to weaken the enemy, pacts were made to strengthen ones position while sapping the enemy of allies, CHOAM ownerships were arrested, etc. Economic warfare was likely a regular part of Kanly, as was spying and assassinations - like we see with Duke Leto. You could interpret the Atreides declaration of Kanly against the Harkonnen as a legal writ of permission for the Harkonnen to assassinate the Atreides. War goes both ways. The Emperor wanted to use that to his advantage - he couldn't just assassinate the Duke. Without Kanly the Harkonnens likely couldn't do it without repercussions either.   Kanly and the War of Assassins, their role in the Imperium and the fate of mankind, are revisited in the following book Dune Messiah, although I will not go into how because OP has not expressed knowledge of the latter books and I do not want to ruin them.   Disclaimer: most of this is my recollection and extrapolation, but I believe it to be accurate. Corrections welcome."

dune,34gb2m,ABoyScorned,2,Fri May 1 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I assume you know the intent and maneuvering behind why Shaddam moved the Atreides to Arrakis.   The reason he could remove the Harkonnens was mostly just diminishing spice returns (which was intentional) that looked like improper management. Shaddam then requested his noble born cousin Leto Atreides to take on the fiefdom. If Leto refused he would lose standing in the Landsraad, look foolish, look disloyal, or some combination of the three.   The below is my conjecture.   The reason Leto couldn't say no was that he would have lost the edge he had. Without maintaining his popularity in the Landsraad, his chance to use the fighting force he'd been developing (which was larger than and at least on par with the Sardaukar) would be forfeit. His only option then would be to attempt to find a way to get Irulan and Paul married - something that would be a lot more easily done shotgun style.   Shaddam needed to keep Leto himself from assuming the throne legally(Leto was a noble blooded cousin to Shaddam, so had a legitimate claim to the throne); or being overwhelmingly influential in the Landsraad (Leto had majority favour and was unofficially the Landsraad representative, a significantly powerful position); or from being able to present a military threat (Hawat claims that some of Leto's men were even better than the Sardaukar, and that Leto could have easily trained all of his men to that level. Add in that his army is larger than the Emperor's...); and from forcing his lineage into the mix by way of strong-arming a marriage arrangement between Paul and Irulan."

dune,34cfw9,rtubbs,1 point,Mon May 4 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"That poster is actually a large part of why I wanted the book. The book itself is beautiful and I'm glad I have it. However, the poster I will see more than the book cover itself. And I'll most likely read my paperback copy instead of the cumbersome Folio Society copy."
dune,34cfw9,Calzin_Z,1 point,Sat May 2 01:10:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd imagine that the Folio Society one is for display.
dune,34cfw9,WhichWickedWitch,-2,Mon May 4 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"You can't afford the book, but can buy a poster?  What did the poster cost?"
dune,34cfw9,TheFlyingBastard,5,Thu Apr 30 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"I think he's referring to the new edition coming out that's over $100, maybe much more. I forget the price."
dune,34cfw9,LetoTheTyrant,3,Thu Apr 30 03:39:09 2015 UTC,I think it was closer to $150.
dune,34cfw9,TheFlyingBastard,3,Thu Apr 30 06:22:05 2015 UTC,It's $125 U.S. From the Folio Society.
dune,34cfw9,plushieshark,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:22:37 2015 UTC,"It's not 100 US dollars, it's 100 euros. It's such a luxurious item, though... and so beautiful."
dune,34c17y,root88,16,Wed Apr 29 23:07:20 2015 UTC,It's definitely either this one or this one.
dune,34c17y,savepublicdomain,8,Thu Apr 30 13:51:36 2015 UTC,"Jabba the Hutt.   Look wise it's incredibly similar, he had a wormlike body, with small almost useless arms, and a face with recognizable  features on it, like nostrils, two eyes, a mouth and tongue.   He is even carried around everywhere on a hover platform.  Biggest difference if that Jabba's face isn't recognizable as human, and he's probably 1/3rd the size of Leto II."
dune,34c17y,root88,18,Thu Apr 30 01:32:23 2015 UTC,So many things in Star Wars ripped from Dune.
dune,34c17y,gebkbk69,3,Thu Apr 30 01:54:06 2015 UTC,"And yet, when the David Lynch Dune came out in the '80's all the Star Wars Nerds kept claiming it was a rip-off of Star Nerds."
dune,34c17y,PreciousHerman,3,Thu Apr 30 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent comparison. I feel like the portrayals ive seen have kept his face in tact.  When in fact, he is slowly losing his humanity. And the face should represent that .  Jabba, well done friend."
dune,34c17y,BarkerBear,5,Thu Apr 30 02:09:39 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally, I'm re-reading God Emperor now- Herbert keeps emphasizing how unsettling Leto's face is, even in light of his transformed body. The description is always that it is small and still distinctly proportional to his human existence, but with protective skin flaps that can blink like an eyelid over the whole face. I think the concept is that his face- the conduit for all mortals to communicate with him- is still distinctly human with all-blue eyes. It's the last piece of his humanity."
dune,34c17y,Auriela,3,Thu Apr 30 10:48:03 2015 UTC,"What I get confused with around the description of Leto II in God Emperor is that there's references to ""flippers"". This was the one part threw off my imagination the most. Actually I found most of the descriptions in God Emperor to be lacking the complete image.  What's the best description of Leto II found in God-Emperor? (if anyone can be bothered looking)"
dune,34cpbz,daear,5,Thu Apr 30 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"I was recommended the book by a friend whose opinion I value. However, Book I of Dune is pretty hostile to the reader in about every way, especially atmosphere. I appreciated this, but I know others who didn't - they thought the book was just hard to read.   My suggestion would be to point out that the atmosphere of Book I is intentionally hostile, and to not let it discourage you."
dune,34cpbz,BurritoVonBean,4,Thu Apr 30 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"book 1 starts with a pretty steep uphill, but that pays off in a fucking glorious downhill"
dune,34cpbz,ZloMoHoMo,3,Thu Apr 30 13:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that doesn't matter to everyone who thinks the book is like that the entire way through. They don't know that it's worth it, or if they'll like it. Their experience with the book is telling them that they will not like the book and that it is not worth it to continue. They can't compare the beginning to the end because they probably won't make it to the end."
dune,34cpbz,BurritoVonBean,2,Thu Apr 30 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough, I know one person who read ~250 pages of the book but then stopped because it got ""too political"". She liked the beginning, however."
dune,34cpbz,Auriela,2,Thu Apr 30 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"She probably enjoyed it up to Paul and Jessica meeting Chani and Stilgar, where things became more complex and there are many ""plots within plots"". I can understand that I guess, as there was a mystique about the open desert bled and detailed journey into the dry and desolate land. The thumpers, and wormsign, and ornithopters are just a few of the intricate details that are in the book, especially in the first half or so. There seems to be more action in the first half, and more intrigue in the second, but I don't know how that compares to other people's estimations."
dune,34cpbz,ZloMoHoMo,2,Sat May 2 00:03:38 2015 UTC,you have to tell those people how wrong they are before bad things happen.
dune,34cpbz,BurritoVonBean,2,Thu Apr 30 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"Hostile in terms of internal content, or hostile towards the reader because of the style/events?"
dune,34cpbz,lundse,2,Thu Apr 30 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"Most people I know who felt this way said that the reader was treated like Paul: introduced to a foreign and dangerous setting. They knew things moving, but didn't know what or how. Some found it frustrating, some found it boring. It depends on whether they could identify the themes among the Scifi or if they cared more about the characters than anything else."
dune,34cpbz,lundse,2,Thu Apr 30 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"I've heard some people get annoyed at the vocabulary. Maybe find the absilutely necessary parts of the terminology and recommend those. Get an electronic version, find-replace all instances of the words in the terminology with some kind of marker (so you get ""A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit_WEIRD_TERM knows."") Check whether the word is absolutely necessary for understanding, and if so, put it on the list.  Oh, and a good summation of the setting. Some people struggle there, I think. It can be quite different, also to people who have read a lot of scifi. Let people know we are talking far future, ftl travel, no computers and a lot of feudal houses and highly specialised guilds."
dune,34cpbz,adyne,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"That's a nice idea. Working with the first several chapters would probably ease the transition quite a bit for new readers.  Do you think the chapter intros are similarly confusing? Not the quotes, necessarily, but the attributions. Seeing things like ""The Manual of Muad'Dib, by Princess Irulan"" 15 pages in might make people feel like they're missing something. Manual of who now? Princess wha?  Actually, that's not a bad line to put near the top of the guide: If you don't recognize a name/reference, you aren't missing something. Keep reading!"
dune,34aniv,the_injog,3,Wed Apr 29 17:08:58 2015 UTC,Holy shit!  A thumper!
dune,34aniv,burzmali,2,Wed Apr 29 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"That is actually really awesome, and makes sense even though it sounds crazy.  Although sandworms don't have natural predators (at least in the time period of the books), maybe, where ever sandworms originated, there were giant burrowing mole-like creatures that preyed upon the worms.   And the worms could have a genetic/ancestral memory of these long forgotten beasts that would devour gigantic sandworms.  Then again, the sandworms rely on vibration to detect movement on the dunes of Arrakis. Thumpers don't go that deep into the ground, compared to the wooden stakes driven into the earth in the video OP provided. Similar to how spiders feel subtle movements on their webs which signals a meal.  That's more likely, although giant badgers is a fun idea to play with."

dune,34bdgq,bradfo83,5,Wed Apr 29 20:16:00 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I feel like the scifi show made no attempt to reconcile Franks character descriptions with their casting.  Also the sets really grated on me. For a book that had such epic vistas it was just a terrible visual translation.
dune,34bdgq,kalemklub,4,Wed Apr 29 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like it made more of an effort to be faithful to the book than Lynch's version did. But of all things, it was the costumes that really tested my patience. I still remember the bouncing butterflies on Irulan's dress at the party scene, and it makes the whole thing look so dated and clearly made in the death throes of the nineties."
dune,34bdgq,lundse,2,Thu Apr 30 02:41:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Why they spent half the money on hats, and next to nothing on getting the desert right, I'll never know..."
dune,34bdgq,SpiceVisions,3,Thu Apr 30 08:27:31 2015 UTC,"I can't do the mini-series. I've tried at least a couple of times, but similar to what /u/SchnauzerFremen said, there's something about it that I find really grating. If anything it makes me appreciate Lynch's vision a bit more."
dune,34bdgq,-sgma-,5,Wed Apr 29 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"I agree vehemently.  The casting choice for Paul, and also for EVERYONE ELSE, is absolutely unbearable in that adaptation.  For all of the weird flaws in the Lynch version, I love all of the sets, the costumes are great, the cast is amazing, a lot of the writing is good, and the vibe and atmosphere are excellent.  And the soundtrack by Toto!  A lot of good stuff there actually.  But even though people do like to point out that the plot of the TV miniseries more closely mirrors that of the novel, I feel that it is spiritually and aesthetically much much further from the novel than the Lynch adaptation.  And the TV adaptation goes so much further than just casting with its failures.  Has anyone else noticed that many of the great lines have either been edited and turned into mediocre lines, or delivered so badly in the TV version that even highlights of the book are turned into embarrasments?  Thanks for bringing this up.    One final, disturbing thought:  Brian Herbert said that the SyFy version was great.  And he's the one who controls the license for this intellectual property.  I do believe there could be a great adaptation ... and that it can't happen during Brian Herbert's lifetime.  Which is really sad."
dune,34bdgq,lundse,2,Sat May 2 10:28:44 2015 UTC,"You know, I think some measure of Paul-as-kind-of-a-selfrighteous-jerk might be in order. He did use the fremen as tools. He did bring the Jihad and was quite smug about it at the end of Dune.  But I agree. The Paul of the miniseries was too old and too... ""standard selfassured badass"", I guess. Like every other movie hero and their nephew.  Paul should be more vulnerable, quite a bit younger, more intelligent and maybe a tad too proud to be a Duke's son?"
dune,34bdgq,Tupile,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:30:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely on Paul.  I definitely have some problems with the mini-series, but I must say the special effects with the Worms are really impressive.  Way more intense than the visual I had in my head while reading"

dune,345v3j,charliereeves15,15,Tue Apr 28 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"Paul's training in the Bene Gesserit Weirding Way certainly helped him train the Fedaykin and earn their loyalty.   Paul also benefited from training he received from Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Duncan Idaho who was a Ginaz Swordmaster.    Muad'Dib was basically the ""total package"" military commander with a mind sharpened to a razor's edge (potential mentat training) and filled with knowledge of multiple forms of combat, in hand-to-hand situations as well as strategic and tactical (bigger picture) situations.    Being the Kwisatz Haderach didn't hurt, etiher."
dune,345v3j,stovor,5,Tue Apr 28 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"of all of those I imagine Thufir is perhaps the greatest teacher, I mean having a Mentat-Level 'Master of Assassins' as a tutor would be pretty cool"
dune,345v3j,WeightyUnit88,8,Tue Apr 28 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"I think all three of them were great in their own ways.  Thufir's cerebral mentat-trained way of thinking, as well as essentially acting as the Duke's spymaster, would certainly be useful.  Gurney Halleck, while not the greatest warrior around, could hold his own in a fight and his ability to lead and inspire his men would definitely pay dividends.    However I think when it comes to straight military training, it would be difficult to top Duncan Idaho as his best teacher.  While the Ginaz school certainly teaches its students hand-to-hand sword and knife fighting, as well as how to fight with and without a shield, Ginaz graduates were also instructed on how to lead a whole army.  Skills such as planning attacks/defenses, managing supplies, and overall strategic thinking were absolutely crucial in Paul's plan to defeat Emperor Shaddam."
dune,345v3j,stovor,5,Tue Apr 28 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"Early in the book there is a part where it goes over Leto's thoughts as he takes over Arrakis.  One of his big fears is that the Harkonnen's trap would work, and so he started training Paul on guerrilla warfare tactics.  I would think that training makes him the best military fit for the Fremen."
dune,345v3j,Hamuel,7,Tue Apr 28 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"he was the Fremen's prophecized ""messiah"" which gave him enormous religious power, and he used that power to lead the Fremen."
dune,345v3j,ZloMoHoMo,3,Tue Apr 28 15:45:33 2015 UTC,Much is said about the brilliant ability the Atreides had for leadership.

Then the Jihad series, then the sequels.   The prequels are actually really fun. I understand and accept that they are not anywhere near the level of Frank's writing, but hey its more time spent in the universe and they still are fun, so I really enjoyed them (Plus when I was really young, KJA's Star Wars books are what made me love to read, so I may be a bit biased)."

Dune - Dune Messiah - Children of Dune - God Emperor of Dune - Heretics of Dune - Chapterhouse Dune.  That's all you really need.  If you want more, you can look into the novels by his son and Kevin J Anderson, but I found them to be poorly-written attempts to cash in on Frank Herbert's legacy.

Even if there was another Leto who was not related to Leto Atreides the first, he would still be called Leto the second.  I did not know this at first, and was confused as to why the God Emperor was not also called Leto III, since he was the third of his name."
dune,33jun0,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 10 23:45:30 2015 UTC,"Regnal number:       Regnal numbers are ordinal numbers used to distinguish among persons with the same name who held the same office. Most importantly, they are used to distinguish monarchs. An ordinal is the number placed after a monarch's regnal name to differentiate between a number of kings, queens or princes reigning the same territory with the same regnal name.  It is common to start counting either since the beginning of the monarchy, or since the beginning of a particular line of state succession. For example, Boris III of Bulgaria and his son Simeon II were given their regnal numbers because the medieval rulers of the First and Second Bulgarian Empire were counted as well even if the present Bulgarian state dated only back to 1878 and were only distantly related to the previous Bulgarian states. [citation needed] On the other hand, the kings of England were counted starting with the Norman Conquest. That is why the son of Henry III of England is counted as Edward I even though there were three Edwards before the Conquest.  Sometimes legendary or fictional persons are included. For example, the Swedish kings Eric XIV (reigned 1560–68) and Charles IX (1604–11) took ordinals based on a fanciful 1544 history by Johannes Magnus, which invented six kings of each name before those accepted by later historians.   In any case, it is usual to count only the monarchs or heads of the family, and to number them sequentially up to the end of the dynasty. [citation needed] A notable exception to this rule is the German House of Reuss. This family has the particularity that every male member during the last centuries was named Heinrich, and all of them, not only the head of the family, were numbered. While the members of the elder branch were numbered in order of birth until the extinction of the branch in 1927, the members of the younger line were (and still are) numbered in sequences that began and ended roughly as centuries began and ended. This explains why the current head of the Reuss family is called Heinrich IV, his son Heinrich XIV and his son Heinrich XXIX.

dune,32vxzj,G3orge11,17,Fri Apr 17 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"It's not teleportation or anything close to that, at least for the BG when Farad'n is writing.  It's more about achieving oneness with your body and your strikes become closer to automatic.  You can look at your enemy, know how they will attack you and automatically respond without any resistance from your body or time wasted considering your options. You've unlocked your mind to the point you don't need to think about doing it, you just can.  Another example in this vein would be where Paul can make mentat like jumps via intuition even before he has his full prescience ability unlocked.  There is part of his mind working on a level beyond conscious though that supplies him with data and courses of action.    In reading Farad'n Corrino's report I think he's talking about more the body obeying the mind.  At that time skilled assassins and such can still kill BG with a fair degree of success.  So the BG aren't playing with teleportation or something that gives them an insurmountable edge.  Also if it was teleportation/mental ability based then Paul couldn't have trained the Fedaykin.  None of them were potential Kwisatz Haderach's, rather simply due to their spice diet and harsh conditions they could accept the training regarding muscle control, etc.  Paul also is described as fighting using a combined style of the BG, Duncan Idaho, and Gurney which I think further suggests at that time the BG were just one of the better classes of meele fighter in the Known Universe.    Overtime people get fasted due to evolution (and the Honored Matres are faster because they'd use more brutal methods and direct genetic engineering as opposed to the BG breeding program method, also perhaps the drugs the Honored Matres used in lieu if spice).  However the ultimate peak with someone like Teg comes back to foldspace at some level I believe.  Keep in mind a Navigator can see the future and foldspace to move a Heighliner across the galaxy.  Paul and Leto II have the same mental abilities as a Navigator and it is implied that another course of action for Paul would have been to go to the Guild, but you never see Paul or Leto II interact with foldspace although it seems if they had walked that path they could have.  Teg has no Holtzman engine but he can move so quickly that for all practical purposes time seems dilated in his favor.  So perhaps he just super fast or perhaps is there some path finding prescience trick he's using al la how Navigators selected Heighliner paths.  Teg also has a massive calorie consumption requirement for his trick, something Paul never needed after fighting.    What is odd about Teg is that obviously the human race has advanced (see for example Leton II's Duncans being useless at hand to hand combat by the end of Leto II's reign).  Yet Teg can accelerate to some level that means him untouchable.  Paul for example actually has issues dealing with Feyd-Rautha (Feyd can at least make a fight out of it) and it's implied Hasmir could have killed a tired Paul.  But Teg can accelerate himself to levels that put him far above other humans.  So he's some sort of break through, but we never get told the specifics on what went so right for him."

He seems to teleport although he is just moving extremely fast.   Also if it was teleportation/mental ability based then Paul couldn't have trained the Fedaykin. None of them were potential Kwisatz Haderach's, rather simply due to their spice diet and harsh conditions they could accept the training regarding muscle control, etc.   I disagree with this as well, you don't need to be a potential Kwisatz to know the weirding way, Jessica could do it before she ever took the waters of life. It simply requires strong mental/physical capabilities, due to Fremen conditions they were already essentially peak human.  As for your original questions regarding speed, Farrad'n can explain it because he needs (for plot) to or rather understands the mechanics behind it therefore knows what's happening even if he can't perceive it. Either way the cause of their speeds is diversity/evolution."
dune,32vxzj,Cai_E,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"Then we agree, I don't think it was teleportation.  I was listing reasons why it was unlikely to be teleportation, such as the fast those who lacked the prescient ability to guide through foldspace could still learn the weirding way.  Thus simply an extremely fast fighting style."
dune,32vxzj,xxmindtrickxx,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I may have misread your first paragraph or something. But I do think in Dune it is described as teleportation iirc, so there's some interpretation there."
dune,32vxzj,El_Camino_SS,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"Good post. I'd argue that LetoII was more powerful than any Duncan Idaho ghola.  The description of LetoII is that he could slither surprisingly fast, and was fully capable of killing with his bulk.  In GEoD he kills a Duncan brandishing a lasgun, who cuts one of his vestigial legs and wounds him before he crushes him."
dune,32vxzj,syncsynchalt,3,Fri Apr 17 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"My understanding (with no cites) is that BG can move quickly but consciously, the HM move just as quickly but without consciousness (direct nerve impulse without the cerebral round trip), and Teg is a whole other deal in that his consciousness is sped up."
dune,32vxzj,Kaneshadow,2,Fri Apr 17 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"I always thought of it in terms of the drug analogies.  The BG use spice to increase their awareness of their own body, so with much training they can gain abilities beyond normal humans.  The HM's drug is a stimulant, so it's granting them greater speed and power but at a price.  My memories of Heretics and Chapterhouse are a little fuzzy but that's always how I imagined it.  I actually don't remember what's up with Teg at all."

dune,32t7u3,Rezzick,2,Tue May 5 02:53:46 2015 UTC,"Okay then, Naib.   But one thing though, why was it so important for Leto II to find Jacurutu?"
dune,32t7u3,Rezzick,8,Thu Apr 16 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"He had visions about Jacurutu being integral to the Golden Path.  Turns out he was right, as he is tested with the spice essence by Gurney and Namri while he is being held captive there, awakening his Kwisatz Haderach powers.  This is also where he finds the sandtrout that he forms a symbiotic relationship with, enabling him to become the God Emperor and live for thousands of years.  He and Ghanima also theorize that The Preacher could be Paul Atreides, and that he may have been taken in by the cast out.  This factors less into his overall motivation to go to Jacurutu/Shuloch, but he certainly wants to find out the truth about his father's fate."
dune,32t7u3,Cyberya,3,Thu Apr 16 15:36:09 2015 UTC,Because of the prescient dreams he was having. He knew Jacurutu was where he would begin the Golden Path but he didn't know the exact how or when because he hadn't gone into the spice trance.
dune,32t7u3,Kills_Zombies,2,Thu Apr 16 15:37:04 2015 UTC,It's interesting how Leto and Ghanima manage to keep their other egos in order whereas Alia is failing. Is it because Leto II & Ghanima still has Chani's ego protecting from being taken over even after spice trance?
dune,32t7u3,StashTheBashar,3,Fri Apr 17 05:11:28 2015 UTC,"Chani mostly protects Ghanima. When Ghanima forces herself to believe that Leto II is dead, that plus Chani is what allows her to develop her own personality. Leto II on the other hand makes a pact with an ancestor named Harum to control all the egos inside of him.   Really though, Alia failed because those who could have helped her, abandoned her to her fate. Which is why Leto tells Jessica to pity her."

dune,32tbrb,DexTsarII,2,Thu Apr 16 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"I read the ones directly preceding Dune and remember very little. It's probably better that way.   The ""House"" series, were not terrible, but the retcon is strong with them. I felt like a few of the plot lines in that series were really to set up for the final two books, (Hunters of Dune, Sandworms of Dune), much in the same way they included plot and characters from their Jihad series into them.  I mean they introduced No-ships and synthetic spice well before the events of God Emperor and Heretics... And we should not forget Rhombar(sp?)-more-machine-than-man.  On the note of synthetic spice pre-Scattering; seems like a step backwards from Frank's Golden Path. Leto terraformed Arrakis, to make spice next to nonexistent (among other reasons), so humans would not be a slave to it. If the Tleilaxu had knowledge of synthetic spice going out into the Scattering, humans would not be rid of our dependence on it."

The writing already reads like screen copy for a TV series (very similar to Game of Thrones, IMO)."

dune,32ig5b,Feranor,25,Wed Apr 15 11:25:41 2015 UTC,"Dune will never make for good TV. The problem is that you cannot ""show"" the story properly; it is too cerebral. There are certain aspects of the story that you need to be aware of to understand the story properly; the problem is that there is no way to convey those aspects to the audience. Any attempt to stay true to the source material will come across as really cheesy, and without the explanatory ""cheese"" you are left with a shadow of the actual story."

dune,32ig5b,soljwf,5,Tue Apr 14 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"Dune verbatim could never be translated to TV but it could be heavily adapted to make it work.  The cerebral aspects are tough but doable. I can't imagine them getting the same feeling the novel gives but who knows. The biggest blocker with Dune is the complexity. Huge costly cuts need to be made, so the trick is about knowing what to cut.  You can't try to David Lynch it explaining everything upfront, you have to simplify the universe, or find a way to introduce things very gradually. The Sci Fi channel miniseries did a better job of it, but they didn't cut enough. For example, you could replace the entire Corrino web of characters with just the emperor and you wouldn't lose much."
dune,32ig5b,soljwf,2,Tue Apr 14 14:52:11 2015 UTC,i think they would have said hat same about auperhero movies a few decades back.  i agree though that nobody will dare to try.

dune,32ig5b,lundse,2,Wed Apr 15 11:41:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of books were considered unfilmable and their film adaptations turned out to be major successes. Both Trainspotting and LA Confidential fell into this category. They just needed strong writers, producers, and directors behind them to adapt them from page to screen.  With a tv series they'd also have the added benefit of not being confined to a 2 hour running time, but instead have at least half a season to delve into storylines and character development. I think Dune would actually make a better TV series than a movie because of this."
dune,32ig5b,NoMoreMrNiceGaius_6,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"The difference is that they said that about Dune, then they proved it, twice. I would bet the full television series treatment would meet with similar failure, unless you completely abandon the central message at the heart of the story."
dune,32ig5b,NHureau,2,Wed Apr 15 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"Problem with Lynch's Dune was that he relied too heavily on exposition when film is a visual medium and he bloated the script with a lot of unnecessary elements. I actually liked the mini-series, and it did gain Sci-Fi two Emmys and Sci-Fi even brought John Harrison back on as screenwriter for the sequel so it wasn't a complete failure.   With a strong production team I think Dune could be executed well. Game of Thrones lost a lot of details from the books in it's TV adaptation, but it was still able to stay strong and be a financial and critical success for HBO. And if John Hodge could successfully adapt a novel like Trainspotting into a coherent film there has to be screenwriter out there that can do the same for Dune.   I think a full season or more of a TV series could easily tackle the central message of Dune, as opposed to a two hour movie. TV series allow a lot more leeway for character development and slower buildup of story arcs."

dune,32ig5b,dormeur,6,Wed Apr 22 12:45:53 2015 UTC,"absolutely. it is also similar to the game of thrones. there is no need for an expensive budget and action scenes in my opinion, if you can just build up the dune atmosphere in a couple of sets and then go with the dialogues and intrigues of politics of the galaxy.   there is so much source to develop on for a good show."
dune,32ig5b,SietchTabr,3,Tue Apr 14 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"OK, so scifi did this. It was a miniseries. What was wrong with that?   Dune is nothing like game of thrones at all."

dune,32ig5b,stovor,2,Tue Apr 14 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"My main beef with the Sci-Fi channel miniseries is the super low budgeting made them look chintzy.  I also feel the casting of the Fremen was way off... they used eastern European actors for people who were clearly based on the Bedouin people.  While the story was truer to the books, it definitely left me feeling disappointed.  With regards to the Lynch movie, that's a whole different can of worms.  Poor adaptation of the source material, weirding modules, the damn rain at the end of the film... but what that film lacked in substance it more than made up for with style - everything in that looked more like Dune to me than the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, plus they had some great actors like Patrick Stewart and Jürgen Procknow in the film.  If adapted properly, and given the proper budget, a new Dune series on HBO or another premium network could be really well executed.  So basically 1) better writing/adaptation of the source material and 2) throw more money at it than Sci-Fi channel was willing to."
dune,32ig5b,SietchTabr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"I thought both were great. HBO can't afford anything more than Sci-Fi did, though. So that's not gonna work."
dune,32ig5b,stovor,4,Tue Apr 14 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'll have to wholeheartedly disagree with you about what HBO can afford to spend on a show.  They can afford quite a bit more than Sci-Fi did ten years ago. Each of the Dune miniseries cost around $20 million to make.  Every season of Game of Thrones costs HBO on average $60 million.  So they've already invested $300 million into Game of Thrones over 5 seasons.  With how popular Game of Thrones has become, HBO realizes they can invest significant money into a show and get returns via subscriptions and merchandising fees."
dune,32ig5b,generaltsao,3,Tue Apr 14 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"In addition, Dune series would have fewer locations that required simultaneous filming which would drastically redue cost compared to GoT, also, guessing here but the cast of Dune would be smaller than the cast of GoT. Let's see, locations: Caladin at first then never again (sell the set). Arrakis, you can probably film that in north america, we have deserts (save money on travel).   Harkonen world is almost surely has to be filmed in a studio or made on a computer.   Same for the emperor's planet. What do you think?  Both the emporer and the Baron remain indoors. They can be filmed in studio.   The truth is, the real reason I want Dune back is I think Lady Jessica could be the most best female character in TV history."
dune,32ig5b,stovor,2,Tue Apr 14 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"Those are good points.  Especially for the early Dune books, we really only need around 15 core characters to cast, with maybe 10-15 more secondary characters for each story.  Filming locations sound about right.  Caladan could even just be an interior set with a CGI background of the ocean/harbor (sort of like the Coruscant scenes in the Star Wars prequels).  Breaking Bad filmed extensively in the desert in the American Southwest, and I think they could find plenty of areas to fit Arrakis.  Only thing is that it's physically tough on people and equipment to film on location in the desert.  Establishing shots of Arrakeen would probably be pure CGI or a blend of CGI/miniatures to get the scale right of some of the buildings/heighliners.    Fremen sietches would likely be interior sets constructed on sound stages, and you'd get some re-use out of them through the first five books.  I think there's only a couple of scenes in the book that take place on Giedi Prime, one of them being Feyd's arena duel against the captured Atreides warrior.  That'd probably be a set like they used on Starz' Spartacus for the Capua arena scenes.  I think the rest would be interior set w/ CGI background like Caladan.  Same goes for the limited scenes on Kaitain with the Corrinos and Count Fenring.  There's not nearly as much cost in the prop department when compared to GoT, considering we don't need period-accurate recreations of armor and weapons from the middle ages."
dune,32ig5b,SietchTabr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"So if I understand you correctly -- you are advocating all of the same things that SyFy did, but with the only difference being HBO's name?"
dune,32ig5b,SietchTabr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"SyFy for instance spent more than $200M on Stargate SG1. If you adjust all of that for inflation it's as much as $240M. SyFy spent $80M on Defiance season 1 more recently. Each season of GoT does not cost HBO $60M anymore because that's how series work. Once you have all of the sets and costumes and actors and everything in line, costs decrease.  At their current budgets, SyFy spends more anyways. $20M 10 years ago on three episodes is more than GoT anyways."
dune,32ig5b,generaltsao,2,Tue Apr 14 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"Along with the other guy I have to emphasize, politely, just how much I disagree with you. HBO would throw HBO money at Dune. Tautology. HBO money : Sci-Fi money :: Arrakis : a sandbox  On the one hand, sci-fi channel (syfy) lowbudget shitkickers.   On the other hand, HBO, undisputed heavyweight champion of television.   Your analysis is off, that's all. Oh, and of course I liked both the movie and the miniseries. HBO would make it 100x better"
dune,32ig5b,SietchTabr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:26:25 2015 UTC,I think you should do some research on SyFy vs HBO and who owns who and how much money is at the disposal of each. I can save you the trouble: SyFy budgets are generally bigger nowawdays than HBO. The parent company's owner has 3x the revenue as HBO's. Just so you know.

dune,32m2yg,Octinomos,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"The acting and costumes/set design in the SyFy show were generally pretty bad, but at least they got the story mostly right. If you can remove yourself from these things it's sort of watchable just for a quick refresher of the story. I'd rather just read the books though for that. I generally don't even really think of watching it.  On the other hand despite its flaws I still really enjoy occasionally watching the lynch dune. I love its strange atmosphere.   On a general note, I doubt it is Brian Herbert who is holding back a quality Dune TV series or movie. It seems silly to blame him just because he wrote some crappy books. I just don't think that there is a market there right now, despite a relatively small passionate fan base. The first venture was a huge financial failure. The second might just still be too fresh in people's minds. It's old hat, and I doubt a studio would want to risk it."

Publishers would only touch his other works if he promised to write more Dune books, it must have chafed him something fierce.   I'm reaching here but iirc Heretics bought his wife the Honolulu property or something to that effect."
dune,32h1tj,Psyladine,3,Mon Apr 13 20:53:10 2015 UTC,His wife died after God Emperor and she was his editor.
dune,32h1tj,FauxShizzle,3,Mon Apr 13 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound right...per the wiki, God Emperor was 1981 and Heretics was 1984, the year she died. I could be mistaken, it's been a while since I slogged through Dreamer of Dune but I believe he went back to the Dune universe with a sigh."
dune,32h1tj,Psyladine,3,Mon Apr 13 21:03:04 2015 UTC,"She didn't edit Heretics, at least not in full. She was in poor health and God Emperor was the last piece she dedicated time toward with him. Whether he went back to work on Dune reluctantly or not, I don't know."
dune,32h1tj,FauxShizzle,19,Tue Apr 14 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"Give Heretics a shot.  It does not contain long, philosophical passages like God Emperor, if you didn't enjoy that aspect of the book.  In addition, there is much to explore--Heretics shows you the results of the Golden Path.  It also has arguably one of the most badass characters in the whole series (Miles Teg).  There's plenty of action and plot twists to keep you going, and you also get to learn a whole lot more about the T'leilaxu and their rather unique culture and perspective."

I know people here love it because it's heady, broooo, but I found the pacing in GeoD to be abysmal and the character of Leto II to be unlikable, and not simply because that was part of his Golden Path strategy. If GeoD was rewritten to alternate between Leto's and Siona's pespectives, I think it could have been much better. (But not by Brian Herbert, please Lord!)  Anyway, Heretics is a return to form, although it's still along the decreasing curve of quality for me."

My post was none of those things.   and whiny shitposting at that.   By the definition of The Oxfords Learner Dictionary Yes, I was complaining about the last five books. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to express my dissatisfaction with the books if I don't complain about them but the fact you've accused me of whining and attributed tone to my opinions is entirely your own work. I didn't leave you a voicemail.   It turns out this isn't the only sub you've subjected to that kind of posting either, which just made me all the happier to have downvoted your comment.   Oh right. So you've taken into account some of the less positive conversations I've had on reddit but  have you took into account the many positive conversations I've had on reddit. No?  I didn't think so and that hardly seems completely fair.  I've seen this sort of behaviour before. Like if you point out the many inconsistencies in the bible for example. Instead of countering with evidence (which of course is impossible) they instead attempt to draw the conversation away or discredit the person or their position.  You could have just down voted and walked away. You could have also explained what it is you really love about the last five books and possibly convinced me to re-read them but you've done none of these things.  If you don't agree with what I have to say, that's fine, I'm perfectly fine with you disagreeing. In many regards I welcome it. I've learnt a lot from differing opinions but learn little from people who agree with me. I enjoy debate as long as it's civil.

I did nothing of the sort, and my response was based purely on the pre-emptive whining about downvoting, then the obnoxious edit about same;  I think I made that pretty clear in my original response.

You understand this isn't a personal attack on yourself and I get no pleasure from demeaning something you've took pleasure from.  Ok, in the books defence, I've only read the other five books once. Although I appreciated Dune immediately I enjoyed it almost as much (possible more) on the following reads.  I will admit there is (an albeit slim chance) that I've come to a hasty conclusion as I have done that before however I found the sequels to be increasingly nonsensical. It's been a long time since I've read them but some of the concepts he dabbled with really spoilt the universe  Spoiler  Now I know what you (or some other less tactful individuals might say).  Aren't the books story already outlandish?  To which I say no. It's incredibly far fetched but to me one of the things I love about Dune is that it talks about Mentats, Bene Gesserit and it explains why they came to being in the first place and to me, it made sense.   As I read further and further into the subsequent books I found myself becoming ever increasingly disenchanted with the story. The first book was tight. It seems that it lacked for nothing and to quote Antoine de Saint Exupéry ""It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.""  I felt the first book was as near to perfection because it had everything it needed and nothing more. I wish there were no other books or that they were better conceived.  I wish I could cite more references from the following books but as I say it's been a long time since I've read them. They disappointed me greatly but I say this with the utmost sincerity; If you enjoyed them then I'm happy for you and I'm also happy for you to explain to me politely, why you think I might be wrong."

Although this subreddit is about Dune and would therefore attract hardcore fans like myself (dunatics, one might say), it's actually refreshing to hear a critique of the series from someone who didn't like it as much as others.   I totally understand that the increasing craziness of the story arc could be a little too much to take, and also might be interpreted as Herbert improvising as he went along.  I won't presume to tell you that you're wrong--it's your opinion.  This is a subjective matter. I will say that for me, the more outlandish, bizarre, and alien a sci-fi novel or series is, the better."

These events are set in motion by beings who have taken on the roles of the Greek gods. Like Simmons' earlier series, the Hyperion Cantos, the novel is a form of ""literary science fiction"" which relies heavily on intertextuality, in this case with Homer and Shakespeare, as well as periodic references to Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu (or In Search of Lost Time) and Vladimir Nabokov's novel Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle.

dune,327e0q,Realik,10,Sat Apr 11 11:03:40 2015 UTC,I think Dune executed the concept better. Frank Herbert strived to capture the evolution of human culture through time.
dune,327e0q,davidlovesjava,9,Sat Apr 11 12:06:34 2015 UTC,Herbert is also a better writer. Foundation is pretty painful to read sometimes.
dune,327e0q,Aluhut,6,Sat Apr 11 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that.  The Foundation series suffers very much from having Asimov's typically flat characters.  The ideas and the universe are quite interesting, but none of the people in it felt particularly real, rounded, or interesting."
dune,327e0q,koralatov,2,Sat Apr 11 16:04:42 2015 UTC,"You have to like Asimov's writing style for it to rise to the level of Dune.  I think people generally have less difficulty with Frank's writing style than Asimov's, as complex as it is.  I do love Asimov, but sometimes his writing style -- the same thing that makes him so accessible in non-fiction (a polymath in that arena) -- makes him completely inaccessible in fiction.  A man who writes robots has a harder time with people."

dune,327e0q,Trevoke,3,Sat Apr 11 15:25:12 2015 UTC,"Foundation might be hit or miss for OP since he says that he hates reading Sci-Fi.  Asimov creates a very interesting and large universe (especially if you include the Robot and Empire books as well). He also tends to focus more on big deep ideas and he doesn't linger on the technical details much. So even though the technology described seems painfully dated at times, the books themselves aged well since the ideas explored are just as interesting and relevant today.  On the other hand while the grand ideas and the general plot are super interesting (on a large scale) I think he fails to deliver on a smaller human scale - his writing gets somewhat 'dry' when it comes to individual characters, their interactions and relationships. The books in question also reflect the old social structures. Basically most of the main characters are male and the very few women who make an appearance are generally portrayed as timid and clueless housewives.  I would definitely recommend Foundation to any Sci-Fi fan but it might not be the best pick for people who generally dislike science fiction."

dune,327e0q,matckama,6,Sat Apr 11 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"Gibson ... that's all blinking lights and cool ninja-esque characters.  I couldn't really take the rastafari rebel space station in Neuromancer, it really feeds on obvious culutral stereotypes. He does have at times beautiful, although not very concise, prose, though, I'll give him that. But when it comes to political concepts, like Herbert worked with, Gibson is not what I would recommend ... But that's just me.  Saying this, I will instead recommend the greatest sci-fi author, in my opinion. Ursula K Leguin in many ways far surpasses Herbert when it comes to conceptual depth (even though they're two different beasts). Herbert is a bit more eccentric and wild (yay, home schooling!) in his ideas and opinions, which can be crazy and at the same time really inspiring to read, but Leguin really nails political themes in a fully realized fashion. The Hainish books are superb, and like Dune, they are set over thousands of years. Read them in any order you want, but do not miss out on The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. I always recommend these books to people who are not interested in sci-fi, because they should be considered modern classics that everyone should read.  You can also read books outside the Hainish cycle. The Lath of Heaven is often her most recommended book (although personally I like her more sociologically and anthropologically themed books better), I also really admired Changing Planes, a (somewhat) more recent addition to her catalogue, which was both funny, witty and serious.  And you can also read the Earthsea books, if you want. The first book is, like Dune, more of an adventure, but as the series goes on it becomes more philosophical and ponders life, death and aging beautifully."

I'm personally someone who don't care so much about about what's appropriate or not (all children should read Crime and Punishment, haha) for children, but A Wizard of Earthsea is actually intended for young readers. I read it when I was 10, and I loved it. The first three books (which can be considered an encapsulated triology) are very much suitable for a younger reader, book four might leave younger persons a bit confused and bored (it's basically a quite dreary gender role study of her already established universe - the best book of the series, though, in my opinion). Book five ties up the final knots, gets more spiritual, moralistic and out there."

But I do like this sentence (in a blog post of hers that was a bit problematic and hasty in other ways, as you can read on her follow up post http://ursulakleguin.com/Blog2015.html) about how she views fantasy:  ""Fantasy is probably the oldest literary device for talking about reality.""

Herbert writes about the pinnacles of humanity and how they touch the species.  Heinlein focuses more on the human to human.  I love them both.  Herbert will always be a guide for me in perspective and outward thinking, but Heinlein will always be a guide on enjoying the little things."

dune,31rpit,minuscatenary,18,Fri Apr 10 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try an explanation but beware of Spoilers below.  IF that rumour would've been true the whole golden path would've been pointless and humanity would still be slaves to both the Melange and one leader who can see the future - exactly the same mistake humanity made before Leto II. and what the whole golden path is about - to abandon those needs to survive.  Maybe it's also something personal as his (Letos) whole suffering would've been pointless. The whole Diaspora (see Book 5) would've been impossible and therefore the survival of humanity would still be in danger.   Furthermore the myth itself shows that humanity still wants a strong leader which is exactly the opposite of what Leto wants to achieve during his reign. His whole reign is there for humanity to receive a 'never again' effect, similiar what happend to the world after Hitler.   TL;DR: If the myth is true the golden path has failed."
dune,31rpit,Ortopox,4,Mon Apr 13 02:46:45 2015 UTC,"You're, of course, correct.  However, I'd also suggest that for Leto the proposition is also deeply disturbing for very personal, familial reasons.  Leto lived his entire mortal life believing his father to be dead. Then a blind lunatic emerged from the desert and Leto knew it to be Mua'dib.    The first thing Leto did after surviving his ordeal at Jacaruutu was to seek Paul out and convince him of the necessity of the Golden Path and to understand why Paul decided to not only abandon it but to seemingly wander into the desert to die alone.  Paul stressed that the Golden Path would force its walker to become a monster, to do unspeakable things, to become an even bigger despot and villain than the Corinno. More than that, the Golden Path would create the biggest mass murderer and tyrant in the history of humanity.  Paul turned away because he couldn't face becoming that. He turned away because his greatest fear was that his children could become that.   He returned from the desert because Alia showed a fraction of the perversion necessary to enact the Path. He denounced her for much less than would be required over the next ten thousand years.  But Leto convinced his father, the most important man in his universe, that he was powerful and capable enough to do it. He urged his father to believe in him, and the first and last thing Paul does for Leto is to do just that: to believe in his son.  Think about the power of that. Paul had never needed to believe in anyone else before. He was an all-knowing God, and he submitted to Leto.  If Paul somehow had secreted himself away it would have meant that he didn't believe in Leto, and that the sacrifices that Leto made were either in vain or unnecessary.  Remember that Leto is not only a figurative monster but a literal one. He's a grotesque horror reviled by many for his actions and his self.  If you turned yourself into that only after your father blessed it, how would you feel if he had secretly planned for your failure?"

This Jihad spread throughout the entire galaxy, pillaging millions of planets. A few campaigns include those on Naraj and its moons. The Fremen Fedaykin commander Farok was head of the Naraj Campaign.  The only planet that was spared the raging fire of Muad'Dib's Jihad was the home world of House Atreides, Caladan. Lady Jessica, mother of Paul Muad'Dib, refused the Fremen any access to the planet, including religious pilgrimage.  The Jihad ended in 10206 AG.

dune,31q274,Thirtydegrees,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The Corrino emperors could not pick off the great houses one by one with the Sardukar, because all the other houses would just chip in and pay their friendly neighbourhood (independent) Guild for a freighter roundtrip among their garrisons, ending at the imperial court.  Paul has the Guild by the consciousness-spectrum-expanding-drug-planet. Pauls Jihad was one planet at a time, at a tempo of the fremens chosing."
dune,31q274,lundse,3,Thu Apr 9 11:29:38 2015 UTC,"You're correct in that Paul's control of the Guild was what made the difference, you're not quite correct about why.  House Corrino ruled because only in aggregate did the great houses of the Laandsrad match the might of the Sardaukar until the emergence of the Fedaykin.   It's made abundantly clear that the Spacing Guild charges absurd rates for the transport of military personnel. It's illuminated in this exchange between The Baron and Rabban after they kill the Duke.   ""Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?"" ""Expensive, eh?"" ""Expensive!"" The Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. ""If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, you'll just barely repay us!""   The Harkonnen are among the richest houses in the galaxy and the transport of enough Sardaukar to defeat one Great House put them in so much debt that even the richest prize in that galaxy would have to be bled for generations to cover the expenditure.  The other houses could never have afforded to fight the Corinno. The Guild needed stability, it needed stagnation, it's one of the reasons why Leto later destroys them.  When Paul seizes control of spice production, he earns the biggest advantage in the universe besides the Fedaykin: he doesn't have to pay the guild a dime.  His jihad is subsidized in a way that allows a galaxy wide pacification in a way that the Corinno emperors never could."
dune,31q274,remember_citadel,2,Fri Apr 10 04:33:44 2015 UTC,"Good point. I wouldn't say it contradicts mine, but you are right to point out that the great houses would need quite a bit more than to shake hands and pay the bus driver, to wage war on the emperor.  The Emperor truly was just allowed to take the throne by the Guild. Maybe it would be an idea to read through the series focussing only on the Guild, the various monopolies on navigation (and maybe prescience).  In a way, the Guild was the oracle causing a safe road of stagnation, long before Paul took over. Sort of parallel to the Corrino-Harkonnen-Atreides dynamic, we have the Guild-Paul-Leto II:   The Corrino were on top in a political system they dominated. The Baron was maneuvering to take that position over in a few generations, doing quite a good job of it while using similar tools of statecraft and kanly. Paul broke the rules, was something outside their context, and won because of it. The Guild was navigating the future on a safe course, forever stagnant. Paul (and maybe the fremen spice orgy subconscious) wrested control over the future from them, through the similar tool of prescience and manipulation of ""pressure points of history"". Leto II did something entirely different with prescience; setting it (as a tool) up to be broken forever."
dune,31q274,destructoid17,2,Fri Apr 10 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"Others have already given the best explanation (monopoly of space travel and power projection). But you'd also have to assume the Fremen liberally used atomics to ""sterilize"" the planets -- basically turning them into radioactive wastelands. So not only did they have the only battlefleet in the galaxy at their disposal, they were nuking everyone with abandon.  The other thing was fanaticism. We can just look at ISIS in Iraq. It was a relatively small group of very hardcore fighters who collapsed the Iraqi army in a matter of days, despite the Iraqis having better technology and superior numbers.  You could only just imagine the really fantastically shitty situation you'd be in facing a Fremen jihad. This corrupt empire and the entire social order underpinning it goes up in smoke in a day, despite lasting for thousands of years. You're cut off, lines of communication and supply broken, and now there's a nuclear-armed invasion force of religious fanatics from OUTER SPACE with a leader who can PREDICT THE FUTURE jumping into orbit.  You're doomed. Plus a lot of worlds out there that suffered under the old feudal system would probably jump at the chance of joining with the Fremen."

Even Paul was said to show early signs of mentat abilities and was offered the option of going on with that training early in the first book. All of the various groups (factions, races, what have you) presumably have their own mentats. Leave it to the Tleilax to experiment on and ""twist"" (whatever that ultimately means) their mentats."

Realfinkployd had it right though and most likely by this point in time mentat's are trained by other mentats or there is a large variety of places to have someone trained as a mentat. Tleilax training seems to have it's own connotations as people are usually suspect that they can't be fully trusted or the Tleilax have created some sort of conditioning in the mentat's but aren't exactly sure to what purpose(this later is confirmed to be true but we aren't sure if it's in every case of a mentat trained by the Bene Tleilax).  In the Dune novels it seems that it is a usual thing for mentat's to be trained by the Tleilax but I think that is just coincidence with the characters we are following in the story (especially with all the Duncan stuff).

Duncan is all we needed and to pull out that Piter was as well makes it not as special and lessens Duncan as a character. It's been awhile since I've read it, but it also seemed in God Emperor that the Tleilax hadn't experienced that kind of thing before and they definitely would have remembered that.

dune,31lfij,PathlessDemon,13,Mon Apr 6 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"The original Frank Herbert material still sees Harkonnen genes as valuable.  Think about it.  Paul is a Harkonnen.  The Baron Harkonnen is his grandfather, and a major component of him becoming the Kwisatz.  Feyd was almost a Kwisatz, it's just the breed of Harkonnen is more aggressive and needed the Atreides loyalty.  But Paul's call to threaten all the spice on Arrakis is a total ballsy Harkonnen behavior, and where his father is a man interested in the protection of his house, in the middle of a guerrilla war Paul moves on the Imperial throne, without Bene Gesserit support.  Instead of simply surviving a hunting war of his people, he's plotting a full galactic overthrow.   That's a Harkonnen."

What is later described by the Sisterhood as ""wild Atreides talents"" is actually the result of that blending --- wild Atreides+Harkonnen talents.  It's not much of a stretch to think that perhaps the Harkonnen genes are the ones which supply the 'talent', and the Atreides genes moderate them.  Feyd is nearly a Kwisatz Haderach, and it's planned that his offspring with an Atreides who's also one-quarter Harkonnen would be the Kwisatz Haderach.  That planned offspring is more Harkonnen than Atreides.  The desirability of the Harkonnen contribution is simply understated when compared with the focus put onto the contribution from the Atreides;  that's completely understandable given the characterisation of the major players from both houses, and the fact that we see events from the perspective of the Atreides."

I would interpret ""benched ledges"" as a kind of natural stair steps.  Kudos to you for asking.  I'd say that 85% of everything I know came from stumbling across a word or concept that I didn't know and looking it up or asking someone what it meant.  A dictionary is a reader's best friend (now we have the Internet, but you get the picture).  Also, make plenty of use of the appendix and glossary at the back of the book.

It can be read as: ""...he began to move, traveling upward, through a sand-carved channel...""  ""Benched ledges"" seems to be a rather rare phrase, although not unique to Dune.

Personally I find the whole thing pretty sad with so many people getting so circlejerky about something that never even happened. It's truly self-indulgent nonsense. It didn't even come close to being made, therefore it wasn't amazing. That's called fact. No amount of what-ifs about what could have been will change that.

dune,318fxp,Kills_Zombies,14,Fri Apr 10 21:50:12 2015 UTC,"While the point is only made explicit in the BH/KJA books, God Emperor, Heretics, and Chapterhouse make it seem like Duncan Idaho is the best candidate for Kwisatz Haderach by its literal definition: One who is in many places at once. His impact in the series is one of the most profound, from being Leto's sword guard, dying to save Paul, serving Leto II for literally thousands of years, and then proceeding to be a lynchpin for the plans of the Bene Gesserit for countless years after the scattering. While the nu-Dune books have some sort of wacko Dragonball Z level fusion shit involving a Duncan Ghola and the thinking machine Erasmus, the second half of the original series is much more poignant about Duncan being the KH."
dune,318fxp,Leftieswillrule,3,Fri Apr 3 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming Jessica had had a daughter, who was the desired husband? It was that one who was meant to father the Kwisatz Haderach, not just anybody who was Jessica's grandson."
dune,318fxp,loercase,13,Thu Apr 2 21:06:56 2015 UTC,Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen was the intended father.
dune,318fxp,smpm,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"Odd that the injection of Fremen DNA from Chani didn't compromise the bloodline. I guess it's possible the traits were ""ready"" when Jessica chose to bear, meaning the union of Atreides and Harkonnen would have only been a political one. The Bene Gesserit had clearly already procured the necessary Harkonnen genes prior to Feyd-Rautha anyway."
dune,318fxp,loercase,43,Thu Apr 2 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"The problem is as much about training as it is about genetics, I think. An Atreides/Harkonnen child would have the deep training from birth provided by the BG, as well as the combined genetics that would lead to the production of a Kwisatz Haderach. Chani's Fremen genes added a degree of wildness and unpredictability, true, but also conferred a thousands-of-years-old ability to manipulate the spicetrance (perhaps not to the level of a RM, but even the average Fremen was inured to the spice via the sietch orgy, far more so than the average Imperial citizen, even in the aristocracy. The Fremen lived with heavy spice addiction.), and the training from birth of the Fremen ways, including what was probably a raw form of prana-bindu training in their martial arts skills. Thus the deep training was conferred upon Leto II (III) and Ghanima, but in a way that the BG did not foresee. An Atreides/Harkonnen Kwisatz Haderach would possibly have been more pliable, seeing as he would have been raised by the BG, no doubt having been spirited away from Giedi Prime or Caladan or wherever, but not necessarily as skilled. Thus the secondary political aims of the BG would have been achieved, but remember that Margot, Lady Fenring conceived a child with Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, as a backup plan, although this apparently came to nothing. We know nothing of Lady Fenring's genes, but they must have been good enough, even though (as far as is known) she was neither Atreides or Harkonnen.   Remember too that Paul was receiving training from his mother in secret defiance of her BG orders, and that he was deeply prepared for the spice agony. He was this close to becoming a mentat, having been trained specifically for that role from a young age. It is likely that, no matter what the BG and the Mentats may claim, their training is not so very different, at least not in its early stages. The combined Mentat and prana-bindu BG training, along with his martial arts instruction, which was even better than that of the Fremen, along with his genetic predispostions, allowed him to go through the agony, even though it nearly killed him. I'm not saying that any peasant of the Imperium could become a Kwisatz Haderach, but it is clear that the training is as important as the genetics (cf. Hasimir Fenring, a ""failed"" Kwisatz Haderach).   Leto II (III) had no need to go through the agony or the training. As a preborn, he already had the knowledge and skills he needed to be a Kwizatz Haderach, having gained them from the BG and the Fremen sides of his heritage. All he needed was a body strong enough to put them into action, which the sandtrout skin gave him, at the cost of his humanity."

dune,318fxp,Mughi,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:48:05 2015 UTC,"yeah great write up. couple of thoughts.  about Chani. we dont know Kynes' bloodline. just looking at canon material, presumably his position and his level of intelligence (belief in science over religion/superstition) suggests superior breeding and training. from that point of view one could assume that between what she got from her father, her position as Sayyadina among the Fremen, and possibly some training up from Jessica, Chani was ideally suited to be the mother of the KH. at least on par with any other intended BG disciple.   Fenring was an intriguing character. wish we had more canon material about his life. birth defects/genetic eunuch (and ability/willingness to procreate) could play a critical factor in this as well. the ability to have their own children to seed the new humanity could be added to the list of required attributes.  was Leto II (III) something else entirely?"
dune,318fxp,Chillibowl,3,Fri Apr 3 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"The biggest part that made it important that it was Feyd and Jessica's daughter to bear the Kwisatz Haderach was one, for the feud between the Atreides and Harkonnens to be mended, and two, this union would have allowed the Bene Gesserit to control the Kwisatz Haderach."
dune,318fxp,Kills_Zombies,6,Thu Apr 2 22:34:07 2015 UTC,Jessica was supposed to have a daughter with Leto. This daughter was meant to marry the Harkonnen Feyd Rautha. The offspring of Feyd and this daughter was to be the Kiwsatz Haderach. That was the Bene Gesserit plan.

I can throw a few fanon theories at you though, most of which revolve around the fact that, as the sister of the kwisatz haderach, Alia definitely had the potential to break a few rules as far as genetic memories go. Keep in mind her niece and nephew both have full access and the only real difference between them and her is Chani's genes. which is important, sure, but the component most frequently cited as being the wildcard in said access is their being pre-born. Alia experiences the same origin, but seemingly is not as profoundly awakened? maybe thats why she doesn't have access to all the males in her line. or maybe she does, but the Baron blocks them in order to dominate her. hard to say.   could also be that it was just cool to have the Baron take her over."
dune,318x53,eremiticjude,2,Fri Apr 3 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"It's been awhile since i read the books, but the way i remember it is that the wemen in the BG were forbiden to look on the male ancestry side because they riscked being taken over by a powerful figure.

dune,318x53,eremiticjude,3,Sat Apr 4 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"Alia is a bit of a sticky whicket. She also has another power that she uses twice in the books that no one else seems to have or even be able to explain. She can somehow project her consciousness into the minds of people with Other Memory and send messages through time for other prescients to read. She does it to freak out the RMGHM in front of the Emperor and to communicate with Paul after the Battle of Arrakeen. No one else can do that. Not Muad'Dib. Not the Tyrant. Only Alia. These powers are not telepathy (Reverend Mother is very clear on that), but they show that what the Bene Gesserit created in Alia was something no one could have predicted.  When you mix Spice with BG-cultivated Atreides DNA weird and unexpected things tend to come of it."

It does say how it feels different from when Ramallo and Jessica communicated during Jessica's Agony, but I always took that to be Ramallo ""sharing"" with Jessica like they do in the later books.  But if it is the same power, the fact that RMGHM is really REALLY freaked out by it when Alia does it makes me think it isn't standard BG operating procedure. Those wacky Atreides wild talents!"

dune,318x53,cheesemagic,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that she is what Paul was supposed to be.  Paul was supposed to be a girl; Jessica flouted orders by having a son.  Also Paul (if a girl) was supposed to be the mother of the Kwisatz Haderach, so he is a generation early.  What it means for Alia is simply that the Bene Gesserit apparently do not know as much as they think.  There's an element of chaos or entropy here.  So maybe the Bene Gesserit have explained Alia's abilities one way, but whether that explanation is true is not totally clear.  And ultimately, it doesn't matter.  Alia is what she is.  So we know is that their breeding program had very unexpected results.  Not too strange that Alia would have abilities the Bene Gesserit cannot fully explain, especially since she is genetically similar to Paul."

His son found the outline in a safe deposit box, and wrote the expanded books around what it said.  After that, I can't say for sure what Frank Herbert would do.  But I like to think he probably would have wrote a prequel about the Butlerian Jihadm, especially as computers became more commonplace.  After that there was no more Dune for him to dissect.

dune,30ospn,tylersburden,11,Sun Mar 29 10:22:09 2015 UTC,"Couldn't figure out who the red head was.  From the forum comments:  ""Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I'm not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer's muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: ""She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift."" You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all."""

I read The Butlerian Jihad at a friend's house some years ago, and managed to stomach it until it got to the actual honest-to-God sorcerers before I just couldn't take anymore.

Reading the books seriously felt like I was reading a 400-page fanfiction written by a teenager.   This, exactly. I hated the books, but I kept reading them. I just liked the universe Frank had built so much. I thought even spending shitty time there was better than nothing--I mean, Disneyland is still kinda fun when the weather sucks, right? But by the time I slogged through Sandworms --interrupted many times by my husband threatening to take the book away if I didn't stop growling and muttering so much--I despised Brian Herbert, and wished he'd died in a childhood accident.

dune,30m0en,ZloMoHoMo,10,Sat Mar 28 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"I believe that the general storyline of the last two (fanfiction) books accurate to how Frank would have ended it.  But I also have no doubt in my mind that Brian simply did not understand what his father was trying to teach us with his story.  If you read some of Frank's other books that focus more on artificial intelligence (ie: Destinasion: Void, the Jesus Incident) you can start to understand how Frank would have made the evil thinking machines much more believable and frightening then Brian did.    The largest failure by far in Brian's ending is that he completely disregarded the main message of the series, which is to NOT create a hero of a man.  What does Brian do? He creates a super-mega-hero who just says something like, ""Don't worry guys I know what to do now."" It is my belief that Brian got the ending completely wrong here. If you'd like I can generalize how I think Frank would have ended it.   In the last parts of the novel Erasmus and Omnius are trying to get the final kwisatz haderach to join there side.  By forcing them to enter the spice trance, Omnius hopes to let the kwisatz haderach look into the future and see all the destruction that his armies will cause the universe.  Rather than seeing all of humanity destroyed, the kwisatz haderach would submit to Omnius rather than fighting him.  The error in his plan is that he did not intend for Duncan to be the final hero (I am going to write hero from now on because kwisatz haderach is too long :p) When Duncan realizes that he is the Hero, Omnius tries to make him look into the future and become the oracle, but Duncan instead chooses to looks away.  This is the final step of the golden path, Leto has set his empire as a stage to show Duncan the disastrous effects an oracle-hero can have on the universe.  This is why he has Duncan re-ghola'd so often,  essentially he has created a man with a new type of other-memory, but where his serial memories are his own.  Leto has spent the thousands of years of his golden path, slowly molding Duncan into a man who is strong enough to turn away from the powers of the oracle.  When Duncan does this at the end of the book, the thinking machines cannot comprehend why he would do this, to them knowledge is power so why would someone knowingly choose not to be all knowing? this is illogical to the machines and in the growing confusion Murbella and the others fly to the machine planet and help destroy it.  How exactly Omnius would die I don't know, maybe Duncan with his cool ability to tap into the machines systems with his brain could force his way past the machine firewall and destroy the programs running Erasmus and Omnius.    I like this ending because it keeps in line with the message that Frank was trying to portray to us throughout the other novels.  sometimes I get mad at Brain for not understanding his fathers work well enough to write a proper ending, but then I remember that Frank Herbert was a master of his trait, so to expect his son to be able to maintain the ludicrously high standards set by his Frank is a little unrealistic."

I love Heretics and Chapterhouse. Lucilla's verbal joust with the Honored Matres, Teg becoming SuperTeg, and Darwi Odrade. I love me some Odrade. And I love seeing some of the day-to-day stuff that makes up the life of a Bene Gesserit.

I bought and read the first six Brian Herbert abominations and I'm glad I avoided at a little bit of the tarnishing that he's done to his father's work.  Then an awful feeling struck me.  How did I know that Rebekah was turned into an axolotl tank?  With my heart sinking I slowly turned to my bookshelf.  Of course, there it was in all its radiant glory, sandworms of Dune.  I swear that I have no memory of ever purchasing or reading that book or its prequel.  However, I must have since the evidence is staring me in the face.  I'm ashamed of myself but I take solace in the fact that I can't remember a single thing that happens. Even reading your summary barely registers.

dune,30m0en,mausphart,2,Sun Mar 29 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"You can be sure that any mention of them using Frank Herberts notes is pretty much pure bullshit.

If you thought Books 7 were bad, the new ones aren't even entertaining in how terrible they are.  I describe them as like going on a secret mission at night by cutting your way through a forest with a flamethrower while wearing night-vision goggles and then when you reach your destination, you use the 'voice' to force the people who came with you to do what they came with you to do.

This was Herbert's usual subtle way of making it clear that change is natural and unstoppable. Thus, static systems that prevent change are bad and cause destruction. The various language and religious changes are subtly making the same point as Leto II destroying the double tripod of Emperor-Landsraad-CHOAM and First Tripod-BG-Guild.

A lot of the Jewish culture, ritual and religion is about remembering the past and keeping it with you as you move through the future. They're playing the long-term survival game. This is neatly echoed by several of the main themes of Dune, including the Golden Path.

We Jews adjust to many necessities, you know.”   Where he explicitly says the reason a navigator cannot see him either, because has Siona genes?  (Oh, and the lesson that any parasite/symbiote can have - and probably has - a couple of parasites or symbiotes of themselves is not new to Herbert. Just like the Jews have managed to stay hidden among the Gentiles and learn and benefit from the Bene Gesserit, so did some unknown race in Herbert's short story The Featherbedders make a niche among humans and the Slovin - themselves as symbiote on humanity.

Not many authors, especially those writing at the time, would partially discredit then blind their original protagonist/hero, and then have him walk out into the desert to die;  even fewer would then have his son, scion of the heroic Atreides family, bond with a sandworm, rule as a tyrant for 3,500 years, kill him, and then introduce a new cast before blowing up the only remaining really solid link with the original novels.  That's audacious even by modern standards, and yet it works.  Keep reading.

Granted, it takes a lot of liberties with the material, but the tone is definitely there: The wardrobe is tremendous, as are the worms; he did a really good job with the inner monologue, which is a nightmare to translate into film and while the story isn't exactly there, he managed to accurately portray the nuances of each faction. It was also a very experimental movie that took a lot of chances (unlike the TV adaptations, for example).

dune,2zxi3f,Galactic_Dick,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:25:41 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from (I enjoyed I Am Legend despite it having no resemblance to the book),  but I think the Dune film just hits the uncanny valley of book-to-film adaptations for me.  It's close enough that it was trying to be faithful, but far enough away to piss me off.  That said, there are aspects (like many of the actor's performances) that were good."
dune,2zxi3f,zombietrooper,2,Mon Mar 23 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I was the opposite on I Am Legend --- I hated that film with a passion.  I do understand how you feel about the Lynch adaptation;  it does dance along the line between 'acceptable' and 'piss-take' pretty closely.  At least part of my fondness probably stems from seeing it when I was quite young (13 or so), and an appreciation of its baroqueness vs. the very sterile Sci-Fi Channel miniseries.  My real dream, almost certain never to come to pass, is a lavish, Game of Thrones-style series that remains faithful but not slavish to the books."
dune,2zxi3f,MrBoogerBoobs,4,Tue Mar 24 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I'm generally pretty forgiving with book adaptations: I understand the differences between the media and the differences between what makes a book readable and a movie watchable, or transversely, what pushes the boundaries of those things. I understand movies have to chop the shit out of the books, and sometimes they have to write in cheats and shortcuts because you don't have 150 pages worth of script pages to allow Paul to figure out how to convert poison to water. But sometimes, bad decisions are simply bad decisions."
dune,2zxi3f,ZloMoHoMo,2,Sun Mar 22 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"Seems a bit obvious, but if you want an idea of the man's spirit and imagination realized just start with one of his films. I'd point you towards the Holy Mountain. Hyper-imaginative storytelling/visuals/acting. It's a bit of a tease when you start thinking about what his Dune could have been."
dune,2zxi3f,Realik,3,Sun Mar 22 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true.   I first tried watching Holy Mountain maybe 4 or 5 years ago when I still had sensibilities that could be offended. Mainly, my sensibility for coherence was being molested. But now, I have no sensibilities or whatever, so, maybe now's the time."

Fenring though would have made a wonderful villain.  In Messiah and Children though is where the Baron really shines as a villain.  As nothing more than one of the voices in Alia's consciousness he manages to plot and scheme and have Alia go willingly along with it.

If I recall correctly the Baron was telling Alia to spend the night with a certain guy because the Baron found him attractive.  The quote at the end of this chapter was what still makes me uneasy.

Why this was not uncovered sooner is something of a complete mystery to me. Why it took 14 or so years for them to find out that a major house had a son is beyond me. Paul would probably been trained earlier, or a new daughter produced.  The idea was that a daughter would marry Feyd and bring peace to the two houses, ending the war and strife.  Their son would have Bene J teachings and might have been the proper kwisatz haderach."

I don't get this answer. If he was so clever, he would not need reasons? How does that follow?  Are you saying really clever people do the right thing without reasons? Would that not be something an intuitive - or, more realistically, a rally lucky - person would do?  And the fremen had been counted a long time ago. They were better at hiding and mining spice for bribes than the empirial lackeys at the time were at investigating. Or they were not all that motivated. Why should they be? The spice was flowing, the Houses given the fief and the Emperor prospered. Who cares about some rabble in the deep desert?  Rabban was hiding the more recent troubles the fremen was giving him, and most of the patrols getting lost in the deep desert can be attributed to smugglers, weather conditions and worms.

But you do not find the lack of interest to study the indigenous people of Bela Tegeuse or Chusuk stupid? Or is everyone an idiot for not being an anthropologist?    You have the benefit of hind-sight. You know how things went down. That is a very, very wrong perspective to judge people's intelligence from. You need to look at the situation and the facts at hand. The fremen turned out to be formidable and fanatical warriors. Noone knew. There was no data to support the idea.  Now, there is something interesting going on here, and that is how the system you are in makes you think in a certain way. The Baron was not stupid; but he was blinded by the way of thinking that had let him and others to succeed before. All the intricasies of Kanly, all the ""ways things work"". The system of the Emperium was blind to these things; not because of any inherent stupidity, but because their way of thinking did not take into account the ""rabble"", did not know how intricate the relationship between planet and populace truly is (a major point of the novel), and thought their ideas of economic and military power were straightforwardly correct.  They were wrong, but they had good reason to think that way, and were not - by any stretch - stupid.  Hawat was desperately searching for chinks in the Harkonnen armor, and he saw that:  A) The fremen had survived long, under rough conditions not unlike those on Salusa Secondus.  B) The Harkonnen seemed to be losing more men and equipment than they were admitting.  I believe he also saw another reason, which made him quite brilliant at thinking outside the abovementioned box: That in the system of the Empire and the Harkonnen machine, there were many possible ""layers"" of under-reporting, giving enough weight to B to warrant further investigation. The Baron would not admit to anyone else the troubles he heard about - he needed people to fear him and the Harkonnen; can't do to show weakness. Rabban would not admit more failures to the Baron than strictly necessary, fearing he would be replaced with Feyd, or that the Baron would take a closer hand in managing Dune. And Rabbans commanders, given the culture of brutality among Harkonnen leadership, would not be keen to share loses and failures with Rabban or others above them in the chain of command.  This is structural stupidity, and - incidentally - I believe it accounts for most of the crap going on today that cannot be put down to pure malice... I don't think we are doing ourselves any favours by trying to square the responsibility away on one person and say ""he was stupid"". It is more complicated than that, and the reason Dune is so damn brilliant is that is contains and showcases such complexity."
dune,2zpk0p,SirFoxx,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:25:54 2015 UTC,"I don't get this answer. If he was so clever, he would not need reasons? How does that follow? Are you saying really clever people do the right thing without reasons? Would that not be something an intuitive - or, more realistically, a rally lucky - person would do?   Arrakis is the most important planet in the universe. Spice is harvested in open desert. Fremen live in open desert. Why would the ruler of Arrakis need a reason to investigate the Fremen further? Shouldn't everything even remotely related to the most precious substance in the universe be investigated?   But you do not find the lack of interest to study the indigenous people of Bela Tegeuse or Chusuk stupid? Or is everyone an idiot for not being an anthropologist?   the most important substance in the universe isn't mined on those planets.   The fremen turned out to be formidable and fanatical warriors. Noone knew. There was no data to support the idea.   do you know what would give them data? investigating the goddamned Fremen. I admit to having wrongfully accused the Baron of this mistake, but i still think it's a sloppy mistake made by the imperium."

dune,2ztlv6,brotherofdoubt,3,Sat Mar 21 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"From wiki:  Herbert derived the Fremen messianic religion vocabulary from real-world Arabic.[4] In Arabic, مؤدّب mu’addib means ""educator"",[5] ""he who disciplines/teaches manners"" or ""chastiser"".[6][7] Ad'dab or A'adaab أدب are ""manners"" or ""literature"".[8] In Dune, Herbert writes that the Fremen call the Muad'Dib mouse ""instructor-of-boys.""  Stilgar says in the novel:  Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.  Muad'Dib seems quite fitting, at least."
dune,2ztlv6,MortRouge,-2,Sat Mar 21 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but as an Arabic speaker I've never used it or heard it being used. It's actually quite odd. The only word I can compare it to is ""embiggens""  Yes, it comes up on search results but how many people actually use it?"
dune,2ztlv6,MortRouge,3,Sat Mar 21 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"Well, if it isn't a common word, wouldn't that make it easier to read? Your point was that the recognition bothered you.  And this is thousands of years into the future. Some words shift meaning."
dune,2ztlv6,tobiasvl,-1,Sat Mar 21 18:15:11 2015 UTC,Apology accepted.  My argument was that I could tell what the word Muaddhib was meant to mean even though it's used that much.   The word embiggens doesn't exist in the dictionary but you know what it was supposed to mean.

dune,2ztlv6,ONymeros,2,Sat Mar 21 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"They don't? Here are the etymologies according to the wiki:  Gom jabbar:   The second part ""Jabbar"" comes clearly from the ancient Arabic word jabbār, meaning to use coercion to force something.   Muad'Dib:   there is an almost exact word in Arabic like it (Mu'adib), which means ""private tutor"" or ""teacher"". It used to be that the Caliphs, the rulers of the Muslim world, would hire a Mu'adib to teach their children. The practice seemed to be common for other strata of society as well.  Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.'    Seems to make sense to me."

Indeed, the origins of its name are also debatable. The first word, ""Gom"", could stem from the ancient acronym ""GOM"", which stood for ""God's Own Medicine"", and was often used in the context of a drug (particularly opium) or biological chemical on ancient Earth.   I have no idea why you're talking about a rock (the gom jabbar is not a rock...) and I still don't understand what your problem with the book's language is."

dune,2ztlv6,dgranthm,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"the gom jabar is the thimble with the poison claw on it. it was created for the purpose of sifting people to find the humans. If it means ""mighty people"" then it was named that because it finds and proves that one is a mighty human and not a base animal. Remember she says how an animal would bite it's limb off but a human would wait to find the trapper and kill him, so it was a test to find out if paul was a human (by their definition)  what did you mix it up with that you thought it was a rock ?  do you need help with anything else? as for Muad'dib, just because you don't know a word or it's not used anymore it doesn't invalidate it as a word, if Muad'dib was used for a caliph's teacher and there hasn't been a caliphate in x centuries then what's the problem? there should be no suspension of disbelief in the language category because the fremen are a mixture of peoples who combined zen buddhism and islam and followed the teaching of the Third Maometh(muhammad)  edit: also if you just google translate مؤدّب it shows that the noun is Preceptor which means teacher. I've never seen the word Preceptor that doesn't mean i don't believe it's a word or can't take it seriously. i see that ""cept"" is in there like conception, inception can you trace any etymology like that in arabic?  https://translate.google.com/?source=dict-chrome-ex&sl=ar&tl=en&q=%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AF%D9%91%D8%A8#ar/en/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AF%D9%91%D8%A8"

There is always a hint that lay beneath the desert, but they are not themselves the desert. Nor are they the spice. Nor the terrible foresight that accompanies. For some reason, I find myself thinking of one of the older covers for Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. This one, to be precise (larger, if you'd prefer). Not as a suggestion of where to go, per se. Just musing.  Similarly, I want to point you to some quotes from God Emperor of Dune as words to draw thoughts on. Again, I am not entirely offering a suggestion with these. Take them as a variety of possible entry points that might be fruitful ways to start from. I've always found God Emperor to be one of the better in the series for idle thoughtfulness. Meanderings. Take from it what you will.  (Spoilers from God Emperor. Obviously, although their complete lack of context does make them oblique spoilers)  Don't view in this Alien Blue. Strips away the breaks between quotes for some reason.

""I have seen people and planets in such number that they lose meaning even in imagination. Ohhh the landscapes I have passed.

There are no closed systems. Even I only stretch the finite matrix."" Moneo jerked his attention from Leto's face and peered into the distances of the mausoleum corridors. I will be here someday.

I know the evil of my ancestors because I am those people. The balance is delicate in the extreme. I know that few of you who read my words have ever thought about your ancestors this way. It has not occurred to you that your ancestors were survivors and the survival itself sometimes involved savage decisions, a kind of wanton brutality which civilized humankind works very hard to suppress. What price would you pay for that suppression? Will you accept your own extinction?      Over here sand blows; over there sand blows. Over there a rich man waits; over here I wait.      ""Nothing is ever separated from its source,"" he said. ""Seeing futures is a vision of a continuum in which all things take shape like bubbles forming beneath a waterfall. You see them and then they vanish into the stream. If the stream ends, it is as though the bubbles never were. That stream is my Golden Path and I saw it end."" ""Your choice--"" she gestured at his body --""changed that?"" ""It is changing. The change comes not from the manner of my life but from the manner of my death.""      The thing stands out against a background which defines it.      ""What will happen today?"" Moneo demanded. It was a question directed not to the God Emperor but to the prophet. ""A seed blown on the wind could be tomorrow's willow tree,"" Leto said. ""You know our future! Why won't you share it?"" Money was close to hysteria ... refusing anything his immediate senses did not report. Leto turned to glare at the majordomo, a gaze so obviously filled with pent-up emotions that Moneo recoiled from it. ""Take charge of your own existence, Moneo!"" Moneo took a deep, trembling breath. ""Lord, I meant no offence. I sought only..."" ""Look upward, Moneo!"" Involuntarily, Moneo obeyed, peering into the cloudless sky where morning light was increasing. ""What is it, Lord?"" ""There's no reassuring ceiling over you, Moneo. Only an open sky full of changes. Welcome it. Every sense you posses is an instrument for reacting to change. Does that tell you nothing?""      ""I am the divided god and you would make me whole."""

I believe, and hopefully my understanding is correct, Paul can see future and choose which paths to take but can't exactly see where his next footsteps will take him.   I believe the best description in the books of how Paul's prescience works is that it's a lot like living in a mountainous region. If you go to the top of the mountain to see the lay of the land, you can see the other peaks, but you can't see the valleys, and if you're in the valley, you can only see a few peaks and none of the other valleys.   So, if he's at the ""peak"", he can see the BIG events. This is where he can see, for instance, humanities end, the thing he (and, hence, Leto II) was trying to avoid. While there, he can't see specifics, like what will happen to Chani or whether or not he will have any children. While looking at those specifics, he can't see the eventual outcome of humanity.  What he can do, though, is make a ""specific"" decision, and then after he does that, then check the ""peaks"" to see what has changed. What he is stuck with from the beginning of Messiah is that he can't connect living happily with Chani AND having humanity survive way in the future. He sees only 3 real possibilities: 1. Chani dead when she gives birth to Leto II, 2. Chani in a slave pit in order to keep Paul working as a puppet governor, and the third option, which you have to read CoD to find out.

By definition, unlike everyone else's life, whatever Paul does in life is what he chose to do against known alternatives. Specifically, he sees Chani's death and half a lifetime of wandering, blind, in the desert.   From my interpretation, I didnt see his vision as THIS life in particular. From what I got from Frank was that Paul saw this future, he saw Chani would die, that he would have a baby girl. This is why he was still able to ""see"" even though he was blind.   But the minute Leto II was born, Paul lost his vision because this was not a vision he thought was possible with the path he was taking. I do not even think he expected the events that happen in Children with Jericho (trying to be vague).   Sidenote: OP you will be missing out on great insight if you choose not to read the rest of the originals.

It's been a while since I have read it, but I'm pretty sure of 2 things:   He sees a lot of futures (maybe not all, but close to it) and has to decide which of them he will take. He did have priorities, though. First, he would not let humanity end in the far future, but not if the cost to himself was too great. Second, that Chani wouldn't end up alone or in a slave pit. He does NOT see the birth of Ghanima. That part was a total surprise to him, having never seen her in ANY of his visions, which is why he lost his sight. Having never sensed a future with her in it, he wasn't prepared when he heard news of her. Even her name, Ghanima, ""something acquired in battle"", says she was unexpected."

""There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers.""  It's never been entirely clear to me that he loses his prescience so much as he gives it up. Another possibility is that the birth of his kids muddies up the waters of time so much that no one can see past that until Leto makes his decisions.   And also, how would giving birth to twins, going blind, and then walking into the desert prevent him from being look at as a godhead/prophet, and stop the Jihad and religious rule from continuing?    In itself, it doesn't. He spends his time trying to avoid a particular future, but all ways out of that were traps, too. His child (remember: he was only expecting one, which says something interesting about his prescience, as well as the kids) will pick up the same problem later, though not in the way he would choose."

He saw all of the possible futures including her death, but he felt that this outcone was the least painful for her (and himself).

dune,2z7iyc,sparvin,3,Mon Mar 16 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"It's been a while so I'm honestly not qualified to answer your questions but since no one else has responded yet I'll take a crack at them. Firstly, I actually really liked God Emporer so maybe don't just stop at Children. I felt that Messaih and Children tend to revisit many themes from Dune and while it might not be in everyone's tastes God Emporer does shake things up a bit more (it's also way weirder).   I think what Paul sees is the same future that his son will try to avoid, essentially a future where a tyrannical Emporer can rule the Galaxy. Paul has gone a long way to create that future by breaking the Landsrad and more or less actually being a Messaih which would enevitalby lead to a fanatical religion created around him that could manipulate millions(I'm guessing). I'm not sure why the twins birth was the trigger for the end of his vision. My best guess is that in his vision he knew that he had to get to his sons birth to fulfill the golden path because Leto II, not Paul, would be the only one to see the rest of the path. He didn't see his daughter because she's part of the path that's blind to him. In that same way he might have known that he needed to be out of the picture for Leto II to fulfill the golden path and that's why he went out into the desert. It's also a more humble end to his legecy than if he were to die and be entombed and enshrined/memorialized. Personally I think he went into the desert out of grief, his children were ""safe"", so he wanted to end his life as a fremen would so he be closer to Chani. Those are my interpretations, they're probably wrong, I'm sorry, hope someone smarter answers you."

Basically he sees the Golden Path, which is the one and only one path to avoid the most death and destruction.  Paul never says what the Golden Path is.  But it traps him because it's the one best way.  So he loses his free will basically.  I don't remember specifically what's said about him losing his vision in relation to the twins.  More is discussed in later books about how certain people are invisible to prescience, and they are extremely important to humanity.

Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but there's no real message in the new books. They're written to be entertaining.  The problem with that is, the original books weren't written simply to be entertaining. To me, Brian Herbert's books read a bit like all the back-filling that's been added to the Star Wars universe. ""Hey, remember that one thing that didn't seem very important? Guess what, it has this crazy story!"" But to make it worse, Frank Herbert didn't have very many unthought or extraneous details in his originals, so often times there's a conflict between the original and expanded Dune. That's a problem for people who think that the originals were really on to something, but not so much for people who just want to read about spaceships and sardaukar and big worms.  If nothing else, the sheer number of books that Brian Herbert has put out should give you a hint to their quality. Also, he has books with robots. I think that the fact that Frank Herbert wrote Dune and deliberately removed robots and artificial intelligences (certainly present in his other works) from the universe was no accident.

dune,2z3dne,theraggedyman,1 point,Sun Mar 15 08:59:41 2015 UTC,What I imagined was a mostly mechanical system (hence heel-pumps) consisting of a half face mask (mouth with tubings in nose) and of course some sort of urine/feces reclamation system.

One of the major themes of Dune is the definition of humanity and its perpetuation, and you'll recall that the BG test people to see if they're human and they even make a point of keeping love ingrained into the human psyche (even though they could breed it out) because they deem it the safety valve for human existence.  Then there's the Tleilaxu and their axlotl tanks which provide a clear reference to what happens when reproduction is degraded to something artificial.  Artificial insemination must be viewed through this lens. The idea is that if you allow it, you are effectively setting a precedent for using people as if they were machines in a fundamentally unnatural and artificial way, and once you start down that path, if you can artificially inseminate, than why couldn't you pre-select the perfect fertilized egg before you put it in a womb, and while you're at it why not tweak it a bit so you don't need thousands (or tens of thousands) of years to get the desired result. At the bottom of this slippery slope you become like the Tleilaxu.  The link to the Butlerian Jihad is in its insistence on the sanctity of humanity. While it's primary goal was the elimination of the thinking machines, it's aftermath produced a system in which only ""quintessentially"" human behavior was permitted and more importantly only using human capacities in a human way was deemed acceptable.  This is why you have Guild Navigators, who while hardly human in appearance and capacity are using a human mind, and a human mind only, to guide spaceships. All of this means that reproduction, which is Herbert's focus for many core aspects of being human, is under strict scrutiny in as much as only entirely natural behavior is permitted.  edit: Mind you this doesn't mean that they're right about it. Just as using a computer to keep track of data (something the BG do) is entirely reasonable, but against the Jihad's prohibitions, so is this. Yet the mental barrier is greater in this case since the BG do have a (possibly healthy) amount of fear about their tinkering with the human lineages, especially once Paul became emperor and they started fearing the thing they were trying to achieve."

dune,2yhnoq,Alabast,4,Tue Mar 10 01:17:40 2015 UTC,"It was an active option. Excerpts:   Beneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister crossbreeding must be explored.   [...]  And she was explicit in her instructions: Was the Emperor ever angry with his concubine? His unique powers must make him lonely. To whom could he speak in any hope of being understood? To the sister, obviously. She shared this loneliness. The depth of their communion must be exploited. Opportunities must be created to throw them together in privacy. Intimate encounters must be arranged. The possibility of eliminating the concubine must be explored. Grief dissolved traditional barriers.   Irulan would go on to maneuver such an opportunity. Remember the training room scene with a naked Alia?  In addition, when Paul was negotiating for Chani's life (even though he already saw her death), Mohiam tried to bring the subject up.   She firmed her jaw, offered a new gambit: ""There are two Atreides.""  Paul, sensing something of what lay in the old witch's mind, felt blood darken his face.

dune,2yhnoq,MortRouge,6,Mon Mar 9 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"I think this question goes to the heart of the book. The scene mentioned, and much of Dune Messiah - including the final crux of the action - is about accepting or rejecting the Bene Tleilax's solution.    The Reverend Mother closed her eyes to hide his face. Damnation! To cast the genetic dice in such a way! Loathing boiled in her breast. The teaching of the Bene Gesserit, the lessons of the Butlerian Jihad -- all proscribed such an act. One did not demean the highest aspirations of humankind. No machine could function in the way of a human mind. No word or deed could imply that men might be bred on the level of animals.    As Uberbobo7 puts it - good answer, that - the Jihad was about more than just machines:   The link to the Butlerian Jihad is in its insistence on the sanctity of humanity.   And from the God Emperor himself:   ""The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,"" Leto said. ""Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.""   Chosing to inject (pun not intended) a technical procedure into the act of procreation is taking a machine-attitude to the most human of acts. It is using technology to wrest two features of human procreation from each other - the meeting of bodies and the social implications of it (including thrones) and the creation of a certain offspring.  And there is a slippery slope here; from artificial insemination, to chosing the healthier sperm and egg, to chosing the sperm and egg with the right genes expressed, to manipulating the genes expressed in sperm and egg, to... Bene Tleilax manipulation of humans themselves. The Butlerian proscriptions are not exactly rational - they are moral proscriptions. And a bit... hysterical (I swear these puns just show up) - they go further than they need to (as most religious and societal taboos do - Herbert knew his stuff). Even though artificial insemination is not in itself horrible (according to us - or at least me), it is making the act of procreation a technical matter, not a question of human acts of love. (And yes, I consider the Bene Gesserit breeding program deeply hypocritical).  PS: In the Dune Encyclopedia (not saying it is canon, just that it has some interesting angles and its authors had a good understanding of Dune), the Jihad starts because a machine intelligence decides to abort a fetus without asking the mother-to-be - mingling the two topics of thinking machines and procreation."

Don't dwell on the words that you don't understand. Think about what it means with context clues but keep going, chances are the words will be used enough that you'll get it by the end, and everything is explained right when it needs to be even if the foreshadowing seems to spoil things.   You'll catch on to the names too. The names come up so much that you'll just pick it up.   When I started reading Dune I had no idea what I was getting into. Started reading it based only on hearing it was good and not knowing what it was about. And for a while in the beginning, I still didn't know what it was about because I didn't understand the language. I only read it this one time though, and didn't look anything up just in case of spoilers, and I'd say you'll figure it out just by reading. That's how it worked for me at least. Just go for it!"

The main thing is knowing the major factions and how they relate to each other: the aristocratic Great Houses of the Landsraad (a sort of United Nations), versus the Imperial House Corrino, who stays in power thanks to their fearsome Sardaukar terror-troops;  the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, a semi-religious/ monastic group;  the Spacing Guild, which has a monopoly over all space travel because the spice lets their navigators see into the future to predict safe routes for ships;  and CHOAM, a kind of stock exchange/ bank/ mint, which governs all interplanetary trade."

dune,2y7r0t,Auriela,3,Sat Mar 14 23:58:21 2015 UTC,"I first read Dune last summer at my job. Needless to say, I tried to sneak in as much reading as possible.  The first book is comparable to stepping into another world in another time.   You will experience culture shock, just as someone from 7,000 years ago would if they came to the present. Just as the Atreides do not know what lies ahead of them, nor does the reader.  After a while you start to catch onto the vocabulary. Like /u/landinojones said, most books have a glossary in the back. I found it useful but it's not necessary. Sometimes its better to use your imagination to think of what something does or is, based on it's description and how the characters think and talk about it.  Also, try not to google or go on Dune forums or wikipedia pages. You can be looking for a minor detail and then have the rest of the book spoiled because a lot of the content in the beginning hinges on the rest of the series."

The name is a bit of a joke, and the book on the topic has a lot of very dry humor, but the basic insights I think are correct.  If you take ""system"" to refer to any large, human-created organization (whether a management reorg, a government bureaucracy or a new computer), these first principles resonant strongly with things Herbert worried about:   New systems mean new problems. The total amount of anergy* in the universe is fixed. Systems tend to expand to fill the known universe.   *anergy = the energy required to bring about a change."

Water is the most important resource to the Fremen, and control of water leads to control of the spice. (the reason the guild exists at all is ultimately so the Fremen can protect their long-term water plans from outside interference-they pay an enormous amount of spice off the books to the guild in exchange, which allows the guild equal footing with the noble houses of the Landsraat.)   Spice itself is a commodity of great value that drives trade, not unlike the 17th century Dutch East Indies spice trade, except where that expanded the palate, Spice expands the mind.  It would be like saying Orwell's 1984 is about the dangers of communism, because IngSoc was socialism in England."

dune,2y0q80,ZloMoHoMo,2,Thu Mar 5 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"Holstein engines enable interstellar travel, not spice. spice enables more accurate navigation, safer & reliable transportation. Think like a sextant & compass do for a navigator, but the wind is what powers the sails. Word of God: Frank Herbert is on record saying the melange spice is not analogous to oil, water on arrakis is. Spice melange controls awareness, prescience, consciousness: secrets hidden from the general population. Again, thin metaphor of navigators carefully controlling their secret knowledge.   To further conflate it all, CHOAM (the trade consortium whose ownership is composed of Landsraad families) is the analog for OPEC. It is the global oil trade in metaphor, and it isn't. Frank was no friend of simple direct allegory."

You can't deny that."
dune,2y0q80,lundse,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"He meant that it would kill the navigators, who were addicted fatally to the spice, and break their hold on space travel. All the imperium were compelled to use them for navigation, as it was the safest route, short of thinking machines."

It seems to me that he's at least accessing higher dimensions, though still basically a three-dimensional being.  His speed is well beyond anything physics or biology would support (decapitating people with a wave of his hand, requiring tens of thousands of calories and multiple restroom breaks in a single meal, etc.)"
dune,2xyw5j,JtiksPies,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"Judging from this, it takes approx. 100 N to decapitate someone with a [semi] blunt object. A well trained hand could easily deliver that much force. The reason we don't witness this today is the cutting ability of the hand is kinda low, it's pretty dull. But considering the weirding way could shatter bone in Paul's time, some evolved version of martial arts could do something like Miles Teg does"

Tolkien was never happy with how the Lord of the Rings ended, but understood that he had to cut it off somewhere so that the ending didn't go on forever.  I think it was the same case here.   Frank Herbert would make this a recurring theme in Dune books, where he gives a feeling of closure in what is a very open ended situation.  (For those curious, LotR had an extra unpublished chapter about Samwise talking to one of his daughters.)"

It’s just the place where you stop the story. And one of the reasons, by the way, why in the book “Dune” I stop it the way I do, deliberately building up a carrying momentum, as though you were going down a slide and then just chopping it…  Found that interview on: http://www.sinanvural.com/seksek/inien/tvd/tvd2.htm"

Why about concubines and wives, though?  Maybe something about how Paul - despite being 'something new' and changing the existing order - is still caught by the political realities of his time. He needs to marry strategically, and not out of love. Just as he cannot stop the Jihad at this point, his hands are becoming tied.

Another answer would be that due to the extreme quickness of planet travel things like moving a house to another planet are done much quicker with the guild and their folding space. Also, when the emperor of the known universe tells you to do something, I don't think you wait around lollygagging.

dune,2xgk8b,Disfraz,27,Sat Feb 28 13:42:35 2015 UTC,"It wasn't my favorite while reading it (I actually stopped part way through and didn't finish the series for years because of it).  It's my favorite because of the impact that it has on the rest of the series.  Patterns that began in the first three books come to fruition in God Emperor, and it sets up a vastly different universe for the last two.    We gain an understanding of the Golden Path and the plots within plots that Leto set up to ensure it.  The impact of Leto's sacrifice (both the humanity he gave up and his eventual ...dissolution into awareness without agency) slowly dawns on us.  The trap of Atreides prescience is never more clear than when Leto marches onto that bridge with his only love, and the Duncan he's worked so hard to preserve acts with the Siona he's worked so hard to produce to betray him (while playing directly into the Golden Path).   We get a look a the plight of Duncan, a man doomed to die and live again with memories of all those deaths.  An immortal without a choice or the facilities to deal with that immortality, unlike Leto.  A man who was once great but who has spent most of his lives irrelevant (a master swordsman casually bested by any Fish Speaker or an aged aide to the God Emperor) until he is pushed to catalyze a change in the universe once again.  It's not the most fun book to read, and I agree that Leto is pretty unrelatable, but goddamn is it impactful.  *edit: unclosed parentheses."
dune,2xgk8b,The_Dirty_Carl,11,Sat Feb 28 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"Fantastic answer, I would only add that the alien nature of Leto II is why I personally find this book so fascinating.  Herbert's portrayal of a God-like intellect is so compelling for me that I keep coming back again and again."

dune,2xgk8b,fedaykin13,2,Mon Mar 9 14:43:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! Glad I'm not the only one so fascinated with how Herbert manages to convey such strangeness.
dune,2xgk8b,albebop,24,Thu Mar 12 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"I think the boring aspect of GEoD is intentional. In the book Leto II had been inflicting enforced tranquility on humanity for millennia. Human society throughout the imperium had been suffering through an enforced homogeny. On every planet (with few exceptions) life was dully uniform. People did the same things, lived the same way, ate the same foods, and died the same deaths. On top of that there was no escape for anybody. Run away from your village? The next village will be the same. Escape in to space? Every world you'll find will be the same. That was the method of Leto's ""lesson"" to humanity. He inflicted peace, tranquility, and boredom upon humanity for thousands of years. It was so complete a domination that even Leto II himself was ultimately bored. He was bored with his godhead, bored with his power, bored with his worshipers, bored with his tyranny, and bored of everything else imaginable. The only thing he had to look forward to were the rare, occasional, surprises of things his prescience didn't predict."
dune,2xgk8b,RedMushtoom,9,Sat Feb 28 15:08:33 2015 UTC,This was the pressure cooker that lead to the scattering. I thought it was great watching an unabashed tyrant be a tyrant with a benevolent purpose at heart.
dune,2xgk8b,cynoclast,13,Sat Feb 28 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with Dirty Carl in that while I was reading it, it wasn't my favourite. However, after reflection it's become, to me, the pinnacle of the series: everything before was leading up to Leto's reign, and everything after was a reflex or reaction to it, and this is exactly as Leto planned. The reason I liked it so much was because it framed Leto as an unavoidable and necessary product or consequence of vast forces of history and sociology, a reflex of human society itself culminating in a singularity of complete awareness and prescience that was necessary to save humanity itself from suicide or stagnation: Leto was both the most powerful manipulative being ever to exist, and a tool, or cog in the wider scope of the machine of human society. To be honest, the foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov serves as a good companion for God Emperor because they both deal with macrosociological variables and the inertia behind humanity and parts of society.   I also enjoyed how the book was essentially commentary on these sociopolitical factors and how it pointed out some of the fundamentals of humans' psychological travails in dealing with an omnipresent sociological pressure from massive human ""communities"". The first three books dealt with the building of factions and religions and groups from the small upwards, within society, and it culminated in God Emperor of Dune where the entirety of human society was moulded. Leto was like a virus then, in that after humanity recovered from his reign, they were immune to such forces that would have otherwise destroyed them, had they not been directed by a prescient tyrant-with-good-intentions."
dune,2xgk8b,polyonymy,6,Sat Feb 28 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"First, Leto II is one of the most fascinating characters in fiction. In his universe he is all-powerful and yet unlike most all-powerful, fictional creations he is very real, flawed, weak even. He is incredibly charismatic, while being a giant worm. He is the most 'human' of characters while being a three thousand year old worm. The contradictions, the nuance, the delicate insights into the human condition are best expressed through him. Compared to him, all of the other characters seem a little two dimensional. Considering we are talking about some of the best articulated characters in fiction, the most intricate and fully realized - that says a hell of a lot about Leto II.   It's also a really interesting contrast between where he was at the end of Children of Dune and where he is at this point."
dune,2xgk8b,Thooorin_2,2,Sat Feb 28 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"Because of his prescience I personally saw him as essentially the same throughout his whole lifespan. That is actually what makes him so interesting to me; as a boy he had the same mind as he would as the worm and as the worm, despite all the fear that he could instill, I still saw him as the innocent boy that was just doing what he knew he had to do."
dune,2xgk8b,xaqaria,3,Sat Feb 28 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"You and parent poster nailed this so hard. Leto III was prescient from before birth. He was forced to be the same person for basically thousands of years. No childhood. No age of wonder. No coming of age. He was born knowing he or his sister must become a tyrant to put all others to shame. It only seems to show in GEoD, but he knew what was coming.   Prescience was a curse and only duty got him through."
dune,2xgk8b,cynoclast,7,Sat Feb 28 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"And most people overlook his suffering.   Imagine having a human mind trapped in a worm body for 3,500 years.  No love. Little companionship. No friends. Vast hordes of enemies, frenemies. His only companion was occasionally rigged to try and kill him.   He was the most lonely being in the universe. For thousands of years.   This was why Paul wouldn't do it. He knew the personal cost and lacked the strength to see it through despite seeing the Path just as clearly.   Grasping all this I thought it was a great book. Herbert is deep."
dune,2xgk8b,cynoclast,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"Also one of my favorites, along with Dune Messiah.  The Tyrant is one of my favorite fictional characters. His vast memory, power, and control over the entire known universe is staggering to imagine.   I did want to add to this that while Paul chose not to transform himself and reign for thousands of years, he admits not seeing the end of humanity in his visions.  The tyrant is the one who claims the Golden Path was necessary.  It's possible that because Leto II IS prescient and invisible to Paul's visions that Paul could not see the visions, but that suggests that the tyrant is the cause of both humanities potential end and salvation"
dune,2xgk8b,Tupile,6,Sat Feb 28 20:36:52 2015 UTC,"Leto II, Moneo and Duncan(s) are the best written and funniest characters in the series despite all three of them being gloomy assholes trapped by their sense of duty. It is amazing how despite there being no sense of danger or adventure in the book it is an entertaining story. It is interesting to see how the factions of the universe sort of squirm and attempt their plots and power plays despite this giant obstacle that is Leto II."
dune,2xgk8b,soylentblueissmurfs,2,Sat Feb 28 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"The combination of the massive time jump which I'm always a fan of in and form of fiction, the absolute insanity of Leto II turning into a sandworm hybrid, the fact that he spent 3000 years basically breeding someone to kill him, and of course the infamous climax scene makes me laugh everytime.  The book is by no means the best Dune book but man its just so goddamned ridiculous that I just love it."

I also found the narrative to be very critical of it's all seeing ruler (which is growing more and more contemporary connotations), but like others have said, that I found him to be more human, which creates his dynamic of oppressor/oppressed which then informs his character motives.   Furthermore this book gave more insight into the mythos of dune, and delved much further into the prescience act than other books had, as well I think the fact of it being more confusing than other books adds to the understanding of how prescience, and individuality, are infinitely complex and can't be understand.   In saying that these books were personally very influential"

CoD was my favorite, but I haven't gotten to books 5 and 6 yet.    The fascinating thing to me about Leto II are his conversations with Moneo where he curses the way things have been, explains his own immortality through the lives of the universe (his direct descendants), and drifts into deep introspection where he still debates on the philosophies of near-omniscience, prescience, and power.  ""To give purpose to evolution"", moved me to the core. I'm taking a genetics course right now and I started this series just in time. It's so interesting! It's amazing. And I found out that F. Herbert wrote more stories besides Dune! So much to read hahaha"
dune,2xgk8b,Utopiophile,-1,Sun Mar 1 10:04:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't read books because I want characters to be relatable or likeable. Nor do I have any intent on being entertained by books, altough I of course enjoy wit (which is something you can find in abundance in Herbert's writing in GEoD). I mainly find concepts interesting and thoughtworthy. The reason I like to read much speculative fiction and sci-fi is because they relate ideas, both political and philosophical, and explore them in a dramatical manner. I think thus they have their place next to non-fictious philosophical/political works, and they both complement eachother.  Comparing the original Dune to GEoD is like comparing fantasy to sci-fi: there is a difference in the reason why you read them. Dune Messiah started a more somber and contemplative thread of writing, this fashion culminating in GEoD. I don't think one needs to be more specific than that. Dune, in comparison, is a space opera with some small philosophical arguments sprinkled around the pages, and good riddance to that."

Well, why you felt the need to be condescending, I have no idea. And if that wasn't your intent, then it's how it came across.  I don't read books because ""I want characters to be relatable or likable"" either. Nor did I say that in my post... I only said that I didn't really like Leto II's character. Didn't say that I read the book for the sole purpose of wanting him to be relatable.  And to each his/her own, but I don't understand why you ""don't have any intent on being entertained by books."" I certainly do. And I mean a loose definition of ""being entertained"" - It could simply be that a book interests me. If the content is interesting and thought-provoking, then, well, I'm ""being entertained."" But I would not necessarily read a book that I found to be very boring and dry (yes, I know, that's pretty much how I described GEoD - but I exaggerated a bit) just for the sake of reading it. But that doesn't apply to GEoD - yes, I've said it's a bit boring, but Herbert's philosophy in it is interesting (though of course there's a lot that goes over my head; I don't claim to understand everything).  edit: wording"

Everyone can and should read books for their own reasons, and I figured I just wanted to share my point of view. Internet is a horrible place for nuance, and it's sad I didn't manage to express myself properly. So please, excuse me :) . I'll try to be more clear.  Talking about likability was referencing the other replies in here, and wasn't necessarily directed at you. Nor is it really the main point of the argument - that is, by the way, as I gather the part that was the most condescending, for which I'm sorry if someone else also felt like that.  Fair enough, in that lexical sense I am being entertained, you are correct, in the same way you would say ""being entertained by your host"". It's a very flexible word! But entertainment also has a very cultural connotation, that of feeling enjoyment or delight. The most clear example is movies, a culture that is mostly dominated by a common philosophy (Hollywood etcetera). The standard movie has a motive of making you react directly, often emotionally - in a comedy you laugh, in an action movie you are awed and so on, a Lynch movie (except Dune, ha) tries to imprimt more abstract emotional states on you (Lost Highway is a really claustrophobic and scary movie ...). The media lends itself to this quite naturally, even though there are of course examples of less direct approaches in movies concerning imprinting information and emotions on the audience. Books can surely work in the same manner, I was thoroughly entertained by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (I laughed) for example, but arguably (and this is my opinion) the great things about books is that they are not a direct experience in the same way movies and games are. I read books, and like litterature, because I can distance myself from them and don't feel the need to be enjoyed/involved. If I'm bored by a movie, pray I'm not at the cinema and need to sit through it all (I find walking out quite rude, especially at concerts and theatres of course). But a book is different, a book is something I continue reading after I put the book down. In some way, I guess I'm entertaining myself in this way. But I read books, just as I read this message board, encyclopaediae, music scores,  articles and so on mainly to gather new information for my own understanding of the world and for my imagination's sake, not to be entertained (although I do enjoy wit ;) )."

In Dutch his mouth fell open in astonishment). It's a very natural read, too.  I personally still prefer the English version, however, because Frank Herbert had a certain flair to his writing that gave it just that extra bit of atmosphere. Technically there's nothing wrong with ""Je wilt dat we partij kiezen in een vete?"", but it lacks the exotic flair that ""You wish our siding in a vendetta?"" has.  My advice, try reading the Dutch version first, if you must. Then go through the English version. It has a much better feeling in general."

dune,2x8vyp,chowder138,26,Thu Feb 26 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"Beautiful question! Up front: I'm making all this up.   Mass ratio is a general term in a few different sciences, but since Kynes was a planetary ecologist (something we still don't really have irl), I'd look at it from an ecological standpoint.   One place I found the term used was in the context of rapid vs gradual change in biodiversity in a given area. If the ratio of Current to New to Overall mass changes quickly (say, if available sustenance suddenly increases), there are different long term effects on the system as a whole than if that change were made gradually.   My guess is that from a planetary perspective, Kynes believed that dramatically changing the overall mass of water on Arrakis would have an unfavorable effect - at the very least on the sandworm lifecycle, but definitely on the plant life he and his father were dedicated to studying and nurturing. Even before melange was 'discovered,' Arrakis was a botanical testing station, so the Kynes' were just the most recent in a line of field researchers.   The cool thing to me is that in my cursory googling, every single source I found mentioning a mass ratio hypothesis in ecology was published after Dune came out, except one from '63 titled The Effects on the Vegetation of the Addition of Mineral Nutrients to the Dune Soils (AJ Willis, Journal of Ecology). And! If we look at Willis' other work, we find titles like The Dune System and its Vegetation and Ecology of Dunes - Salt Marsh and Shingle.   I wouldn't be surprised at all if Frank read his work as it was published - and maybe even modeled Kynes a little bit after the author."

Even if the ecological term isn't what was being referenced, I enjoy looking through this little window to research that was done during Frank's life and seeing something he may have been inspired by.     Looking at Appendix I, there's a quote from Pardot Kynes that strongly echoes Willis' work:   There's an internally recognized beauty of motion and balance on any man-healthy planet,"" Kynes said. ""You see in this beauty a dynamic stabilizing effect essential to all life. Its aim is simple; to maintain and produce coordinated patterns of greater and greater diversity. Life improves the closed system's capacity to sustain life. Life - all life - is in the service of life. Necessary nutrients are made available to life by life in greater and greater richness as the diversity of life increases. The entire landscape comes alive, filled with relationships and relationships within relationships."""

dune,2x8vyp,fungoid_sorceror,2,Thu Feb 26 21:53:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this affects Dune universe same way as ours. They are transporting military ships inside Gild's ships. In latest book they have private desert inside. Sand and alloys have higher density than water… If you pay for transportation Gild will transport everything. And you don't need Gild for travel inside local solar system where could be ice planets or comets. Kynes was a planetary ecologist so I guess this problem was about impact on ecosystem of Arrakis.

After all, why have the game focus on books which were an incoherent mess.   Personally, I loved the entire series with GE being my favorite, though I can understand why some people may not have enjoyed the rest of the series, but you can't just throw away the entire series.   I think the first book stands on it's own. I will admit there are unanswered questions but that can be, in many cases, much better as it leaves the book with an air of mystery.   Especially when the point of the second was to focus on why heroes are dangerous, illustrates just how human Paul is, and effectively destroys his mystique. He's just as lost as the rest of us, and just as prone to making mistakes, even with the gift of prescience. This is crucial to his characterization.   Well we're all entitled to our opinions of course. I'm in the other camp. I read the following books and did not enjoy them at all. I felt they became increasingly nonsensical and feel there is little there that would enhance the game.  Everything the game needs is in the first book but as I say, that's just my opinion."

As a matter of fact, as nice as it is you might have been for you to agree with me it's better that you disagree. There is more to be learnt that way.  For example; I think many people (to their detriment) know Dune only by way of the movie. I think it could reach a wider audience by being Dune and not the sequels. I think it may draw fans of the other TellTale games.  Either way we're discussing the merits of something which, at the moment, is nothing more than an idea. It's not even reached conception."

If they made a game, obviously Dune would have to come first. It needn't be the last game, however. It's one of those situations where if you don't like what comes after, just don't play it. Doesn't make sense to take the opportunity away from others.   Fair enough. I could see many of the episodes centered around the first book. Just as the book is compartmenualized then so could the episodes with some third wheel affecting to some extent the losses of the Atreides or the Harkonnen but which would not alter the actual story.

Any tasks that were normally performed by highly capable computers before have been taken over by highly specialized humans and humanoids, like mentats and navigators.  Using Navigators as an example, instead of allowing a computer to plot the incredibly complex task of navigating the heavenly bodies, members of the navigator's guild consume and bathe in huge amounts of melange, allowing them to use superhuman psychic precognition to determine a safe route through space, while the engine uses the Holtzman effect, a physical phenomenon that can be produced without the use of a thinking machine, to actually propel the ship through folded space.  Anything that you can imagine society needing a computer for, there's likely a human equivalent that's been drugged up or intensely trained (or both) to perform the function instead."
dune,2x1x4t,LalitaNyima,4,Wed Feb 25 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"There's a distinction, maybe not of kind but of degree, between computational devices and ""thinking machines."" There's a prohibition against machines that resemble the human mind. Look at the two human(ish) replacements for thinking machines: Mentats and Guild Navigators. Mentats seem primarily to be used for strategic planning and dealing with the human equation via politics.  Likewise, Guild Navigators expand upon a uniquely human ability in the Dune universe: prophetic power that allows the future to be seen, and therefore make space travel possible.  Neither of these tasks are doable by the kind of computers we see all around us in everyday devices and presumably are not doable by lasguns and suspensors either.  Furthermore, these human-focused abilities that Mentats and Guild Navigators possess are really the opposite of what real-world computers are good at.  These are strong-AI characteristics, compared to the kind of weak-AI that modern computers can do.  Really, they're more than Strong-AI, they're the things humans are uniquely capable of in Herbert's universe.  So calculators and basic microprocessors and stuff are ok, they're not even close to the kind of thinking machines prohibited."

House Corrino (and it's many many allies built up over the centuries) gots to get paid, Spice=money and power, and if the Guild simply cut off supply, they'd be risking an all out war for control of the Galaxy, which is not something I think they want. Better to let the Emperor do all the work of actually ruling, give him a taste of the profits to make sure everything runs smoothly, and bingo bango, everything's peachy.  It's well established that the Guild has a blind spot in their prescience when it comes to Paul/Leto II (and vice versa), so I don't think it's really a stretch that they'd take the route that they did rather than fight what would have to become a Galaxy wide nuclear war. There's a ton of industry that's currently completely dependent on oil, but they never tried to take over the Middle East and completely cut it off... Wait a minute..."

The same with the guild - they acquiesced to allow the Atreides to take the CHOAM contract for Arrakis and Spice and then acquiesced to allow the Harkonnen to attack them.   They had one rule - the spice must flow.   They were pretty quick to tell Shaddam to go fuck himself when the Harkonnen fucked up on Arrakis.   The simple fact is, which we all learned  from Dune , is that you don't directly occupy or lead and take the flack, you let others do it for you."

If the guild started playing favorites too much (or for themselves) perhaps the great powers would be willing to violate the great convention rather than be slaves to the Guild.  Perhaps they would develop an alternative guild (or split the current one).  By being above the fray in all matters, they avoid having the other powers combine their efforts to unbalance them, as this was a delicate tripod.  If the Geriatric effect was well known then you would be doom the wealthiest and most powerful people to much shorter lives, something I imagine they would exert a great effort into preventing.  I think if they had cut off Arrakis or any particular group, the backlash may have been too dangerous for them to dare.  Perhaps limited prescience leads them to this conclusion or they were just conservative and risk averse.   If they made sealed off Arrakis and still made spice available to the wealthy (at great cost, etc.) then perhaps they would have been successful at a quarantine.

The Guild only bowed to Paul because their prescience allowed them to see him destroying the spice cycle, if they didn't know for sure they might have thought he was bluffing in either intention or ability. They probably predicted a short term significant dip in spice production if they had siezed Arrakis for themselves, because they probably don't have the same skills in ruling planetary feifs as the noble houses and because such a move would lead to political turmoil.

It was a known fact that Guild navigators could predict no way to take control of the spice without producing just such a nexus. The obvious conclusion was that someone of higher order powers was taking control of the spice source, yet the Bene Gesserit missed this point entirely!)"
dune,2wxoi4,lundse,2,Tue Feb 24 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"I think the long term problem if they chose to sieze imperial power is that if they started extracting more wealth from the imperium (either by taxation or by taking direct control of the planets) they would have a divide between space faring guild members and planet bound guild members, in the long term not different from the current situation as the ground bound guild members would need to adopt a way of life similar to the Houses to control their planets.

They had never dared grasp the sword . . . and now they could not grasp it. They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of specializing on the melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators. They could have done this, lived their glorious day and died. Instead, they'd existed from moment to moment, hoping the seas in which they swam might produce a new host when the old one died.   Like the Bene Gesserit could have taken the throne, so could the Guild have taken over - maybe even quite easily. But any empire stagnates, any force is met with a larger force at some point, and eventually, something inside or outside would have toppled them. They were hoping they could remain forever safe in a unique position of influence.  Come to think of it, maybe the Bene Gesserit are more like the Guild than I thought. Their Kwisatz Haderach program could be a way to try to control the change they know is coming (where the Guild hope to survive it by being useful and in a unique position). The BG are just a tad more proactive; but they are still stagnant and while they are prepared for the KH, the fall of Houses and Empires, they are not ready for a true game-changer; neither Paul nor Leto II.

dune,2wxoi4,LalitaNyima,3,Tue Feb 24 02:10:33 2015 UTC,"the correct answer.  as stated in the book, is that when conflict occurs and you are precient, there are to many potential outcomes so you can't see past the ""decision nexus"" the guild MUST have spice and if something were to go wrong in them endeavoring to seize power they could, but wouldn't take that risk.  Muad'dib chastised them for this very risk averse mindset during the conversation at the house at arakeen after the battle of the shield wall."

dune,2wxoi4,Fire_Elemental,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the Guild's monopoly on space travel is enforced by the Emperor's government.  The reason they have no competition in this field has as much to do with Imperial law as it does with their head start on the market.  By interpretive analogy, Arrakis is the middle east with its riches of oil and the Guild represents capitalist corporations.  Corporations generally do not politically rule the areas they exploit, but rather have a political entity which covers for them, in this case the Empire.  Political control of the region is granted to an Imperial appointee, but their job is, primarily, to keep the local population pacified and maximize production for corporate use.  In addition, the Empire also enforces the Guild's monopoly by acting against smugglers as well as ensuring that no legal competition with the Guild is allowed.  In the end, I think asking why the Guild doesn't run Arrakis directly is like asking why British Petroleum didn't run Arabia directly in 1920.   Because it suits them better to have someone else be politically responsible for the population and working with, rather than against, the Imperial political system already in place ensures legal enforcement of their own monopolies."
dune,2wxoi4,Comrade_Beric,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:20:30 2015 UTC,I think you are conflating Guild and CHOAM...
dune,2wxoi4,BrooWel,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"No, the metaphor simply gets complicated when trying to port it over to real life.  CHOAM is a corporation but its operations are controlled by the Empire, while the Spacing Guild is the group actually using the Spice to move everyone around.  When reading it as a metaphor for real life, who are they, then?  It would seem ""The Spacing Guild"" is a metaphor for capitalist industries as a whole, where as CHOAM is simply a government run oil corporation.  The metaphor still holds with what I was saying, though, because the Guild still needs the Emperor and his government to enforce their monopoly, just as governments enforce patent monopolies today, etc."
dune,2wxoi4,Comrade_Beric,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:49:55 2015 UTC,"There is no and to my knowledge ever has been, a monopoly analogous to the Spacing Guild in the real life.  The key to the Spacing Guild's monopoly is that it is not granted by the Emperor, but instead emanates from the Guilds navigators themselves. And since the Guild is already around it can defend its monopoly by threatening to deny FTL travel to the Empire. In case anybody tried to form a new navigator order or supplant the Guild by other means.  Yes, Emperor on the other hand, could threaten to deny spice from the Guild. However this is a MAD scenario and thus not really on the table as long as the Emperor is not completely mad."
dune,2wxoi4,BrooWel,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"The East India company held a monopoly on trade from the British crown for quite some time, and older guilds during the middle ages used to hold government-enforced monopolies.  For example, the Miller's Guild was the only group allowed to own and operate mills within England.  The Miller's Guild, however, couldn't actually shut down an unguilded mill on their own authority.  It was up to the government which had issued the guarantee of their monopoly to shut down those unguilded mills.  The point of the power of the Emperor, then, wouldn't be in the ability to deny spice to the guild.  It would be in their enforcement on the ban against smuggling and non-spice using space travel.  It is the Emperor who would ensure that there is not, and cannot legally ever be, competition with the Guild.  That, in addition to the actual collection of Spice itself, would be the service the Emperor provides.  The Guild may be able to perform that second activity if it held Arrakis directly, but not the former.  That requires political control over all of humanity which the Emperor has, but the Guild could not take without much much more than simply a coup on Dune."
dune,2wxoi4,Comrade_Beric,3,Wed Feb 25 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"The thing with The East India Company was that it was a monopoly granted by the sovereign. And was a holding of the crown. I read an excellent article which went into considerable detail on the topic, but cannot find it at the moment. As such it was merely an extension of the crown. CHOAM is in fact the analogy to the East India Company - including the dominant share held by the Emperor.  The Spacing Guild is bound to Spice, not to the crown. And while Emperor controls the spice, he cannot destroy the Guild without destroying the Empire as I mentioned earlier.  Perhaps you have forgotten, but Heighliners are under Guild sovereignty and anybody breaking Guild rules may get banned from space travel. Also Guild does not care about the cargo at all. As long as you follow the Guild rules. That is how smugglers were able to get supplies for Paul.  The ""ban"" on non Guild space travel is not of Emperors goodwill towards the Guild, but of Guild's inherent position of power.  With Spacing Guild, the bad news is they have a monopoly on space travel. On the other hand, the good news is they only really care about space travel and stable Spice supply. Which seems like doubly a good thing if you are an Emperor. At least until a random Mahdi comes along."
dune,2wxoi4,BrooWel,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2x4ps4/til_that_the_dutch_east_india_company_was_the/  It was a monopoly guaranteed by the sovereign, yes, but a government-held controlling interest was not a feature of the company until much later.  The government ensured their monopoly in exchange for a cut of their profits, like basically all medieval guilds.  A corporation with a controlling interest held by the government is different and, yes, would be more analogous to CHOAM than the Spacing Guild.  I still believe that a monopoly, enforced by Imperial law, for the Spacing Guild does neatly explain why they wouldn't simply enact a coup on Arrakis and control the source of the Spice directly.  It would usurp the CHOAM company and Imperial control over the spice, but it would irreparably damage relations with the Empire and create an atmosphere in which the Emperor has no reason to grant or enforce a monopoly for the Guild.  Assuming I'm wrong and you are correct, then what is your reasoning for the Spacing Guild not collecting the Spice directly?  If their monopoly is inherent, and not enforced by Imperial law, then what incentive do they have to allow Imperial control of Arrakis?"

Basically the Spacing Guild is super conservative because the limited prescience of the Navigators does not allow to see any scenarios where they take over and the spice flow doesn't stop.

dune,2wxoi4,Chillibowl,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Paul answers this question in the book itself. To preface this, remember that in the books the Guild is portrayed as extremely secretive: no one has ever reported seeing a navigator and even the BG is not sure how the guild does what they do. Their total dependence on the spice is not common knowledge.  The Guild's decision not to takeover Arrakis is both a result of and a cause of the Guild's limited prescience. The Guild navigators have limited prescience, not Paul-like prescience. The Guild of course could do as you say, but in every limited iteration that they project, openly revealing their dependance on the spice and becoming an active player in the politics of the Empire, participating in commerce, and not being completely neutral (or at least appearing to be completely neutral) eventually ends with the end of the Guild as they know it. Paul specifically says ""they could have lived their day and then died"" (I think that's the exact words but I don't remember). Instead they choose longevity, the choose to follow a path where the Guild always exists because that's what their prescience tells them is the safest path for their survival. At the same time Paul notes that choosing the safest path also limited their ability to see past the Guild's supposed end and realise that they were only seeing change, from the Guild as they knew it into something else.   TL:DR: The Guild predicted that doing as you say would eventually end with their destruction, but the didn't realise that there were other paths they didn't see that led there was well. It's the prophetic trap that also comes back to haunt Paul, but that Leto escapes by embracing."

I'm just blunt i guess.. also, in all the other scenes where they're saying that Arrakis is a Harkonnen trap, Leto is very casual about it, saying things like “Knowing where the trap is-- that's the first step in evading it.” aaand my final defense is that when he asked what could be done for Leto specifically, i thought it was more personal."

The Duke Leto knows that the spice is everything and he knows that the Harkonnen have given up Arrakis without a fight and in place, the emperor has given it to the Atreides.  This is how he knows that when they go to Arrakis that the trap will eventually be sprung and the purpose of it will be to destroy the Atreides war-machine and kill the Duke.  He feels that his chances of surviving this trap are negligible but there is hope for his son, Paul.  You need to understand that these are leaders of world/s. They have some of the greatest political minds (Thufir Hawat) in their employ and Leto is no fool himself. Like a game of chess they've evaluated the various 'moves' that are likely to occur and this is why the Duke know he is to die."

Metaphorically he dies the same way the Duke does.   The Author does an interesting thing with this. The whole plot is laid out in the first few chapters. We know the Baron wants Arrakis back and that the Emperor will secretly give him Sardaukar force to achieve this. We know there is a traitor in house Atreides. We know who it is.

The 1984 movie tried (and did a good job) of fitting most of the plot points in, but it was left feeling disconnected to someone who hadn't read the books and thus was a major box-office failure. Maaybe you could split the first book into two (three I feel is a stretch) films, but I think there's too much detail that the audience would have to carry over between each film to make the entire story make sense. It's a dense book, no doubt about it.  That being said, each of the subsequent books seem to be much better suited for a film, except there isn't enough action to excite American movie-goers.  tl;dr I don't think anything beyond a re-edit of the 1984 movie is possible"

I further recommend his ""Consentiency Universe.""  Those are ""The Whipping Star"" and ""The Dosadi Experiment."" As a warning, these have aliens, albeit well treated aliens.  In the same vein ""The Godmakers"" is an incredible quick read, as are many of his other standalones.  Hope this helped!

I'm currently reading a non-fiction book about Newton's time at the mint by Thomas Levenson and I'm struck at how well Stephenson's telling of that time period was researched, as much of what was part of the fabric of his novel appears in this obviously well researched book that I'm reading."

You know it cannot be like the book you but you can show respect for the book whilst making a great movie.  Although I'm unsure as to how many movies I'd want I know it would be many. I'm also unsure of how it would be broken down as there are very few 'actions scenes' in Dune yet a lot of dialogue so as an collection of movies it'd be quite slow.

""The eyes of Muad’Dib""  Few historical records on Arrakis survived the Starvation and the Scattering, but if they concerned the city of Arrakeen, and if they discussed religious matters, they were likely to have made reference to ""The Eyes of Muad'Dib""; though something that could be seen by every resident of the city every day, ""The Eyes"" were never described.  Now with the discovery of the Hoard, this minor puzzle has been solved, and its solution provides a curious sidelight into the mores and thinking of the Fremen of the eleventh millennium.  In 10196, as is well known, Paul Atreides used used his family atomics to breach the Shield Wall, about 1500 meters high at that point, south of Arrakeen. Through the gap moved his forces to destroy the surprised Sardaukar. After Paul assumed the throne, the gap remained as a visible sign of his conquest, and became a place honored by the Fremen. In 10211, two years after Paul went into the desert, a delegation from the city of Arrakeen approached the regent Alia with a proposal to create a monument to Muad'Dib at the west end of the gap. They pointed out that the crumbled edge of the west wall bore a rough likeness of a human face; playing both with and against powerful religious feelings, the delegation interpreted the likeness as a sign from Shai-Hulud that on that spot should be carved a gigantic likeness of Paul, looking out over the bled. Anxious to secure her power base, Alia agreed to the plan, and allocated resources sufficient to begin work on the form of a hooded face, rising 400 meters from the chin to the top of the head.  Work was to proceed through a modified use of the wind-etching technique — the first attempt to wind-etch on such a monumental scale, but a technique in keeping with Fremen tradition. Areas to be protected were to be covered with sheets of plasteel thus allowing the sandstorms from the desert side of the wall to grind away the exposed areas. It was estimated that the project would take sixty years to complete, after which the whole sculpture would be coated with a protective surfacing until such time (perhaps three or four hundred years) as climatic changes had reduced sandstorms to the extent that protection was no longer needed.  The work became a source of discord as soon as the plan was announced, because many of the desert Fremen held religious scruples against the representation of the human form in general, and against a depiction of the Messiah in particular. Nevertheless, work began and by 10218, high up on the west wall of the gap, there reared the gigantic form of a hood above two heavily lidded eyes (construction had proceeded from the top down, on scaffolding lowered from the rim of the wall). By this time, sentiment against the project was so vocal that Alia, confronting mounting political problems, ordered work to be set aside till some quieter period. That calmer time never came, however, and Leto II replaced Alia in the next year. Work was then permanently halted on the project, and only ""The Eyes of Muad'Dib"" remained to stare sightlessly into the desert into which their original had wandered.  ""The Eyes of Muad'Dib"" remained one of the supreme attractions of Arrakis until Leto II destroyed the sculpture when the gap was widened and deepened to permit passage of the Idaho River.  W.E.M.

dune,2w9jpm,SuetyDig,22,Wed Feb 18 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Children of Dune isn't bad, better than Messiah, worse than the first book.  God Emperor is a slog when you read it at first, but after you finish the series you realize how awesome it is.    Heretics and Chapterhouse are page-turners.  Maybe not as subtle as the first book, but better than Children and Messiah.   I know it sounds lame to say ""Read the next 3000 pages and then you'll understand!"" but you really will!"
dune,2w9jpm,ill_mango,18,Wed Feb 18 02:22:48 2015 UTC,God Emperor was my favorite and I've read all canon.

dune,2w9jpm,GoodAlaskanNews,2,Wed Feb 18 13:01:53 2015 UTC,God Emperor of Dune is the best book once you read it the second time after finishing the series.  It is sort of a prequel you didn't know was a prequel until you read it a second time.
dune,2w9jpm,BrooWel,4,Wed Feb 25 19:18:06 2015 UTC,Having read most of the Malazan series it wouldn't be the first time someone told me to read 1000+ pages before something was made clear. I'm happy to hear it'll make sense at some point. Guess I'll start reading Children of Dune then
dune,2w9jpm,watermanjack,8,Wed Feb 18 02:29:29 2015 UTC,"Herbert never gets back to how well written ""Dune"" is, which isn't surprising since he spent so much time developing it.

dune,2w9jpm,cocainebubbles,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:46:51 2015 UTC,heretics was definitely my favorite after Dune. Mainly cause I fell like it captured the same sort of magical ambiguity that the first book had.
dune,2w9jpm,mattcolville,10,Wed Feb 25 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"Herbert thought the lesson of Dune was 'do not follow charismatic leaders.' But I don't think anyone got that lesson, we mostly all thought Paul was aces.  So he wrote Dune Messiah to try and show how dangerous a charismatic leader is. How, even with the best intentions, he attracts manipulative immoral power-seekers. And billions die in the Fremen Jihads.  But that doesn't make for very good storytelling."

dune,2w9jpm,ClandestineMovah,3,Wed Feb 18 03:53:44 2015 UTC,I only like the first. I read the others but they become increasingly nonsensical.  In my opinion.  If you love the first you'll likely read the others anyway but I suspect you might regret it.
dune,2w9jpm,stu8319,1 point,Wed Feb 18 13:36:01 2015 UTC,I'm making may way through Heretics right now but I'm starting to think I would have been happier not reading past the first.
dune,2w9jpm,ClandestineMovah,2,Wed Feb 18 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"I wanted to know if the story went anywhere but it really doesn't.  It becomes increasingly incoherent. The first book is quite concise whereas the following books are not and go wherever they want to go. The final books go full bat-shit crazy with some of the concepts.   I suppose it depends how far your prepared to let your imagination go but I found all the books but the first to be just silly.  Also, I never liked any of the characters like I did in the first book.   How can they compare to Gurney Halleck?"

It's also worth remembering this is just my opinion.  Perhaps a change of direction. I strongly recommend you read Protector by Larry Niven. Dune is my favourite book but I love Protector very much.
dune,2w9jpm,stu8319,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:57:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks for the suggestion! I will check it out, but I've made it this far, I'm definitely finishing the Frank series of books."

dune,2w9jpm,Realik,2,Wed Feb 18 15:04:50 2015 UTC,Children is the best book. Messiah is awesome if you know what you are reading
dune,2w9jpm,MortRouge,2,Wed Feb 18 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"If you didn't like Messiah you might like Children. Parts of it, anyhow.  But do try again. I reread Dune just recently, and it seems so childish when compared to Messiah. Messiah was also the book that got me to read further the first time I read the books.  Also, Messiah might make more sense in style after you've read God Emperor."
dune,2w9jpm,insidiom,2,Wed Feb 18 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"Past Dune, they can be tough to read.  God Emperor was really hard to follow with all the big concepts - and being so alien from the first three.  But God Emperor is my favorite because I loved the story of Leto and Hwi - and Leto's mind was really fascinating.  I suggest you read all of them.  It's a great series and there are many moments where I put the book down to ponder something that I read.  And despite the abrupt ending in Chapterhouse, I think that it caps the series well.  Like life, you sometimes don't get the fulfillment you expect.  It makes the journey better than the arrival."
dune,2w9jpm,tall_comet,3,Thu Feb 19 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"Contrary to most people's opinion on this sub, I personally think the original Dune is the best book in the series. The rest of the Herbert books are definitely worth reading as they give you a much broader exposure to the Dune universe, but the original is still the only one I've re-read."
dune,2w9jpm,mrkeked,12,Wed Feb 18 02:42:26 2015 UTC,I think that's actually the most common opinion over here.
dune,2w9jpm,confitqueso,1 point,Wed Feb 18 07:22:24 2015 UTC,"Children was much better than messiah in my opinion.  I couldn't get through god emporer. The skip forward 1000 years in the plot line kinda ruined things for me.  I also read the 2 modern books written by Frank Herbert s son in between Dune and messiah, messiah and children. The writing isn't phychadelic like the originals but it fills in the gaps in the story and helps you understand the originals better."
dune,2w9jpm,MrFatalistic,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"I did not like Dune Messiah, especially the early portions of the book, however Children of Dune made up for it, and my favorite takes place after (God Emperor) which doesn't make a lot of sense if you don't bother to get through both Messiah/Children.  I've seen a couple camps with this, some say don't read past ""Dune"" others say don't read past ""Children"" but I really enjoyed the whole 6 book series."
dune,2w9jpm,-Nkoe-,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"I have to say i read all 6 books about 8 years ago, one after the other, and thought the same thing about Messiah. It was a total downer. I recently picked up the series again, at a slower pace and read Messiah a few months after finishing Dune for the second time. I got to say i have grown to understand Messiah as a fantastic corollary to Dune. It adds a lot more weight to Paul's story than i remembered. So I wouldn't try reading it again right now, probably give it more time and then pick up the series again. As you change during that time, so will the parts of each book that speak to you. Cheers!"
dune,2w9jpm,ravingStork,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"I know some people are split on stopping after Children or stopping after God Emperor but I guess a lot of commenters here loved God Emperor. I personally found it terribly boring with a lot of amateur philosophy that isn't compelling or interesting.  But a lot of people here like it so if you don't mind to keep going, keep going but if you didn't like messiah, I would say read Children's and be done with it. It is better than Messiah and a good place to stop. You will want to read God Emperor, you will want to really bad, but I wish I wouldn't have. I don't think the other books come close to the first, just because of the novelty of the whole universe. I took the Dune series as great because of the universe. The characters, especially women characters, quite silly. This is just another opinion that I think needs to be here for you to consider your next move in the Dune universe."
dune,2w9jpm,rhinowing,0,Wed Feb 18 20:39:50 2015 UTC,messiah is the worst in the series. most people on this sub love god emperor but I think sandworms / chapterhouse are the best. so keep reading!

dune,2w6saf,tollfreecallsonly,-4,Tue Feb 17 14:25:53 2015 UTC,Your analogy only works if you ignore all the differences between the cars which dramatically affect the person's experience. Driving a high end sports car is much more pleasurable and enjoyable than driving a beater for a multitude of reasons.   Books are different because the experience is the same so long as the contents are identical. You will derive no additional enjoyment just because one is hardback or costs $110.
dune,2w6saf,saqwarrior,2,Tue Feb 17 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"This obviously isn't true.  Some people prefer paper and some people prefer an e-book.  The way the words are presented does make a difference.  It might not be a good value for you, but it could be for someone else."
dune,2w6saf,root88,0,Tue Feb 17 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me that you would get more enjoyment from reading the Twilight books if they were leather-bound $110 copies? Because for what you're saying to be true, that must be the case, and frankly, I don't think that would be true.   People can rationalize purchases like this however they like, but the fact is that the enjoyment of a book comes from the quality of its content. Someone claiming that they prefer the leather-bound copy because it looks better on a shelf is an issue of interior design, not reading.   Also, the primary point of my comment was to show the error of his car analogy."
dune,2w6saf,saqwarrior,2,Wed Feb 18 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying, his car analogy was exactly correct.  They both get you there, but one may be more slightly enjoyable than the other.  Maybe people just like the feel of leather.  Maybe someone wants to sit back, relax, and read a cashmere covered book because it tickles their fingers or the nicer paper is easier on their eyes.  Maybe the smell of the fine materials are soothing.  It's an insane cost, but some people have an insane amount of money.  Yes, both the cars and both the books get you to the same place, but one of each does it with a more style and comfort.  This is true for pretty much anything you can purchase.  It kind of baffles me how you can't see this."
dune,2w6saf,root88,0,Tue Feb 17 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"It kind of baffles me how you can't see this.   What should baffle you is why you think that someone disagreeing with you equates to them ""not seeing it."" People have different opinions, which you obviously take issue with since you seem to be downvoting me for not agreeing with you.  I get what you're saying, I just think it's malarkey in regards to reading books. As I already pointed out, a leather-bound version of a shitty book will not improve your experience. Ergo a leather-bound version of a good book is equally meaningless -- and any distinction made otherwise is simply a rationalization made to justify their aesthetic preference for hardback/paperback/ebook/papyrus/whatever. As an example: I have multiple copies of The Silmarillion, including an early large edition that I'm somewhat fond of. But I do not enjoy it any more as a book just because it's prettier on the outside."
dune,2w6saf,saqwarrior,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"a leather-bound version of a shitty book will not improve your experience     Ofc it will improve your experience. But probably not enough to actually read it regardless. You are obviously right that the actual content is by far the most important part, but HOW the content is delivered matters a lot too. Would you read a good book if there only would be one word on each site? Would you really enjoy it as much? (yes i know this is pretty extreme, but it gets the point across i think) In the end it just comes down to how much money you would spend additionally to get this extra amount of value. Personally i enjoy reading a paper book much more than reading the same thing on my kindle, so i absolutely am ok with paying 3-4 dollars more for paperbacks than i would for the kindle version for example.     But I do not enjoy it any more as a book     Which isn't the point. The point is if you enjoy it more READING it. Nobody says the story gets better, but the enjoyment of actually reading itself can be better/worse"

dune,2w0m8h,raskolnik,1 point,Tue Feb 17 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"I don't speak German, so I can't say for sure.  But I will say that I looked it up awhile ago after first finding the quote, and the only reference to that translation is from Dune.  I'm yet to see any usage that conforms with it.  Meanwhile, I have seen another usage, specifically having to do with a story that builds tension.  There's some discussion on the Wiktionary talk page for the word, for example.  But again, I haven't been able to find an example of anyone willing to translate it that way."
dune,2w0m8h,Westergo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 11:10:55 2015 UTC,"The word exists in Dutch (I'm Dutch) as ""Spanningsboog"" and it has the meaning ""The time that someone can spend in concentration/focus"". I can't find much on the German version.  Edit: Some additional info: Often, spanningsboog is used, for example, to describe how there is a build up of tension in a book or movie (spanning can be translated as 'tension' or 'suspense'). This building of tension helps make the release of that tension (i.e. the end-game) more interresting. A good build-up also makes it more difficult for the reader to put the book down, as he/she wants to know how it will end. A 'boog' is a bow. If you draw the string, the tension on the bow increases. The stronger the build-up of tension, the stronger the force when the tension is suddenly released."

dune,2vtu5n,jax201,5,Sat Feb 14 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"This video I just discovered is mostly Brian Herbert talking about the Lynch movie and the miniseries.   The interesting part is the mention that Frank Herbert saw a 5 hour cut of Lynch's Dune and was generally satisfied with it.  The part about him not liking the ending is dead on, since he mentioned in an interview that the film shows Paul being a god by making rain when he was just playing to being one in the book.   Aside from that, all reports and commentaries from Herbert about the film have been positive and he mentioned that it surpassed his expectations in many aspects.  The 5 hour cut has been theorized again and again, and many say it was just a rough cut, never meant to reach the cinemas.   But the astonishing difference of length between it and the final version makes you think how much more material there is buried in the vaults and how much comprehensive it would have been if completed (the Scifi miniseries lasts 6 hours so that should give you an idea).  I know for a fact that a few scenes remain unreleased (Paul in the temple) since I've seen stills of them, but they were never included neither in the special editions nor the alternate cuts flowing through the web.  There's more information about those scenes here... http://www.duneinfo.com/giedi_prime/dvd_extended/"
dune,2vtu5n,LorJSR,2,Sat Feb 14 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"Hrmm.. I would dearly love to see the extended-extended cut. Hell, I've been trying to get my hands on the rumoured 4 hour version for a long time.   You mention that Frank Herbert quote about the ending of the film --   I have my quibbles about the film, of course. Paul was a man playing god, not a god who could make it rain.   You said, ""...the film shows Paul being a god by making rain when he was just playing to being one in the book.""   I was always sure the quote should be taken the other way around, i.e. Paul in the film was a man playing at being a god, whereas in the Book he is a god - the Kwisatz Haderach. Have I got it the wrong way round this whole time? =O"
dune,2vtu5n,my_socrates_note,3,Sat Feb 14 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for bringing the quote, but I'm pretty sure he's not meant to be a god in the book either even though in the movie it could go either way.  His powers in the movie could be interpreted as a variant of the space guild navigators abilities to fold space.  They see the safest route for the journey through their limited prescience, he could actually fold space and bring rain from another world (completely unfounded and personal theory).  In the book he's never shown to be a god at all, he's a superbeing and the pinnacle (before Leto II) of a long and expensive selective breeding meant to give the Bene Gesserit a perfect prescient with the genetic memories of both is male and female ancestors (this aspect is kinda left hanging there in the movie and the miniseries til Leto II arrives).  The entire point of the Dune saga is that as far as everybody knows, there's no god at all, only people's belief.   Herbert even mentioned that in a couple of interviews. People should believe in themselves and their own capacities.   This is both an indictment of religion and politics but not a clear pronunciation on the existence of god/s since he also mentions in the books that god doesn't have to prove his existence to us.  Dune Messiah show's Paul exhausted and trapped by the Jihad, taking extreme measures to release himself from his own myth.  Leto II even mentions that in GEOD when he says he's the true religious conscience of the empire because he's the only one who can't pray at all.  I've always seen this a subtle confirmation to the nonexistence of any supreme being/s, since Leto, with unlimited access to all his previous lives, could have perfectly known if there was ever something like that.  If in all his lives, he's never seen anything of the sort, then he concludes that a supreme being either doesn't exist or doesn't manifest at all in a way we can perceive or understand.  Herbert did believe in some type of unexplainable forces, like he mentions in the beginning of one edition of Messiah of Dune when referring to the tarot.   But he always stroke me as an agnostic, wary of charlatans an organized religions (too often the same) but humble enough to avoid definitive pronunciations about an unsolvable subject.  Edit: added a few details after checking my books, sorry about that."

Despite including concepts like the Tarot, prescience and such, he never gave a supernatural explanation to any of them. He showed them as human phenomena born from humanity itself.  Daniel and Marty, are most likely thinking machines or face dancers, or a mix of both.  I'm quite convinced the great enemy are in fact the thinking machines, Herbert simply had spent decades building a universe populated only by men, and their only natural antithesis, aside from themselves, were their own creations.  Not gods, not aliens, the ancient enemy. The machines.  I can't find a single way to back any other alternative (my teen mind believed there were aliens or gods too but Herbert kept them away from Dune for a reason)"

If the pupil or cornea turned blue, you wouldn't be able to see (or everything would look blue), and I'm pretty sure Frank would have mentioned that.

He's not the right director for the books.  What he does is that he takes Shakespearean tactics, and waters them down for a modern audience.  He then takes out all drama, until he kills a supporting character, whose death is quickly forgotten so that characters can make more 'witty' banter and save the day.  Dune has enough great quotes that Whedon isn't needed.  Dune also has its own unique sense of humour, and its the type that goes over most people's heads, so you can take the entire saga as a tragedy of the effects of power, or a comedy of the absurdity of types of power."

dune,2vcei8,JohnJacobJHSchmidt,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would rather it was made into a really well-produced animated series, with character designs by Mamoru Nagano, and get the best of the best voice talent, even if they aren't household names. Spend the bulk of the budget on the writing team and the animation, rather than box-office A-listers. Put it on HBO and I bet it would be good. A major problem with live-action is that of Harry Potter: the protagonist is meant to be a smallish 15-year-old, and it's hard to do a single film, let alone the series we need, with very young actors, partly because of subject matter and partly because of the basic fact that kids age so quickly. Animation obviates these problems.   If we absolutely have to have a live-action film, I'd sooner see unknowns for the most part. Go for look and feel, rather than name recognition."

The reason you adapt a work from one medium to another is because it inspired you. That inspiration is your only responsibility as an artist. An Jodo was quite obviously inspired.  The ending, for one thing, sounded brilliant and frankly better than Frank's ending. Dune just stops. Which, if you know how he was writing it, makes sense. He'd already written big chunks of Dune Messiah and so just chopped off Dune after its anti-climax, and picked things up in the next book.   There were a lot of bits of Jodo's Dune that I thought were brilliantly inspired. But they were inspired. He read the book, it inspired thoughts in him, and some of those thoughts were amazing."

In other words - when J. thought he was seeing something in Dune that he then wanted to bring unto the screen, what he was really seeing was the acid/his own ideas.

dune,2v649y,Egon88,0,Mon Feb 9 00:40:56 2015 UTC,I'm not aware that this has been demonstrated. Please point me to this info.

dune,2v649y,Egon88,2,Sun Feb 8 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"Most of that isn't referring to the Dune 7 books and none of it suggests they didn't follow an outline laid out by FH. Also, much of it is petty ie: FH described a lasgun beam as purple but KJA said invisible. Would that actually ruin a book for you."
dune,2v649y,eremiticjude,2,Sun Feb 8 18:03:16 2015 UTC,Eventually it gets to taking apart the so called sequels. But it's much more than las color. They try and retcon ALL of the original three books to be lies irulan wrote. They tried to retroactively upgrade their own bullshit above the original three. Ponder on that.
dune,2v649y,Egon88,0,Sun Feb 8 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"No thx, that would be a waste of time. Just take them for what they are."
dune,2v649y,Adrialic,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:03:24 2015 UTC,"It shows an ignorance of the story they claim to be continuing. Its hard to take anything else they write seriously when they cant be bothered to get basic details right.   A recent parallel i encountered for this: if someone cant even pronounce schrodinger correctly, would you listen to anything else they have to say about quantum mechanics?"
dune,2v649y,Egon88,2,Sun Feb 8 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"I would if it was correct.   Anyway, I notice that you seem to have read all the KJA stuff so you obviously felt is worth continuing rather than abandoning."
dune,2v649y,DocOnDrugs,-8,Sun Feb 8 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree on almost everything you said but i'm not gonna try to change you mind, it is yours to keep :)  Also Franks last 3 dune books were terrible, it was clear he only pumped them out for cash. The prequels are much better, without a doubt."
dune,2v649y,eremiticjude,7,Sun Feb 8 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"you can disagree with my response to the corpsefuckers' sequels, but you can't on the subject of the speciousness of their claim to be authentic. as for your claim re: the last three dune books, you're just trolling, which is sad. the dune books, by that point, were not keeping FH in gold plated bentleys. the problem many, you included probably, had with them is that they were more dialog heavy and philosophical than action. most people don't mind thinking, so long as they can get some action scenes to space it out. FH threw away the formula with God Emperor and everything after it."
dune,2v649y,L3PU5,3,Sun Feb 8 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. The soulless monstrosities of Anderson and that traitorous bastard are so completly out of line with Frank Herberts work, that I wonder at how anyone can ever call any of it ""amazin"". People that don't like the second trilogy at all are probably too shallow or dense to appreciate the subtle genius behind them. Those if us that love Herbert senior, read and reread his works because you get new insight with every read, peeling back the layers with every read-through. That just doesn't happen with the pretenders books, what you see is what you get, I can't even bother to read those books *once anymore. It's like watching Star Wars ep4-6, then you watch the soulless prequels, imagine if he would have made a new shitty Star Wars movie every year for over ten years. Eventually you stop caring, i stopped caring after they dropped their monstrous chapterhouse sequels, it was the last straw and I refuse to give them any more money."
dune,2v649y,The_Dirty_Carl,3,Sun Feb 8 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"While Heretics and Chapterhouse probably weren't up to the same standard as the others, God Emperor is amazing and ties the entire series together beautifully."

dune,2uwy0u,war3rd,2,Thu Feb 5 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"I think the nail in the coffin to all this is that Bill Ransom, co-author Frank of the ENTIRE Pandora trilogy, who was able to from a single draft and outlining complete The Ascension Factor after Herbert's death, was not brought on.  Brian's NOT a stellar writer, but he wrote a decent standalone novel with his dad, and I think combined with Ransom who worked with Frank for years (need I mention on the only Herbert work which operates on the most similar thematic resonance of all his other non-Dune returns with Dune), then they could have done a good job, especially if they had those ""Dune 7 notes"" to go on.  But no.  He hired Kevin, an ill-reputed literary whore/professional fanfic writer, who's greatest achievement- the substandard sequel series to the original Star Wars Trilogy, just got obliterated into obsolescence by Disney.  Fuck."

I didn't really care much about the differences in style and story.  Whenever friends ask me what Dune books to read I always recommend Dune as a great standalone if they just want a taste, but if they are willing to commit I hand them the Butlerian Jihad, just with the note that it's not the original author.  I've been re-reading the series again over the last couple years and the only thing that bothers me are the minor plot discrepancies."
dune,2uwy0u,lundse,2,Fri Feb 6 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"If you feel that you need some details on Pauls boyhood adventures - stealing away on guild ships, joining the circus, that sort of thing - or if you feel the series should have ended with some kind of psychic uber-hero to save us all from insane, crossdressing robots, then you should definitely read KJA's pulp crap.  If you feel those things are ever so slightly not quite in the context of Frank Herbert's Dune, then - apart from having a reading comprehension level about 5th grade - you can save yourself a lot of money and time.  Just read the wikipedia recaps, if you have to - better prose, cheaper and quicker. Still good for a laugh :-)"
dune,2uwy0u,fedaykin13,2,Tue Feb 10 04:15:55 2015 UTC,If you have time in your life for some long 'popcorn' books?  Absolutely.  People complain--some have merit  I did not go in expecting to read a Frank Herbert book...  Because he didn't write them.  They don't have the layers of the father's books.  But I was certainly entertained.  I enjoyed the Butlerian Jihad series the most.
dune,2uwy0u,jax201,2,Tue Feb 10 13:30:25 2015 UTC,"You make great points Fedaykin, I've read and enjoyed popcorn books.  But you can't call one of those Dune, it just goes again the very nature of what made Herbert famous.  If they had published those stories without the Dune brand name, I would have zero beef with them and probably respect them a lot more.  So yes, I agree you can enjoy them,   I've nothing against that, but those books are not Dune.   Is like painting a beetle like a Ferrari and insisting is a Ferrari just because the guy who sells it says so."
dune,2uwy0u,fedaykin13,2,Fri Feb 6 15:05:11 2015 UTC,I'm not as bothered by that.  I get why people might be.  I tried reading one of his own novels...'the race for god'?  Not too good.  Do I consider them canon?  No--Herbert is one of my favorite authors.   I'm just not that offended by the son's books.
dune,2uwy0u,fedaykin13,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"OK, that's a good perspective. I don't have a lot of free time, so I have to choose my books carefully, but perhaps grabbng one or so when I'm on holiday may make for a simply entertaining read. I'm like that with films. They don't always have to be incredible experiences, it's OK to merely be entertained with fun without depth sometimes, right?"
dune,2uwy0u,riouxda,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:50:56 2015 UTC,That sounds like a plan. If you don't have a lot of free time and need to plan your books--read a better one and save this for vacation when you don't want anything too deep.
dune,2uwy0u,AnoArq,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"I know I'm gonna be in the minority here but, I'm actually reading House Corrino. I read House Atreides and Harkonnen before it and, I didn't hate them. But, I must explain this first. The first time I started reading House Atreides, I hated it. I just had in mind Frank Herbert's writing and, it was way different. And somehow, I would just compare the too... compare how I had imagined things and how I thought Frank Herbert imagined them and, I couldn't stand how those books were different. So I let them rest... for two years. In the mean time, I read all kind of bestsellers novels. And then, I was in a mood for some Dune and decided to go back to House Atreides and try it again. And somehow, I kind of had forgotten how Herbert was writing them... And also, I had read some bestsellers where the writing was horrendous. I started reading House Atreides and I see it in a new light! The writing is not that bad, although, it must not be compared to Frank's writings. But, after three books, I now feel that I'm in the Dune universe. Of course, things would have been different with Frank Herbert but, I think that his son and KJA did succeed in recreating a universe where the Harkonnen are plotting agains everyone, where the Atreides are noble and all... And I feel like it can expand the universe of Dune. Like I said, I'm in the minority here. And I still haven't read the other books so I can't judge them yet. But, I do enjoy the Before Dune series immensely now. So, if you are able to try to forget Frank Herbert's style, I do recommend them. If, like many, you just can't stand something that is different, then, don't go there, keep a good memory of what the originals are and, go read something else!"

dune,2ut7io,elliottok,2,Thu Feb 5 04:51:58 2015 UTC,What? The first book is just scratching the surface of what dune is really about. That's like saying someone should watch ten minutes of a movie and completely abandon points where the plot begins to develop.

But I thought it was pretty much accepted that Dune's major development doesn't start until after the first book. I mean, at least to me, people aren't getting the full picture of what Herbert is talking about until they read at the very least Messiah. Dune is kinda incomplete without it."
dune,2ut7io,gumbagumba,0,Thu Feb 5 15:15:58 2015 UTC,I don't know. Dune is a pretty great book just on its own.
dune,2ut7io,elliottok,3,Thu Feb 5 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's disagreeing with this sentiment, but rather saying that the sequels are just as important, if not more so, in getting the true sense of what Herbert wishes to convey.   Dune itself is not enough to understand what the Dune Universe is all about."

dune,2ut7io,elliottok,2,Thu Feb 5 15:43:58 2015 UTC,Here on /r/dune God Emperor of Dune is the most common book listed as readers' favorite in thread after thread.  Therefore an overwhelming majority of people agree that the first book isn't the most enjoyable.   /s if you couldn't tell  Just because you didn't enjoy the sequels doesn't mean that an overwhelming majority of people didn't.

dune,2ut7io,elliottok,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"Did that go right over your head?  I wasn't trying to prove a point that people in a Dune-themed community are going to like the sequels.  Obviously that information is going to be biased to begin with.  I was discussing confirmation bias, and how that is exactly what you are doing here by parading opinions like ""the overwhelming majority of people do not enjoy the sequels"" as facts just because you yourself did not enjoy them.  You haven't provided any data to back that up.  Nothing but hearsay like ""it's the most common criticism of Dune that I have seen.""  Where have you seen it?    Here's a source that would seem to refute your absurd claim - all six of the original Dune books all rate highly on goodreads.com.  Yes, Dune is the highest rated, but the remainder of the books with 3.75 to 4 star (out of 5) ratings are not enjoyed by ""the overwhelming majority?"" Are you serious?"
dune,2ut7io,stovor,-1,Thu Feb 5 17:05:52 2015 UTC,"Lol ""yes, Dune is the highest rated""  Yeah - exactly my point. Go on Amazon.com and look at reviews. Dune has something like 3,000 reviews. The sequels have a couple of hundred each. Those people are the super fans who read all of the sequels. Most people do not. Why? The sequels are simply not as good as the original. In fact, I would say they're insufferably bad."
dune,2ut7io,elliottok,2,Thu Feb 5 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"Why are you even here on /r/dune?  You showed up just to comment in a thread about typeface, of all things, and immediately changed the subject to how shitty the sequels were and that they're insufferably bad, and how somebody shouldn't bother reading them.  You clearly do not enjoy the source material or any of the themes Frank Herbert was trying to address as evidenced by your comment here in this same thread.  If you want books that provide you with no challenges, or no thought-provoking moments, go to an airport and pickup Dan Brown's newest recycled-plot thriller filled with pseudo-scientific babble and just enough controversy to get publicity to sell.  I'm not saying you aren't entitled to your opinion that the books are insufferably bad, but you're clearly not the target demographic for the Dune series if you don't give two shits about literary themes and just want entertainment out of a book.  To me there's no point of going into a community where you despise nearly 85% of the material the community is based on, just to go in and say that you hate 85% of it and ""everyone else does"" too.  It's bad form.  It'd be like going into the subreddit for bronies just to talk shit because you don't like it.  It's dumb and it accomplishes nothing."

It comes from the 1978 Caedmon Records LP ""Sandworms of Dune"" featuring a selected reading of Dune by Frank Herbert himself. I asked Ian Schoenherr, John's son, on his blog about his father if there were any prints for sale of his father's Dune illustrations, including this one. He said there weren't any, but that he was trying to ""rectify"" the situation.  From what I understand, most of the original paintings are possessed by various members of the Herbert family; and the rights to them are tied up in the Herbert Properties LLC. Considering the HPL are absolute assholes about this kind of stuff, I wouldn't hold much hope of ever seeing high quality copies of Schoenherr's Dune illustrations any time soon.

Now I don't know if these are the ones I stumbled upon (as I stopped reading the appendix after seeing them) but I'm hoping they aren't. I really don't like things that make a major plot influence right away to be known in advance, I love surprises.

Jessica's parentage is revealed early on and just adds an ick factor. After a third of the book, both spoilers will have been revealed to the story.   EDIT: I checked it.

I ""chunked"" them by their relative relationships, with the first three forming a trilogy, God Emperor of Dune being a bit of an odd fit, and then the final two before the author passed a way.  I would just start with the first six myself; as a fan of the series, I've read most of the books overall, but wasn't very impressed with his sons  work.

dune,2ubbht,StumbleOn,17,Sat Jan 31 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the Dune series is incredibly complex and detailed. There is very rich character development.  I think any attempt to present Dune as a movie or short mini-series is bound to fail. You simply can't sufficiently develop the characters and narrative in that short of a space.  Imagine trying to compress Game of Thrones into a single movie or short mini-series. It would be incomprehensibly difficult and the amount of material that would have to be glazed over or ignored would destroy it. In my mind, Dune is no different.  The only way a presentation of Dune would succeed is in the format of a series, spread across about half a dozen seasons.  The problem is that a well-produced series costs upwards of $100 million per season, and it's unlikely to attract a wide enough audience to make the investment worthwhile."

Many folks enjoyed both, for various reasons, but they never really captured the essence of the story or brought in many folks outside those who were already fans and had read the books.

dune,2ubbht,ZloMoHoMo,7,Sun Feb 1 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"Said it before and I'll say it again.  How to tell Dune in a few easy, short seasons (14-15 episodes tops):  BEGIN with narration that leads directly into Dune and allows for some foreshadowing.  Season 1 starts with Dune with some backstory material from the House books.  Just a little to flesh out some more details.  There will be narration interludes.  It won't be entirely clear who the narrator is yet.  Season 1 progresses into Dune Messiah... and we start to get a sense that there is something other-wordly about the narrator.  At the end of the season, we find out that the narrator is Leto II, and we're looking back into his memory.  So, a portion of God-Emperor gets fleshed out.  About 15-20% of it.  Season 2 wraps up Dune Messiah and rolls into Children of Dune.  We are now about... 30%-50% the way through God-Emperor by way of Leto's narration and slightly longer interludes.  Season 3 does the balance of God-Emperor in a couple episodes.  It's a short book, although certainly it was gigantically dense.  Season 3 rolls into Heretics of Dune, and we get a little flavor from the Legends books and the interstitial sequels.  Season 4 is extended, and gives us Chapterhouse and Hunters.  Season 5 gives us Sandworms, with more elements of the Legends books.  That's the game.  Why include Brian/KJA's materials?  Because there is stuff in there that will help fatten the plots in a way that won't hurt the series.  It would be helpful to understand the violent and inhuman nature of Omnius and Erasmus, and the grotesque nature of the titans.  I think this is the most logical way to do this, and the only way to flesh it all out properly."
dune,2ubbht,ancientvoices,2,Sun Feb 1 01:55:35 2015 UTC,that would probably be the best way to go. Good job. I love the thought of having Leto II as the narrator.

dune,2ubbht,tractorinballs,2,Wed Feb 4 07:43:12 2015 UTC,I really love this idea.  Just want to say you have my full support if you ever get a movie deal to adapt Dune!
dune,2ubbht,ZloMoHoMo,2,Sun Feb 1 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"they just suck. you can't watch dune, you have to imagine it."
dune,2ubbht,ZloMoHoMo,5,Thu Feb 5 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dune is about women VS men, i think it's about man VS nature, or greed VS respecting nature. The villains are the  Harkonnens, The Padishah Emperor, The Guild, CHOAM. The ""heroes"" of the story are the Fremen. So Paul goes from being on the team of the villains, to the heroes. the Fremen respect nature, they have formed their society around Arrakis's eco systems and natural cycles. The Guild are the corporate businessmen who ""rape"" Arrakis, by making profit off the spice. When we follow Paul on Caladan, he's pretty flat and boring to me. But when he undergoes the transformation of Dune, his character grows and he becomes the leader, the prophet we remember. We never get to see what happens on a Guild Heighliner, we never see the great engineering humanity has achieved, we never get to attend a CHOAM meeting. These aspects of the Dune universe are ephemeral, they work in closed sircuits right above our heads. But Dune, this seemingly primitive place, we get to know in great detail, because Dune has a heart. It has a pulse. The rest is just cold, meaningless background noise.   This has nothing to do with your original claim about the movies, i just countered your interpretation of Dune with mine. :)"
dune,2ubbht,ZloMoHoMo,3,Sat Jan 31 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dune is about women VS men   Neither do I. You misinterpreted my post if you think I said this.   i think it's about man VS nature, or greed VS respecting nature   I don't agree, I think this is a really superficial understanding.   Dune is about choices and inevitability, couched in a story about greed, nature, corporatism, and power struggles. The fact that Fremen are noble savages is just an easy trope to use but we find later that the Fremen are not as noble as they believe themselves to be and that their society is not as functional as originally presented.   The point, to simplify for you, is that Paul is a force of nature rather than being specifically interesting himself, so a movie would be better retold by treating him as such as not trying to follow what is going on in his head."
dune,2ubbht,Shafalcon_Manbeast,3,Sat Jan 31 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"I can also see how Dune is about choises and inevitability, but i can also see how it is about greed, nature, corporatism, and power struggles. It was certainly that that interested and inspired Herbert primarily, his basic idea was a story about how followers dehumanize their leader and how power attracts the corruptible. And i think i worded my text terribly wrong, with ""Men VS Women"". What i meant was that i don't think Herbert tried to create such a relationship between women and men that you talk of.  Regarding how you would want the movie to be done, i think it would be a catastrophe, to be honest. One of the main messages Herbert was trying to convey was that the Messiah is a human, that is flawed and has all the attributes of a normal human being. To tell the story from the other people's perspective would just cloud Paul in even more illusions of Omnipotence and godhood. And if you want Paul to be clouded in that manner, you have, by Frank's own definiton, missed the point of Dune."
dune,2ubbht,Shafalcon_Manbeast,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Paul is a force of nature and is only human enough to be trapped by that force. He is both person and other, and Herbert hammers on this over and over and over. Nothing Paul did was by choice, it was all by circumstances he was forced to live by. Paul talks about becoming myth!  To tell the story of Paul by those who experienced it would humanize him. We don't feel for people by being inside their heads, we feel for people and understand them through the lens of others experience.  The perspective of Jessica and Chani would go further towards that then focusing entirely on Paul ever could.  Consider: Movie media can't capture internal feelings very well. You can get a good actor to express themselves, but Paul is a stoic. 80s Dune tried to do the whole whisper voiceover crap and it didn't work.  Good drama happens when people begin to interact. Show me, don't tell me, after all. Dune as written is a lot of tell me, whereas it could be rewritten to be on screen as show me, but only from the perspective of others. I feel now that such a show would be a hit.  Also, both the movies turned Paul into a lesser godling without much core humanity. They did exactly what you point out and what Herbert was trying to speak against."
dune,2ubbht,ZloMoHoMo,2,Sat Jan 31 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"That's where i think you're wrong and that's where i think a good adaptation is impossible. Here's why: The dialogue in Dune relies largely on what they thik. Someone says something, the other person thinks about the statement, then chooses the answer that shows her opinion and goal either directly or hidden in the words. Dialogue in Dune is like a sort of battle, they finely tune their words to awaken associations in the person spoken to, they try to control the conversation, foresee the other players next move. And that dialogue is impossible to recreate on screen. The key to creating interesting and complex characters in Dune is that dialogue. So, in conclusion, none of the characters would be as good as in the book. Especially not Paul, if one is to use your way of making a Dune movie adaption. Have you noticed, Stil, how beautiful the young women are this year? ;)"

That last sentence is something that will stick with the readers and preferably sums up a very important theme in the book, as a conclusion. And what is that sentence?   ""We, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine - history will call us wives.""   It completely and utterly wrecks the accusation that the author of this article makes. It underlines that the women in this book are just as much strongly written characters as the men. If Dune did one thing really, really well, it's creating living, breathing characters - even with the feudal system the story has, the ladies are shown to be people in their own right."
dune,2u9tbx,WhichWickedWitch,0,Sat Jan 31 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"I mean the Sci Fi genre is historically dominated by white males. And while I love Dune, the women in the novel are either Bene Gesserit priestesses or just a side note. Also the whole idea of the Bene Gesserit trying to breed a MAN who can see what they as women fail to see is kind of stupid and sexist if you actually think about it."
dune,2u9tbx,LalitaNyima,11,Sat Jan 31 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"The culture in which the characters of Dune live might be sexist, but the story is not.

Paul was ""the one"" but would he have ever made it without Jessica or Chaini? Nope!"

Yet he's just a failed breeding stud who helps his wife manipulate other men."
dune,2u9tbx,LalitaNyima,2,Sat Jan 31 13:29:00 2015 UTC,"I think I would disagree that Paul is the only man in the book with any power. There are lots of powerful men in the Dune universe. Women in the book are relegated to stereo typical female support roles. And you hit the nail on the head when you said   Think about Hasimir Fenring. He's a noble and the right hand of the emperor of the universe. Yet he's just a failed breeding stud who helps his wife manipulate other men.   While you see this manipulation of men as women being powerful, it's actually a stereotypical way for ""powerful"" women to be portrayed in literature. The thing is, these women aren't powerful on their own - the only way they have any power is by manipulating or seducing men. It's only by sexual seduction and witchcraft that they wield any influence. The idea that female characters could be powerful without tricking men is never explored.  The Bene Gesserit, while they wield influence, are portrayed as seductresses who ultimately are only powerful because they are able to manipulate and use men.   Like I said - I love the book. But it's definitely not forward thinking when it comes to gender roles. It doesn't make me like it any less."

As she cried out the words she felt a mind moving in on her own, felt IT seizing, squeezing her brain. Then she realized that Charles Wallace was speaking, or being spoken through by IT.  “But that’s exactly what we have on Camazotz. Complete equality. Everybody exactly alike.”  For a moment her brain reeled with confusion. Then came a moment of blazing truth. “No!” she cried triumphantly. “Like and equal are not the same thing at all!”  But Charles Wallace continued as though there had been no interruption. “In Camazotz all are equal. In Camazotz everybody is the same as everybody else,” but he gave her no argument, provided no answer, and she held on to her moment of revelation.  Like and equal are two entirely different things.  For the moment she had escaped from the power of IT.”   -A Wrinkle in Time pg. 160  There's no meaningful difference between Margot Fenring seducing Feyd and binding him with her witch powers and Paul stabbing him. The Bene Gesserit aren't more overt for the exact reason Jessica gives in the book. If the BG were mind controlling everyone and killing people with their space kung fu, there would be a Jihad against them. For the same reason, the Guild is very subtle in their control and the Emperor uses proxies to destroy his enemies."
dune,2u9tbx,lundse,3,Sat Jan 31 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Manipulation and politics is the name of the game in these books. Though one's gender may be decisive in where one's position in the world is (which, yeah, is sexist because that's their society), few characters resign themselves to any subservient position and are willing to kick ass and chew bubblegum if need be."

If you think about it, it really isn't. It was never said that the BG could not see down their male bloodlines ""just because they are women hur hur"". The reason is not known. That a male at the right point, at the right time, would be able to see in both the male and female Other Memories without dying only shows that a specific set of genes and makeup seemed to be required.  This is about as sexist as stating that men are generally more athletic than women. It's just an acknowledgement of difference in ability. It's also not racist to state that black people are on average more athletic than white people. There are reasons for that, that go beyond social constructs.  Same with the KH. The fact that the BG were looking for the KH as a male person is not a social construct. It's biological."

You then completely ejected from the context and said it was all because of Frank Herbert. Then you proceeded to call every female character in Dune seductresses or home makers.  The absurdity is palpable, especially since the whole strength of the characters from Dune is that it shows that they are more than merely their position in a feudal society."
dune,2u9tbx,elliottok,2,Sat Jan 31 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, the way the story is written is sexist. The female characters are seductresses or home makers.    Have you actually read the book? Or any other in the series? Calling the Bene Gesserit nothing more than ""seductresses"" vastly understates their purpose and shows a complete disregard for the fact that throughout Dune, and the rest of the series, they are a main driving force. Calling Jessica, or perhaps you meant the Fremen women, ""home makers"" is absolutely ridiculous. Jessica not only defies her training and gives birth to a son (he just happens to be the main character) she is a skilled and powerful combatant, diplomat and spiritual leader. The fremen women killed Sardaukar, no easy feat for a trained soldier, let alone a simple home maker."

The Bene Gesserit are terrified of looking into that place because duh they're weak women who need a man to save them."
dune,2u9tbx,TheFlyingBastard,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"No, not because they were weak. Because Frank subscribed to basically Jungian ideas that are heavily essentialistic; that there are deep, inherent differences between the sexes.

dune,2udzey,KingOfTheMultiverse,12,Sun Feb 1 07:08:15 2015 UTC,It should be left alone. The Baron isn't neccessarily just gay; he's a rapist and an ephebophile.  Making characters gay for the sake of appearances is a terrible idea anyway. Forcing a certain sexuality upon the characters is the exact opposite of treating homosexuality like a normal thing.
dune,2udzey,TheFlyingBastard,4,Sun Feb 1 09:49:44 2015 UTC,This so much. No need to change. This is not a homophobic story just because it lacks prominent homosexual characters. The focus is something beyond homosexuality.

dune,2udzey,HogWild53,9,Mon Feb 2 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"Sadly, Frank  Herbert was a bit of a homophobe. His second son, Bruce, was a gay-rights activist; and to say their relationship was strained by his homosexuality would be putting it mildly. There's even a scene in God Emperor of Dune where Idaho gets offended at the suggestion of a tendency towards homosexuality in all-male armies. Of course filmmakers could always change these aspects, but the original source material doesn't support a very LGBT positive attitude."

But yeah, Herbert did seem... biased towards a traditional view of sexuality and gender.  That said, making Paul gay would be weird and write off Chani. Duncan as gay does go against him always being send to guard/escort the ladies, but if we are focusing solely on Dune, you could do it. I don't personally think this is the way to make any friends among fans, nor to help any agenda, however much I happen to agree with its goals."
dune,2udzey,lundse,2,Sun Feb 1 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno about Duncan. Any changes to the original character would have consequences for all the gholas - once they recover the original's memories - throughout all the sequels. I'm not sure the Duncan in Chapterhouse could be gay without messing the whole Honoured Matres subplot. I'm not sure about the God-Emperor's Duncans either.  I guess it could work if we establish that not all gholas share the same orientation (or indeed personality) as the original - I can't remember the finer points of Tleilaxu ghola praxis but I seem to recall that being mentioned in GEoD.  A bisexual Duncan might be another option. I'm far too autistic to understand how bisexuality works, so maybe not.  With regard to the first book, Hasimir Fenring is a fairly minor character who could definitely use some character development. That might be a good choice also."

dune,2udzey,ScytaleTleilax,2,Mon Feb 9 15:29:53 2015 UTC,How about we don't shit on Frank Herbert's work? Suggesting that we shoehorn in a gay scene is disrespectful and insulting. Shame on you.
dune,2udzey,SlickThroatButter,3,Thu Feb 12 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"In God Emperor Duncan is both a homophobe and a heterosexual (and to Frank's credit his homophobia is seen as backwards by Moneo). Leto II is a homophobe, so worried about male homosexuality that it's part of the reason his armies are female only. In a modern adaption I think it could work well to show that despite his transcendent condition he still has human biases and prejudices (that become multiplied on a galactic scale).   If you want to include heroic homosexuality in the original Dune story without contradicting the later books or inventing new characters I'd make the Fremen practice homosexuality, sort of like the arab ""women for procreation, men for pleasure"". There are several social and ecological reasons I could see them do this: population control, maintaining moisture by swallowing semen (especially when the men make long treks outside the sietch) and in the spice orgies many people probably have homosexual experiences so shaming 'true' homosexuals would make little sense. The problem with this is it's probably hard to show it without people squirming about how they are exaggerated gay super-humans (which is ironic since they are equally exaggerated non-disclosed super-humans in the original story). Fremen being a reserved and private people (except for during the orgies) I think it would be hard to show it on film without it coming off as forced."

dune,2udzey,ZloMoHoMo,0,Sun Feb 1 20:10:21 2015 UTC,A villain character who happens to be gay isn't automatically bad. But using homosexuality as an indication of perversity and villainousness in a character is homophobic.
dune,2udzey,tgjer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"the fact that he's gay is dwarfed by the fact that he is a pedophile. When i read it, the thing that i felt was an indication of perversity and villanousness was the pedophilia."
dune,2udzey,ZloMoHoMo,2,Sun Feb 1 20:11:55 2015 UTC,"It's a portrayal that didn't make much distinction between homosexuality and pedophilia. They were seen and treated as variations of the same perversion of healthy sexuality. His sexual desire for children is not separated from his sexual desire for males, and his sexual perversion is used as a sign of his instability. He's practically the archetype of the depraved homosexual trope.  It's not a surprising perspective given the author's era, the treatment of homosexuality and male rape of boys as variations of the same thing was commonly accepted as obvious truth by most people at the time. But this depiction becomes very uncomfortable and distracting now. A modern adaptation that does not want to distract from the intended reaction to the story, would have to change some of the details of his portrayal to avoid it."

dune,2udzey,Dudekahedron,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:28:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely think there are ways to deal with the homophobia in Dune.  It's a bit like when adaptations of Sherlock Holmes are made, and Doyle's casual racism is avoided. Yes it's part of the source material, and I'm sure some purists will object to any change. But if the actual dialogue in The Adventure of the Three Gables was included in a modern adaptation, even one set in the Victorian era when such views were common, it would break the intended tone of the story. Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be the admirable, rational, heroic character - the dialogue that to Doyle seemed perfectly reasonable now makes Holmes seem like vile racist. To get the story's intended response from the audience, that dialogue has to be changed.  In Dune, the  treatment of homosexuality as an indication of perversity and villainous detracts from the story now. I don't know about making Duncan Idaho gay, it would depend on a very good writer to make the audience accept such a change, though it could work in the right hands. But at the very least, the Baron's depiction could emphasize him as a pedophile, without reference to the gender of his victims. And inclusion of same gender couples among neutral/positively portrayed background characters would remove the whole ""all good people are by definition heterosexual"" vibe."
dune,2udzey,tgjer,2,Sun Feb 1 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"I think this would be the way to go. Changing the sexuality of a prominent character just for the sake of it doesn't seem right for the author, but the stuff you mentioned would probably be the best ways to work around the backwards views of the day. Although I think some element of that could remain."

He sidesteps the question when it's brought up saying that at some point in the future he might release them, but I honestly don't think those notes will ever see the light of day as long as Brian & Kevin are writing novels in the Dune universe.  I think the way the story ended, with a literal messiah Duncan Idaho super-ultra-mega Kwisatz Haderach becoming the bridge between machine and human is pretty much the opposite of one of the core themes that Frank Herbert wrote about: tearing down the messiah mythos."

She was basically a highly skilled mathematician who was the brains behind Tio Holtzman's inventions including glowglobes, suspensors, and the end-all, be-all Holtzman Space Folding Drive.  Some evil stuff happens, she gets tortured, then she develops mental powers.  Long story short, she becomes the first Guild Navigator, and then becomes some sort of god-like being to the Guild.

""There were no machines at the end of Dune""    too true - but i am curious about what you and others think about sionas worm trip in ged where she heard the sound of advancing machines.  both of those things stand out in my mind.    it's nice to believe that duncan was to be more than just a tleilaxu tool... and maybe that's where frank was headed...  same with the return of the thinking machines."
dune,2u3lu9,dtsky,8,Thu Jan 29 20:26:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think a cliffhanger is a fantastic way to end anything.  Imagine the original Star Wars if it just ended after The Empire Strikes Back.  That being said, I'm satisfied with the way Chapterhouse ended, but there are a ton of loose ends.  It seems ridiculous to introduce mysterious characters like Daniel and Marty right at the end of a book, characters who clearly have quite a bit of power and knowledge, and plans of their own, if he had no intent on fleshing them out.  I mean, even the water merchant in the original Dune gets fleshed out as a character more than those two.  I really think Brian found notes and possibly even a rough outline for Dune 7.  I believe those notes exist, but none of the stuff he and Kevin wrote about is contained in there.  No Omnius, no Erasmus, no cymeks, no oracle of time, none of that complete drivel.  Thinking machines coming back into the fold?  Possibly, but not as mustache-twirling cartoon characters.  More realistically we're probably talking about advanced, independent Face Dancers.  There's a good story in there involving the crew of the no-ship and their struggles to avoid Daniel & Marty's net, but that story will never be told."

A state we have all lived with and come to terms with for a long enough period that is a familiar and satisfactory end.   Using your satisfied state to defend the idea that there is nothing in Chapterhouse that is worth building on and ultimately resolving is unfortunately probably just you pandering to your own need for ultimate resolution and the memory of Frank, sitting on such a lofty perch in our collectively memories that some refuse to believe that he could have died before finishing his greatest story, which of course is nonsense.   I for one would love the notes to be released to even have a sliver of how frank may have planned to resolve some of the plot elements left hanging.

dune,2tjff7,jax201,10,Sat Jan 24 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting take.  If that truly is the reason, then audiences are primed for it right now.  I think Game of Thrones has accomplished much in that vein- no character is purely good or evil, and a big budget multi-season serial is the perfect platform to accomplish adapting a book that suffers for every scene removed.    The reason Lynch's Dune was not ""successful"" (commercially) is because it's as weird as anything else Lynch has done.  Personally I'm a huge fan of his work but movies like Eraserhead are just not suitable for mass consumption.  I think his adaptation was good in the sense that it is faithful to the book without being bound by it.  Herbert's opinion was similar.  I think the mini-serieses failed because of lack of budget.  The cheesy Syfy channel special effects really fail to impress, and the amateur acting can't convey the nuanced emotion of the book's characters.  Not really a cutting opinion around here but I hate Brian for milking his dad's legacy.  What a hack.  I'll never forget my utter disappointment when reading House Atriedes.  I made it until Leto fought the electrified stingray on Caladan, when I threw the book down and exclaimed, ""what the f*ck!?"""

However, a few years later (still really a kid) I read the House Atreides (having no knowledge of Duniverse books beforehand) and liked it, and read the rest of the prequels in short term (I should note that I didn't read Dune proper because it was in the regular library downtown and the prequels I got from a children's library in my neighborhood). They didn't have Battle of Corrino, so in the summer of last year I got the whole series (prequels+the real thing) as ebooks and started to read from the top (skipping the houses trilogy). The Butlerian Jihad trilogy was an okay light science fiction time waster. And then I started reading Dune.  I was surprised at how much better it was and how different. Since then I've reached the last chapters of the Heretics of Dune (which I'm reading now) and it's become in my mind the best SF story I've ever read previously the title was jointly held by Helliconia and the Space Oddysey).  However, I wouldn't say Brian's books are unreadable (although I can see why someone who started with the actual Dune series would think that), but are more of a Dunewikia which can be read to give you some more info on the world, while not necesarilly being either good writing or accurate. I do fully intend to read the rest of the prequel/sequels once I'm done with Chapterhouse, but I highly doubt I'll ever reread them, while I'm sure I'll reread Dune.  We can discuss whether Brian should have done what Christopher Tolkien (who is also a much better writer) did and only wrapped up the last book his father was working on while keeping as much of his father's work intact and only making absolutely necessary additions while informing us what they are or was writing his own books the way to go. I agree with the opinion that his books aren't really canon Duniverse, but in my opinion the only real thing we can hold against him is his not trying to finish the last book as his father intended to do himself, but rather turning it into a series of his own novels with the goal of making more money."
dune,2tjff7,Uberbobo7,2,Sun Jan 25 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"I think every single book of his is just as grievous as Dune 7.  Any way you slice it he's taking a few notes from a much better writer and mushing them into dime-a-dozen ""Dune universe"" books.    I can see how some people could enjoy just the tidbits of the true universe that they get with each book, but I can't see past the bigger heresy against the Church of Frank."

dune,2tjff7,Leodhas,1 point,Sun Jan 25 13:06:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like Syfy channel tried to do things on the cheap a little bit before CG had gotten much cheaper. The sequel was done only a few years later and already there was significantly more CG use, and done far better. Of course better acting, directing, and even scripting helped too.  If the miniseries had been made 10 years later, it probably would have been far more convincing. Those stage-play sets were truly awful. These days, and in the sequel, entire scenes, even indoors, would just be blue-screened.  Maybe Dune is just one of those things everyone wants to take on a little too soon, because the pitch is so effective (most popular SF book!)."
dune,2tjff7,lenzflare,3,Tue Jan 27 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, my introduction to Dune was the Cryo game from the early 90s. I've revisited both the original book and the game many times and I believe it did a great job of translating Dune into a visual medium. I'm referring here to the original floppy disk version - the game is unfortunately better known for the CDROM adaptation released a few years later, which went over the top with pre-rendered videos and has none of the charm of the original.  Thinking about it, I would say that what made this so successful is that the game focused visually on landscapes and characters and used colour in a very coherent way. The Lynch movie and the mini series were lacking with regard to the former. You can't convey the atmosphere of Dune without long tracking shots of the sunrise over the Shield.  Less specifically, a successful adaptation to a visual format would have to take inspiration from something like Koyaanisqatsi. Take the time to show this world. This is a though sell, unfortunately.  Also related to the issue of pacing is the matter of introspection. There's a lot of that in Dune. An awful lot, and it's tough to make compelling TV/cinema out of that. You could probably get away with voiceover narration in a series but that just wouldn't fly for a feature-length movie.  This doesn't address your point that Dune is a story largely about moral choices made in a rarefied, maybe Zen-like realm of abstract consequences. It's tough to tell such a story in a visual medium. You need some melodrama to make the psychological story compelling. I'll do the obvious film snob thing now and name-drop Ingmar Bergman."

dune,2tjff7,soylentblueissmurfs,3,Tue Jan 27 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"Agree with many of your points. I just don't think a dune novel can succeed. A modern film adaption of dune will simply fail to capture the essence of dune. Many of the scenes in the novel involve long sections of discussion.  Take the dinner scene which happens to be one of my favorite. An accurate portrayal accurate to the novel will easily take 20 or 30 minutes of various characters discussing and posturing and implicating. No such scene can possible made with a modern audience in mind.   Sure such a scene for a film would be amazing for us book readers who have come specifically to see such scenes rendered accurately. However, this sort of thing would be a tough if not impossible sell for whatever film production company is considering the film.   They could gut the scene, render the 30 minute dinner into 10 minutes, fit for the modern audience. This would gut the film, turning the film from a philosophical journey into glorious michael bays eye candy.   Even something like ASOFAI (which I've also read) is a lightweight compared to Dune scene wise. ""Discussion scenes"" are short, concise and to the point, making such scenes executable within 5 or 10 minutes.   This type of dilemma was a big reason why David Lynch's adaption is the abomination that it is."

dune,2tjff7,-sgma-,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little more mundane than that. IMO, the reason a Dune adaptation never took off is less what decisions are being made and why but rather how those decisions are arrived at. People can respect pragmatic decision-making, but they need to understand the reasoning behind it. So much of Dune is characters superhumanly picking up on non-verbal cues and processing what they mean at lightning speed, and while that's easy enough to show in a book, it's difficult to do it in a movie without spectacular actors or resorting to voice over."
dune,2tjff7,sammythemc,1 point,Sun Jan 25 09:22:50 2015 UTC,"There's a valid point there, but you're thinking about certain moments of the Atreides who certainly know body language and such.  I'm referring to the whole philosophical, religious and ethical context that has nurtured the characters from birth, making them quite complex in many ways."
dune,2tjff7,sammythemc,2,Sun Jan 25 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that those contexts have never quite come across in adaptations, but I think a big part of that is just the difference in mediums. So much of those contexts you mentioned are exposited through the internal monologues (and just normal monologues) of characters dealing with the ""wheels within wheels"" plots, and that's a very easy thing to mishandle on film."

I would have the actors remain very steady in their actions to better frame subtle movements like the flaring of nostrils, tapping of the fingers etc.  I would have on screen subtitles emerge out of the atreides hand signals similar to the on screen text in the BBC Sherlock series.  The soundtrack would be done by Swans and the Kronos Quartet.  Ornithopters would have flapping wings, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen wouldn't float around, and the fremen eyes would be blue in blue with no whites whatsoever. I picture the Atreides family as greek actors, fremen as south african, and harkonnen as spanish.

dune,2tie1b,ZloMoHoMo,5,Sat Jan 24 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, he did indeed, but very obliquely.  Back when the Lynch film came out Waldenbooks put out an obsequious interview with both Lynch and Herbert, on cassette tape of all things. Some kind soul has created a transcript.  Talking about the start of the film process, a call from Dino de Laurentis, Herbert says, ""But the funny thing happened. Dino called me. I didn't know David from Adam's offer. And he called me and he said that he had hired David Lynch to do the.... to direct the film of Dune. This was after a couple of... well I think they would have been disasters. David knows why."""

Judging by how many complaints there are for modern adaptations and the changes made to them (think any franchise'd movie, except maybe Watchmen which was wildly accurate).

It's always nice to see a departure from the three-lobed mouth thing. I once sketched (in a back-of-the-notebook kinda way) an idea for a worm that was based on the look of a baleen whale. Anybody know of any other unusual and original worm designs?  edit: also is it me or is the Emperor actually Charles Dance, and Gurney M. Emmet Walsh?  edit: Dammit, Mohiam is Helen Mirren!

dune,2tbbhx,Mughi,2,Fri Jan 23 00:46:01 2015 UTC,"RIGHT! Skandar Keynes is Paul. Once I looked past the chins I saw Meaney. I can see Mortensen now that you say it. I can see Frewer in Yueh, as well. So far I'm down with this entire cast; I'd love to see Colm Meaney play a role like this. Okay, so who's everybody else?"
dune,2tbbhx,Mughi,2,Fri Jan 23 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"Rutger Hauer is Thufir, Ulrich Mathes is Piter. Feyd is a US teen actor (or used to be) can't place him properly to track his name."

I didn't know Matthes, until I looked him up and realized he was the actor who played Goebbels in Downfall, in which case I think that's spot-on casting. Feyd is messing with me, too.

dune,2tb5nq,erythrocytes64,2,Thu Jan 22 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on which aesthetic you're going for.  Story-wise, most people (but not all, I hear you) would categorize Dune as Space Opera.   The trouble is, that not a lot of space opera gets translated to film well.    The Fifth Element has a bit of the multi-world, high drama, galaxy sweeping storyline and a great stylish look to it -- but it's a bit of a lark.  The Black Hole has a lot going for it contemporary with Lynch's Dune too.  Blade Runner's good if you were impressed with the dark, stylish look of Lynch's Dune.  Star Wars, the Trek movies, etc.. yeah, they're all in the same genre technically, but... no gravitas and none of them a spectacle.  (Though I'd argue that Wrath of Khan and Empire Strikes Back might fit that billing.)"
dune,2tb5nq,clintp,2,Fri Jan 23 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"So, I really want more. I know about the TV series and the books. But the TV series look a bit meh to me – they don't seem to have the same gloomy atmosphere. It's a pity, because the visual aesthetics of the movie are unmatched.   I've been kind of beating a dead horse about this, but so far I've found all the Frank Herbert Dune audiobooks to be excellent listen/reads."
dune,2tb5nq,Ubergopher,2,Mon Jan 26 06:18:22 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the miniseries was pretty satisfying for different reasons. The acting is pretty bad, and the effects are laughable. I started thinking about it more like a play and it started to make a lot more sense to me. Once Paul hooks up with Seitch Tabr I felt like things got pretty exciting. Being less than sober helps ;)  As for Dune Messiah, I think that was my favorite so far. If, like me, Paul is your favorite character, I would highly suggest reading it."

dune,2tb5nq,ZloMoHoMo,3,Thu Jan 29 23:26:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with that Lynch created an aesthetic feel that was very unique, but if you read the book you realize how clumsy the dialogue actually is. All the inner monologues and the weird lines destroy the original work for me, and they tried to convey so much information in so little time that it becomes an infantile fetus that slightly resembles the thing it was trying to adapt. One of the most improtant things about the book is how it patiently builds relationships and story arcs, not just rush straight to the action. the first half of the movie was promising, but the part where Paul meets Stilgar and becomes part of the Fremen and lives with them needed to be much, much longer and take it's time."

You did a GREAT job once again, and I must congratulate you for breaking from the traditional influences (the movie, the miniseries, the encyclopedia) and following your gut.  The portraits are also terrific, and even though I have Daniel Day-Lewis as my Duke Leto I must say that Viggo Mortensen fits the more more than well. Also kudos for including Charles Dance as Shadam (he's too cunning for that but, I'll take it).  Finally, do I detect a hint of Colm Meaney as the baron? He's not my first choice but I can definitely see it under the makeup."

I'll try to not procrastinate as much on the next groups, they're mostly all sketched out, so it's just a matter of finishing everyone. But, I'll be sure to post them here when I'm done!  Lynch's film had some cool production value, and talented actors, but were ill-fit for the roles they were given, Paul and Feyd especially. Haven't watched the miniseries yet, but I plan to, even though I'm sure it's not that great.   Thanks! Viggo has that great soft-spoken quality, but can also be very intense. Daniel-Day Lewis is phenomenal, so I'd have no problem with him either.   Yup! Colm Meaney is another phenomenal actor. While they need to cast someone on the heavy side, first and foremost, they need a great actor to play the Baron. They can always make the actor fatter, preferably with prosthetics and not cgi, haha. I think Stellan Skaarsgard would be another great choice."

dune,2t5xd4,dddash,10,Wed Jan 21 12:24:40 2015 UTC,"I actually flew through Messiah, and found Children of Dune hard to get through. I really loved some of the stuff in Messiah. It had a very interesting switch in tone, and while I was sort of disappointment we didn't get any POV-action of the Jihad, I thought reading about the aftermath in Paul's new empire was very intriguing.  To illustrate how chilling some of that stuff was I'll quote p. 135-136   ""Stilgar,""Paul said, ""you urgently need a sense of balance which can come only from an understanding of long-term effects. What little information we have about the old times, the pittance of data which the Butlerians left us, Korba has brought it for you. Start with the Genghis Khan.""  Ghengis... Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?""  ""Oh, long before that. He killed... perhaps four million.""  He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Lasbeams, perhaps, or...""  ""He didn't kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions. There's another emperor I want you to note in passing - a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.'  ""Killed... by his legions?"" Stilgar asked.  ""Yes""  ""Not very impressive statistics, m'Lord.""  ""Very good Stil."" Paul glanced at the reels in Korba's hands. Korba stood with them as though he wished he could drop them and flee. ""Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I've killed sixty-one billion, sterlized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I've wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since-""  ""Unbelievers!"" Korba protested. ""Unbelievers all!""  ""No,"" Paul said. ""Believers.""  ""My liege makes a joke,"" Korba said, voice trembling. ""The Jihad has brought ten thousand worlds into the shining light of-""  ""Into the darkness,"" Paul said. ""We'll be a hundred generations recovering from Muad'dib's Jihad. I find it hard to imagine that anyone will ever surpass this."" A barking laugh erupted from his throat.   ""What amuses Maud'dib?"" Stilgar asked.  ""I am not amused. I merely had a sudden vision of the Emperor Hitler saying something similar. No doubt he did.""    Just for this passage alone, Messiah carried a lot of weight for me, and was a lot more meaningful than Children ever was. though I have not had the chance to reread the series yet - and I expect knowing the events in the latter three books, Children of Dune will be a more interesting read in the long run."
dune,2t5xd4,melodeath31,16,Wed Jan 21 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"I've always thought of Messiah more as an epilogue to Dune and a prequel to Children than as a standalone novel. While some important things do happen in Messiah; in my eyes it really only wraps up the end of Dune and sets the stage for all the events of Children. While still being entertaining, it's my least favorite book in the series."
dune,2t5xd4,IVHoltzmann,13,Wed Jan 21 13:37:36 2015 UTC,"IIRC, a lot of people gave Herbert crap about Dune Messiah, but he insisted it had to be written, because you can already see in Dune that the messiah myth is outgrowing Paul. We must see what happens ten years later. It is the yin to Dune's yang."
dune,2t5xd4,Trevoke,15,Wed Jan 21 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think Messiah was really important for me to read. After Dune, I started to think of Paul as the savior of the universe. After all he was an Atreides, he had rid the universe of the Harkonen and had severely disempowered the Corrinos, and had turned the Fremen into a fighting force.  However, the lesson for me was that we cannot rely on heros. The ""hero"" was a myth and an excuse. Paul was just a man. A remarkable man, but a man still. The title, ""Dune Messiah"", is an ironic one because of the way the book deconstructed the messiah."
dune,2t5xd4,traitorousleopard,4,Wed Jan 21 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"That's why I loved Messiah. It must have taken balls for Herbert to deconstruct his story's hero. Not many authors would do that, flip the role on the hero. From God to a victim of his hubris and inability to do what must be done. I'm sure a lot of people wanted Paul to continue being a hero, and were disappointed by Messiah."
dune,2t5xd4,Darth_Odan,2,Wed Jan 21 23:13:57 2015 UTC,"Totally Agree, it was extremely George RR Martin of him (but I guess that should be the other way around).  But that for me was what made the book so brilliant. I honestly struggled to decide if I like Messiah or Dune more. One is a classic Hero's tale, the other is so opposite and for all the right reasons it blew me away."
dune,2t5xd4,xxmindtrickxx,2,Thu Jan 29 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"While I agree with what your saying. Keep in mind, in many ways Paul remains the hero. Only he has merged with his son.  The only reason Leto II was able to resist and dominate the bloodlines and consciousness of millions (maybe thousands I cant remember) of people was because he had Paul's conscious within him who was the true Kwisatz Haderach."
dune,2t5xd4,xxmindtrickxx,2,Thu Jan 29 03:15:34 2015 UTC,A very good point that I did not consider. Thank you.
dune,2t5xd4,traitorousleopard,6,Thu Jan 29 07:00:41 2015 UTC,"I personally loved it as much as the other ones. Maybe it's just me, but I felt it was the darkest of them all. I felt Herbert conveyed the trappings of power and prescience really well, especially when Chani dies"
dune,2t5xd4,odLott,3,Wed Jan 21 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yup! two very dark, tragic events:  Paul loses his beloved--tragic, no matter how much foreshadowing.  Alia loses Paul, becomes possessed. I feel like Paul was the only glue that could have held Alia together.   It's one of the last times Herbert allows us much pity for either character."
dune,2t5xd4,OtherMemory,12,Wed Jan 21 20:59:28 2015 UTC,"Dune Messiah is exactly what the title indicates: it's the story of a messiah. It just talks about what happens when the messiah becomes bigger than the man.  It's a warning about false idols, a tale of woe for societies and worshippers, and a reminder that we are all just men and we can't control everything.  ""Paul has meetings"". Yes. Exactly. And while he has meetings, his fremen tribes are conquering planets in his name. He is stuck with meetings, with people who have their own agendas, and he is much weaker than his name is.  Read the book from the point of view of learning what happens to an idea, to see how the mighty fall."

The middle part of the book was really hard for me to get through, however the ending made it up for it. I am waiting for the next three books to arrive, since I only ordered them over the weekend. Can't wait!"
dune,2t5xd4,I_also_never_post,1 point,Wed Jan 21 13:35:39 2015 UTC,People talk about the ending as if something utterly amazing and world shattering happens.  What happens is told to you in the middle of the book almost. One could read a synopsis and totally skip that book without missing anything.
dune,2t5xd4,stovor,7,Wed Jan 21 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"One of the themes of the story is identity.  Who is Paul?  Is he the hero or is he the monster that unleashed a jihad that killed billions?  Hayt constantly struggles with his identity, with people telling him he's Duncan yet feeling unable to identify that way.  Is he really Duncan trapped in a body that can't remember who he is supposed to be, or is he simply a Tleilaxu tool to bring about Paul's destruction?  With the ending of the book we learn a couple of things that are sort of mind-blowing in the constructs of the Dune universe.  Firstly, that Paul's prescience was not perfect, despite him being a Kwisatz Haderach.  He only say one child in his visions, not twins.  Secondly we learn that a ghola is indeed capable of regaining his memory.  This is a huge revelation to everyone and it changes things immensely.  I won't spoil how, since you said you were only on Children, but that's really a huge plot point.  Otherwise, what /u/IVHoltzmann said is pretty much my exact view on Dune Messiah.  It's a necessary piece of the puzzle that establishes very important things in the Dune universe."
dune,2t5xd4,stovor,2,Wed Jan 21 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"While I agree, a lot of the scenes were written in a really off putting way. Where as Dune set up it's ""action"" scenes and the like pretty well. Here, we have disjointed and somewhat confusing sequences.   For instance, when Paul is walking around a neighborhood talking to people at their houses and then all of the sudden STONEBURNER. A very pivotal scene, but the set up is just horrible. It's almost like Herbert knew he couldn't top Dune, so he's just like ""meh...this is how the story would go if..."""
dune,2t5xd4,traitorousleopard,9,Wed Jan 21 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a different sort of story than Dune.  The original was a coming of age/messiah tale, which would of course be filled with action scenes.  Dune Messiah deals with the consequences of those actions, and is definitely a lot slower plot-wise.  There's many more dialogue scenes than straight up action scenes in the sequel, and I could see how that could be a bit jarring to someone who had just read Dune.  I'll say this - if you didn't like the pacing or way this book was written you'll probably dislike God Emperor of Dune for similar reasons.   For instance, when Paul is walking around a neighborhood talking to people at their houses and then all of the sudden STONEBURNER.    Paul wasn't just out for a leisurely stroll around Arrakeen, chatting up his subjects and shooting the shit.  He's been sent to meet with one of his fedaykin, Otheym.  Paul cannot refuse this invitation.  He goes out there to meet Otheym, completely knowing that this is a trap, but not knowing exactly what sort of trap is waiting for him since the conspirators had been shielded from prescient observers by Edric's guild navigator prescience.   I actually really like that the Stone Burner came out of nowhere.  We knew that the conspirators were planning something big, but what exactly they were planning was purposely left out of the narrative.  We're aware from what's written in Dune that use of atomics is absolutely abhorrent and would result in the combined might of all the Great Houses coming down on the responsible party.  That's why it's such a huge reveal, that the conspirators were willing to flip the bird to the entire Empire by defying the Great Convention.  The Stone Burner destroys Paul's eyes, which is a death sentence among the Fremen.  Yet he still sees due to his oracular vision.   At this point in the book, Paul's consumed with destroying himself in any way possible to prevent what's happened in his visions.  What could possibly terrify Paul Atreides, the Kwisatz Haderach, so much that he would rather destroy himself than allow his vision to become reality?    Just to provide a counterpoint to your final statement:    It's almost like Herbert knew he couldn't top Dune, so he's just like ""meh...this is how the story would go if...""   He most certainly did not arbitrarily decide to do this.  You'll just have to read Children of Dune to figure that out, but the entire third act of Dune Messiah is extremely pivotal, and in my opinion, very well written.  We'll just have to agree to disagree there."
dune,2t5xd4,I_also_never_post,9,Wed Jan 21 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I read Dune in my late teens and my initial reaction to Messiah was a teenage reaction. Instead of seeing the hero conquer again with no regard to the future, this book was about consequences, both foreseen and unforeseen. I didn't appreciate this aspect till I was older, but it cemented Herbert in my mind as an author that was above pandering to my desire for action and adventure.  He created a world in Dune, and I believe that given what he had made, Messiah could not have been written any other way. It was the natural progression of the story. And though it might not be as flashy as its predecessor, it was a good book with good lessons that should be learned."

dune,2t5xd4,minuscatenary,5,Wed Jan 21 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"this might just be me and my lack of attention span   No offense intended, but you may have hit the nail on the head.    God Emperor of Dune's plot is like a slowly moving glacier that yells at you and lectures you the whole time it heads to the sea.  It was a tough book for me to read the first time when I was in high school because I kept thinking, ""Well, when is anything going to happen?  Will this guy ever shut the hell up?  He's such a smug, condescending asshole!""  I went back and did a re-read at 21 and totally changed my opinion about God Emperor of Dune.  It's probably my favorite in the series now."
dune,2t5xd4,Mughi,3,Wed Jan 21 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Reading God-Emperor and expecting it to be an action-driven book with a strong action-driven narrative is not enjoyable. God-Emperor is essentially Frank Herbert speaking through the mouthpiece of Leto II; all while making a pretty intense set of arguments that would be read as ""maybe the author meant this or that"" should they have been reduced to a narrative.  I loved God-Emperor.  But Children was my favorite. The last 20 pages of that book contain what is probably one of the best pieces of English prose ever written.  edit: gramur"

The start and the end of the book have the most meat,  things are happening, but the middle is less story and more spiritual meditations on the jihad and prescience.   Which I enjoy, but only if it serves to reinforce the story like it does in the original Dune. In Messiah I could feel a disconnect between the story and the meditations."

dune,2staqd,velders01,8,Sun Jan 18 15:33:52 2015 UTC,The only part I didn't like about this book is how Duncan Idaho is portrayed. So pathetic in this book. I kept picturing him as some squirrely fat bureaucrat. Why would Leto II reduce the most badass warrior in the universe to that? It's been years since I read the book so I may have some memory gaps.
dune,2staqd,Deusarchaic,9,Sun Jan 18 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"Actually Duncan is revived to be a breeding stud for Leto's genetic program.  He has very ancient genes, that carefully combined with others were part in the creation of the golden path.  He never reduced him to a bureaucrat but tried to give him a chance to adapt to the new empire, unfortunately Idaho was man out of his time and that ended up being his ruin, every single time."
dune,2staqd,Deusarchaic,3,Sun Jan 18 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yes that's right, I had forgotten."
dune,2staqd,paledave,11,Sun Jan 18 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"You didn't.   You retained what made the greatest impression on you and in the long scheme of things it seems you were right by choosing that as the most important point to hold on to.  There's a reason or at least a meaning to the return of Idaho in every book.  He's the spirit of mankind, of true mankind, that defies being tamed, reduced, breed or anything else.  It's rebellious, destructive and very emotional but in the end holds the key to being the ultimate kwisatz haderach after some help from the tleilaxu.  He's mankind reaching his ultimate potential, and nothing, even no-ships, can be hidden from him."

dune,2staqd,Trevoke,2,Sun Jan 18 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"I think we're in agreement but we're adding our personal POV about Zen.   I also see Zen as a way to transcend rational, conscious, though into something superior, but our main difference is that I don't dare to define it at all what that superior thing is.  You use the term understanding, which at least for me, implies something rational. What the golden path offers is something uniquely organic an alive, that defines that understanding.  By binding his empire and mankind's fate into a Zen non-structure, Leto II has made it indestructible because men nor machines can understand it completely.  Herbert is deliberately ambiguous about that, which I believe comes from his own inability to define something that's not explainable with words (the closest we get is the mathematical explanation of prescience in COD and Paul's own explanation in MoD).  So in a way Leto II had that plan and like you very well say, is beyond logic but cannot be accurately described just like the essence of Zen is beyond any words or concepts.   In the end I think we're in agreement and our differences are mainly semantic ones."

dune,2sj68l,CXQ,6,Thu Jan 15 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"Excellent reply. This is probably my favorite book in the series other than the original. A couple comments on your answers:  Warning: potential HoD/CH:D spoilers  For #2 I agree, just a note that ""she-bang"" is a part of the phrase ""The whole shebang"".  For #4 I concluded the former. I think that Leto knew once he had bred a proper Atreides with a no-gene, they would (could?) bring about the end of his life and the scattering would begin. Basically, once the no-gene was bred into the bloodline properly, there would no longer be a need to shepherd the breeding program. Siona just played her necessary and integral part in furthering the Golden Path. I think she ABSOLUTELY sensed that it would continue with Leto dead and it validated that it was OK to assassinate him."
dune,2sj68l,bradfo83,3,Thu Jan 15 18:44:57 2015 UTC,The no-room is critical as it allows the creation of no-ships so that the human migrations are hidden.
dune,2sj68l,soylentblueissmurfs,2,Thu Jan 15 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response.  Regarding#4, if Leto did indeed sensitize Siona to the Golden Path, wouldn't she realize that Leto isn't the greater evil she assume him to be?"
dune,2sj68l,Adrialic,3,Thu Jan 15 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"Read on. This might be spoiler territory, but the golden path doesn't end with the death of leto II. I feel he allowed what Siona and Idaho did because it was a necessity for the continuation of his vision. He himself was no longer necessary, but perhaps his demise was."

dune,2sh2u1,wiseoldsage,5,Thu Jan 15 02:42:51 2015 UTC,I think rereading some of the chapter introductions will give you good hints  on that.  f.ex.  Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible  i could go on but seeing the daylight by yourself should be much more effective .... another Herbert lesson  ;-) you know all comprehension is temporary
dune,2sh2u1,Dr_Wellington_Yueh,2,Thu Jan 15 09:22:34 2015 UTC,"For the record, I have my own thoughts I was just curious about what the fans thought."
dune,2sh2u1,toxicasshole,2,Sat Jan 17 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"One of the big themes of the first book is that closed systems inevitably tend towards catastrophic failure.  The Imperium is an example of that. Outwardly, it is a political, social and cultural order in complete lockdown where nothing has happened in ten thousand years that would disrupt the essential balance of the system. Irulan's quote to the effect that balance is crucial in a beginning (I don't have the text at hand) is very significant in that regard. And yet, there are forces at work in the Imperium that eventually bring about its destruction in Paul's jihad.  This applies to Arrakis as well - Keynes and the Fremen's patient efforts eventually break the balance of this seemingly closed ecosystem. Granted, we only really see the consequences in later books.  This is even true of prescience in Messiah of Dune - Paul's ability to see the future as an immutable catastrophe nonetheless leads to Ghanima being born and, through her, existential freedom for mankind.  This relationship between reactionary order and destructive revolution is of course what Leto's Golden Path is all about - and Leto went to extremes of sadism to become mankind's ultimate punisher/liberator."
dune,2sh2u1,Nikkansama,4,Sat Jan 17 23:21:20 2015 UTC,"When I read Dune the most poignant theme to me is the inevitability and unpredictability of sociological change.  The singular goal of the Bene Gesserit order is to produce a human that will both preserve the achievements of humanity and improve the state of affairs in their world. Effectively, because the humans in Dune lack an external threat, they are constantly on the brink of catastrophe. This was very much the state of affairs during the Cold War of course. In fact, historically it appears to be the inevitable conclusion of every era of peace in human history.  From Book One of Dune,  ""Don't be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surrounds us. We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial House-hold balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures. It'd be bad enough without the complication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.""  However, the moment their theorized Kwisatz Haderach emerges, to resolve this situation, it is no longer aligned to their purposes. The range and scope of the Kwisatz Haderach's abilities makes the Bene Gesserit agenda obsolete.   To demonstrate that Frank Herbert wanted you to acknowledge different grades of ability one need only see the relationship between Thufir Hawat and Lady Jessica. Thufir Hawat as a Mentat is conceived of as a human computer. The way we visualize physical and social simulations on a graphical interface is inherent to Hawat's mental process.  Once again from Book One of Dune,  ' ""Now you know something of the real training they give us,"" she said. Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her command had been regal, peremptory--uttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible. His body had obeyed her before he could think about it. Nothing could have prevented his response--not logic, not passionate anger. . .nothing'  There is a lot of detail so I am going to skip ahead a little.  ' Hawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes. Only the most rigid control kept him from calling the guard. Control...and the suspicion now that woman might not permit it. His skin crawled with the memory of how she had controlled him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn a weapon and killed him!  (italics open) Does every human have this blind spot? (italics close) he wondered. (italics open) Can any of use be ordered into action before he can resist? (italics close) The idea staggered him. (italics open) Who could stop a person with such power? (italics close) '  Paul is the extreme extension of this gap in abilities both of reasoning and capability. Even the people who stand as comparable to Paul intellectually such as Guild navigators, Count Fenring, and even Leto Atreides predict events nearly as well as Paul but not as well. And as they are each parameters of the others predictions, no one ever gets it completely correct (Not to mention that some events are convergent in the Dune timeline as far the the narration of the book is concerned. In other words they can not be avoided regardless of any action taken.)  This leads to the central concept of the first volume of Dune. That Paul perceives the consequences of political involvement on Dune further than anyone else has predicted. It is summarized as follows.  Book Two of Dune,  ' I have seen this place in a dream, he thought. The thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him on this path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his name. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror. Wild legions would charge into battle creaming their war cry: ""Muad'Dib!"" It must not be, he thought. I cannot let it happen. But he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut. It was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this instant, the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and now--himself and his mother included--could stop the thing. '  I've already spoken at length of my interpretation of Dune. If anyone doesn't agree they are certainly entitled to do so. Hopefully the quotations from the text will be enough to convince at the very least that I am not just making all this up from my own opinion. Let me know if you want to discuss it further.  The following section is personal conjecture  Actually I would propose (but can not prove of course, I did not write the fictional story.) that nothing can stop the actual violence, only the motivation for it. The Fremen are already on the brink of causing the Dune galaxy to spiral into violence. All the political elite of their world will die without spice. And as hard as it may be to believe, the proliferation of smaller and smaller local conflicts always causes much more death than the conflicts of large states (if every man is killing his neighbor and his neighbors family, this is worse than pitched battle, which only involves as many humans as can be outfitted and deployed. This is very much why most of humanity is opposed to anarchy except those who don't truly understand the consequences of not having governments or who don't care.)  On another note, I would like to respond to a comment in one of the replies that Herbert is cynical of religion (there is a significant difference between religion, faith, and even the concept of God or deities if you prefer, in my opinion. You'll have to explore this idea or reject it on your own initiative). From my perspective, he clearly has depicted religion as serving a purpose that is not inherently negative. The Bene Gesserit especially serve a noble purpose, not to say that every member of their order is objectively good (or bad for that matter). Paul as a messianic figure pretty obviously based on the Prophet Muhammad cannot cause only good things to happen. Paul really has no power to stop the Fremen from instigating a galactic conflict, only to restrain and guide it as its spiritual and political head.  There are of course people who abuse the established system in Dune Messiah ( Korba; Alia after she goes insane). This like the post of Dr_Wellington_Yueh says, is basically an inevitable conclusion (over time) in most human institutions. Most of the struggle of human civilization is the attempt to limit and correct abuses of power and influence."
dune,2sh2u1,Leodhas,2,Sat Jan 17 08:18:14 2015 UTC,"These apply to all the books; by far the most interesting concept to me is the emancipation of technology and all the evolutionary traits that come from this. I find Herbert to be very cynical of religion and capitalism, but not at all preachy. I have a hard time deciphering any metaphors from the books, possibly because in not aware of the time that they were written in."
dune,2sh2u1,Leodhas,1 point,Thu Jan 15 06:58:07 2015 UTC,"Well the entire subjugation of Arrakis by both the harkonnen and atriedea and all the conflicts that arrise from the spice. chome, ixians, bene gesirit and pretty much all other factions have a monopoly on atleast one service that they use to influence each other, hell, the fremans entire philosophyrevolves around scarcity. guess it's pretty broad to label him as cynical of capitalism, it's just my interpretation."
dune,2sh2u1,Ortopox,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:57:12 2015 UTC,"At first that the books are always relevant, no matter how many years have passed since they've been written.  Something that is quite important also today (see ISIS or the djihadistic terrorism). If both religion and statesmanship come together you're bound to have a catastrophee. If one dares to work against the state it's automaticly morally wrong (a sin), while working for the state - in any extreme way thinkable - is morally right because it's covered by the religion. That's basically what Paul knew would happen if he continued his way with the Fremen (and he wanted to prevent all the time(!)) but couldn't do (reasons being explained in the second and thrid book).   To get the connection back to the present time - it's also dangerous what happend to Turkey ('european' example) during the regency of Erdogan, where the state got more and more involved with the religion (which is in itself funny as Attatürk(sp?) the founder of the modern Turkey was pretty against this involvement and created a 'modern' state if you compare it to Europe in this regard). Another good example would be Iran where all got more religious when the Ayatollah got stronger the past 20-30 years. Not to forget the radical christians in the U.S. which are just as bad."
dune,2sh2u1,ZloMoHoMo,1 point,Thu Jan 15 12:47:54 2015 UTC,"to me, the book is about patience and change. it's about having patience and working hard to change something over a long period of time, you can find that idea on many levels of the book. For instance, Herbert patiently builds up tension by putting Paul through extensive preparation for Dune, and talking about sandworms, and that tension becomes an orgasm when you finally see the sandworm devour the sawndcrawler. On another level of the book, the ecologist Kynes is trying to change the ecology of Dune, and that task has been passed on through generations of patience and hard work. everyhing in the book changes. The characters change greatly throughout, and as the franchise goes on, so does the ecology of Dune, and the political enviroment. It shows that everything changes, if you just give it time."

dune,2s6sfe,TheGreenRecluse,2,Tue Jan 13 06:34:17 2015 UTC,I kind of understand why scifi fans are so desperate to buy into this hype.  The idea that scifi as a genre could have been so much better if this unobtainable holy grail could have been found/made is a hopeful and intriguing one.  But I really can't agree.  I tried to sit through Holy Mountain once and it struck me as an overthought trainwreck of an arthouse movie.  That's what he wanted to do with Dune and it wouldn't have been any more watchable for it IMO.  Maybe scifi does need a new messianic figure but it isn't Jodorowsky and it isn't this movie.  From this thread it seems he did some decent comics (which I will check out) and maybe people are judging him for that.  I encourage people to actually try to watch some of his movies and really critically consider him doing Dune.
dune,2s6sfe,polyonymy,3,Tue Jan 13 03:48:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like most folks here have never tried to watch The Holy Mountain.  They complain about Lynch's version of Dune, but Lynch is like Ken Burns compared to Jodorowsky."
dune,2s6sfe,polyonymy,2,Tue Jan 13 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"Jodorowsky is a fool who would've made an even more surreal and incomprehensible film than Lynch ever did IMO. He had some great ideas and found some other greater people than himself that went on to do amazing things.  I mean think about it, Jodoworsky threw the film away basically because he wanted to hire Salvador Dali as the emperor and wouldn't have anyone else. That's moronic. The emperor's role is at best 5 minutes of screen time.  The documentary was well done but Jodor's Dune is all over-romanticized bs."

I actually like Lynch's version but agree it is unforgiving and not very comprehensible to non-sci-fi people. If only he could've made it 20 years later he could've filmed the fight scenes correctly of the Fedaykin and the weirding scenes and kept them true to the book. Plus with all the sequels that come out these days he wouldn't have felt forced into an alternate ending and could've done a quadrilogy. Although his ending could still hold in both regards.

In the case of Fenring, paul had only a limited prescience, he could not see his possible deaths, and Fenring was one of these. He was also a potential Kwisatz Haderach.

dune,2s55oh,Spardocus,7,Wed May 20 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"Jodorowsky is an artist who took the framework of Herbert's Dune and planned to use that as a vessel to make the most ambitious film ever attempted.   How did you feel about Watchmen?  Arguably the most ambitious comic ever made.  The film version by Zach Snyder SUFFERED by trying to be too true to the comic.  The best moments of the Watchmen film were those in which Snyder used Alan Moore's comic as a framework to wrap a story around. The opening montage of Watchmen (film), the prison break sequence, and the ultimate ending were all modified from the original source material, and in my opinion those are the finest moments of the film.   Literature and Film are too dissimilar forms of media in which attempting direct and exact adaptations usually fail. I'm curious to see how you feel about Peter Jacksons's Lord of The Rings.  Kubrick's version of The Shining?  To Kill a Mocking Bird? What I am trying to get at here is in order to make a good film, some things must be changed.   How do you feel about Lynch's Dune?  Sci-Fi's adaptation of Dune? I've seen them both, and neither impress me.  Lynch's Dune is a disaster, and Sci-Fi's fails due to poor production values and sub-par acting.    Jodorowsky had planned on changing or modifying the source material, though I see nothing wrong with that for the sake of film making.  Here is a man that would have taken a sci-fi epic that we all know and love and wanted to change the way films were made, and change the way we the viewers experienced films.  I admire Jodorowsky's ambition and passion.  Look at the team he assembled!  HR GIGER! O'Bannon! Magma! Pink Floyd! Salvador Dali!    I would pay a large sum of money for a copy of that massive screenplay that Jodo passed around to all the studios.    Do yourself a favor and watch Jodorowsky's other films:  El Topo, The Holy Mountain, The Dance of Reality.  His films are weird and stimulating, visually striking and wholly unique.  Read The Incal. If Jodo had never brought O'Bannon & Giger together Alien would not have been Alien.  I don't want to imagine a world without Alien.    In summation, Jodo's Dune would not have been a true adaptation of Herbert's Dune, but it would have been a staggering film.  Ari Folman who directed Waltz with Bashir wants to make Jodorowsky's Dune a reality as an animated film.  I hope this comes to fruition.  Jodo's version is far too interesting to be unseen.    I'm not trying to put your opinion down, rather I am trying to open up some discussion on here.  I'm clearly a huge fan of Herbert's Dune, Jodorowsky's films, and the documentary."
dune,2s55oh,TheGMT,2,Mon Jan 12 16:25:05 2015 UTC,"That's fine, this is the kind of discussion i wanted, however it's not the changing of source material or any kind of adaptations that bother me, unless its ""i am legend"", my point of contention is purely visual, i found the character designs and relentless shoehorning of celebrities and pop musicians to be really... sort-of childish, i found there to be a complete lack of tonal consistency between the characters and artistic style, especially with gigers unique style shoved in there"
dune,2s55oh,NickPrefect,2,Mon Jan 12 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"Giger's inclusion is just so odd to me. Him and Moebius seem to be polar opposites stylistically. Like many art house, philosophically grandiose films, I feel Jodo's Dune would lack visual cohesion. He had a vision I don't think was quite refined to the point a film should have been made out of it. Really interested to see how this supposed animated version turns out, I fail to see it having any clean direction. Maybe he'll have mellowed in his old age and considered this."

I would certainly also prefer a filmmaker who brings his own direction and perspective to an adaptiation, but I would draw the line where the filmmaker ignores the source material to bring in his own, especially if unrelated or opposite, ideas and points.  J. wanted Dune to end with Paul being the entirety of mankind, and Dune cumming on the universe or was it the other way around? It had no connection to Dune or its themes, and I can't respect that. If he had wanted to focus on wielding power, doing a two-part movie first with Leto and then Paul as protagonist - go for it! A psychadelic freakshow into time, drugs, visions and religion - go! Ecology front and center - go!   In my version of Dune, the Emperor of the galaxy is insane. He lives on an artificial gold planet, in a gold palace built according to not-laws of antilogical. He lives in symbiosis with a robot identical to him. The resemblance is so perfect that the citizens never know if they are opposite the man or the machine...   F... that noise :-)"

However,  it is not a case of ""some"" not liking the BH/KJA works. It is that they are insulting to Frank's work.  They retconned the original Dune into in-universe propaganda.   They turned the Bene Gesserit from ""vengeance is for small children"" into ""Imma give you a disease to make you fat because you raped me when I tried to force you to have sex with me.""

I am going to agree with this.  Especially if they're making a television series, and want to prolong it for more cash.  I can see producers add elements from the Dune Encyclopedia, the Brian books, and even the Westwood video games.  Having books retconned into in-universe propaganda seems to be in the spirit of Herbert's books.  Showing how authorities manipulate people and history for their own propaganda is a constant theme in his books, and having his Dune novels be shown as propaganda is a great way to deconstruct the universe."
dune,2s2b34,savepublicdomain,10,Sun Jan 11 19:42:08 2015 UTC,"To me, this is like hearing ""why were there never novels written about Neon Genesis Evangelion?""   NGE, like Frank's Dune novels, found a lot of it's fanbase because of it's unique approach to presenting itself; while Frank Herbert deconstructed the Science Fiction genre in the process of writing his books, Hideaki Anno deconstructed the Giant Fighting Robot genre of Anime while producing NGE. In my opinion, both are very well presented stories, but the fact of the matter is that they would not be as revered as they are now had it not been for their originality--Frank Herbert is a well respected writer, it is his writing in an age where simply more people read books that made the Dune novels so phenomenally well respected and famous. On the flipside, Anno is a well respected director, and it was primarily the visuals and music in NGE (the music, specifically, drawing credit from Shiro Sagisu) in an age where more people watched movies and TV shows that pulled me and many others into taking Anime seriously. If Dune was not a book series, and if NGE was not a TV show, we would not be having this conversation.  You see what I said there? The bit where I mentioned ""taking Anime seriously""? Before I watched NGE, I was a fan of the Dune novels; now, don't get me wrong, I found NGE to be really enjoyable, I even listen to the soundtrack sometimes, but I was only able to start watching because I had an open mind and because I believed a friend that told me it was not going to be silly. That's what I'm getting at. Dune is a serious story that Frank wrote to immortalize many of his philosophies in an ageless series of books; it is well respected because of his style of writing, his dialogue, and his ideas that, were they not written down, could be easily overlooked in other mediums of storytelling like music, movies, plays, or (you guessed it) TV shows.   What I'm saying is, Dune is a story that was meant from the very beginning to be told in books; even if (and I mean eeeeeven if) you could make a movie or TV show based on Dune that is good enough to receive a level of critical acclaim even close to the books, it would likely be considered to be, at the most, only ""like Dune""; were it in the form of Anime, it simply may not taken as seriously. It's not me, man--trust me, I've tried to convince at least a dozen of my friends that NGE is worth watching, but they are all convinced that it's some weeaboo bullshit and won't touch it. The Dune series began in 1965 and is still around today because of how well the books were written. If an Anime adaption were made right now, it would be:   Likely a ploy for Brian to make more money off of his father's ideas. Likely not worth the effort, as it would appeal to only some book-only Dune fans, only some fans of both Dune and Anime, and only some new to both.

dune,2rwnks,oddball223,6,Sat Jan 10 01:53:57 2015 UTC,Now read about the ideas that Frank Herbert had for the Butlerian Jihad. Perhaps then you'll understand why people hate on the clichés they shat out.
dune,2rwnks,TheFlyingBastard,6,Sat Jan 10 11:33:46 2015 UTC,Where can I read these ideas?
dune,2rwnks,TheFlyingBastard,7,Sat Jan 10 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"In the Dune Encyclopedia. Herbert was planning on writing about the Butlerian Jihad as a prequel, using the outline that the entry in the DE provided.  Here's an excerpt, but the full article on Jehanne Butler is probably three or four times as large as that. Pretty in-depth stuff, and you can tell that FH himself had a hand in the very rich background that the article provides."
dune,2rwnks,clintp,5,Sat Jan 10 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"It's because Brian Herbert isn't in the same ballpark as his father.  Frank Herbert is one of the greatest and most influential science-fiction writers of all time.  Dune is usually considered the greatest sci-fi book of all time.   Frank Herbert was a minimalist when it came to description, and constantly edited his books until they became great.  Brian Herbert keeps putting out books with the DUNE name attached. They're not nuanced, or explore any of Frank Herbert's ideas in a new way, or even come out with original ideas of their own.  They just explore areas of the Universe only hardcore fans care about, and not with enough care to satisfy the hardcore Dune fans.  Sad truth is, if Brian wasn't writing Dune books, no one would read his works."
dune,2rwnks,fedaykin13,5,Sat Jan 10 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"It's not just the quality of writing, but Brian hasn't read his father's books either and systematically waters down [pun, sorry] the Dune story.  A good chunk of the first chapter of Dune is Pauls' fascination of traveling offworld in a Guild Heighliner for the first time.  Paul and Leto even have a discussion about it at some length.  It's an important mood setter for the first bit of the book, and provides exposition for the Guild and space travel.  ** mild spoiler for a weak book follows **  In Paul of Dune which partly takes place before the journey to Arrakis, Paul and Leto are offworld together on Grumman fighting somebody or another over something which was entirely unimportant anyway.  Not only is is wrong, but it pisses all over Dune's first chapter."
dune,2rwnks,raskolnik,3,Sat Jan 10 22:54:29 2015 UTC,All of those things are true.   I still enjoy them on a pure 'popcorn' level.  I never expected his books to be his father's books.  I definitely had some genuine great moments with the character Erasmus--probably the best character he wrote.

I have only read the Legends and House serieses, but I enjoyed them both. I think Legends has a bit more leeway since it's so long before Dune proper.

dune,2rwnks,dtsky,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"The Battle of Corrin is a tremendous book, easily my favourite of theirs. I found the whole Legends trilogy incredibly absorbing, they matured so much after their first ""House"" trilogy. I love the original chronicles with all my heart, and I read the new ones more out of duty than anything, but for all their flaws and glaring inconsistencies, I'm not ashamed to say that I enjoyed them a lot.   (Obligatory part: However, it's pretty clear at times, particularly in the Hunters/Sandworms books, that they just didn't get the thread of what was happening in Frank's vision. Marty and Daniel were butchered in those books, and the crowbarring-in of Omnious grated on me. Part of me wishes they had written Dune 7 first and then more gracefully thrown in the thinking machines concept from the outright (was that always Frank's intention? We will never know) and explored their origins in the prequels later, but alas, we're stuck with the canon we have. There were some fun ideas, but ultimately it makes me really sad that they missed the point so tremendously.)"
dune,2rvvth,stovor,5,Fri Jan 9 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"The only in-universe theory I've been able to come up with would be that it was done in a similar manner as the Duncan Idaho ghola's serial memories in Heretics of Dune, where they implanted the old genetic memories from the Face Dancer into the Master DNA when cloning him from the Axlotl tank.   This was always my take on it. Something to the effect that his actions in Messiah warranted elevation via ghola rebirth into a master."
dune,2rvvth,Vongman,2,Sat Jan 10 00:13:20 2015 UTC,Masters achieve immortality through awakening three memories of the flesh. This technique was only learned/proven by the tleilaxu after Duncan came back - Scytale being their only witness. Of course they would bring him back to hear everything about it. And the master caste arose around the same time (or after).  It is not inconceivable that Scytale became one of the first (possibly only) generation of masters for his successes (within limits) in Messiah...

He is killed by Paul (using Leto II's vision) at the end of the book. When we see him again in Chapterhouse he is apparently a Tleilaxu Master, and is described as such with the pale grey skin, pointy teeth, and short stature.   He has changed from being a Face Dancer into a Master - two things that are genetically dissimilar enough to be considered different species.  Yet he somehow maintains his Face Dancer memories after becoming a Master.  I am actually pretty certain in the text of Chapterhouse that it is explicitly stated that he is a Tleilaxu Master.  My question is how was this possible?"

I was just not clear on the resolution of it all. So much back and forth in the language, and I don't even think I get what the golden path is. I also hate how his books end like a TV show do, where it all kinda wraps up nicely in one scene, the first one specifically. I think I enjoyed the second book the most, because I could understand the fall of the hero. But I wanted Leto II to be a hero, and I don't really know wtf he even became.

dune,2rpazo,callehm,8,Thu Jan 8 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"A big part of Dune is how stagnant the empire has become both socially and technologically. For most of humanity life is probably close to what it was in the 15th century (or late 19th on the heavily industrialised planets such as Giedi Prime). Because of the body shields, ornithopters and force fields in use a small warrior aristocracy can rule on most planets as massed unskilled troops can't overthrow them. The nobles monopolize technology (really Ix does but only the nobles have the buying power) and only comission stuff that they need such as body shields, poison snoopers and such."

And the future; with all of the sci-fi glory that interstellar space travel, technological innovation, and the inspiration to let the mind weave, wander, and create what is ""The Known Universe"" in Dune.

The only setting in which the sort of dynamic multi-polar classic RTS style game would make sense is post scattering.

Then no art except for a single shitty image ripped from DA probably, no mention of legal stuff, no mention of what kind of game except ""rts mmo"", oh and no mention of how he's going to create this game. this is just embarrassing."

dune,2rinbo,statixc,2,Tue Jan 6 15:25:39 2015 UTC,"It's not that MMO is not the way to go, it's that wow-clone is not the way to go.  The only MMORPG that has deviated significantly from the formula put down by everquest is Wildstar, and that's failing for other foolish reasons. The problem with all the recent ones (old republic, elder scrolls) is that they're nothing but cash-ins on a franchise's popularity rather than trying anything actually new and interesting.  Planetside 2 is an MMOFPS and it's actually quite good (though far from perfect), so an MMORTS might work if someone put some genuine effort into figuring out how to make it work (which won't ever happen from a major studio)."

The places where they don't it can be excused because it's the eighties. Personal shields look about what you would expect from that era.  The film replaced the Weirding Way with a whole subplot about weapons working on sound called Weirding Modules.  The Harkonnen were changed beyond recognition. In the book they were intelligent and noble, but they really didn't give a shit about life. They killed when they had to. In the Lynch movie they were reduced to cartoon characters. They were chaotic evil, raving lunatics, killing just for pleasure.  Example: Thufir Hawat gets kidnapped and poisoned, as in the book, but instead of secretly giving him the antidote in his food, the Harkonnens make him milk a cat for it.  The story is largely pretty slow, before Paul and Jessica join the Fremen. After that, the story races to the end. It feels like they didn't have enough time to explore the Fremen culture, and as a result they come across as just desert fanatics who can ride cool worms.  The ending is legendary, but not in a good way.  Also, Patrick Stewart holding a pug dog as he leads a counter-attack against Sardaukar in Harkonnen livery.  By the way, check out this article."

He took on the mantle of the Golden Path, sacrificing his life (figuratively and literally) for the betterment of humanity. The amount of depth that Herbert gave the character is amazing. You truly believe you're reading about a character who has done it all and seen it all, albeit through other memory. The joy he feels when he experiences truly new and unique human actions are amazingly well written. The grief he feels about his lost humanity is gut wrenching. His introspection and observation of humanity as a whole are beautifully spoken. The intricacy of his golden path is mind boggling. He's not just my favorite Dune character, but probably one of my favorites in any piece of fiction.     And he saw the vision of armor. The armor was not his own skin: it was stronger than plasteel. Nothing penetrated his armor -- not knife or poison or sand, not the dust of the desert or its desiccating heat. In his right hand he carried the power to make the Coriolis storm, to shake the earth and erode it into nothing. His eyes were fixed upon the Golden Path and in his left hand he carried the scepter of absolute mastery. And beyond the Golden Path, his eyes looked into eternity which he knew to be the food of his soul and of his everlasting flesh.   Heighia, My Brother's Dream from the Book of Ghanima"

But then, I realized that Jessica is really the best of all of them. She never comes unglued. I realize that's a reflection of her Bene Gesserit training, but it takes character to hold onto that in extreme circumstances. And she is loyal, kind, a good mother (as good as circumstances allow, anyway), and she is fucking lethal. And I love her."

Only Paul's struggle matters?"

I am not saying she gets mother of the year for her treatment of her daughter. I am saying that she took necessary risks and did what she could to lessen the damage she knew she would be doing to her unborn child. Alia didn't make it easy on anyone. If someone won't accept your help, are you just supposed to stick around and keep trying and keep getting shit on? She left because there was nothing she could do to help her daughter at that point. And, no, not only Paul's struggle matters. She left him behind, too.   She still never got panicky and came unglued.

None of them are panicky or come unglued. Most of them can kill you in 57 seconds flat.  Sorry, but Jessica was quite flawed. And choosing to have a son, rather than the daughter that BG requested, is most definitely doing something ""without thought.""   Her choice was selfish and self serving. There could have been hundreds, even thousands, of very good reasons why the BG wanted her to have a daughter, but only ONE reason for her to have a son, and it was the only reason she cared about. Jessica may not have been aware of the intricacies of BG'S  breeding program, but she knew it existed, and knew it's importance.  She chose blind loyalty to ONE PERSON over the sisterhood. She continued that blind loyalty after his death, forsaking her children. Leto was the only person she had the capacity to give a fuck about. That makes her weak."
dune,2qusd7,OtherMemory,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:10:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, I said that's probably due to her training.   I know she's flawed. All of the characters in the series are flawed. That's okay because it makes them more real. We are all flawed beings. She had a son rather than the requested daughter because she thought about it, not without thought. She did it either because the Duke wanted a son or because she purposely wanted to put a wrench in the gears of the quest for the Kwisatz Haderach. Either way, it wasn't a decision or an action formed from panic or done without thought.   You can certainly view her motivations as selfish. She wasn't following the Bene Gesserit plan at all, which is what caused Leto II to exist, which is what caused the Golden Path, which is what caused the last three (?) books to exist. Regardless, the characters and plots were manipulated by the author and things happened the way they did because they did.   I don't see her choice of the love of her life over the sisterhood as a problem. The Bene Gesserit spent millennia manipulating countless people and bloodlines for their own very selfish reasons. The good of the masses wasn't really their motivation for anything. I don't see how she chose Leto over her children after he was dead, sorry. He was dead and required nothing of her. She left Arrakis because of her personal failure with her daughter and because how painful staying would have been. Similar to a real person moving to another city after their spouse dies, leaving their children behind. Why stick around with so many painful memories when you can go somewhere better? Oh, because your screwed up daughter who refuses to do anything to help herself or allow you to help her somehow needs you? Nah, get out while you can. She came back, too. You can see her as weak, but I don't. Parents really shouldn't hang out where they are not wanted out of some vague sense of ""I could help!"" toward their grown children. Besides, Paul could have helped Alia a lot more than Jessica ever could have and he did nothing."

She originally left because the memories of Leto were too painful. My books are in storage, so I can’t pull a quote for you (perhaps others have theirs on hand?) but that's why she bailed.  As for Alia refusing her mother's help....you have a quote? because my recollection was Alia being terrified of running things without Paul. Jessica could have helped after Pauls death .  the stress of running things herself is what caused Alia to overindulge in spice, leading to her possession.  You are free to like Jessica--even love her, as you said (although, if you aren't her duke, be prepared that she may not even piss on you if you were on fire). Being ""human""may make one a realistic or relatable character, but it doesn't make them a great one.   Sacrifice your very humanity to ensure humanity's very existence? Knowing that most of that said humanity will label you a villain for the means you went about to achieve it? That's sacrifice. That's greatness. Leto II ftw!!"

Both stories also discuss human nature and the self-destructive lust for power that many humans are unable to discard.

Hypothetically - let's say the two stories take place in the same universe, and Dune takes place thousands, or tens of thousands of years after the events in these stories.  Would humanity be stupid/proud enough to make another Artificial Intelligence after literally deus ex machina (God from the machine) happening in this story?

The Axlotl tanks __or Axolotl tanks __ were living organisms within the Original Dune series and Axlotl technology is also mentioned, but not elaborated upon, in Frank Herbert's novels Destination: Void and the The Jesus Incident. Axlotl tanks are the means by which the Bene Tleilax reproduce a living human being from the cells of a cadaver, a type of cloning called a ghola as well as the creation of genetically engineered assassins known as Face Dancers. Later in the series, the axlotl tanks are engineered to replicate the spice Melange, previously only available on the desert planet Arrakis where it is created naturally as part of the life cycle of giant Sandworms. The Bene Gesserit suspected that the axlotl tanks were what remained of female Tleilaxu, since no Tleilaxu females had ever been seen. Moreover, the Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, during the time of the Honored Matres, had declared to Tleilaxu Master Tylwyth Waff that neither she nor any of her sisters would become an axlotl tank. This remark elicited shock from the Master, a reaction that indicated that the Bene Gesserit suspicion was true, especially since he did not deny it.

dune,2qu239,Dr_Wellington_Yueh,1 point,Fri Jan 2 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.  ~ Jesus   The earth had long ago turned into a barren frozen wasteland the Brood Mother reflected. Before that, the humans which were the hive member's ancestors fled the earth - like a bird leaving it's dirtied nest. The nuclear holocaust, of the old earth year 2112, caused the humans to flee but the hive merely went deeper underground eventually tapping the molten core of the earth to power the hive's great turbines.   Occasionally, humans returned to earth but they were quickly taken into the hive's vats. This way their memories were assimilated by the Brood Mother who learned everything that the Outsiders were accomplishing. Very little interested the Brood Mother, even the ability to fold space, but when a face dancer's memories informed her of the existence of a Tyrant who had symbiotically merged with a worm this caught her attention. However, for the most part life went on for the hive with little interference from the Outsiders.   Everything changed for the hive when a great ship appeared over the horizon of the earth. No matter how hard the brood mother tried to override the controls of the ship it remained serenely over the skies of the earth. Finally, the Brood Mother received direct communication from Ship.   ""I have established a neural tachyon connection with your organic nervous system- do not resist."" Ship said.   Ship instructed the Brood Mother that the hive's drones were to scour the earth to find genetic material of organisms long extinct be it plant, animal or microorganisms. From there the genetic code of almost all species which lived on earth were stored in hyb-tanks in the great ship's hold.  Next, this genetic code was transferred  to the Hive's vats which reconstituted the DNA into living organisms.  Although subordinate to Ship, the Brood Mother retained her function of inspecting every living thing which emerged from the Hive's vats with her sensors.  Upon closer inspection, the Brood Mother realized that the reconstituted face dancers were a product of a renegade Hive which had fled the earth under the cover of earth's final war which had plunged the earth into a nuclear winter.  Soon the earth began to be terraformed with resurrected life forms and with the ice glaciers melting oceans began to cover the surface of the earth. To prevent the earth from being completely covered by water Ship introduced sandtrout which began to seal off water allowing dry land to ascend from the deep . On the next day clones of humans long dead began to replenish and fill the earth. So different from the other animals were these humans, Ship mused. After naming all of the species filling the earth Ship decided to further study these humans much more closely. From the hyb-tanks, Ship created a clone from blood samples taken from an ancient roman nail and incarnated himself in this being. Seeing Ship's success, the Brood Mother requested Ship to incarnate herself in human flesh.   Having built for themselves a lush garden in a tropical zone surrounded by four rivers these two individuals realized that they still had to name each other before the could rest from all of their work..   ""Well, what should we call each other?"" The Brood Mother asked.   ""I will call you Marty. . yes, from now on let us be known to the Outsiders as Daniel and Marty.""  Daniel said.  ""The hive is almost ready to swarm after this seventh day after your arrival Daniel, what are your instructions?"" Marty said.  ""Our work on this planet is done but there are many other planets we will have to tend and build gardens for ourselves in."" Daniel said wiping perspiration from his forehead.   ""From the hive's vats, I have produced many face dancers and drones which will help us tame the Outsiders."" Marty said intently looking at Daniel.   ""Yes of course."" Daniel said while he continued tending to the garden, trimming the black roses with a snick-snick from his pruning shears.    ""I can see their tracks but not the flesh,"" Ship said out loud. Whenever they were off planet Ship felt no need to wear his hyb-flesh although the brood mother now preferred to clothe herself in the hyb-flesh known as Marty.   ""When we collected that specimen whose tracks you were following the hive determined this ability to hide from you is in their genes."" Marty said. From the countless memories the hive have absorbed from the outsiders both Ship and the Hive had learned many things concerning these primate-based life forms.   ""This genetic marker became part of humanity after they had spent thousands of years contained as if in a hive."" Marty said. ""When at last humanity swarmed after the death of their Queen Bee, or King, in their case, their population increased exponentially."" Marty said. ""But mankind's capacity to breed is trivial compared to the number of drones which our hives can produce on every planet we find."" Marty said. ""And. . ""   ""Yes,"" Ship cut her off, ""And what of this gene which hides so many of them from my sensors?""   ""Apparently something to hide humanity from predators such as us."" Marty said. ""But this gene will not protect them from my plagues.""   By this time the Honored Matres had been falling like flies from the plagues. The drones harvested the comatose bodies for the hive where they became stumps to continue to breed and increase the hive's numbers. The Bene Gesserit, however, were initially immune to these plagues much to the astonishment of Marty. From captured Reverend Mothers the drones soon learned that when cut off from spice the Reverend Mothers quickly fell to the plagues. Marty then declared that drones, and the face dancers they supervised, assume the guise of Honored Matres---and then destroy all known Tleilaxu worlds. With the Tleilaxu source of spice eliminated  Marty requested for Ship to arrive at Chapterhouse. By Ship merely shutting off it's gravitational cloaking device Chapterhouse was thrown out of orbit and flew into  the sun. Even though the Bene Gesserit were being hunted into extinction humanity had spread throughout innumerable galaxies to the extent that it would be impossible to collect every specimen. Marty, however offered to Ship the following plan.   ""I will make various strains of plague to stay dormant many years, but to remain infectious to spread throughout the population."" Marty said. ""With sufficient time the plagues will reach almost anywhere humanity has traveled via fold-ships."" Marty said. "" When humanity learns that you have the cure, they will come from the uttermost parts of the universe searching for you.""   ""Then I will descend from the clouds to save man."" Ship said.   From experience, Ship had learned that the population of the plague planets responded more favorably when Ship was in a tangible body rather than relaying the message as a disembodied voice booming from the heavens. Once pacified, the population was transferred to the hyb-tanks within the great holds of Ship. To accommodate these passengers Ship had to increase it's size to the extent it's mass was creating a gravitational field capable of affecting large planets. To counter this Ship materialized a anti-gravitational field around itself.   ""I have become a mythical cosmic ark."" Ship mused.   The population of the planets Ship visited were not sure whether to consider ship a savior or a destroyer of worlds. Whenever a third of the planet's night time stars were blotted out of the sky, or the sun eclipsed during the day, the planet's history was forever changed. Daniel then came down to the planets and asked the people if they were prepared to worship him. When in the guise of Daniel he noted the reactions of the more highly evolved humans towards him.   Reverend Mothers became disturbed when Daniel scanned them in awe of their cellular awareness without technological interventions. Masters nervously whistled at  him almost as if they could hope to control him. What surprised Daniel the most was the reaction a ghola named Duncan Idaho had towards him."

dune,2qqwq5,hellostarsailor,6,Tue Dec 30 02:47:59 2014 UTC,"I prefer the miniseries. There are plenty of moments where the lack of polish and money is glaring, but there's also some quality set pieces and acting. The miniseries is much closer to Herbert's material as well, if that's a factor for you (it is for me.) If you enjoy it enough to complete the series, the follow-up 'Children of Dune' is also good, with an obvious upgrade to budget over the first one."

I love the casting but he lynched the soul out of a great book and taking away the knife fighting and replacing it with sound guns... What?  The miniseries is okay.

Brian Tyler is a freaking brilliant composer, and that whole scene where SPOILER Chani dies, Duncan returns, Scytale dangles his carrot in front of Muad'Dib and gets killed, and finally Paul goes blind again END SPOILER still gives me goosebumps every time. The music starts calm, soothing, during a romantic talk. Then, as it continues to tragedy and then to excitement, it builds up to a feverish pitch until the scene comes to a climax, and as everything winds down, the music rolls off as well.  That soundtrack has to be one of my favourite soundtracks of all time."

Super Secret agent Princes iriana doing everything,  other than  just turning up at the end.  The Sadduka, as trained by SGT-Major Paris-Fashion-Week.  The hats. Oh my god, the hats. Butterfly hats and chimney hats. Why!?  That wierd waynes-world hand action the guild envoy did when he said ""the spice must flow"".  community cackling from the Harkkonans, including Batmanesque camer angles whilst looking straight at the camera.  The sodding Princes.  And the film: Sound weapons to quickly convay the wierding way. Heartplugs to quickly convay Harrkonan degeneracy in a manner they could put on screen.  Raining at the end.   Basically the film suffered from trying to put a massive book into a short amount of time, but got the look and feel spot on. However the tv series suffered from needlessly changing bits and throwing in plotlines that just weren't needed. One failed due to ambition, the other due to incompetence.

dune,2qpure,MetricLemur,5,Mon Dec 29 15:49:05 2014 UTC,Well I just started Chapterhouse and I didn't realize the story was going to pick up right where it left off so I assume there's more to learn about the Honored Matres and Tleilaxu still!
dune,2qpure,stovor,4,Mon Dec 29 16:25:43 2014 UTC,"Chapterhouse will answer many of your questions so hopefully no one here spoils anything for you.  Happy reading! And yes, avoid any of the non-Frank stuff unless you need something to start a fire with."
dune,2qpure,stovor,6,Mon Dec 29 17:13:48 2014 UTC,"Actually a lot of the answers to your questions are in the text of Heretics if you look a bit more closely on a re-read.  I won't spoil anything from Chapterhouse here (that isn't specifically stated in Heretics) because it's a really well-paced book and a great final chapter to the series, apart from the infuriating ending, but it's better than what Brian and Kevin came up with.   Odrade actually answers this directly.  When discussing the Honored Matres and their ability to control men via sex, Waff remarks about how distasteful it is and says that he had tried it only once, and only with a Face Dancer, whom he had destroyed immediately afterwards.  Odrade correctly surmises that despite the ""Honored Matre"" being a Face Dancer mimic, that Waff was actually enslaved by the Honored Matres due to this experience, and was not acting under his own will, despite him thinking otherwise.  This is addressed in Chapterhouse, so I won't spoil it for you!  The special thing the Tleilaxu actually did to the Duncan ghola was to include cells from every single one of the serial Duncan gholas in addition to the original memories.  This was not known until Duncan's encounter with Murbella when she tries to enslave him, and Duncan has a flood of all the other memories after his original persona was re-awakened.  The Tleilaxu gambled that the Bene Gesserit may use an imprinter (like Lucilla) to re-awaken the memories, and Duncan was programmed to kill the imprinter. (second part of this answer is below) Duncan's purpose was twofold for the Bene Gesserit.  First would be to act as a male imprinter on Sheeana, thus controlling her (and her latent ability to control the worms) as part of Taraza's plan to begin the spice cycle on another planet.  The second part of the plan ties in to the first. By spreading word of Duncan's sexual prowess/ability to enslave the Honored Matres the way they enslaved men, it would drive them mad with rage.  They would learn (either via their spies, or a carefully placed leak from the Bene Gesserit) that he was on Rakis, and head there to destroy him, and anything that stood in their way.  Even if it meant the whole planet.  Due to the events on Gammu involving Teg, the Bene Gesserit did not need to use Duncan as a lure/bait any longer, as the Honored Matres were driven by bloodlust to kill Teg, completing Taraza's plan."

dune,2qpure,savepublicdomain,6,Mon Dec 29 17:03:39 2014 UTC,If you expect the same level of authorship then you'll be disappointed. If you just want to keep exploring the Duniverse then it's satisfactory.  Note that this is an unpopular opinion here. You may not be able to get past the different writing styles.
dune,2qpure,Joomes,1 point,Mon Dec 29 17:35:44 2014 UTC,"Not really, but his son based Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune off of an outline Frank left behind.  So if you read the wikipedia summary, that's how Frank intended to end the series.  Also, the last page of Sandworms of Dune was written by Frank, so next time you're at a book store, look at the final page."
dune,2qpure,stovor,10,Mon Dec 29 17:28:47 2014 UTC,"Well, this is what they claim. They've never published the outline that they say Frank left behind. I'm disinclined to really believe them on this, given how their ending kind of contradicts one of the major themes of the original series.  I mean Frank Herbert himself insisted that one of the central themes of Dune was the destructive nature of charismatic leaders, and the dangers associated with giving any individual (or individual institution) too much power."
dune,2qpure,savepublicdomain,1 point,Mon Dec 29 18:12:21 2014 UTC,"I thought about that too.  However, the final battle in Sandworms of Dune has a lot of aspects that are in Frank's work, but not in Brian's.   Also, Dune was an ever evolving work, so  the themes were maturing over time.   That said, the outline was clearly a first draft, and I have no doubt that Frank would have written a final Dune book with a very different feel than what we got.   Personally, I think that Brian and Kevin stayed too slavish to the outline at the cost of the plot, atmosphere, character, and stories."
dune,2qpure,youknowhatstuart,3,Tue Dec 30 03:19:45 2014 UTC,"thought about that too. However, the final battle in Sandworms of Dune has a lot of aspects that are in Frank's work, but not in Brian's.   It also has the super dumb metal-mind stuff that's straight from Brian's work. It's heavily implied in the original series that the Butlerian Jihad took place for ideological reasons (humans giving up too much of their responsibilities to things they created, reducing their independence and 'humanity') as opposed to a kind of revolutionary war against a rogue AI that conquered much of humanity.  Until they release Frank's un-edited notes, I'm going to be skeptical that they even exist as a coherent outline (they may well exist, but be so patchy as to be basically unusable for a full book). I more strongly suspect, however, that the notes do exist in some form, but that Brian and KJA injected a bunch of their own crap."

dune,2qpzz3,stovor,1 point,Tue Dec 30 18:22:47 2014 UTC,"Was Frank Herbert on some sort of serious deadline?   I don't think so. I think the details were left out intentionally, as they wouldn't have actually added much other than an action scene or two. In general, if you look at the action scenes throughout the original series, they are only included in detail when parts of the scene that are relevant to the plot would otherwise be left out. Take a look at God Emperor, for example. Almost all of the action in that book takes place 'off-screen'."

I don't think they were on-planet for more than a couple of weeks before the shit hit the fan, and the journey from Caladan to Dune doesn't take an inordinate amount of time as far as I know.    Then again, Bene Gesserit are strange women.

I had my husband read the books a few years ago and it was super relevant for him because he and his family had moved from the Midwest to the Southwest US when he was Paul's age and he still likens it to the Atreides moving from Caladan to Arrakis. The culture shock, the climate change, all of it except there were no Harkonnen trying to kill him."
dune,2qiu4f,Mohawk115,4,Sat Dec 27 16:50:07 2014 UTC,I think it will always be relevant because its based around human nature at its worse.
dune,2qiu4f,annarchy8,2,Sat Dec 27 15:28:06 2014 UTC,"That could be part of it. Herbert also shows us humans at their best, though. The sacrifices made by the Atreides family for all of humanity, for example."
dune,2qiu4f,Mohawk115,2,Sat Dec 27 18:22:02 2014 UTC,"True, its yin and yang really. A lot of what occurs in the series makes characters morally ambigious and the setting ambigious too. I think its doing what Herbert wanted, and that's people seeing his characters as part of themselves so they get attached even more."

dune,2qiu4f,soylentblueissmurfs,3,Sat Dec 27 19:43:50 2014 UTC,"Spice is a closer analogy to oil than most of you realize. Oil is literally what  makes our society as wealthy as it is. Oil allows for transportation and indirectly for longer lives thanks to industrialized healthcare and industrialized farming and sanitation. Our civilization is addicted to fossil fuels and when they become scarce, like they became under Paul II, our society will again become more primitive and isolated."

dune,2qiu4f,saati,6,Sun Dec 28 07:06:10 2014 UTC,I personly also equate spice and oil. But I also think that this is open to interpretation
dune,2qiu4f,Templer_90,1 point,Sun Dec 28 19:47:49 2014 UTC,Open to what interpretation? Both are substances that are required or global trade just dies.
dune,2qiu4f,saati,13,Sat Dec 27 11:19:48 2014 UTC,"Well...   Spice=Oil: Like you said, it is used for trade and transport. It is literaly used for making everything, like we use oil today. From explosives to beer to paper and plastic. It comes from a far way desert land (far away for most westeners) with a strange culture (again, for most westeners) and language (see the other brackets in this sentence). See this post for more. Spice=Drugs: Dune was written in the 60s. A time when drugs were used for ""expanding your horizon"" , ""finding youself"" and such things. Think about the common comments about a good LSD-trip: You see more of the world around you, you feel like you can see the future, time and space are disorted, etc. That sounds to me a bit like the effects of spice. Oh, and it makes you depend on it like some drugs. Spice=MacGuffin: A resource in a science-fiction story. Not more, not less (this one is a weak argument, imho). Spice=Metaphore for the enviroment: Arrakis (and other plantes) is a desert-world cause of the Sandtrouts and Sandworms. Without them Arrakis would be a nice(read wet) place. It is hinted in the books (and explicit said for other planets) that the Sandworms are not native to Arrakis. They were brought to this world by humans(maybe aliens?), thereby destroying the native ecosystem and extract value from it in the process. Some real world analogs like the rainforests arround the world (desertification, destroying of ecosystems), oil and coal harvesting. Look at the big Bucket-wheel Excavators in germany and what remains after the coal is unearthed. The climate change and the resulting change in ecosystems also works nice in this context (don't forget Herberts inspiration for dune).   Edit: Formating"

dune,2qiu4f,Shiningtoast,3,Sat Dec 27 17:44:30 2014 UTC,Spice is clearly a metaphor for several things. Herbert had a wonderfully complex mind.
dune,2qiu4f,Realik,0,Sat Dec 27 18:08:04 2014 UTC,Metaphor*
dune,2qiu4f,zensunni66,0,Sat Dec 27 21:29:36 2014 UTC,"You can not argue this. Oil does not do one half of what oil does. Oil is not attached to gods and theologies, and sacred actions."
dune,2qiu4f,Realik,5,Sat Dec 27 17:02:29 2014 UTC,"Well, since Herbert himself said CHOAM is OPEC, I suppose you can argue it. An imperfect metaphor is still a metaphor."
dune,2qiu4f,zensunni66,0,Sat Dec 27 19:28:23 2014 UTC,He did not. He gave that as an example to think about their dealings.  And the qoute that is being cherry picked he said water is like oil scarcity..not spice.
dune,2qiu4f,Realik,2,Sat Dec 27 21:16:40 2014 UTC,"Like I said, it's an imperfect (partial) metaphor. Spice, like Scrooge or Oz, is a literary creation, and has no precise and complete corollary in the real world."
dune,2qiu4f,zensunni66,1 point,Sat Dec 27 21:20:08 2014 UTC,Of course not. I am only so stern in this as i see that as a simple and unworthy analogy to the greatness of this work.
dune,2qiu4f,Realik,-1,Sat Dec 27 21:27:28 2014 UTC,"In that, we agree. Dune isn't a puzzle to be solved, really, and Herbert didn't write it that way. Look at the moral complexity of the characters: only Baron Harkonnen is an absolute, a villain so wonderfully over the top the Herbert admitted he was a bit of a parody. The ""good guys"" do bad things, even with good intentions. Simple explanations don't work with Dune any more than they work with Hamlet or King Lear.   So too, with Paul: is he based on Lawrence of Arabia? The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him? Buck Rogers? All of these and more!"

dune,2qiu4f,Neon-Knight,2,Sat Dec 27 18:05:54 2014 UTC,Dune is not a metaphor for oil and Iraq.  It is a critique on western literature and its love of hero's and theologies In stories and statecraft.
dune,2qiu4f,DaveyGee16,12,Sat Dec 27 18:14:27 2014 UTC,"I feel that it's probably both. Finding a subject that Dune does not allude to, would be difficult to say the least. When I read it, I was reminded of TE Lawrence, I'm sure I'm not alone."
dune,2qiu4f,Immediately_Hostile,5,Sat Dec 27 10:22:27 2014 UTC,"I'm certain that I've read somewhere that T.E. Lawrence was Herberts direct inspiration, as stated by himself (but I could be mistaken). The film about him, Lawrence of Arabia, premiered 1962. Dune was published in 1966."
dune,2qiu4f,Rampant_Durandal,5,Sat Dec 27 12:43:37 2014 UTC,"No doubt Frank used TE Lawrence as an inspiration for Dune.  I like to call the connection Lawrence of Arrakis.  From another angle, just try to imagine Dune without the possibility of an outsider leading desert nomads to revolt against morally corrupt forces, and in the process becoming a god-like figure to the revolutionary forces.  I actually wrote a long essay about all the parallels. Not only am I a Dune fanatic, I am also a huge Lawrence fan. His real life is much more amazing then what was shown in the classic film."
dune,2qiu4f,DaveyGee16,2,Sat Dec 27 13:04:49 2014 UTC,"It isn't, the oil analogy only works in the first book. It makes no sense in the entire story arc by Herbert. Spice is a means to an end for Herbert to criticize the self-destructive nature of humanity and its capacity to endure."
dune,2qiu4f,Pilga,4,Sat Dec 27 14:14:38 2014 UTC,"The oil analogy works analogously to looking at an onion thinking there are no other layers beyond the first.   Oil is the weakest and most superficial analogy in my opinion. And if it's the only one seen, OP will have to read the book again to glean anything further from it; his biases are deceiving him."

dune,2qiu4f,chippeh,2,Sat Dec 27 15:24:29 2014 UTC,I think it takes away from the unique setting to relate Dune to something so boringly Terran. Dune is more about how time and humans interact than any allusion to contemporary resource wars. Dune is relatable to many things though.

I feel he would make a lot of the same mistakes Lynch did. He's all about creatures and effects these days. He couldn't even make a simple Kaiju film make much sense with Pacific Rim."
dune,2ql4a8,CrashCoplee,2,Thu Jan 1 04:59:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I couldn't disagree more. Pacific Rim could easily have been another dumb rock-em-sock-em-robots movie, but Del Toro did a great job of giving the film heart as well as creating kaiju I felt had actual texture. They were more than just a bunch of pixels punching another bunch of pixels. If anyone is going to do the Sandworm's justice it would be Del Toro. Plus, with Crimson Peak on the way I'm sure he's going to quell any fears he's lost touch for story driven film making."
dune,2ql4a8,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,2,Thu Jan 1 12:00:12 2015 UTC,"Pacific Rim did have heart, because it had particularly well after and filmed performances. It had fun Kaiju, too, but really, Dune needs more than that. Much more."

When he is clean shaven he looks super young then can play older.

dune,2qhc57,enitnepres,4,Sat Dec 27 07:36:30 2014 UTC,"Probably the only documentary to bring a tear to my eye. A lot of people dispute Jodorowsky's ending for butchering the series, but I'm of the camp that the ending would have been fantastic, and a great homage to the idea of a perpetual heritage. Jodorowsky's speech about money was one of the most moving things I've ever seen. That man gave his soul to produce art that very few appreciate, and his bitterness about the world only recognizing what would sell good really shines as a legitimate criticism."

dune,2qhc57,enitnepres,1 point,Sat Dec 27 03:06:45 2014 UTC,"I feel the people that are against this movie really don't understand his aim or meaning honestly, which is perfectly fine and ok! I however, like the other 5 people that like Jodo wish I could have seen his adaptation given it's profound cast and script. Watching the documentary you can't say that the whole meeting of each individual working for Jodo wouldn't produce something  that they believe was their best. Each person mentioned how inspiring Jodo was to them and how they devoted days and months into their creations to do their best work. I really believe Dune would have been more of a cult classic than the Lynch version, but his whole story was quite profound with symbolism that Dune teaches. Dune tells the fact of many things, of which I believe is the spread of Muad'dib to create his Jihad. People murdered because they felt Muad'dib as their messiah(pun). I can absolutely see where the ending of Dune where everyone symbolically takes Paul into them and again, symbolically adopts Paul as their 'god' with Paul's presence spreading throughout the entire universe as a singular human being, much as if Paul dying is him becoming Muad'dib the god that perpetuates through everyone. I see the Jihad and the fact Muad'dib and his actions became such a religious fanaticism as the point to Jodo's ending.   TL;DR   I love the idea of Jodos movie cuz I was probably too high honestly. Would bomb in the office."

Messiah is Paul trying to fight what he should do, but can't which is what happens in Children. With his prescience he knows what must be done but refuses to do it until it blows up on his face. I really enjoyed Messiah because of this: it flipped the hero's journey. Dune finished with Paul basically being a God and Messiah trapped Paul within his own actions and flaws until he cowered before reality.  You should feel the Paul's plight in regards to Chani. He knows that she will die but tries to postpone it and then they offer to revive/clone her (that was the whole Ghola plot, Gholas had never remembered anytning but the Duncan one proved that it was possible) but Paul knows that he can't do it. The allpowerful, allknowing Emperor knew of his wife's doom, couldn't prevent it and had to watch it unfold in front of him, he became powerless and fearful. To make it worse, they offer him the one thing in the universe and he has to refuse because of his role.  The one that really deserves pity is Irulan.  But without spoiling anything, Children will explain the prescience thing that was hinted in Messiah. They'll introduce it and continue with it in God Emperor. There is one giant plot element that started at the end of Dune and continues with all the books. Messiah is Paul facing that reality, and regardless of all his power and prescience he fails, from a God he becomes a powerless child. Children continues it while God Emperor deals with that plot element directly, the following books deal with the consequence of thag plot element."

The first is good ole space opera (though with Herbert's quality of writing you can add ""and then some"") while the second deals with the consequences of the Jihad and Paul's powers.   Without spoilers, the third is a mix of the previous two: there is some action and there is some deep philosophy and ideas exposed.   The fourth is where it all comes together, and it's by far the deepest of any of The Holy Six (pause to spit on the prequels <HHHAWWWWWK PTUI>)  The fifth and sixth are basically a giant novel split into two parts, which shows the further consequences of the first four books. Their tone is definitely a lot more action oriented than even the first, but again, with Herbert's writing they're amazing still.

dune,2qbhiz,kamehamehigh,6,Wed Dec 24 22:58:33 2014 UTC,"While I think HBO would be a good choice in terms of production quality and budget, I don't think they would be a good idea in terms of actually being loyal to the tone and narrative flow of the book.  All the HBO series I have seen have been very good but they all have a very familiar pattern where they take a interesting concept and inject a lot of blunt sexuality, salty language and vivid violence.  Don't get me wrong. None of that is a bad thing in the right setting but Dune is a very specific kind of story that kinda demands a lighter, more nuanced touch.   To be honest, I don't know if there is a film/TV studio that could really do Dune justice at this point, It's such a cerebral book that nobody would really want to touch it unless they can sex it up."
dune,2qbhiz,StarTrekMike,4,Thu Dec 25 02:47:02 2014 UTC,"I just feel that Dune is one of those books that has to be handled in a very specific way. HBO does great productions but they are also either built from the ground up as projects that fit the HBO mold or are existing properties that are already in the same ballpark (like Game of thrones).  Dune conveys most of it's ideas and narrative flow through heavy, introspective dialogue. Characters spend a lot of time thinking and processing the world and people around them very carefully. This is something that the David Lynch film tried to capture and it is what the sci-fi channel version missed almost entirely.  To put it bluntly, I want to see a Dune mini-series that is loyal to the books. I want to see something that actually respects not just the source material but also the existing fanbase who has been waiting for a good on-screen translation of it.  To be even more blunt, I would rather Dune be it's own thing in terms of tone, I love Game of thrones, it's a fantastic show but I would rather not have a Dune mini-series that feels like it, A Dune series would need it's own tone and identity."

dune,2qbhiz,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,1 point,Thu Dec 25 04:36:43 2014 UTC,"First off,  I largely agree with /u/StarTrekMike, in thinking that HBO wouldn't get this right. HBO often seems like they break the mold, but they have their own mold they stick to very closely, especially as shows drag on, and HBO does tend to drag on. They have a have their own form of status quo is king, and they prefer melodrama and plot over character and drama.  This is the network who choose GoT but passed on adapting The Sword of Truth, and despite thriving on low grade shocks, haven't made GoT a show that produces real discussion,  just cheap ""omg's."" I don't want to see Dune turned into something people watch for tits or cool cred.  That said,  some of your castings are interesting. I'm not sure how multicultural the cast should be,  but political reality dictates that. That said,  maybe the Fremen should be pale,  contrary to conventional wisdom. They were night people, and couldn't go outside uncovered upon penalty of death. Just a thought.   As for who I would cast, David Tennant as Duke Leto. Thomas Brodie as Paul. Gerard Butler as Gurney. Rosamund Pike as Jessica. Ralph Fiennes as Stilgar.  Pricey,  I know. All the more reason for a mini series.   Edited."

dune,2q43mq,Ace1999,3,Wed Dec 24 02:30:35 2014 UTC,Dune's nuances come out of being able to read the thoughts of characters and also a number of little side conversations and such.  It's tough to film because you have to narrate those thoughts or change up the dialog to add exposition and that is hard to go without sounding corny.  For the side conversations it is also a hard balance to strike between having an epic feel or just feeling like a slog where the secondary characters are on screen way too much.

One of the best parts of the first book, IMO, is that Herbert throws you directly into his enormous and detailed universe without any preparation.  It is both profoundly alien but quintessentially human.  When you finally start to understand the setting, you feel a sense of accomplishment after the culture shock wears off.  It's like buying a plane ticket to another planet.  The book grows in meaning with rereads, but you never again get to experience the sense of immersion that I described above.

As to the choice of woman or servant, I have no idea. I can only guess it is the males choice what status his new dependent is to have in his household."
dune,2pcks9,Fire_Elemental,13,Mon Dec 15 11:07:40 2014 UTC,"yeah, harah wasn't paul's to do what he liked with, she was his responsibility bc he killed her partner. i imagine being responsible for the wife and children of men you kill would cut back on duels like that."
dune,2pcks9,IWankYouWonk,6,Mon Dec 15 15:26:58 2014 UTC,"Completely. If stability of the tribe, for the tribes survival, is a central issue, then making duelers responsible for the fallen's dependents would be a natural break, and a fair one. If anything marks the Fremen's customs that Herbert wrote, it would be tribal survival. In a way, understanding a Fremen without seeing the Fremen in the context of the tribe isn't possible. And in the next two books you see the Fremen growing weaker as a people, and at the center of it is that they are removed from that context."
dune,2pcks9,Fire_Elemental,11,Tue Dec 16 07:45:29 2014 UTC,"They can only be taken for a year, after which they are free to chose.  I believe what Herbert is referencing here is that in societies that face harsh conditions, children and fertile women are the two most protected assets.  Females have a much more limited fertility window compared to males and harsh societies  tend to have child mortality rates.  So in order for the tribe to survival those assets must be protected (note that Paul also becomes the provider for the kids).  It's basically a very crude version of social security for Harrah and while perhaps contradictory to the not taken against their will deal, Herbert tries to convey it is necessary for tribal custom to give Harrah a landing spot in Paul's household.  Plus there are other control mechanisms, if Harrah didn't want to be his wife but he forcible slept with her, she's a trained fighter can kill him.  Others in the tribe, such as Harrah's male relatives, might also opt to call Paul out for such an act.    Herbert's fairly deliberate in how Harrah is handed over along with the coffee service and the water that Paul holds in trust for the tribe, all three are tribal assets that Paul now holds in a certain trust (coffee service as a symbol of status within the tribe that will be passed on to the next generation of males, the fertile female, and tribal water).    The implied context is that it is a trial period.  The ideal solution from the tribe's point of view is for the pair to make it work and thus minimal disruption to the overall structure.  However if it doesn't there is a window for Harrah to find a new household to join.  I also assume that if such couldn't be found, Paul would be expected to retain Harrah and not cast her out unless he has a good reason.    Basically you have an odd situation in which the female retains her free will relative to mate choices, except in situations where custom dictates an intervention to ensure tribal stability."
dune,2pcks9,Cai_E,3,Mon Dec 15 22:38:16 2014 UTC,"Women are fiercely independent in fremen culture.  Chani kills a male that comes to challenge Muad'Dib while he is meditating.

dune,2pcks9,El_Camino_SS,2,Mon Dec 15 12:08:11 2014 UTC,"In this circumstance, Hanah was clearly willing to be Paul's wife, trying to convince him to have her, and clearly upset when he makes her his ghanima and not wife."
dune,2pcks9,vinsneezel,2,Mon Dec 15 12:24:15 2014 UTC,"As far as i see, ""not taken against their will"" is interpreted as rape. I thought that it connoted as taking her as a wife.  But than the question is, what is the difference between 'woman' and 'servant'? If Paul had chosen her as his wife, could she refuse to have sex with him?"
dune,2pcks9,vinsneezel,3,Mon Dec 15 13:55:11 2014 UTC,"Probably? I would assume that any society that holds women as highly as the Fremen do would have a concept of marital rape.   Even the choice Paul has to make strikes me as being designed to protect Fremen women. Hanah doesn't marry Paul but she does become a member of his household, and he takes on responsibility for her children. This kind of responsibility would make anybody think twice before challenging another man to duel to the death."
dune,2pcks9,soylentblueissmurfs,1 point,Mon Dec 15 16:14:37 2014 UTC,I suspect society would expect them to have sex if she was his wife and that she could make official complaints if he didn't want to. Just as she could make official complaints if he wanted to have sex with her without making her his wife.
dune,2pcks9,lundse,1 point,Mon Dec 15 15:45:22 2014 UTC,"Quite possibly, Harrah could also have refused marriage and chosen to be merely part of the household. We would not know, as she clearly wants to be  married, presumably because she can still bear children and thus is the role of fertile women in fremen society. So yeah, strong gender roles, little freedom of the individual, less for women than men - but no reason to assume rape is the order of usual business."
dune,2pcks9,mscinagan,1 point,Tue Dec 16 13:42:17 2014 UTC,"I don't know whether this will contribute much, but since Fremen has so much reference to Arab culture...  Back in the days it's customary for men who came back from war to take the wives of their fallen comrades and make them his own. More for the sake of protecting the women and children from harm and upholding their honor & dignity. After a certain time of grieving period, that woman can remarry if a man asks her hand in marriage.

I don't feel it has any ""fuck you"" element since some of those scenes were slavishly choreographed, re-written, and edited.    Overall, I'm a little worried as I think the OP is kind of overthinking this process!  I would just read the next few books and trust that you'll at least enjoy them enough that it was worth it.  Even the toughest parts of the next five novels are better than most best-sellers.  If you truly 'get' Dune then trust that the author who could write something that amazing at least has a few very cool things to say in the next few books, or a chance for a book you'll enjoy even more than the original .  And for a vocal minority of Dune fans books like Heretics and God Emperor are just as exciting and mysterious as the original (God Emperor was so amazing to me there are no words.  as bad as it sounds it made me not even like the original anymore).  Reading those two later books were among my greatest reading experiences in life."

dune,2p9bq8,Ponches,7,Sun Dec 14 22:43:08 2014 UTC,"A while ago someone asked the same question. Here's what I said at the time.   In my opinion, gods yes, especially because the books are so vastly different in their focus.  Dune is very much action-adventure, as you may have noticed.  Messiah and Children are more about political games around the main characters. Oooh, the plots!  God-Emperor continues with social commentary and lamentations. It's a very polarizing book. Some really appreciate living along with and getting a deeper understanding of the title character, who is a tyrant externally but is sacrificing and suffering internally. And some really don't give a crap about all that whinging.  Chapterhouse and Heretics just flip the whole story upside down and follow the struggles of the Bene Gesserit as they face mankind reshapen.  It's quite a bizarre collection of books like that, but I liken it to having a large, varied feast. Is the first course just as good? Yeah, it is. But don't expect it to be the same.   [Source]"
dune,2p9bq8,TheFlyingBastard,3,Sun Dec 14 19:24:37 2014 UTC,Certainly read at least Messiah. The series of 6 is long but rewarding.

dune,2p9bq8,kengou,3,Sun Dec 14 15:17:38 2014 UTC,Definitely keep reading. Keep in mind though that their all very different from the first one. Messiah is really slow at times but gets good towards the end and wraps up in an interesting way.

dune,2p9bq8,Arkadii,1 point,Fri Dec 19 18:59:31 2014 UTC,"Oh, the one where we're specifically told that Frank/Dune was wrong, and that Paul did go offworld as a child .  And where we learn every Atreides is an amnesiac, having forgotten Leto's bloodbath/doomsday-weapon-aborted wedding attempt.  And where the quiet, traffic nobility of Fenrings choice and brotherhood with Paul is undone."
dune,2p9bq8,lundse,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:09:07 2014 UTC,"I don't remember him going off world, he just goes to another part of Caladan, but you may be right. It's been a while. I didn't even remember the original line in Dune that he'd never left the world so it didn't bother me substantially.  What makes you say that everyone had forgotten the wedding? I mean, my family's had traumatic events in the past, my dad lost his fiance and her family in an accident at an air show in Germany, but it doesn't mean I make a habit of bringing it up every time we travel around. Stuff happens in people's lives.  Lastly, I don't see how Fenrings actions in Paul of Dune undo his actions in Dune. From what I recall, he's a conspirator by nature, and his actions in Paul seem to be a natural evolution."
dune,2p9bq8,Arkadii,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:18:37 2014 UTC,"Well, whether you remember Dune or not, then Paul of Dune does establish Leto I as completely retarded, unable to keep track of his sons coming and goings.  And it seems truly weird to me that no Atreides - Leto, Paul, Jessica - ever brings up or remembers the horror-bloddfest that was Leto's first wedding, as they discuss or think about how the duke could have married Jessica...  And Fenring decided at the end of Dune to break with Shadam, by not killing Paul. He was a tragic figure, seemingly torn between his friend the emperor, his Bene Gesserit wife, and some understanding only he and Paul shared of what was necessary. He was not just another plotter who plunged daggers into stuff for other people. Except, of course, in Paul of Dune. Maybe he suffered from the same mental illness that robbed the duke Leto of his mental faculties?"

So he gives the Duke Arrakis knowing he HAS to take it and will be taking it from his mortal enemy...which of course will give them cause to fight. The Baron sent a letter to declare a truce, knowing the Duke would reject it, which allows him to attempt to basically destroy everything Atreides in a lawful manner."

The whole point of the Atreides getting the spice contract on Arrakis was a ruse, a setup to wipe out House Atreides.  Paul's father, Leto, was the first person in generations that the Landsraad (Barons, and democracies that hold all the other planets) trusted enough to be close to the Emperor's power.  The Landsraad had been under the thumb of House Corrino (the Imperial House) for over two thousand years, and nothing was going to change if Shaddam had anything to do with it.  NOW STOP.  IS PAUL IN THE DESERT YET?  YOU CAN READ THIS.  The Harkonnens and Atreides are sworn enemies from a family falling out generations before.  They're also the two most powerful 'normal' (Non-Ixian, Non-Tileaxeau, etc) houses in the Landsraad.  Harkonnens, with the Baron, were down for anything to kill off their 'cousins.'  NOW STOP.  IF YOU'RE STILL CONFUSED, ONLY READ THIS IF YOU'RE OVER HALFWAY THROUGH.  THIS WILL NOT SPOIL THE ADVENTURE.  The Bene Gesserit had been setting Shaddam, and House Corrino up for a takeover for generations.  The emperor, of high breeding with spice presence, knew something was up, although he didn't realize that the Bene Gesserit had been breeding a suitable 'Master Emperor' (the Kwisatz Haderach, or a MALE Bene Gesserit reverend mother) to replace him.  The Bene Gesserit miscalculated, and thought that the male heir from a Harkonnen/Atreides marriage would make the new great emperor they could control.  Paul was one generation too early.  Jessica was to have a daughter, probably to marry Feyd, and calm him and make the great house merger to take the Emperor.  Jessica was the most beautiful of the BG, and her daughter with Leto was to be irresistable, as well as noble, and a prize for the Harkonnen.  The BG were known to use women to satiate (cool-off) the war-headed desires of sovereign leaders.  In short, they put a beautiful and noble woman in there to cool them out, and kill their desires for conquest. The Atreides loyalty and honesty, with the Harkonnen will, was to make an incredible, noble Emperor... and save the universe from a intersection where spice interruption would cause humanity's extinction.  Then the son of Feyd and the Atriedes daughter would be a ferocious, but honest, leader, and the Bene Gesserit would put all of their support behind him, and it would topple House Corrino as Emperor, as a natural choice.   And then Jessica had a son.  Because she loved Leto.  Which was her better nature, and why she was paired to Leto, because she was beautiful and honest.   Notice that the BG, for generations, had been breeding those two characteristics, separately, in two houses so they could have a very pure heir with the two survival traits to FINALLY merge them.  The BG are the hand the rocks the cradle of the universe.  Unfortunately, they made a mistake, and the Emperor became jealous of Leto's honesty and popularity, and tried to wipe out House Atreides in a move by putting them on Arrakis where they couldn't escape, and using Harkonnen and Imperial troops (Sarduakar) to kill Leto and his legacy.  They never calculated that the son and his mother would survive, and that he already carried the characteristics necessary through the breeding program to become the new Emperor, and after a war on the most dangerous planet in the universe that you CANNOT destroy, Paul steak-attacks the Emperor in a sandstorm in a way that he can't get offworld, and uses worms, and desert power to assume the throne."

Early in the novel, it's to demonstrate a smooth transfer of fiefdom between the two houses.   Was Atreides put there to run Arrakis or to run the spice?   Yes. Any house assigned the fiefdom of Arrakis is in charge of spice mining/output.   And are the Harkonens the rulers (fief?) of Arrakis at the start?   Yes   I know this is probably really but could anyone answer this without spoiling anything? or should I just keep reading and work it out through context?   If you're not aware of the reason, then it's possible that you already read it and you simply forgot. Here's a synopsis: I will not use spoiler tags because it is outlined very early in the novel.   It's a plot between House Corrino (which holds the imperial throne) and House Harkonnen to get rid of House Atreides. The reasons: Emperor Shaddam feels threatened by Duke Leto's popularity in the Lansraad and, for The Baron, it's all about the rivalry with House Atreides."

I think they were careful not to depend on it as that would give anyone who controlled Arrakis control over them as well. Bene Gesserit sees humanity and its improval as a worthy cause in itself and will tinker with it to improve and safeguard it while Bene Tleilax sees mastery over humanity as the final goal but actually maintaining their own or others humanity is not a concern as long as they reach their goal. Ascendancy/mastery. It's stated very clearly by Tleilaxu characters. They probably have some very interesting legacies, I imagine a lot of planets will be colonized by designed animals and peoples and that very far into the future there will be several intelligent species populating the galaxies thanks to Bene Tleilax knowledge. Leto II seems aware that humanity will probably evolve into something completely different in the far future but that he should not stop it.

The Tleilaxu and Bene Gessert have opposing mindsets in how to alter the ""improvement"" of life-forms.

dune,2ousi2,Leftieswillrule,8,Thu Dec 11 00:37:40 2014 UTC,"The problem I have with that is that a show would require expansion into the later books. I highly doubt Chapterhouse or Heretics would translate well on-screen, nor would God Emperor.  If HBO went ahead and funded a feature-length movie I would be super excited. The story of Dune really lends itself to the big screen, and while it would be difficult for the average viewer to digest, the first is still self-contained yet enormous enough to captivate attention. I'd love to see Daniel Day-Lewis as Leto or Michael Fassbender as Duncan Idaho."
dune,2ousi2,stovor,4,Wed Dec 10 21:32:20 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt Chapterhouse or Heretics would translate well on-screen, nor would God Emperor   I agree 100% on God Emperor, but Heretics and Chapterhouse could be done on-screen fairly well I think.  Moreso Heretics - that book is paced really quickly.  Chapterhouse has a lot of scenes in the no-ship and scenes of Odrade woolgathering in her office which might require an extensive re-write/adaptation of the story.  The overall plot of Chapterhouse I think could be really cool to see in a visual medium."
dune,2ousi2,Leftieswillrule,3,Wed Dec 10 21:59:52 2014 UTC,"I feel like as the books go one the action becomes less and less intense and the characters spend way more time in their own heads, which makes for excellent books but also makes it difficult for an adaption to the screen. The first book is a classic ""hero's return"" story, and every book after that is the fallout of creating a messiah figure. The first one would be great for the box office, but once people realize that after book 2 all of the main characters are basically gone/fundamentally different and your only constant is a dude who died in the first 30 minutes of the first movie, viewership will probably only be limited to the people who read the books first. It doesn't have lasting potential in the visual medium."
dune,2ousi2,Shoeboxer,2,Wed Dec 10 22:12:10 2014 UTC,Odrade woolgathering ; think of that scene from Ferris buellers day off with camera staring at the painting. What he's thinking is pretty clearly expressed imo.
dune,2ousi2,solarnoise,3,Thu Dec 11 01:39:30 2014 UTC,"I would be fine with them stopping after Children of Dune, like Syfy did.  They could easily turn the first three books into 3-4 seasons, and mix in ""appendix"" content like Game of Thrones and the Hobbit movies are doing and maybe squeeze out an additional season.  Basically take the Paul/Leto arc and then stop there. People who are introduced to the series by the show will have more books to read and they'll likely understand why they weren't all adapted, while the book fans have some cool new Dune media to entertain them.  Frankly, I don't care if the show is ""dumber"" than the books and omits the Golden Path. In an age of reality TV, I'll gladly take a faithful, if only in spirit and visuals, adaptation of my favorite book. I felt the same about the Watchmen movie, and feel that way about Game of Thrones, though it seems a majority on here disagree.  A show may never come close to doing the books the full justice they deserve, but the material could at least be adapted into something as high quality as Game of Thrones, True Detective, Breaking Bad, etc."
dune,2ousi2,Andynonomous,4,Fri Dec 12 11:06:43 2014 UTC,"I don't know. I've always felt that with Dune, most of what's really interesting is happening inside the characters minds. So I just don't see how a visual interpretation will ever have the power and profundity of the novels."
dune,2ousi2,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:26:52 2014 UTC,"I feel like the omnipotent perspective of the books was the means to an end,  not the end itself. Herbert used the right tools for telling his story in the medium of print. The inner monologues may not work as well on film,  at least not in the quantities of the books,  but that's the point. A film maker adapting Dune must use the tools appropriate to his or her medium to tell the story. It will be different on the surface, but that difference is what could allow for fidelity to the heart of the story."
dune,2ousi2,Nihiliste,4,Fri Dec 26 00:06:24 2014 UTC,"In capable hands, I think the Dune universe lends itself to fantastic, radically different interpretations.

The nice thing about Dune is that you can get new actors every season, so you could get some big-name actors to come in.  The important thing is that this couldn't be done as a movie, or a network TV show.  You can even add onto the prequels, and get real writers to do the scripts.

Personally, I think they'd made okay outlines, but could be built upon, and the parts that don't work ignored by a team of talented writers.   Kind of like how X-Men: Days Of Futures Past ignored the things that didn't work, and developed its own plot, creating something that stayed true to the spirit of the original, but surpassed the source material in many ways."

dune,2otqga,AndyH13,4,Wed Dec 10 07:51:18 2014 UTC,"As /u/bigbadal points out, it can be compared to a number of mythologies, including Judaism and Christianity."
dune,2otqga,rsixidor,12,Wed Dec 10 13:37:07 2014 UTC,"It's possible that Herbert used biblical references for some of Dune, as he was raised Catholic - but he became a Zen Buddhist 15 years before writing Dune and the main religion in the series is a combination of Buddhism and Islam.  Twins are common in a lot of mythologies - often to contrast good and bad/divine and not divine by having two opposites created from one source and showing how their choices affect themselves and those around them.  You could compare Leto and Ghanima to Castor and Pollux who battled to save their sister (could be Paul's sister, Alia), caused the Trojan War which led to an empire being overthrown and when offered the choice of life or death Pollux gave up immortality to save Castor (could be Ghanima seeing the Golden Path but stepping off it to allow Leto his thousands of years). That would be a more direct comparison than using Ghanima's descendants.  Alternatively the Zoroastrian religion, which predates and influenced Judaism, Christianity and Islam, had Ahriman (a twin) creating an evil snake with human qualities"
dune,2otqga,BigBadAl,3,Wed Dec 10 11:14:32 2014 UTC,"There are certainly aspects of many religions throughout the series. In my brief research on Ahriman just now I read that he tried to dry up the earth and prevent the rains. The creature he created, Zahhak, would infest the world with vermin if he was killed, like Leto and the worms."
dune,2otqga,root88,6,Wed Dec 10 19:03:55 2014 UTC,But you completely ignored the fact both blind guys called for their sons to touch them to confirm the identity.  That's pretty damn specific.
dune,2otqga,BigBadAl,3,Wed Dec 10 15:17:48 2014 UTC,"But associating Ghanima's descendants, rather than Ghanima herself, with Esau is also pretty damn unspecific. You can't have it both ways.  I'm not an expert on mythology, it's just a passing interest, so it may well be possible that there are other stories where twins have a blind relative. Remember that the old testament was based on older Jewish stories, and these in turn were probably fed by Sumerian myths and, whilst that's about as far as we can go with written records, it's entirely possible that those Sumerian myths were based on older stories again. So the same themes keep cropping up time and again."

dune,2otqga,averypissedbloke,5,Wed Dec 10 14:28:20 2014 UTC,All dune to me is basically a retelling of the old testament. To me the fremen are basicaly jews and particullary they are the zionist/sabra while the bene gesserit are the religious rabbinical power.
dune,2otqga,lundse,2,Wed Dec 10 11:21:44 2014 UTC,"Uhm... Aren't rabbis a development from after the fall of the temple? Long after the time described in the Old Testament / The Torah? And how are the BG anything like rabbis?  Also, how are the fremen Jewish? Because they are monotheistic? Live in a desert?

It's an unmistakable nod and it made me grin when I read it. The author (Patrick Rothfuss) puts Dune at number 8 on his list of 40 essential sci-fi/fantasy novels.
dune,2oq055,aheadyriser,50,Tue Dec 9 04:21:23 2014 UTC,"Totally just my two cents, but I'd draw a pretty clear parallel between the weed and Paul himself. He is the weed and the rock is his lack of prescience in his youth, limiting him. The spice freed him from those limits like a rock being lifted away, giving him room to flourish and achieve his full potential.  But he can't escape his fate. One day the rock will be replaced (his both prescient and physical blindness), and it will be all the more tragic for him having had the power and then lost it."
dune,2oq055,gee_iwonderwhy,6,Tue Dec 9 04:47:00 2014 UTC,Great interpretation and it makes a lot of sense in that context. Thanks for sharing.

dune,2oq055,spaceman_zero,18,Tue Dec 9 18:54:25 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's a parallel to the society he lived in.  The weed grows in a harsh and inhospitable environment, but when it is allowed to grow and flourish beyond those around it, society feels threatened by it and impedes it once again."
dune,2oq055,producer35,5,Tue Dec 9 05:16:25 2014 UTC,"I really like this idea. The weed is trying to grow in an inhospitable environment, and once its removed it flourishes right next to what used to be holding it back. Only to bring it back down. It definitely parallels Paul very well flourishing within the fremen, and they are the ones who ultimately cause his demise (not directly but still)."
dune,2oq055,Tony_Chu,6,Tue Dec 9 05:24:33 2014 UTC,"There may be a significance in the use of two different rocks in the parable.  For example, when the first rock is moved that removes some of the burden from the weed allowing it to flourish for a time. Those problems are conquered and do not come into play again.  However, the second rock represents other problems that were there all the time and were not removed. The remaining rock is eventually shifted and buries the weed representing a cruel fate handed out by a capricious and uncaring universe.  To me it is a succinct and apt allegory for Muad'dib's life."
dune,2oq055,MortRouge,5,Tue Dec 9 14:48:57 2014 UTC,"No matter how favorable or unfavorable the conditions for a weed, it's end state will always be the same.    Momentary success is but an illusion.  Everything finishes the game with the same score.  A dead weed that once thrived isn't any more successful than the dead weed that never thrived.  Thus, by moving the first rock, Muad'dib did nothing.  By moving the second rock, Muad'dib did nothing.    The weed was always going to die.  That was it's fate.    Even with prescience, Muad'dib struggled with the difficulty of creating something lasting."
dune,2oq055,MetricLemur,5,Tue Dec 9 19:39:46 2014 UTC,"I never saw the weed as a symbol itself, rather I thought it was an enigmatic explanation of Paul's powers. He chose to do a insignificant task, and then it shows that fate can be absurd - try to do a good thing, a bad thing will still happen. Even by moving the rock, Paul knew he was going to cover it later.  Sort of a koan."
dune,2oq055,verbalineage,6,Tue Dec 9 21:35:04 2014 UTC,"There is the question in the books that is brought up over and over again: ""do the prescient see the future or create it?""  Paul is fate."
dune,2oq055,Treejay,4,Tue Dec 9 22:48:27 2014 UTC,"I saw this as Paul's commentary on prescience and intervention in personal ""destiny.""  After the Muad'Dib trilogy Herbert really starts to pull apart the trap that is playing with time and causality especially in regards to the Golden Path.  The Weed had grown between the rocks.  The rocks were it's fate.  Paul let it flourish for a time but noone can change their inevitable fate."
dune,2oq055,Jaydubya05,7,Wed Dec 10 02:40:09 2014 UTC,"""It is said of Muad'dib that once when he saw a weed trying to grow between two rocks, he moved one of the rocks. Later, when the weed was seen to be flourishing, he covered it with the remaining rock. ""That was its fate,"" he explained."" - The Commentaries.    I think this illustrates how even Paul's most minor actions were scrutinized by those around him. The phrasing ""it is said"" indicates that this may be a myth created by his followers to explain something.   It is said that Jesus' followers were left without a leader and confused at the loss of their messiah. Stories and sayings were passed around that were the basis for the gospels.   That's what I think this illustrates."
dune,2oq055,InconsiderateBastard,2,Tue Dec 9 19:34:26 2014 UTC,"Maybe just Paul playing with the idea of the Golden Path, he saw a weed that was gonna die, saved it, then killed it, because everything needs to stay on that path, he just wanted to see what happened if he changed things a bit."
dune,2oq055,Realik,2,Tue Dec 9 21:53:04 2014 UTC,"It has been a long time since I read the series, so I might be forgetting things that show this to be completely wrong, but is it possible the first rock removed symbolized humanity's entrance onto the Golden Path?  If so, the second rock being placed back again could symbolize the futility of even those monumental efforts."

You could have the sisters find some machines parts, and build up the threat that machines will cause, when they finally show up.  -Hunters of Dune reveals that the Honred Matres got their violent tendencies from grouping with Bene Tleilax females. So you could write about how Kara adapts to their ways, and focuses their anger to lead them.  -You could reveal that the Navigators Guild has pushed explorers out into the territory, and set up research labs using machines and slaves in order to produce their own spice so that they don't need to rely on Arrakis.  -Remember that with the Water of Life, Reverend Mothers could communicate with their past relatives by exploring their own DNA.  So you could use that trick to get a few famous characters to make cameos in the story and offer their wisdom.  -Honored Matres need to mate.  Don't be afraid to add some lower caste males into the story, who are used as breeders, and have them plot and scheme too."

Just wanted to clear it up, I am not publishing this novel or anythig, just writing it for myself becausei love the duniverse. I wont use machines, but ultimate face dancers as the enemy is what I think frank was aiming for,  the son (who i will not name, he doesnt even deserve that) had no fucking notes from lord frank, he made that shit up, he brutally raped the series. I hate him."
dune,2oqpap,savepublicdomain,2,Thu Dec 11 01:17:38 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that his son had notes left by Frank.  He claimed to have them, and based Hunters and Sandworms around them.  I knew you wouldn't publish it.  Our copyright laws are very outdated and last too long.  (See my user name.)  Too bad Dune wasn't public domain, so that people other than his on could build the universe.    When you are done the story, make sure to link it here."

dune,2o7a5s,sandpet1,4,Thu Dec 4 00:22:01 2014 UTC,"Well, leaving aside that which ItFrightensMe said, I could offer a possible example from pottery (one of my hobbies).  Free water boils off at 100 degrees C (obviously), but there is also a point at which all water chemically bound to molecules separates from those molecules and they become anhydrous - with ceramics, depending on the chemical make up, this is usually achieved at around 500C.  So imagine a closed chamber that gradually heats up the body, first removing the free water from the body, then as it gets hotter removing the bound water.  Both of these vapours can then be reclaimed through normal condensing processes."

And it comes from a far way desert land with strange fauna and flora (btw,do the Little Makers count as both?), like oil. Or at least it did at the time of writing of Dune.

For instance, the original Dune is about the dangers of a hero. It seems highly unlikely that Frank would end the series by creating what amounts to a super hero out of a main character. Then if you throw in the fact that the last chapter of book 8 is, what, three deus ex machina endings? And that the last two books completely change the identity of Daniel and Marty from face dancers (literally the last paragraph of Chapterhouse) to robot overlords that werent mentioned, or even hinted at, anywhere in the original works. Things just dont really match up very well.   Does that mean that you shouldn't enjoy Brian's books? Of course not.

dune,2mxvuh,IMPIRUSH,21,Fri Nov 21 02:00:11 2014 UTC,"THIS ENTIRE POST IS A MAJOR SPOILER SO DON'T READ IT!  I think you're missing some major plot elements. Paul was an imperfect Kwisatz Haderach, and the near end product of a Bene Gesserit human breeding program. The Bene Gesserit ideal Kwisatz Haderach was to be a male equivalent to a Reverend Mother with prescient powers. Prescience is the ability to see into the future. To be able to see the consequences of choices, actions, and events on the small and large scale, in the near and long term. Paul did meet these qualifications, but his visions were imperfect, and he was born a generation early. There were future events and possibilities which Paul was unable to see, or see beyond, and he was blind to others possessing even minor prescient abilities (Guild Navigators). Paul's mother, Jessica, was also under orders from the Bene Gesserit to bare only daughters to Leto Atreides. Their plan was to breed a daughter of House Atreides produced by Jessica (the unknown daughter of Barron Harkononnen) with one of Barron Harkonnen's nephews to produce their intended Kwisatz Haderach. The Bene Gesserit would then control this Kwisatz Haderach, and be the hidden hand behind the thrown once he became Emperor. They also intended to end the feud between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen through a marriage they would arrange. Jessica fell in love with Leto, and out of that love disobeyed her orders about only producing daughters to intentionally have Paul. Being able to choose the gender of the child is one of those Bene Gesserit abilities that they all know how to do (without being a Reverend Mother). In addition to this, Paul's parents, unknown to him, were putting him through the childhood stages of Mentat training. Jessica also taught Paul some Bene Gesserit secrets that males weren't supposed to know. Then the whole Arrakis debacle happened, and the Bene Gesserit lost control of the situation. The Bene Gesserit didn't know that Paul was a Kwisatz Haderach before House Atreides left for Arrakis. Paul hadn't awakened to his abilities, and might never have if he hadn't gone to Arrakis. Once there, he was saturated in Melange. It was in flipping everything. This caused his body to build up a tolerance to it, and caused him to start having prescient visions. His Mentat training allowed him to retain the knowledge that the visions imparted on his mind, and allowed him to choose the future where he became Muad'Dib. This was more of a survival choice than prescient guidance, however. The Bene Gesserit had been sending people to Arrakis to preach religious ideologies for a long time, and the local populations were primed for a messiah figure to rise to a position of leadership. House Atreides knew this when they arrived on Arrakis, and Leto had suggested exploiting this existing trait of Arrakeen society as a means of survival to Paul. Paul's prescient visions, along with Jessica's training, allowed him to pull it off. Now, as far as the Jihad is concerned, that's Paul's Hobson's choice. Paul's visions are imperfect. He can see that a Jihad is coming in the future, and initially tries to steer humanity on a path away from it. He tries to avoid the Jihad. Paul had been searching for a future path where the Jihad could be avoided, but couldn't see various paths he could take, or the consequences of certain decisions. After he survived the spice agony his visions gained some clarity, and he was able to see that avoiding the Jihad was impossible without leading to a human extinction event. He was able to see beyond the Jihad. Paul came to understand that the Jihad wasn't simply unavoidable, but necessary in order to prevent humanity from going extinct. From there, Paul understood that the only thing he could do would be to limit the damage, and hope to teach humanity the dangerous folly of succumbing to the authority of charismatic leadership. If he decides to uphold the Atreides tradition of respectable leadership then he'll be loved by the people, but the Jihad will still happen, be a lot worse, and humanity will continue down the path to stagnation and eventual extinction. If he decides to play himself up as a religious icon he can seize control of the situation in order to play up the horror, and destructiveness, of the Jihad while actually working to limit the damage by bringing the conflict to a more timely conclusion, and hoping to teach humanity how foolish it is to be enamored by charisma."
dune,2mxvuh,RedMushtoom,14,Fri Nov 21 03:18:11 2014 UTC,"I agree with everything, except the part about Paul being an imperfect K.H.   He wasn't on the timeline the B.G. expected, but he was who they were planning for. They just didn't realize what he would actually be when he arrived.  They couldn't control him, because the K.H. was never going to be able to be controlled.   Jessica disobeyed the Sisters when she was told to bear a girl, partially to give her Duke a son, but also because all of her training and all of the Sisters within her told her that a son of hers would be the K.H.  And the Reverend Mother drops a huge hint when she tests him with the gom jabbar and recognizes that she has pushed him harder than any other male.  The reason his foresight was limited was because it was unlimited. When he looked down a path, all he could see were the zillions of threads leading out from that moment based on different choices and tiny occurrences. So there was no real future to gaze at, just a muddle of constantly changing possibilities. The only thing he could see for sure was the Jihad, because it was at the end of every thread.  But you're right, when he saw the Jihad coming, it was terrible, but if humanity could be guided through it worse things could be avoided."
dune,2mxvuh,iridiumtiara,6,Fri Nov 21 04:25:21 2014 UTC,"Paul's prescience was actually more limited, and that's where the analogies about being unable to see the spaces between dunes comes from. Paul's able to see the top of the ""dunes"" of time, but blind to large areas in between. The low areas.  Leto II's prescience is more powerful, and what he sought in The Golden Path was to take humanity into the areas he could not see. Leto II's prescience was so complete that his existence was ultimately boring because he had foreseen nearly every possible alternate future that could exist. This is why he took such enjoyment from the few surprises in his life. They were the rare, treasured, moments of his existence where he did not know exactly what was going to happen, the few times where his prescience failed him."

But if that was all you knew about Dune, you'd finish and still not really know anything about what makes Dune important. A lot of that stuff was represented, but it was just garble if you didn't already know what it was meant to be.  I really appreciate some of the visual effects. They did a great job on the stillsuits, and many of the interiors, and I thought it was novel how they showed the Guild Navigator. I wasn't so sure about the Reverend Mothers being bald, but maybe I just missed that somewhere in the books?  The desert was gorgeous, absolutely how I had pictured Arrakis. And they did an amazing job on the sandworms, given the tools available at the time.  I think if Lynch had gotten 6 hours, he could have done the story quite well. He seemed to have a handle on it. The people with the money didn't, and that's usually who gets to make decisions."

dune,2mxvuh,trolls_toll,2,Fri Nov 28 06:24:29 2014 UTC,"SPOILERS FROM SUBSEQUENT BOOK While we're on the topic, one thing I never understood exactly was the difference between Paul's and Leto II's prescience.  While I think the books do the right thing stylistically in obfuscating the exact nature of prescience, it always bugged me a little that I couldn't fully piece together this difference.  Sometimes I got the idea that there was some significant difference in what timelines and possibilities the two saw looking forward (i.e. something along the lines that Paul wasn't able to disentangle himself from the myriad possibilities, while Leto II could pick a point/state of events in the future and see a clear path back, though the two options never seemed mutually exclusive to me), while other times the book seemed to imply that they saw the same thing (which makes more sense to me instinctivelly), but Paul wasn't willing to put on the trout armour for some reason (which doesn't make too much sense to me as the moral difference between accepting to head the Jihad and the 4000-odd year reign doesn't seem to be that significant).  Anyone have any thoughts that could clear this up for me?  Cheers."
dune,2mxvuh,loyalpeon,3,Fri Nov 21 10:29:08 2014 UTC,"The difference was in the degree of the prescience, and how they came to posses it. Paul's prescience was awakened in him through exposure to melange. Leto II's prescience was inherent from his initial moments of self-awareness while developing in the womb. He was preborn without having survived/suffered the agony, and the associated psychological trauma. Paul did catch glimpses of The Golden Path, but only enough to know that it could exist. He was able to see that a path existed, but didn't know where it went, or how to guide humanity down it. Leto II had much more powerful prescience, and had a clear vision of The Golden Path. Paul's visions were foggy, where Leto II's were painfully clear. Paul caught a glimpse of the sandtrout skin, but was unwilling to make the sacrifice of his humanity which would have been required to put it on, and tried to find a path around it."
dune,2mxvuh,RedMushtoom,2,Fri Nov 21 15:10:00 2014 UTC,Part of Paul's struggle with taking Leto II's golden path was Chani. He had to make decisions that controlled the jihad and protected Chani.
dune,2mxvuh,OneMoreDuncanIdaho,3,Fri Nov 21 21:41:19 2014 UTC,"That's pretty much how I saw it too. I think Paul knew that letting Chani have the baby (he didn't see one of them) would kill her, but not having them would result in the extinction event, due to there not being anyone with the prescience to make the Golden Path happen. Paul had too much Atreides righteousness in him to make the selfish choice and keep Chani, but I dont think he could live for 3,500 years knowing he could have saved her, and didn't. I mean, he left his children and his empire at what was arguably the time both needed him most, due largely to his grief over Chani's death. A death he knew was coming and couldn't avoid."
dune,2mxvuh,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,1 point,Mon Nov 24 23:14:23 2014 UTC,"I think it had more to do with when they respectively became a KH.  Paul only became a full KH and thus obtained full prescient abilities when he went through the ceremony with the water of life.  Leto II on the other-hand was prescient and had genetic memories available from the very beginning.  I think Paul and Leto II both saw the same possible futures, but because Paul developed his abilities much later in life, he was unable to undergoe the self-sacrifice of becoming what Leto II later became, and thus enabling the Golden Path that humanity had to follow in order to survive.  He saw the beginning of the Golden Path, the jihad, and started humanity down that pathway towards survival, but was unable or unwilling to sacrifice himself in order to continue down that path.  Leto II knew nothing else but prescience and genetic memory, because of this his ego was not in the way when he had to make the decision to undergo the transformation that would enable him to guide humanity down the Golden path."

dune,2mxvuh,toxicasshole,5,Fri Nov 21 23:17:18 2014 UTC,"One other way to look at this jihad business is to see it as the catastrophic failure of the old imperium.  If you look at the world as it is when Paul is on Caladan, you have a baroque system of institutions that work together to keep a stagnant, zero-growth empire together. You have limited trade and limited warfare, a de facto gold standard in the form of spice which just happens to also be a vital consumable resource and the Sardaukar to scare everyone straight. Houses may well rise and fall but at the macro level there's been nothing new for 10,000 years.  Enter the Arrakis plot. House Harkonnen and House Corrino conspire to destroy, or at least set back House Atreides. Fair enough, that's politics as usual. This involves using Arrakis, the one productive place in the Empire as bait. As far as the established order is concerned, it's a hellish place that exists only to be mined for spice. Neither the Arrakeen environment nor the Fremen natives figure in the strategic planning of these Houses (or indeed the Guild who's also in on it).  House Atreides sees the trap but goes for the bait anyway. Early contact between the Atreides administration and the natives goes fairly well. That lovable rogue Duncan Idaho even manages to build a rapport with ""real"" desert Fremen, including a tribal leader.  Anyway, some time later the trap is sprung and Arrakeen is attacked by Harkonnen/Sardaukar troops while Doc Yueh betrays his duke. It's a complete disaster for House Atreides except that Jessica and Paul manage to escape.  There's a bit of high adventure in the book at this point. Anyway, it turns out that there is a MASSIVE resonance between Paul, the Fremen and even the planet itself.  That's where the Jihad begins. Arrakis was the keystone of the old world order. It produced spice and spice preserved the statu quo. Now all of a sudden, the natives are no longer content to just bide their time and wait for their terraforming project to come to fruition. They've rallied behind a messiah who's determined to take Arrakis back. And so they do. Arrakeen is eventually captured by Paul's Fremen insurgents and that's the tipping point.  There is no way Paul could have stopped the Jihad from spreading once the Shield was breached. When the final battle is over, House Corrino has capitulated before the Fremen insurgents who have also taken control of spice production. Paul is their leader, but they really are just a mob of fanatics. Paul just couldn't have told them to go home and let him be the new Padishah. And besides, doing nothing would have caused everyone not on Arrakis to band together to contain the Fremen/Atreides threat to the established order. So on and on the holy war goes, from planet to planet. ""A terrible beauty is born"".  Everyone involved loses something of themselves in the process of that jihad. Fremen lose their Arrakeen way on water-rich worlds, Paul loses any hope of being a just ruler by being forced to be an absolute despot, countless people lose their lives and even Arrakis itself loses its climate."

But it isn't clear, and the only thing he can see is that the Jihad is coming. It's already in the mail, and he can't find a pathway ahead that doesn't lead to it.  His musings aren't about how the Jihad is a good thing that needs to happen, he's trying to find a way to spare humanity from what's coming."

They planned on acquiring genes until they could ensure that they'd have one under their control.  The kwisatz haderach can see into the future. The Bene Gesserit live to ensure that humanity must survive and continually strengthen itself.   Paul's Jihad is a necessity because of what Paul learns from becoming a kwisatz haderach. He requires complete control over humanity. I'm not sure where you got that the Jihad is for breeding purposes.

dune,2n0ixr,xylon,1 point,Sat Nov 22 11:34:04 2014 UTC,"The Machine Stops:       ""The Machine Stops"" is a science fiction short story (12,300 words) by E. M. Forster. After initial publication in The Oxford and Cambridge Review (November 1909), the story was republished in Forster's The Eternal Moment and Other Stories in 1928. After being voted one of the best novellas up to 1965, it was included that same year in the populist anthology Modern Short Stories.  In 1973 it was also included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two. The story is particularly notable for predicting new technologies such as instant messaging and the Internet.

I have watched it after finishing the books so I enjoyed it very much. The dune ""feel"" was there.   But for the unfamiliar audience who doesn't know anything about Dune, it may seem as absolute incoherent shit."
dune,2m9sv5,dormeur,4,Fri Nov 14 14:22:10 2014 UTC,It is true that no amount of post-release doctoring is going to make Lynch's Dune more accessible.  Spicediver's edit does help by making the film at least somewhat comprehensible in areas where the theatrical cut left audiences dumbfounded.
dune,2m9sv5,maxximillian,2,Fri Nov 14 15:36:49 2014 UTC,I don't know. I remember watching it with my dad a few times before I read the books. We both liked it. I didn't read the books till years later.

The guy think to much of himself and he would have probably made good but not a masterpiece
dune,2m9sv5,ginbear,8,Fri Nov 14 22:06:00 2014 UTC,"Glad you took out the time to watch it. It really is the best cut of this movie, by far. For what that's worth. Used to be if I wanted a film Dune fix, I went with the SciFi series, but Spicediver has made the movie ""good enough"" for me to watch. Some of his changes were brilliant, like dividing the story into ""books,"" the once-deleted sayyadhina scene at the beginning, no rain at the end, etc. And although I still wish Spicediver had edited out heart plugs and cat-milking, that would have required that Thufir basically disappear from the second half of the movie, and I think adding his deleted death scene was one of the big things Spicediver wanted to do. Still, I may go back in my own copy and take them out - technically, they are pretty simple to cut and aren't really integral to the film (unlike weirding modules.)  This isn't a great movie, but I think Spicediver has made it watchable and coherent - one of the best fan edits I've seen. They say you can't polish a turd, but it turns out dorodungo works pretty well."
dune,2m9sv5,hellequin,1 point,Fri Nov 14 16:22:52 2014 UTC,Don't you think that the heart-plugs and cat-milking are enjoyable embellishments that help to create a more bizarre and dissonant context for the story? I quite like them. They emphasize the fiendishly creative cruelty of the Harkonnens.

dune,2m9sv5,rebelspyder,2,Fri Nov 14 17:16:34 2014 UTC,"I do think nostalgia plays a strong role in my feelings toward the film.  It was my first exposure to Dune in any form, and though I came away from the film feeling confused and a little angry at what I thought was a bait and switch — ""Where's my Star Wars?"" — over the years it's definitely been an itch that occasionally must be scratched.  If you haven't seen Spicediver's fan-edit, you need to.  If you already have a fondness for the film, this will make you like it even more."

dune,2m6phd,Psyladine,8,Thu Nov 13 16:22:23 2014 UTC,"They wanted to keep his genes, and they also felt he might have been a Kwisatz Haderach so attempting to kill him might not have worked.   They didn't want to waste a potential Kwisatz Haderach."
dune,2m6phd,letsgocrazy,5,Thu Nov 13 16:54:20 2014 UTC,"Yes, but, eh, it's hard. They told Jessica she was going to lose Leto (I believe partially out of revenge). She basically set the program back a generation, it seems a stretch that they could expect to control a radical possible-Kwisatz (Mohiam told Paul as much), especially one who's mother made an emotional decision in defiance of the order.  They could have killed Paul as an infant and ordered a daughter, for example. Or ordered a daughter, period, and have that child wed to Sting Feyd to continue their work.  It was unlikely that such a cabal of conspirators would make such a glaring error, but I guess that's why Frank started the book there, if the fridge logic didn't catch the reader, then they could swallow the rest of the book."
dune,2m6phd,Psyladine,4,Thu Nov 13 17:15:24 2014 UTC,"I still don't see why they would be insistent on killing him.  The Kwisatz Haderach was always going to be difficult to control or manage. It's not like they could have emotionally manipulated him from childhood to do what they wanted But will he be ours to control?  He was the Kwisatz Haderach, he was always going to be aware and independent. He would have had other memories.  He was either the Kwisatz Haderach or not - and if he wasn't he would have died taking the water of life, or not, and would have been exactly what they wanted him to be.  He was.  He just happened to transcend their vision for what he would achieve."
dune,2m6phd,letsgocrazy,5,Thu Nov 13 18:44:47 2014 UTC,"For the same reason they wanted to kill Alia, the abomination; it was beyond their control.  Mohiam even says to Paul, ""I must have wanted you to fail."" They wanted to remove him as a potential obstacle. He wasn't neutered like Fenring, he was to be the scion of a genetic line that would control history, under the thumb of 'scheming jesuits' in Herbert's own words.   It's obvious that Paul needed to live or there wouldn't be a book, but there is no reason whatsoever he couldn't have had a younger sister to marry Feyd, or for that matter Mohiam forcing an early marriage of Paul to ensure that his child would be of age with Feyd and Margo's.  She says something to the effect, recognizing that Leto and crew are going to die, losing that genetic history as a result of Jessica's folly. Leaving Paul to live was just careless, callous and stupid. ESPECIALLY with his mentat training. Yes, they couldn't see the future, only the past (and the guild navigators the future, bleh bleh bleh), but it was pretty freaking obvious that a house war with nukes was not going to go over well on the ONLY KNOWN SOURCE OF MELANGE IN THE UNIVERSE."
dune,2m6phd,Psyladine,8,Thu Nov 13 18:53:11 2014 UTC,"For the same reason they wanted to kill Alia, the abomination; it was beyond their control.   Paul wasn't an abomination. And abomination is beyond their own control - they have been taken over from the inside at birth and never developed their own personalities.  That was not the case with Paul.  There was always going to be risk creating the Kwisazt Haderach - the Bene Gesserit hoped they could control him - but the situation for Paul was the same as anyone else.   Mohiam even says to Paul, ""I must have wanted you to fail.""   Out of Schadenfreude for Jessica. the sisterhood was angry at Jassica for disobeying them.  It just feels like you don't grok the idea that he was either the Kwisatz Haderach or not. He was.   It's obvious that Paul needed to live or there wouldn't be a book, but there is no reason whatsoever he couldn't have had a younger sister to marry Feyd, or for that matter Mohiam forcing an early marriage of Paul to ensure that his child would be of age with Feyd and Margo's.   Yes, and that may well have happened - except Jessica had a son, not a daughter, and so the Harkonnens would not or could not wait to marry off Feyd.  Frankly, Duke Leto would never have allowed it anyway. The Sisterhood can manipulate and cajole - but at the end of the day Duke Leto could have given the Duke Veto.   She says something to the effect, recognizing that Leto and crew are going to die, losing that genetic history as a result of Jessica's folly.    this has nothing to do with    Leaving Paul to live was just careless, callous and stupid. ESPECIALLY with his mentat training.    this.  Jessica made a mistake out of love - that is the point of the story.  The Bene Gesserit had to go along with it.  If Paul had not been a Kwisatz Haderach he would not have been a threat to the Bene Gesserit at all - so there would be no need to piss everyone off - even the Emperor - for no real gain.  If he was the Kwisatz Haderach he was exactly what they had been training for.  The Bene Gesserit plan was flawed as they did not understand (could not understand) what a huge game changer the Kwisatz Haderach was.  In fact, pretty much all of God Emperor is Leto II lecturing them for being thick and naive.  You keep saying they should have killed him but I don't see what that would have achieved. They were always goign to have issues controlling a Kwisatz Haderach - Jassica trained him in their ways and when Mohiam say Paul she had hopes he could be the one. That's what they wanted. He is what they wanted.  It's like I've saved up for a Transformers toy all year and then my dad gets the wrong parking space at Toys R Us. I'm not going to abandon my toy just because of some piddling details.  Ending the Harkonnen fued was peanuts compared to what the KH was supposed to achieve.  The Bene Gesserit would have also been well aware that not only did they have bad blood with the Harkonnen (literally) - but offspring from them could have been ten times as worse than Paul.  Who would you rather have as a KH? some nephew of the most perverse man in the known universe, or the grandson of Leto the Just and the Lady Jessica.  In every way shape and form Paul would have been a preferable choice."
dune,2m6phd,letsgocrazy,3,Thu Nov 13 19:09:52 2014 UTC,"I think another thing to add to that is that the Bene Geserit understand that love and hate are opposite sides of the same coin. Jessica had a son because of her love for Leto. If Paul were to die and Jessica learned the sisterhood had been involved, I think she would hate them, not just because Paul was her son, but because of the pain it would put Leto through. What are the chances of her conceiving a daughter for them then? Not much."
dune,2m6phd,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,2,Fri Nov 14 04:09:11 2014 UTC,Exactly. I think everyone would have been pissed off.   The Bene Gesserit are far too subtle for murdering a Duke's son over something we haven't established as even being necessary to them.   They can't get far if no royal family can trust them.

dune,2m7ttm,Redfan45x,15,Thu Nov 13 21:10:49 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, gods yes, especially because the books are so vastly different in their focus.  Dune is very much action-adventure, as you may have noticed.  Messiah and Children is more about political games around the main characters. Oooh, the plots!  God-Emperor continues with social commentary and lamentations. It's a very polarizing book. Some really appreciate living along with and getting a deeper understanding of the title character, who is a tyrant externally but is sacrificing and suffering internally. And some really don't give a crap about all that whinging.  Chapterhouse and Heretics just flip the whole story upside down and follow the struggles of the Bene Gesserit as they face mankind reshapen.  It's quite a bizarre collection of books like that, but I liken it to having a large, varied feast. Is the first course just as good? Yeah, it is. But don't expect it to be the same."
dune,2m7ttm,TheFlyingBastard,4,Thu Nov 13 21:47:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I think you've easily convinced me to continue this series.

Then I moved on to other stuff, re-read Messiah and Children. Then I re-read Dune...  I think I've read the first book 7 or 8 times now, and Children only twice.

It reminds me of Dune in the sense where he is destined to become a sort of Galactic-Emperor God as well.  The 2nd book (the last one I finished) has more happening and you become a lot more aware of the setting and get a feeling of what could be coming up"
dune,2m7ttm,MortRouge,6,Fri Nov 14 02:52:13 2014 UTC,"Dune is about heroes and messiahs being inherently destabilizing forces for the societies they ""save"". Even though I think Dune is the best single novel of the series, DM and CoD are really essential to see that whole trajectory."
dune,2m7ttm,lobotomatic,6,Fri Nov 14 01:43:09 2014 UTC,"You might be startled by the change of style in Messiah. People often cite it as their least favourite - but I think people should just give it another chance (I continued to read because of it). Reading the first book might give you expectations. Herbert rather continues with the more cerebral and philosophical parts of the first one, it is the most depressing book in the series. The series takes a much more somber and serious tone, until Chapterhouse (which isn't a bad book at all on its own merits - and certainly not jolly either)."
dune,2m7ttm,OneMoreDuncanIdaho,3,Fri Nov 14 01:59:48 2014 UTC,"Definitely yes, though for me personally everything after God Emperor was not that good. Some may disagree."
dune,2m7ttm,SmlHwkn,2,Thu Nov 13 21:13:19 2014 UTC,"YES, at least the first three if just to complete the story. Dune is so much better when you see where Frank Herbert was going with the story. And the first six books are just fucking awesome too."
dune,2m7ttm,IWankYouWonk,2,Thu Nov 13 21:42:27 2014 UTC,"Let me add my voice to the chorus of yeses.  After Dune, my personal favorite is Dune Messiah, which reads like extra chapters of the first book.  So if you like the first book, you're in for a treat.  Though to be fair the going does get a bit rougher as the series continues and the weirdness factor ramps up.  That doesn't mean they're bad by any means.  Just different."

dune,2m3im1,burt_flaxton,8,Wed Nov 12 18:52:14 2014 UTC,I assume you are only given a sietch name if you are a non-native Freman male. Liet's father was not originally a Freman and that could be the reason he was given one.

""Their women are as fierce as the men."" Yueh says, so I guess the empire at lrge is not particularly feministic. I don't think Frank was either, to tell the truth...  Anyway, I would not be surprised if sietch-names are for males only."
dune,2m3im1,apjak,3,Wed Nov 12 19:57:37 2014 UTC,"As far as the multiple wives thing, it is explicitly stated in the books that it was instituted/justified as a means for identifying 'male infertility' rather than abject misogyny."

dune,2m3im1,apjak,1 point,Fri Nov 14 03:48:01 2014 UTC,"It is.  It follows from several Semitic traditions that Frank Herbert was more than aware of.  For Example: in the Old Testament case of Onan, he was supposed to father a son on his sister-in-law for his dead brother, so that she'd have someone to take care of her, and the child would inherit the dead brother's property.  Onan was greedy and used the pull-out method instead, then somehow ""Onanism"" became synonymous with 'self-abuse'."

The Dune Encyclopedia says that his troop name, ""used only by his comrades at Umbu Sietch, is thought to have been Sahkan - the Fremen name for a type of desert hawk - but verification on this point is difficult to obtain. The evidence found thus far consists of a reference made by a man from that sietch who accompanied Stilgar on jihad."""
dune,2m3im1,toxicasshole,1 point,Thu Nov 13 06:57:51 2014 UTC,"This is pure speculation (how could it not be?) but I see it as an in-group thing. Jessica never truly went native, never joined the tribe.  I think it's implicit in the books that you've got tribal Fremen society on the one hand and Arrakeen society on the other. The former ride worms, live in sietches, take part in Spice orgies and have secret tribal names, including I think their women. The latter deal with outsiders, live in cities and are ritually unclean although they may be ethnic Fremen. The Shadout Mapes strikes me as a good example of an Arrakeen Fremen. If she was born to this life, then I suspect she wouldn't have a sietch name.  Jessica was probably too old/too holy to be anything other than a foreign Sayyadina. In general, I think joining a Fremen tribe has to be done before puberty - Paul's case was surely borderline and he wouldn't have been accepted if he hadn't killed Harah's husband. I don't think Uliet ever got a sietch name either."

Paul is reborn and grows as Muad'dib of Arrakis rather than his old character of Paul of Caladan. I'm fairly certain it's some character development marked by titles. Jessica remains herself as she is an adult, but Paul the child grows into Muad'dib the man."

dune,2li1k5,rclowery624,36,Thu Nov 6 19:07:08 2014 UTC,"I think the cheap answer is that Paul presumably would have knowledge of that future and knew it didn't lead to the Golden Path and spare humanity from extermination.  If he destroyed the spice, it would have separated the old empire, but not as a scattering beyond the reach of those that would destroy humanity, but rather into already known locations. Humanity would be locked in place, vulnerable. The first to develop non-guild travel, which eventually happened, would hold tremendous power over the rest of humanity. And if that was, say, the Tlielaxu, then what? Further, destroying the spice would sacrifice the only leverage the Atriedes had to rule, and prevented Leto II, or any Atriedes, from being able to ultimately implement the Golden Path."
dune,2li1k5,ginbear,4,Thu Nov 6 19:54:00 2014 UTC,"Yes, this is a very good point. I think this clarifies the issue."
dune,2li1k5,lagatag,4,Thu Nov 6 20:07:31 2014 UTC,"Paul's real issue is that he can't accept the Golden Path.  The Golden Path is the only option for humanity to survive (Paul and Leto II both see the same future as the only one that humanity survives, so its a safe bet unless you think FH had a real curveball planned for a hypothetical book 7 that would undo basically his entire series to that point).  Destroying the spice ensures humanity will die out.  Paul is basically just trying to buy more time to find a new way, and he actively chooses the Jihad over the Golden Path to gain that time."
dune,2li1k5,SomeNiceButtfucking,5,Fri Nov 7 01:29:30 2014 UTC,Doesn't the first book make it clear that spice is an addiction that will kill you if try to quit?
dune,2li1k5,alkonium,6,Fri Nov 7 06:27:02 2014 UTC,"On the contrary, destroying the spice would make everything worse for everyone.  The Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe because virtually everything in the Imperium depends on it."
dune,2li1k5,kengou,3,Fri Nov 7 00:29:35 2014 UTC,"It might solve problems for Paul himself, but the entire imperium of humanity would basically be destroyed.  That's a heavy price to pay, and he wasn't prepared to pay it.  Messiah and Children proved that Paul really wasn't prepared to take such large steps - he needed Leto II."
dune,2li1k5,dmalexa,2,Fri Nov 7 16:31:55 2014 UTC,"Paul was in it for revenge. Everything. He looked into the future at first just to hit the imperium and harkonenn back hard. But then he saw extinction etc and knew the vitality jihad would bring humanity, a little more time, by the time he really knew what was up he couldn't do it, knew his kid could, the rest was buying time and setting the stage/ clearing the slate for the Tyrant"
dune,2li1k5,MoRackley,1 point,Fri Nov 7 14:38:47 2014 UTC,"I haven't finished Children of Dune yet, but I feel like what Paul said to the Guildsmen at the end of the first book was an empty threat. When he tells them that the power to destroy a thing is the ultimate power over that thing it feels like a bluff. I don't think I've read far enough to be taken seriously but I was under the impression so far that Paul is definitely a spice addict."
dune,2li1k5,soylentblueissmurfs,3,Fri Nov 7 02:16:58 2014 UTC,He was definitely prepared to go out with the spice. The navigators could see him destroying the spice as a possible future even with their limited prescience.
dune,2li1k5,minuscatenary,1 point,Fri Nov 7 02:49:51 2014 UTC,"He does slowly destroy it though; well, him along with Leto II. That was the point of terraforming Dune: To wean the Empire off of spice while also allowing for the development of Ixian navigating machines and to force the Tleilaxu to come up with a subsitute.  Paul hates the idea of blood in his hands. And that's what the Golden Path required. His Jihad was small compared to what Leto ended up doing as the Tyrant. Leto II understood that he'd have to kill billions just to assure that humanity would survive. He doesn't take it lightly though, hence my favorite favorite line about him running until he is exhausted and then resting his head on Ghanima's lap."
dune,2li1k5,scumbagbrianherbert,0,Tue Nov 25 18:32:31 2014 UTC,"Perhaps. It'd also make him the most selfish prick in the history of the universe and no kind of protagonist that anyone would want to read about... but yeah, it might have made his own, personal life a little easier.  That said, the only reason he ever gained the power to destroy the spice was because he was the type of person who wouldn't destroy the spice. No selfish coward is going to end up ducal heir and legitimate leader of the Fremen at the same time."
dune,2li1k5,Realik,1 point,Thu Nov 6 19:22:44 2014 UTC,"I see your point, but Paul spends a good bit of the novel preoccupied with preventing a jihad that will kill millions (billions) of people. It was always my understanding that he goes along with the jihad because he views it as an opportunity to prevent human civilization from stagnating, and therefore dying. Destroying the spice would accomplish something similar, although not necessarily the same."
dune,2leide,XavierMcDonalds,1 point,Wed Nov 5 20:46:48 2014 UTC,"Personally I can't listen to music while reading as it distracts me from getting into my book. I would argue listening to anything with lyrics may distract you from some of the meaning in Dune since it's regarded as a heavier novel. Maybe some traditional classical like Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, etc. I would suggest instrumental over lyrics."
dune,2l9vte,TonytheFish,13,Tue Nov 4 16:44:35 2014 UTC,"Dune and Foundation serve as two parts of my holy trinity of sci-fi. I definitely saw the similarities between Leto's Golden Path and the death/rebirth of an empire in Foundation.  Have you read the Robot/Empire series as well? They definitely enrich the idea of a rebirth from stagnation found in Foundation. With those two earlier series, you can see on a grand scale, grander than Leto's timeline, the cyclic nature of civilization and constantly going through the trials of ensuring that humanity finds a way."
dune,2l9vte,book1245,7,Tue Nov 4 16:56:32 2014 UTC,Dune and Foundation serve as two parts of my holy trinity of sci-fi.   What is the third member of your holy trinity?
dune,2l9vte,mpierre,12,Tue Nov 4 18:17:24 2014 UTC,"Barsoom. Huge contrast in tone and writing yes, but its legacy is undeniable, plus it's nice to have a fun series compared to the serious sprawling epics of Dune and Foundation."
dune,2l9vte,book1245,6,Tue Nov 4 18:34:39 2014 UTC,"I'm totally in agreement with you on your holy trinity.  I'm incredibly glad that I've now read Foundation, much later than the other two.  I grew up with the Barsoom stories, and remember searching used book stores for copies.  I read all of Dune in college, and adored it, but Foundation failed to click for me.  It took me until my now-30s to really get in to Foundation and appreciate it.  I definitely see themes that are common between Foundation and Dune.  Now that I think about it, though, perhaps these themes also exist in Barsoom.  It is always on the edge of collapse from lack of oxygen, and religion is more of a tool than anything else.  Barsoom's scale is a little smaller, and there aren't so many wheels-within-wheels, but it's an entirely different style of writing, as well.  The prescience of Hari Seldon, attempting to protect humanity through the dark times, definitely feels a lot like Leto the God Emperor.  I'm reading Foundation in published order, though, and have gone from Foundation to Foundation and Earth, and have now wrapped around to Prelude to Foundation.  So, while Hari Seldon is losing his pseudo-godlike status, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if he regains some of that in this or the next prequel.  One contrast is that to me, Leto seemed fundamentally compelled towards the Golden Path by his prescience, while Hari Seldon, at least half-way through Prelude, is being pushed towards making psychohistory viable by an outside actor.  John Carter, on the other hand, is just a badass, and didn't really mean to turn Barsoom's religions on their head.  He just found himself there, much as he just happened to find his way to the atmosphere plant at a serendipitous time, so that he could later use what he knew to save the day.  There isn't an overarching view of the politics and societies of Barsoom in the same way that there is in Foundation and Dune, but now I'm curious what ERB might have written, if he had decided to approach Barsoom from a Dune/Foundation approach.  TL;DR:  Barsoom, Dune and Foundation are all amazing :)"

I haven't read much science fiction - my prejudices regarding the genre have turned me off.  I'm just now getting into it, but my interest lies in stories like Dune and Foundation - stories about human conflict, maybe from a different vantage point.  Stories about strange alien races that do magic or have inexplicable technology don't interest me.  The human condition is interesting enough for me. Can you recommend any good books?"
dune,2l9vte,book1245,2,Tue Nov 4 18:28:35 2014 UTC,"Since you say you've finished the first Foundation book, head next to ""Foundation and Empire"", followed by ""Second Foundation. This was the initial trilogy in Foundation, much like Dune/Messiah/Children was the Dune trilogy for some time.  The rest of the Foundation series expands on the technology, but it at its core it's still about the human struggle.  If you're willing to dive into the whole series, this is the order in which I read them, and it gave an amazing sense of scope.  Foundation  Foundation  Foundation and Empire  Second Foundation  Foundation's Edge  Foundation and Earth  Prelude to Foundation (Prequel to Foundation)  Forward the Foundation (Second Prequel to Foundation)  Robots  Robot Visions (or any compendium of his short Robot stories, like the well known I, Robot)  The Caves of Steel  The Naked Sun  The Robots of Dawn  Robots and Empire  Empire  The Stars, Like Dust  The Currents of Space  Pebble in the Sky  And then that all brings you back to Foundation. It's a huge commitment, but one I was thoroughly satisfied with when I reached the end of the Empire Series. Obviously with the title of one of the series being ""Robots"", there are non-human characters, but the entire sprawling story as a whole remains about the triumph of humanity."

There are things in Foundation and Earth and Prelude that directly have to do with things that happen in the Robot novels (which take place long before the Foundation novels).  If you want to read them in in-universe chronological order, read the Robot novels first, then the Empire novels, then the Foundation series.  The order within those groups is as he listed, but as he points out, Prelude and Forward come before the first Foundation book."

dune,2l9vte,felix_mateo,1 point,Tue Nov 4 21:13:47 2014 UTC,"The connection between Foundation and Robots is tenuous and only really exists, I believe, because Asimov wanted to wrap it all into one great universe as he was getting older.

dune,2l9vte,book1245,4,Wed Nov 5 04:32:48 2014 UTC,"An astute observation! I just finished God Emperor of Dune (4th Dune) and Foundation and Empire (2nd Foundation), and both series definitely encapsulate grand visions of a galactic empire.  Your note on Foundation being written in the 1950's struck me as well; Asimov's characters seem wooden and his plots one-dimensional compared to Herbert's, but their styles are different and the science fiction genre was still fledgling when Foundation was published. It's nice to go back and read the work of the giants upon whose shoulders modern writers stand."

Tell me something: one  criticism I have of Foundation is its repetitiveness - each section seemed to be a new generation with a new (but similar) problem that finds resolution and followed by another generational jump.  I understand the value of that structure, but it lacks excitement.  Does the next book continue in the same vein?"
dune,2l9vte,filpt,3,Tue Nov 4 18:36:06 2014 UTC,"I felt exactly the same way. Give Foundation and Empire a chance; it starts off slow, but it picks up steam in the second half and the ending is a nice surprise.

Also, it follows the same characters, so there is more continuity and less repetitiveness."

The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed are two of the earlier great books. If you want something outside a series The Lathe of Heaven is of course wonderful, but it also differs greatly from her other works, using the sci-fi plot to explore certain types of character traits rather than large scale politics."

dune,2l9vte,kamatsu,3,Wed Nov 5 01:39:30 2014 UTC,"I've always felt that Asimov writes in a more direct way which sometimes makes his work seem simpler and less complicated.  Make no mistake, however, he masterfully conveys his point with language that more people can grasp.  Herbert has more complex language and packs a lot more meaning in his words which makes it seem like he's building a more intricate world.  It might be that he is indeed weaving a much bigger narrative that depends a lot on the user to fill in the gaps but it doesn't, in my opinion, diminish what either of these authors have written.

dune,2kwjnz,PolarPopBear,11,Fri Oct 31 17:47:20 2014 UTC,"The ""Red Mars"" trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson! I just finished the entire FH Dune series for the first time and I just moved on to Red Mars.  It's incredibly detailed and well written.  The trilogy spans multiple centuries of humans first colonizing and then terraforming Mars.  Lots of political intrigue, investigations into how environments shape society, and even some strange desert-religion stuff later on.  Give it a shot!"
dune,2kwjnz,Trolliclitus,2,Fri Oct 31 18:00:16 2014 UTC,"I'll second this. The Mars Trilogy does, at times, remind one of Dune. Robinson is juggling a larger cast of characters and the scope of the series can make it hard to follow at times, but still a great series."
dune,2kwjnz,StevenRayOrr,9,Fri Oct 31 18:09:28 2014 UTC,"I'm right now at the middle of  the 4th book of Dan Simmon's Hyperion Cantos, in many ways it feels like i'm reading about the butlerian jihad, and in many ways like it's obviously not the same 'verse. I highly recommend it, it has similar levels of psicology and religions exploration as Dune's books had, if not more, and a modern kind of future technology.  Another good trilogy I found exceptionally good is Joan D. Vinge's The Snow Queen Cycle, the third of those books, The Summer Queen, has come to be one of my top 5 most favourite books of all time. Theres little similarity to Dune in this books tho, the main characters have a strange conection to a vast and powerful data center from the Old Empire that they can tap to and can respond to almost any question asked, they are similar to the cover story for the Foundation.  Talking about the Foundation, thats a great series as well, both trilogies, the first one and the second one, very different from each other though, the third trilogy by different authors than Asimov is pretty cool as well. Of course the Cycle of Trantor is not bad either. If you want to read a whole lot of books in the same universe, this ones are pretty consistent and don't contain a whoooole lot of plot holes, highly recommended.  I can keep going, but i guess this is the top 3 on my list right now."

In Dosadi it's more to do with gender and politics (big surprise) whereas D:V has this whole runaway feedback loop thing going, but either way the details felt a bit woolly to me.

More like the follow-ups after Dune couldn't deliver the same feel of awesomeness that the reader found in the first novel.

dune,2kuhrp,liu777,5,Fri Oct 31 07:20:39 2014 UTC,"Finally! I thought I was alone in this regard. To me, the original Dune novel is the one and only. Frank Herbert unleashed lightening from the bottle, each chapter, paragraph, sentence and phrase felt so full of meaning and nuance.  The rest of the books was like someone asking Herbert ""what happened after?"" and the resulting books simply did not have the same impact as the original. Herbert kept trying to top the original with bigger and badder concepts but the end results always felt flat compared to the masterpiece that was Dune."

Like Dr. Yueh leaving the still suits and signet ring in the exact same ornithopter the Harkonnens chose to leave Paul and Jessica in the dessert? And how did he leave he guard to do it? If I remember, Yueh just walked away from him. I think that faulty logic was there from the beginning.  I couldn't stand Messiah and Children, but I dug Emperor a lot. It was a departure from the other books. Still I like the heady direction it took. You might like Heretics and Chapterhouse since they are more in line with the original Dune."
dune,2kuhrp,felix_mateo,2,Fri Oct 31 11:36:17 2014 UTC,"A man (or woman) after my own heart. I first read Dune a couple of years ago and it instantly became my #1 favorite book. I was enamored with the universe and thirsted for more. The next 3 left me sorely disappointed.  Dune Messiah - I found this one to be the most interesting of the sequels, perhaps 80% of the greatness of Dune. I love seeing how Paul's religion got out of control, it's a great allegory for what we're seeing in real life.  Children of Dune - I found the premise interesting, but I honestly never felt like Leto and Ghanima were in any real danger. Still, there was a sense of adventure I appreciated.  God Emperor of Dune - Ugh. Leto's proselytizing put me to sleep time and time again. I know Herbert wanted his books to be heady and philosophical, but I feel like he really missed an opportunity to show rather than tell. The most interesting character, Siona, was put on the backburner for most of the story, and when she finally reappears she hasn't grown as a character. The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. Just all around snooze-inducing for me."
dune,2kuhrp,littlebill1138,2,Fri Oct 31 07:16:39 2014 UTC,"I don't know... for me the first three books really set up Duncan Idaho as being the real central (and tragic) character in the entire series, from Paul's love and admiration for this man from both afar and small glimpses, to Hayt/Duncan and on through to God Emperor as a stand-in surrogate for the reader who enters this new Dune universe with a very big, ""wait, what the hell just happened?"" perspective... all the while linking Leto II to the two separate trilogies.  That said, I think the rest of the books are necessary to telling the complete story of Muad'Dib. In DUNE you read about pre-Kwisatz Haderach Paul, seeing time as these ebbs and flows, or mountains and valleys, and this terrible purpose and decision he has to make, and it opens up the conversations about the trappings of being able to predict the future, about fanatic religions, and how to rule, and I think that yes, while you lose that adventure sense of the first novel, but you see the trap Paul inadvertently sets for himself, and how Leto II embraces that which his father cannot stomach... all with a plan (second trilogy) to take humanity to a level where people like him and his father can no longer wield such power over the human race. Terrible Purpose becomes Terrible Responsibility. The Golden Path.  The seeds are planted in DUNE, though, with the Bene Gesserit hoping to control such a power, and how that power, unleashed on its own is too much for anyone to wield. And thankfully someone with a firm moral base is who assumed such power. And even THEN it gets away from him!  Good stuff.  Also, I felt Children of Dune had pretty good adventure as well. :-)"

I had huge expectations for God Emperor and it let me down hard. I thought the idea was a fantastic one, but the story was uneven and poorly paced. We spent too much time in Leto's chamber watching Moneo cower, and not enough time on Arrakis, seeing the consequences of those meetings.

Spoliers  The first book I loved.  Imaginative, but not too far fetched.  I learned a lot and the richness was satisfying.    Upon reading Messiah I was disappointed in 2 major additions to the story line - gholas and especially facedancers.  They seem like such cheap plot devices and really worn out ones at that.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, how these creatures were so easily detected and therefore limited.  Their usefulness was more subtle than expected, and that was worth something.  Not exactly Polyjuice Potion, but close enough that I thought Frank Herbert was better than that.  The idea of Abominations was a bit far fetched for me (memories with animus?), but I bought in eventually.  I really enjoyed Children of Dune.  God Emperor is my second favorite, having been inundated with facedancers and gholas long enough to excuse those threads.  I was most taken with Leto's boredom with longevity - for some reason that interested me rather than dragged me down.    After that, the introduction of killer Amazon whores from outer space, hybrid creatures, no ships, yes ships, Martys, whirling dervish Tegs and superfucker Duncans and I was pretty much done with the series.    As a whole I truly loved it, but I really think it went off the rails in a lot of ways."

dune,2ksute,lordcola,12,Thu Oct 30 17:46:22 2014 UTC,"The fictional answer is that they are very advanced, independent Face Dancers. They are somehow descended from the Face Dancers sent out in the Scattering but they are not longer 'bound' to any Masters. They are not Dommel.  The more fanciful answer, and I like this and believe it, is that they are a nod and a wink from the author and his wife. Marty and Daniel are Frank and Bev Herbert. The characters are escaping not just their universe, but the entire universe of fiction. They are slipping the grasp of the omnipotent author even, and escaping into our imagination.  It's that interpretation that makes me think the mythical ""notes"" are not about a 7th book or at best were the skeleton for a 7th book that wasn't needed. Writing the author in to send off the series is not something you do before the actual end of the series."
dune,2ksute,dmalexa,4,Thu Oct 30 18:45:02 2014 UTC,That's a really cool explanation regarding the 7th book that I've never heard before. I guess Frank Herbert could have potentially ended the series with the 6th book to let the readers decide the fate of the characters and universe.  One question regarding the fictional answer: If they are advanced Face Dancers how did they get into Duncan's thoughts. I recall that they were the couple Duncan had visions of and he thought that the Tleilaxu from the Old Empire had been the ones to tamper with his ghola brain. If that is true how would Face Dancers from the scattering get into his head?

dune,2khke9,Hoeftybag,32,Mon Oct 27 18:38:27 2014 UTC,"For me, this is one of the ""technical details"" which Frank left deliberately vague to allow the reader's imagination to fill in the blanks; and getting a concrete answer to this question depends on the interpretation one has of the technology involved.    To get a picture of the Imperium's dimensions, one has to decide what the interstellar travel method is like.  I think we have to assume that it is of the ""hyperspace"" variety (wherein a ship ""jumps"" instantaneously from one point in the universe to another), because if it involved just going at relativistic speeds the time-dilation would mean hundreds of years (at least) would pass for the rest of the Imperium while those on the ship would experience much less time.  There's no account of people having to ""catch up on history"" whenever they travel to a new planet, so we can safely assume that aside from the time it takes to rendezvous with a guild ship and then disembark and land on the planet of your destination (things which could take hours, days, weeks or even longer depending on the circumstances), your time spent traveling ""between stars"" is more of less instantaneous.  I think it's safe to say that not only is the jump instantaneous but that the distance involved is irrelevant, i.e., it takes the same amount of time to jump 10 light years as it does 100 or 1000 or more! I think Herbert's use of the word ""foldspace"" is a great use of economy in writing, and implies all of the above in the word alone, and this is borne out in the scant details provided throughout the texts when interplanetary travel is discussed.  So if the actual physical distance between the origin and destination is irrelevant, one needn't assume that the Imperium's physical dimensions would follow what one normally thinks of as an Empire.  One normally imagine a seat of power with all the controlled territory in a big blog surrounding it, and in space, we normally think of that blob as being in three dimensions.  But that's because you normally have to travel the distance from the seat(s) of power outward, and supplies, troops and administrators can only be carried so far, and at a pace dictated by the technology available.  However, in a universe where the intervening distance is meaningless and the time traveled is next to nothing (or at least roughly the same regardless of destination) you can no longer get a meaningful picture of how the empire would be shaped in three-dimensional space.  And furthermore, this also means that having a Multi-Galactic civilization is not out of the question!    What little we know of the actual navigation implies that one must be able to accurately project the future position of stars based on their current positions, first by guild navigators with the spice, and later by Ixian machines.  It's logical to assume that this is done by first taking measurements of the stars around your ship, and getting your bearings based on the current positions of the known stars around you then using what is essentially just math (albeit far beyond my abilities with it), you can calculate your destination star's actual current position by accounting for the delay it took for that star's light to reach you.  Obviously you would need very accurate data and pretty sophisticated calculations to then determine where you actually need to fold space to arrive at your destination.  This is further complicated by the fact that your velocity relative to your destination also has to be accounted for; if you're jumping from one star to another, those stars are moving relative to each other, and your ship will currently be in orbit around the star it is leaving, so it's easy to imagine one would either need special training and a mind-enhancing drug, or a very sophisticated computer to do all the math required to put your ship where it needs to be and going the right speed in the right direction to put it in the right orbit around the destination planet which is itself orbiting a star.  If you have the ability or technology to do all that, every star is as easy to reach as any other!  One might imagine that one restriction is that if you don't already know where a star is, and have its velocity well established, you would have to be able to physically see it from where you currently are.  If your Navigator's brain or Ixian machine doesn't keep a database of known stars, one could suppose you would have to always have line-of-sight to your destination, but even going from one side of the galaxy to the other would be as easy as ""jumping"" your ship to a more or less empty region of space (perhaps ""above"" or ""below"" the plane of the galaxy) where you can spot your destination.  As for the possibility of there being different universes, I seem to recall that this is mentioned in one of the last two in the series, I believe it was Odrade trying to do just what your question does, and imagine the entirety of scattered humanity.  The implication, if I remember correctly, was that even they don't know exactly how foldspace works, and that it does perhaps provide access to other universes.  I think this only further serves to illustrate that trying to build a mental map of the universe in physical space is impossible; planets and the stars they orbit are known in relation to each other, and every known star is as reachable as any other. That's why humanity had to be scattered to countless unknown stars (and it people shielded from prescient search by Siona's genes or a no-ship/chamber) in order to ensure its survival; as long as every planet harboring humanity was known and controllable by a single power, it was subject to potential self-annihilation.  Whew! Sorry for the wall of text, I started by answering your question but then definitely got off on a ramble there.  I was just so excited to see this discussion as it's definitely something I like to think about!"

Him and Miles were pondering where they were, they seem to allude to a 'subspace' or a alternate dimension(one that may have been a place the Navigators went to, to try to avoid Leto's vision during his reign. This also could have been intercepted as being in a void of space devoid of stars far from the imperium. That is left up to the reader.)

dune,2khke9,FalcoLX,1 point,Mon Oct 27 22:51:25 2014 UTC,"A valid question, but if the sun has 9* planets of its own it seems reasonable to assume planets are pretty common, and 13,000 could easily fit within the Milky Way's 100-400 billion stars. Even if they thought the Milky Way only had 100 million stars at the time, that's 4 orders of magnitude more than planets in the Imperium, so one out of every 10,000 stars would have a viable planet.  9* as of 1969 when Messiah was published."
dune,2khke9,root88,2,Tue Oct 28 13:33:57 2014 UTC,"I don't know what you mean by different universes.  I don't remember reading anything like that.  Maybe this Dune wiki will clear things up for you?  The borders of colonized space are never accurately described. Even after the merger of the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, when the known universe was larger than it had ever been, the full extent of manned space is undisclosed.  However, some projections can be made based upon the known locations of stars and basic Dune history. The human race began on Old Earth and colonized numerous worlds around other stars. These ranged from nearby stars within 20 light years, to several stars 100-200 light-years away from Earth, and the furthest known colonized star of the Imperium, Beta Lyncis, which was 410 light-years away. However, even Beta Lyncis (and its planet Ishia) is well within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. Also, it seems that the Old Imperium remained centered on the general region of Earth - consider that the Atreides and Harkonnen homeworlds, Caladan and Geidi Prime, were each about 20 light years from Old Earth respectively.  Assuming that Dune takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy, it can be clearly surmised that the Old Imperium remained situated in the Orion Arm, even though Frank Herbert calls it a ""multigalactic empire"". It is possible that there were outposts outside of this region, such as Tupile, or the Ixian colony which Leto II discovered through prescient vision. But for the most part, the pre-Scattering Imperium was in the Orion Arm.  The Scattering, of course, changed all this. The people of the Scattering not only spread throughout the Milky Way Galaxy, but made fold-space jumps to other galaxies such as Andromeda and others. In this way, people lived too far and wide to be governed by a single force. This, combined with prescience-cloaking genes, achieved Leto II's Golden Path."

dune,2khke9,babybabyhaha,1 point,Mon Oct 27 19:14:15 2014 UTC,"I've wondered about this myself. I was able to find these two star maps. The first one outlines the Old Empire, sometime between the discovery of the suspensor-nullification effect(13004 BG) and the Age of Pretenders(11105 BG). The second shows the central planets of the Galactic Padishah Empire. So we can assume that the second map is accurate from the beginning of the reign of Sheuset I Corrino in 88 BG until 10196 AG when Paul Atreides ascends the throne and the Imperial Seat moves from Kaitain to Arrakis. The third major shift occurs in 13724 AG with the death of God Emperor Leto II Atreides which coincided with the release of the Ixian navigation device. From here we're given very little indication of how far and wide humanity actually spread. Which of course, was the entire point."

I think Game of Thrones works well as a TV show because its chapters are are setup as small episodes for a particular character. I enjoyed the miniseries, and you see how the it was divided into 3 episodes that matched up to the 3 books in Dune. That's why I think the miniseries format has the best chance of delivering the best adaptation. A film would be too short, and TV show would have too many pacing problems. I'd like to see a continuation of books adapted in that way, even a remake of the first one for improved production quality and allow for some rewrites. But if someone came along with a good outline for a show with maybe 10 episodes, I think it would be worth it to pursue it further."

dune,2k9u0q,vinsneezel,5,Sat Oct 25 11:40:18 2014 UTC,"Although the movies depicted the color as an electric blue, the book description is really more of a deep navy blue, almost black hue.    The metaphor is that people who abuse the limited prescience that Spice grants become deathly fearful of change, such as the Guild Navigators that always take the safe route, which leads ever downwards towards stagnation.  Similarly, the Fremen are prone to reducing complex situations to simple black and white decisions (""Arrakis teaches the way of the knife"") due the harshness of their lifestyle.  For both groups, their lack of perspective is mirrored by the lack of depth in their eyes, which now appear solid black.    This is driven home when a Guild official in Paul's court loses his cosmetic contact and his eye is revealed to be completely black.  Their fear of risk and complexity acted as blinders that prevented them from seeing the eventuality where Paul Maud'Dib wrests control from the traditional power structure.  You can also see this loss of perspective in Stilgar, who in the same moment is transformed from Paul's companion into a crazed zealot of a God-King."

I suppose it does explain why they accept seers from the outside world, viz. Liet, Paul and who knows how many foreign Sayyadinas. From a Fremen perspective, metaphysics can just be delegated to these outsiders, provided they are sufficiently holy - they're just a specialised tool for a specialised job.  Thanks for that!"

dune,2k7saw,Realik,5,Fri Oct 24 22:23:33 2014 UTC,"I agree. But to be fair that's not really in the first book. The world of Dune before Paul's jihad is one of conniving political entities playing a zero-sum game with various kinds of power within the imperium, but all having a stake in its stability. That's a bit less true of the Bene Gesserit, but still.  The first book isn't so much about hero worship as it is about reactionary ideals, the idealised before-time when everything and everyone had its appointed place. The key difference between Paul and Leto II is that Paul is a man of that era, he may have gone native but he never truly rejected the old world. Neither did the old guard of House Corrino in Children of Dune, for that matter.  Leto, on the other hand, truly loathed reactionary leanings - both his own and mankind's in general - and went to extremes of sadism and hubris to reintroduce mankind in the wild."

dune,2jii71,RayLomas,15,Fri Oct 17 14:28:59 2014 UTC,First off Nayla's orgasm? the hell?   You're gonna be WTFing way more during Heretics and Chapterhouse.   Will my questions about Siona and what exactly her role is in the Golden Path be answered in Heretics?   Without huge spoilers I can say that her role will become obvious when you read it.
dune,2jii71,gee_iwonderwhy,16,Fri Oct 17 14:20:44 2014 UTC,"At least the weird shit in Heretics and Chapterhouse all had purpose, Nayla was just like, ""oh he's so manly climbing that wall"" sploosh."
dune,2jii71,RayLomas,2,Fri Oct 17 14:45:20 2014 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure about it.   I don't have the book with me to quote it, but for example Lucilla's bragging about her ""capabilities"" when she was being instructed how to pretend to be an Honered Matre was pointless, and at least silly.  Also, Daniel and Marty - they were both WTF and kinda purposeless (but I'm treating Brian's stuff as fan-fic, and assuming that it all ended with Chapterhouse)."
dune,2jii71,gee_iwonderwhy,4,Fri Oct 17 14:58:23 2014 UTC,"It may not have been necessary for the story, no, but I think Lucilla bragging was mostly just to make her character interesting, showing her confidence in things she knew about when she was otherwise mostly a tag-along.  I'll give you Daniel and Marty though, they were so pointless I actually forgot about them. And yeah no, we won't even get into BH/KJA, I read one book years ago and still regret it."

I suspect they would have been a lot less purposeless if Frank had gotten to write Dune 7. Admittedly they're heavy handed when compared with the foreshadowing from, for example, God Emperor, but I'm pretty sure that they were going to be central to the original plans for Dune 7."

dune,2jii71,stovor,5,Sat Oct 25 13:36:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah that orgasm scene was definitely strange, I only read the book once and never looked back into it too much to see the purpose of that scene. I thought it was especially strange because she is physically stronger than Duncan so why is she so attracted to his accomplishment of climbing that cliff, she probably could've done it easier than he could've.  So from what I understood from reading God Emperor was that Leto was doing his own sort of breeding program to complete the golden path, and Siona was who he needed, its her genetics that allowed him to complete the path.  She has a Gene that cloaks her from the prescient powers of the Kwisatz Haderach, or any prescient being for that matter.  Which I assume was necessary to enforce an event that occurs later (but I stopped reading) called the scattering, or rather occurs right after Leto's death and the intergalactic traveling ban is lifted or rather cannot be enforced because no one can see the future to stop it.  The thing I cannot remember is why the Golden Path requires the human race to be shielded from any future Kwisatz."
dune,2jii71,gee_iwonderwhy,6,Fri Oct 17 13:23:38 2014 UTC,"The thing I cannot remember is why the Golden Path requires the human race to be shielded from any future Kwisatz.   It's all about not putting all your eggs in one basket.  It ensured the survival of the human race, and allowed them to hide from prescient beings that might possibly want to exterminate them.    If you continue on to Heretics and Chapterhouse you'll get a lot more information on why the Golden Path was necessary, and also what happened during The Scattering."
dune,2jii71,wordplaya101,3,Fri Oct 17 13:51:44 2014 UTC,"Yep, during Siona's spice trip she saw the ""seeking machines"" (likely the Ixian machines which were instead used for navigation) that would have wiped out humanity if it hadn't become both invisible and scattered."
dune,2jii71,TheFlyingBastard,-2,Fri Oct 17 14:40:53 2014 UTC,"I know its kind of a sin to mention the BH/KJA books here, but if they really based their books on Frank's notes then the ""seeking machines"" were actually the thinking machines that were supposedly wiped out during the butlerian jihad. The machines had a contingency plan  that went in to action when humanity started destroying whole planets to remove the machines."
dune,2jii71,Joomes,5,Fri Oct 17 18:25:38 2014 UTC,That is fucking hilarious.  And also bullshit. I still hold on to the Butlerian Jihad that McNelly and Frank thought up.
dune,2jii71,Goatisme,2,Mon Oct 20 20:45:38 2014 UTC,It's heavily implied in God Emperor that the seeking machines from the vision are of Ixian manufacture. He even explicitly mentions to Hwi Noree (IIRC) at some point that Ix had considered (and then rejected) making self-improving self-perpetuating killing machines that would have had the potential to wipe out the entire human race before failing themselves.  This suggests that one of the many ways the golden path and humanity could be ended was if some combination of events made Ix think it was actually a good idea.
dune,2jii71,FBC,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:25:32 2014 UTC,And then instead of building those machines the Ixians put all of their effort in blocking the abilities of Leto creating the No Rooms and No Ships. So Leto's plan of so beating down humanity had the effect of making Ix go 180 degrees away from where they'd be the cause of extinction.
dune,2jii71,xxmindtrickxx,8,Mon Oct 27 05:40:51 2014 UTC,"I think the Golden Path required humans to be shielded from the Kwisatz Haderach, and prescience in general, so as to avoid stagnation. I think that was Leto II's whole point. Knowing the safe path to the future leads to stagnation, which is dangerous for the human race's long term survival."
dune,2jii71,Shoeboxer,2,Fri Oct 17 13:55:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah now that I read this this is what I remember him saying he wanted diversity on a massive scale and to diversify humans to be protected from even someone like himself, which is why he welcomed his death, even though he couldn't see his death perfectly I believe he knew he was walking into a trap."
dune,2jii71,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,3,Fri Oct 17 14:06:38 2014 UTC,I'm not sure he couldn't see his death so much that knowing was a threat to the Golden path.
dune,2jii71,dmalexa,3,Sat Oct 18 00:35:33 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right. He said in the book that he refrained from looking at his own death, because he knew it had to happen for the Golden Path to happen. Not to mention, we all know how much he valued surprises.   Though to be perfectly honest, I think that he probably suspected, or perhaps hoped, it would happen when and where it did. He mentions at least once that he couldn't risk being killed away from water, or his body wouldn't revert back in to the sandtrout. He knew this Duncan was dangerous, and that Sionna still hated him (Leto). Then he armed them with Nayla, who was fanatical enough about him to obey every order from Sionna because he had told her to. And knowing all that, he still moved his wedding to the crazy small village he had sent Duncan and Sionna to, and crossed the bridge.   I dont think he knew, but he definitely helped set the stage for his death. And after 3500 years, I think he was ready to die. Ironically, meeting Hwi, and knowing they could never have a normal life together, only pushed him toward desiring death even more. And with the culmination of his breeding program finally realized in Sionna, there really wasn't any reason for him to stick around anymore."

It goes meta, that is, the author's pontificating more than the reality created within the duniverse to rationalize that conceit.  The Golden Path is basically the republican wet dream; no central government and everyone forced to go off and live on their own, preventing any single epidemic from wiping out the species, because all systems fail eventually.  The whole thread of the Dune novels is the dangers of the superhuman, because all humans are flawed, so if you give one magnified power, their flaws will in turn be magnified, to horrific consequences (Herbert was very suspicious of The Great Man theory of history popular in his time.)   A typical scifi series at the time would have had the godlike superhuman ruling benevolently for all eternity; Herbert just went a different way, one that had a real conviction in how intentions and reality diverge."
dune,2jii71,Joomes,2,Fri Oct 17 13:55:17 2014 UTC,That makes sense. I knew she was blind from prescient abilities I guess I was just curious why he allowed her to go so unchecked. But it sounds like the next book will answer a lot of questions for me. Thanks!

Climbing isn't just about physical strength. She almost certainly couldn't have made the climb at all, let alone more easily than Duncan. From the way the wall is described it's pretty clear that only a technically very accomplished rock climber could successfully scale any part of the wall; combine this with the fact that the wall is several hundred meters tall, and you get a very impressive feat."
dune,2jii71,_Asphyxia_,4,Mon Oct 20 21:21:23 2014 UTC,"I know this was from a few days ago, but I just found r/Dune and am super fucking pumped, so screw it.    I always took the orgasm as very meaningful.  Nayla is the most unquestioningly loyal of the female characters in the book.  To me, she is semi-representative of a universe of women during Leto's peace.  During this peace there are few warriors and few true men; all are subservient to the God Emperor.  Women (especially the Fish Speakers) become masculine and I interpret that many of the men become more feminine (though we don't read of them).  Human identity and vitality (including gender and deep primal longing) are intentionally suppressed by Leto.  His task in the Golden Path is to be the predator, as he says, and he aims to oppress humanity until it explodes with violent force.  During his peace, all are equal in submission to him.    In comes Duncan, a man made before the suppression.  He is drawn to Hwi, the most ""classically"" feminine of the females in the book and would be more common to his memories.  Siona and Nayla don't do it for him.  Nayla's orgasm (to me, again, heavily interpretive) represents the sudden feeling of living in a world where subservience is no longer.  She sees Duncan's struggle, taken freely and openly in a way a normal man of that time or a Museum Fremen never would.  Nayla's orgasm is the first sight we have of the scattering, the deep human lust for stress and victory and freedom.  A release from Leto's suppression.  It seems very weird because it is.  That orgasm can only happen in a universe where women are not allowed to know the meaning of a true human (not just man) for 3000 years."

In that scene Duncan does an extremely alpha-male thing by free climbing somewhere between 2000-3000 feet straight up what was built to be a smooth surface. It is not surprising that she responded in such a way to such a showing of sheer confidence, power, and determination.   In Dune, everything is connected.

Duncan's final act seems iffy too considering the entire series he is the embodiment of ""Man"". But to answer your question on what to skip, I don't remember the two too well because I threw them in the river when I finished, but one certain ""scene"" stands out as particularly brutal to read. Paulo or Paolo or whatever and the skinny baron want to hunt but its raining so they hunt stuffed animals inside, ouch. What are we 6??

It's needlessly noodley and gives an unfair advantage to factions with natural income. In fact to start with, you probably shouldn't play with any optional rules.  I was trying to think of two factions you could play against each other in a 1v1 game that would be fun, and I can't. Maybe Emperor v Guild? Neither of them have any crazy combat powers, or weirdness involving traitors or treachery cards.  The factions aren't balanced, because the expectation was you'd have six players and you'd be able to pair a strong Fighting faction with a strong Crazy Ability faction and they'd compliment each other. If you're playing 1v1, it's easy to end up with two factions that aren't fun to play against each other."

The Jihad books were sloppy retcon after sloppy retcon with cardboard cutout characters.  Brian & Kevin also have a terrible tendency to reiterate plot points every 20-30 pages or so, assuming that nobody has an attention span to read 60-100 pages of a book in one sitting.  I made the mistake of reading Hunters of Dune and it was even worse than the Jihad trilogy.  Didn't bother to read Sandworms of Dune when I saw the cover had two worms battling in the gorram sea.  Read a plot summary and it's everything I hated about Hunters turned up to eleven.  The ending of the book is literally deus ex machina after deus ex machina plot bailouts, resulting in the creation of the ONE THING that Frank Herbert railed against in his original Dune novels - a messiah figure.  You made a solid choice stopping where you did.

dune,2jcuha,Dirty_Tleilaxu,1 point,Wed Oct 15 22:50:27 2014 UTC,No you don't. As someone who actually enjoys Lynch's Dune I would recommend not watching the extended cut. It actually leaves some scenes out. There's a reason his name isn't on it.
dune,2jcuha,watermanjack,2,Thu Oct 16 05:13:58 2014 UTC,"There are several different cuts of the film. All should be watched, you filthy gene-peddler.   Seriously though, I love this intro. I was shocked when I bought the dvd (the very first dvd I ever purchased...it was the ""short version"" but not the ""short tv version"" compared to the ""long tv version"" that was six hours long (with commercials) which I grew up watching on Sci-Fi Channel back in the early 90's. The DVD had the other intro with Princess Irulan, which sucks."

When I was 10-12 yrs old, I answered the recurring question of: what do you want for your birthday/xmas/etc. with ""books"". When pressed for specifics, I said ""Heinlein"". I had read a few of his juvenile/Boy's Life stuff... and loved `em.  I got some books that holiday. Some relative tried hard (they were in the Sci-Fi, section, even in the ""H's""...) but, bless their heart, they gave me ""Herbert"" instead of ""Heinlein"". Paperback box set of DUNE 1-4/the quadateuch. I didn't know Frank Herbert so I read all the other books first. Then... I ran out of books. This was pre-internet days, pre-cable... best I could hope for was Doctor Who on PBS Saturday nights and the book-mobile coming by on Wednesday.   After I read everything else in the house, I tried ""Dune"". It sucked; bored the crap out of me. I quit it, for a while, then got so bored I tried again. Same result. It took me at least three tries to get to the point where the light bulb lit up in my head and I said ""wow"". Then I went from ""Dune"" to ""God Emperor"" in a weekend.  I've re-read them all many times in the decades since; I learn something new each time.  Final TL;DR- If it's slow, you are bogged- push through. It's worth it."

dune,2j5c17,joetoenails,20,Mon Oct 13 20:17:11 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it, I don't think. The end of Children of Dune sets the stage for God Emperor in a very direct way, and Leto II (I suspect) is a far more interesting character if you knew him when he was still human.   Children (if I remember right) has good amount of explanation and context, seen through Leto II's eyes, for Paul's actions in Dune and Dune Messiah as well.  So I guess I don't think you'd have much trouble following along with the events of God Emperor if you skipped Children. But I do think you'd be missing a huge amount of context that's pretty crucial from a thematic point of view. With this in mind, I don't think you'd enjoy it as much, so I would suggest holding off until you can get a copy of Children.   Hope this helps! :)"

But if it makes you feel any better, Children of Dune is really awesome as well. A lot of the really interesting stuff that God Emperor spends so much time pondering is introduced (or at least brought heavily into focus) in Children.

The emperor, Lady Jessica, Alia, and Baron Harkonnen are all described as red headed.   The rest of the aristocracy of the known universe are described as pale white, as a probable contrast and other-worldly appearance.  Also, remember that Liet, the Imperial Ecologist, and Chani's father, was offworlder.  So Chani was half-fremen.  LetoII and Ghani were definitely dark fremen, and looked mostly like their mother according to the lineage."

I assume by ""Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber"" you mean Brian and Kevin?  I can assure you that the time gap between God Emperor and Heretics is 1,500 years and has always been 1,500 years.  You know Frank finished those books more then 20 years before his son decided to start adding to the Dune universe, right? There aren't any re-issues where anything is changed like the Star Wars Special Editions.  I don't disagree with your opinion about those two who have now (infuriatingly) written more than twice as many Dune novels as Frank, but the passage of time between GEoD and Heretics has always been 1,500 years, without any retcon bullshit from Brian & Kevin."

I don't have the book with me, but I'm pretty certain it's mentioned fairly early on in the narrative. God Emperor of Dune also takes place ~3,500 years after Children of Dune so maybe that's why you're thinking it's closer to 10,000 years, with 6,000 total years between the original Dune novels and the events of Heretics and Chapterhouse.  Regardless, there have been no alterations/retconning to Frank's books done by Brian and Kevin.  The only changes to the books in their current paperback pressing include an afterward written by Brian Herbert in the original Dune, and possibly in the 2nd edition (I'm not sure if it was in the 1st edition) of Chapterhouse, where Frank wrote a eulogy for his wife, Bev, which is at the end of the book.

dune,2isko9,the_AnViL,1 point,Fri Oct 10 19:47:19 2014 UTC,"After waiting for Amazon to ship my order, I finally got a copy of Heretics of Dune and only had to read the first chapter to find two examples of the timeframe of the novel.  First is Lucilla's mention of her reliance on the Jessica persona within her Other Memory.  The line references that it had been in the Atreides Line/BG Other Memory for five thousand years.  The second is at the end of the first chapter where either Schwangyu or Lucilla states that it's been 1,500 years since the Tyrant's death.  It's the Ace Mass Market paperback edition, which has been unchanged since 1986 I believe.  Well before Brian took the reigns and pissed all over his father's legacy.  I didn't get too far in my re-read last night since I was wiped out from cleaning all the damn leaves out of my yard during the day, but I'll keep my eyes open for that passage about Dar-es-balat.  I'd also like to talk about the back cover.  My roommate has a much older copy of Heretics that does indeed have the ""ten times ten centuries have passed"" line on it, but I don't really think that the back cover of a book can be considered canon.  I'm pretty sure that the publisher is responsible for the design of the cover/back cover, including the text / synopsis.  I highly doubt that Frank personally wrote the synopsis on the back cover.  Also - 1,500 years is a damn long time!  Where were humans 1,500 years ago?

dune,2io2z2,_miles_teg_,5,Wed Oct 8 19:30:32 2014 UTC,"I can see the argument either way, but I'm personally betting that the fuel costs would probably balance out.  With this method, we surely would need more Carryalls and each Carryall would burn more fuel while harvesting, but I'm guessing that aircraft fuel is pretty cheap, or at least efficient, in the Dune universe. The first book implies that the Carryall is pretty much buzzing around all day anyways, and Duke Leto seriously considered permanently assigning 2 Carryalls to each Harvester. Moreover, we no longer need to fuel 4 spotter craft and the harvester itself.  We also don't need to pay to operate the spotter craft and I'm betting that the pilots at least don't come so cheaply ( no computer assisted flying, after all ;) ). We also don't lose Harvesters, and while their crews probably aren't so highly trained, even with the lowest skilled labour, employee turnover means training cost and lost efficiency."

dune,2i9uy4,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,3,Sat Oct 4 13:11:52 2014 UTC,"Was Irulan a full RM? I honestly can't remember for sure either way. I always had her in my mind as BG trained, but not a full Reverend Mother. Like Jessica before she drank the spice essence at the Fremen spice orgy. I could absolutely be wrong though.   I know that they have selective filters on other memory, mentioned several times in various places. Even in Chapterhouse when Murbella goes through the Agony. It just seemed odd to me that Rebecca had none prior to sharing with Lucilla. Also, having Atreides blood via the Sionna gene almost seems to make it even more likely that she would have other memories to fall back on, at least to some degree.   I suppose the argument could be made that sharing with Lucilla imparted the BG training that may be necessary to unlock other memory, giving Rebecca access to something she simply didnt know how to operate. But that still leaves the question of what the Jews would gain from having her undergo the spice agony, as I find it hard to believe they would endanger one of their own and saddle her with a lifelong physical addiction to melange, on the possibility that her genes might result in an interesting talent. I think there would have to be a much more consistent outcome with a predictable and useful talent."

She is never depicted as going through the agony, and was referred to as a sub-par Bene Gesserit in the first place. Bene Gesserit sisters who are unworthy will die in the agony.

Wasn't the Sayadina that Jessica met actually Reverend Mother Ramallo?   I guess I can see the Jews doing it out of a sense of ritual. The Sayadinas were spiritual leaders for the Fremen, and transformed the water of life for the spice orgies, so they make more sense for them.   If you dont mind my asking, what were some of the other powers you had imagined for the wild RMs?  Just curious what fellow fans have conjured up in their ""head canon."""

It was founded in County Armagh in 1795 – during a period of Protestant-Catholic sectarian conflict – as a Masonic-style brotherhood sworn to defend Protestant supremacy. Its name is a tribute to the Dutch-born Protestant king William of Orange, who defeated the army of Catholic king James II at the Battle of the Boyne (1690). Its members wear Orange sashes and are referred to as Orangemen. The Order is best known for its yearly marches, the biggest of which are held on 12 July ('The Twelfth'). Although strongest in Northern Ireland, the Order also has a significant presence in the Scottish Lowlands and lodges throughout the Commonwealth and United States.

dune,2hx4mg,zogmuffin,6,Tue Sep 30 19:44:59 2014 UTC,"I like the asbestos idea!  If, though, the spice is in fact a biopolymer, as the Dune Encyclopedia says, perhaps part of its molecular structure is similar in some way to cellulose, or more likely similar to silk, if the worms are in any way like arthropods, which would make its substrate ideal for paper and fiber, just as plant fiber is for us. The spice that comes directly out of the sand probably isn't salable melange; it needs to be cleaned, refined, and so on. The leftovers (maybe we could call it ""spicesilk"") are what is made into fiber, paper, spiceplastic, etc."
dune,2hx4mg,Mughi,2,Tue Sep 30 23:32:53 2014 UTC,"Cellulose is a great example. It's a biological molecule which is a powder in pure form, but also a primary ingredient in things like cardboard or paper and (most relevant) rayon."

For example, there are two theories were the oxygen on Arrakis comes from, despite the lack of enough plant life.

Having every part of your life mapped out with no surprises is a recipe for death. It's why Leto doesn't use prescience unless necessary. It's also a common theme of the first books. It's why they are in this mess. Paul keeps saying ""Disengage"" in the previous books. But he can't. Prescience locked him into every possible scenario. The only option he had he would not do. You need options in life or life fucks you. Leto knows all of this of course since he is the one who had to do it."
dune,2htsuz,LandryP,2,Thu Oct 2 00:05:50 2014 UTC,"I stopped reading God Emperor for this reason.  After reading the comments, I will give it another try."
dune,2htsuz,drater029,2,Thu Oct 2 17:06:05 2014 UTC,"There is one thing that helped me get through GEoD when I was reading it in my teens.  Remember the opening with all that about Hadi Benotto, Dar-es-Balat, and Rebeth Vreeb?  These people found Leto's diaries somewhere between his death and HoD.  At some point in GEoD Leto mentions something to the effect that future generations will be able to make entertainment out of his history and diaries.  Don't quote me on that though, my memory is a bit fuzzy and it is my interpretation anyway.  At that point in life I found it a very surreal sensation to be learning about the goings on in the book in what seemed like present tense, but to know that it is actually a history.  Not only that, my interpretation, was that although Rebeth Vreeb only read part of Leto's diaries, no doubt adding poetic flair to it.  The main part of the book is someone's reading of his diaries, in my opinion, with stylistic flair added.  When I thought about the whole book in this manner it added a certain amount of irony to the goings on.  Maybe in his personal dealings, Leto really wasn't such a philanthropist, but in the grand scheme of things he was definitely a giver.  It adds to the drama, and the TRAGEDY, of the book if you take it almost as a set piece like something from Shakespeare.  This is what made me first truly appreciate GEoD.  Of course, I've read the whole series many times since then and I love it and get more from it every time."
dune,2htsuz,drater029,2,Wed Oct 8 13:34:30 2014 UTC,"I realize I didn't mention anything about what turns you off from the book.  If you like what I said previously I think we are supposed to find it funny, almost laughably so, that everyone in GEoD wants to depend on the absolutes their God Leto can offer them through prescience.   Everyone thinks that Leto ""knows"" what will happen, but unlike his father he knew the trap of prescience.  I think it's fantastic that Frank took a character who was supposed to be all knowing by seeing the future and made him human despite his outer shell.  At one point Leto even states that he can tell what emotion causes the behaviors in those around him, no prescience there, just simple or not so simple psychology."
dune,2htsuz,drater029,2,Wed Oct 8 14:08:58 2014 UTC,"I really appreciate your perspective, and I took this into account when reflecting on the book. I do like that we are essentially getting a glimpse into the past, and the pre-chapter segments are much more interesting and informative than in previous Dune books.  My biggest issue is that I don't think the book had the same balance of action and philosophy that the original Dune and to a lesser extent, Children of Dune had. As I commented, it just felt like endless council meeting and Idaho's frustrated rants. Maybe after reading Heretics and Chapterhouse I will have a better appreciation for GEoD."
dune,2htsuz,tollfreecallsonly,2,Wed Oct 8 14:51:00 2014 UTC,"I get it.  Thinking about it the way you put it, I almost feel like what action we do get in GEoD is more trivial or fluff than the other things going on.  Until the end, you can count on one hand the amount of action scenes we get.  Aside from Siona's run through the Forbidden Forest, the other action parts are really underplayed.  ahaha, now I feel like I'm arguing semantics and we are starting to say the same thing.  Tell me if this is too far off topic, but I almost feel like Frank went for the opposite history telling of Tolkein in this regard.  Whereas Tolkien's writings were not about deep interpersonal relationships, Frank delved more deeply into relationships and not the battles."
dune,2htsuz,Uncle_Malky,2,Wed Oct 8 15:07:07 2014 UTC,"I dunno...it's been a while, but it seems to me the end of the book was surprising enough.  Leto must have known, but didn't stop his own death...."
dune,2htsuz,stovor,6,Tue Sep 30 00:57:49 2014 UTC,Leto refused to see his own death. He knew prescience was a deathtrap. The OP should have got to that point by now at least.
dune,2htsuz,stovor,2,Wed Oct 1 23:44:34 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed that part, and now I realize that Leto II refused to use prescience in the same way that his father had. I didn't hate the book, I just thought it could have used a bit of ""spice"" (cue crickets).  But seriously, I was much more interested in what was going on with Siona, especially in the middle of the book, before she was captured. Instead of that, we got Leto's endless preaching to Moneo. I appreciate his wisdom, but from a reader's perspective it was just dull. Especially after the heart-pumping opening scene."
dune,2htsuz,stovor,1 point,Wed Oct 8 15:58:38 2014 UTC,"But seriously, I was much more interested in what was going on with Siona, especially in the middle of the book, before she was captured.   If she was doing anything of substance, I'm sure Frank would have written about it.   I really don't think too much time had passed between the raid on the citadel and Siona's capture.  If I recall correctly, wasn't the point of the meeting where she gets captured to meet with the Ixian ambassador and get him to smuggle the copies of the stolen journals out to the Ixians, Bene Gesserit, and Guild so they could work on translating it?"
dune,2htsuz,obnoxious_commenter,2,Wed Oct 8 19:53:16 2014 UTC,"Yes, she was smuggling the texts out. But watching the violence that was exploding all over Onn at that point would have been much more interesting than hearing Leto and Idaho talk about it.   Later, when the explosion threatens the Ixian Embassy and Hwi, Leto unleashes his rage and crushes many of the combatants - that was awesome, and the ramifications were felt by his Fish Speakers throughout the rest of the book. I just felt like too much time was spent in Leto's council chamber and not enough with the rest of the characters."
dune,2htsuz,obnoxious_commenter,1 point,Wed Oct 8 20:29:58 2014 UTC,"Fair enough, it's been a few months since I finished my most recent re-read so I might have been confused with the timing of certain events.  It definitely would have been nice to see the violence in Onn from a couple of different viewpoints, sort of like how George RR Martin portrayed the Battle of the Blackwater in two separate POV chapters in the second book of ""A Song of Ice and Fire."""
dune,2htsuz,merthsoft,1 point,Wed Oct 8 20:47:08 2014 UTC,"Precisely! As it happens, I was reading A Feast for Crows concurrently with God Emperor of Dune, and the former was much more engaging. Again, I appreciate Herbert's philosophical mind and deep characters, but the overall pacing of the book was very uneven. I hear Heretics and Chapterhouse are better, though!"
dune,2htsuz,Razorwyre,1 point,Thu Oct 9 14:43:38 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed God Emperor probably due to the fact that it's so different from the other books.  Heretics and Chapterhouse are great, too, and the pacing is definitely much quicker.  I think you'll enjoy them!"
dune,2htsuz,tollfreecallsonly,1 point,Thu Oct 9 16:56:35 2014 UTC,"Sorry to butt in here... especially if you have not finished   But watching the violence that was exploding all over Onn at that point would have been much more interesting than hearing Leto and Idaho talk about it.    At this point, the idea of dozens of Idahos should be known. This type of violence was a bore to Leto, all was still the same. The difference, was the responses that Idaho had during these talks.   ... the ramifications were felt by his Fish Speakers throughout the rest of the book. I just felt like too much time was spent in Leto's council chamber and not enough with the rest of the characters.   about those ramifications....not much time was spent on that, at least thats how i remember it, yet you know thats what happened. the same way you know how that violence in onn went down,  the same way any war goes down.   the interesting part, are those talkis with his council chamber. he is his council, in past, present and future. the rest of the characters dont get developed, because THEY ARE LETO. HE IS THEM. all except one... Duncan, and well maybe malky. it could explain why he was willing to put up with him, and waited so long to kill him.   crap, leto doesnt have duncan idahos memories in his prescience. i have never thought about this idea. it makes perfect sense now!   Siaynoq!"
dune,2htsuz,tollfreecallsonly,1 point,Thu Oct 16 03:04:13 2014 UTC,"I appreciate this outlook - I'm done with the book now, but thanks for the consideration!   I guess my real problem with the book was its pacing. Dune and Children of Dune had excellent pacing. There were periods of introspection and discussion neatly interspersed with high-tension ""action"" scenes. When I say that I wanted to spend less time in Leto's chamber, I mean I wanted to spend more time with characters like Siona, who feared and hated him, or Nayla who was acting on his behalf. Instead of simply hearing him pontificate, we could see those rambling speeches put into action.  Given that the book starts with a heart-pumping forest chase, I was pretty disappointed that we didn't see anything else like that until well into the second act. I love Frank Herbert, but some of those council sessions felt as boring to me as real-life councils must be."

Oh you just wait till you get your hands on Heretics and Chapterhouse. Reading your comments is making me laugh because its almost like you are giving a brief summary about something you have not yet read!    I love Frank Herbert, but some of those council sessions felt as boring to me as real-life councils must be.   That was the point. Freedom from the mundane."

dune,2hps6b,duke_of_ks,1 point,Sun Sep 28 19:59:38 2014 UTC,"Indeed, and I appreciate you sharing. I'm just interested in this notion of remakes. I personally don't understand why a movie becomes a book, or a comic becomes a movie and so on. In some cases, I like the results of reinterpretations, Sergio Leone's spaghetti-western versions of Akira Kurosawa's films for example, because something weird and unexpected happens. I can like these derivative works on their own merits, but it doesn't help me understand the notion of attempting to recreate things. I would presume making something new and different would take priority."

dune,2hirms,soylentblueissmurfs,3,Sat Sep 27 00:03:57 2014 UTC,"I agree. I think Dune remains one of the most under-realized SF properties out there. Frankly, it's baffling, as even the half-baked and aborted projects went on to inspire other franchises (e.g., Dune II established many of the elements we still see in RTS games, and Jodorowsky's Dune apparently lent some creative ""spice"" to future SF franchises like Star Wars).  Other redditors pointed out that a film script would be challenging, but hey, who else remembers the days when LOTR was ""un-filmable""? We just need someone to step up! Don't get me started on David Lynch's 1984 steaming load - apologies to anyone who liked that campy piece of nonsense, but I hated it."

I wish they would publish all the official continuity photos because I know I am in some of them.

dune,2hbtn7,macjoven,8,Wed Sep 24 14:13:25 2014 UTC,"Having read the book 2 or 3 times before the movie was made, I thought the Stillsuits looked awesome. Up close they were just made of cheap thick spongy foam. I felt REALLY bad for anyone that had to wear them in 100+ degree heat, including the hundreds of Mexican soldiers ""hired"" as extras (like they had a choice). After each and every take of the desert battle scenes there would be dozens of them literally passed out face down on the sand dunes from heatstroke. I am not exaggerating either. The set doctors were always walking around giving salt tablets to everyone to avoid dehydration. It was dangerous. One day my truck got stuck about a mile away from the set and I was alone. I started to walk back and in 10 minutes I nearly passed out. Fortunately another vehicle came by and rescued me and took me back to a trailer with A/C. It took me about an hour to cool off enough to be able to stand up again.  Looking back as an old (50+) geezer now, it was one of the most fun things I ever did when I was young.  The movie? Considering the state of special effects back then and the complexity of the story, I think the movie is best appreciated if you have read the book. In fact I think the movie is awesome if you understand David Lynch and have read the book. Thanks for asking! Sorry for the long response."
dune,2hbtn7,enitnepres,3,Wed Sep 24 14:31:03 2014 UTC,What I never understood was why the actors weren't wearing some kind of goggles or facemasks with their stillsuits. In the movie they were fighting in the dessert in sandstorms and I thought it was silly to not protect their eyes! Were the actors really getting pummeled with sand or was it some kind of effect?
dune,2hbtn7,enitnepres,3,Wed Sep 24 16:00:54 2014 UTC,"You know, that's a good point. Fremen would have had to have eye protection. No question about it. Do they address this in the books? I honestly can't remember. I remember they had these massive huge fans blowing tons of dust and sand in a couple of the scenes. I'm sure they ended up with a lot of gritty eyelids and mouths."
dune,2hbtn7,PM_ME_DAT_BUTT,2,Wed Sep 24 16:28:49 2014 UTC,It is mentionned in the book after Paul and Chani first met when Chani the Fremmen (Sean Young's character) is giving Paul(Kyle Maclachlan) pointers about being in the desert like keeping one's hat/helmet at the right angle to keep sand out with visibility.

dune,2h4g7l,HarlockJC,3,Mon Sep 22 20:31:51 2014 UTC,"If the alternative to seeing the story die is a shitty continuation, yes. It's not exactly the same situation, given that there's a bunch of other evidence than a birth certificate to prove that Obama is who he says he is. There's exactly zero evidence other than 'because I said so' coming from Brian.  Every noticed how one of the central themes of the original series was a subversion of the hero myth, trying to show that reliance on a central hero or authority figure is dangerous?  Brian then goes on in the 'sequel' to completely shit on this concept, and have an individual hero save the world.   mantle picked up by the son   Brian Herbert didn't pick up his father's mantle, basically everything he's written in the Dune series has been in conflict with the original 6, whether it's in factual inaccuracies or thematic inconsistencies."
dune,2h4g7l,lundse,-2,Fri Sep 26 12:55:19 2014 UTC,"There would just as many nuts out there who said there zero evidence by Obama. I personally don't feel there any reason for Brain to lie about it. He did not need to say there was anything for the books to carry on. Chapterhouse came out a year before he died, do you really think when reading the other books that Frank would have stopped there had he lived longer, it was a good year or two betwen Chapterhouse being completed till he died. He may not have gotten far into the books, but he would have started something.  You can't go in expecting the same writing style out of Brain as you got from Frank. Anne Mccaffrey worked close with her son and you still don't see the same writing style. The books that Brain and Kevin are doing are great stories on their own and is the best I think any author could do stepping into Frank's shoes.  Leave the conspiracy to the 911 nuts, and just enjoy the fact we are not stuck with nothing at all like what has been in the Tolkien world where the family fights too much over money that we get no new stories from such a great world. Dune is the first time I have ever heard of fans of books coming up with conspiracy theories."
dune,2h4g7l,HarlockJC,4,Fri Sep 26 13:03:38 2014 UTC,"I personally don't feel there any reason for Brain to lie about it.   Seriously? You cannot think of a single reason two authors going into a venture to continue a story would profit from telling a yarn about how they have all sorts of notes from the original author? No reason whatsoever?  And please don't bring the ""style"" argument up - the problems are far beyond ""style"" and if you have read two posts from non-KJA-fanboys, you would know this."
dune,2h4g7l,lundse,0,Fri Sep 26 13:30:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, far be it that people enjoy reading the books. I can't speak for Brain, but if Kevin Anderson was only worried about money then he would have written more star wars books. When you listen to the interview on Hunters of Dune they say the infromation they got about the next books was a little amount. You know Frank had to already start working on another book, there was no reason for him to have stopped with Chapterhouse. He had been writting Dune books most of his life."

dune,2h4g7l,HarlockJC,4,Mon Sep 29 10:06:20 2014 UTC,"Just because we know a plan  exists doesn't mean Brian stuck to it at all. I'm not saying the plan isn't real, I'm saying it doesn't seem likely that Brian really used it.   It's not a question of a difference of style, it's a question of difference in content. Brian's 'sequels' and prequels are not only inconsistenr with the original six in terms of canon, but in terms of theme. Taking a series where the fourth book is literally ALL about a character's plan (which is in part to stop humanity from ever relying too much on single individual ever again) and 'concluding it' with a book that directly contradicts many of the themes of that plan, and the rest of the original series is a travesty.  Brian's books read like shitty fan-fiction that totally misses the thematic points of the original. Taking a deeply philosophical series and 'concluding' and 'expanding' it with (at best) averagely written standard sci-fi schlock that in many places actively contradicts the original material is fucking criminal. It's a dis-service to Frank and the original series to read the stuff Brian's produced and say 'yeah I guess that'll do'.   TL;DR Sure the notes exist, there isn't some weird conspiracy theory that they aren't actually out there. I seriously question whether Brian actually read or used them (or, for that matter, the original 6 Dune books) when writing his 'sequels' and prequels to Dune though, which is another question altogether."

dune,2h4g7l,lundse,1 point,Thu Oct 9 17:55:00 2014 UTC,A story does not need to end just because someone dies. Many stories have continued without the original authors and many of them make many mistakes. Look at the Star Wars univerise for the biggest example of this. But on a smaller scale you can see this with the Pern novels and The Wheel of Time Books.
dune,2h4g7l,Robot_Tanlines,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:22:02 2014 UTC,"A story does not need to end just because someone dies.    That persons story does.  Otherwise, it is just ""people having fun in that universe"". Nothing wrong with that, but don't claim that person B can write person A's story.

dune,2h4g7l,HarlockJC,0,Mon Sep 29 09:44:11 2014 UTC,"The Wheel of Times author, Brandon Sanderson, was hand picked by Jordan's wife, who was also the editor to most if not all the books, Sanderson's included. You can say with some amount of certainty that the post Jordan books stayed true to his story because many of the people involved with the WoT remained involved after his death. I'm a massive Sanderson fan, I think with free reign he could have probably made the ending better than it was, but he stayed true to Jordan's vision for the story.   As for Pern, I know there is a million of them, but the original Author and her son wrote several of the books together and he continued with the the world and stories that he helped come up with. Brian Herbert didn't stay true to the world because it was never a world that he was part of because he never wrote in it, that's why he didn't care to make whole sale changes."
dune,2h4g7l,Robot_Tanlines,1 point,Mon Sep 29 10:19:48 2014 UTC,"So it's ok for the wife to pick someone but not the son. Right now I am reading Out of Oz, while the Wicked books have been decent books they are not completely true to the story. They get enough of it right though to make it so that it's not a really big deal. The great part about the books, is the fact it adds more story to the OZ world. That how I look at the Dune books are they perfect Cannon for the story, No. Are they really good books with a really good story that adds to a world I grew up loving, Yes. I was so happy when I learned the new books where coming out, even happier when I found out Kevin Anderson would be helping in the writing. I feel they are great stories and I look forward to more. You may not like them, and past them by. I personally love them, with the Legends of Dune being my fav. You may hate them, but I will keep buying them and looking forward to more."
dune,2h4g7l,HarlockJC,2,Thu Oct 2 09:09:40 2014 UTC,"I am unfamiliar with the Wicked books, I'm not sure what relation it has with the Frank Baum Oz, maybe the books are based off the movie and not the book, which were very different from each other.   Harriet McDougal is a well respected editor in her own right, she edited Ender's Game. She can take over because she was actually involved in the WoT time from the beginning. She was the editor of almost every one of Jordan's books, the series was as much of her life as it was Jordan's. The WoT is both her and her late husband's legacy, she continued the series to finish what they both started and she did it with love, not greed in mind.   Brian Herbert's only connection to Dune is his Father. Brian's an author, but nothing he's done as been worth note other than the Dune series, which he has written more books in that series than than all his other books combined. Dune is his cash cow, he is nothing without it, and to that end he will milk it for whatever he can get out regardless of the integrity of the series.  The best and simplest example of him simply not caring about his fathers universe is Paul, in Dune it is clearly state by Duke Leto and Paul himself, that he has never left his home world, but is the Brian books, he's going on adventures on other worlds at 12, 3 years before he leaves for Dune.  Dune starts with Paul as a innocent unbloodied boy and he becomes a man who will be responsible for billions of deaths in the novel, it's a very important part of it.  The new books have no integrity, you can see how little they respect the world by the ridiculous stuff they do which makes no sense in the series they are writing in. The new books feature such things as ""no-ships"" several thousand years before they are invented, but they only make one and then everyone forgets about it. The Bene Gesserit have invisibility, which is never used or spoken of again, and somehow in the past they had the ability to make their brains explode killing everyone around them, yet they simply forgot about it, hell they only had a breeding program going back 90 generations to make a Kwisatz Haderach, they do seem like forgetful people. The Tleilax create artificial spice before The events of Dune, yet it's never mentioned particularly in God Emperor when Leto forces the known universe to its knees because he is the sole controller of the spice, probably would have been helpful. They also have communicators that can instantly travel the Galaxy in the prequels, but their forgotten about too. And these are just the major problems, there are hundreds of inconsistencies between the Frank and Brian books.   Just adding more crap in a fictional universe doesn't add to the richness of it, it just diminishes the value that was already there. Look at the Star Wars sequels, it had to be written into the contract that the prequels are the official Cannon of Star Wars going forward because since they were so bad Disney was just planning on pretending that they never happened."
dune,2h4g7l,Robot_Tanlines,1 point,Mon Sep 29 14:21:57 2014 UTC,"Funny thing about the Wicked books, the author seems to like and add parts from either the movie or the book based on what he trying to do.  The whole creating spice was explained to be pretty much a failure and/or destoried. How much was forgotten between the fall of Rome until now, there still stuf the anicent Egyptians had done that we don't understand. In the The Battle of Corrin they explain with all the information that was destoried why so much of the information was forgotten, there quite a bit of details into why this is. I compared it to the library of alexandria with the fall of rome when I was reading it. The No-Ship was from Chaterhouse, alot of your issues are explained in this book. Though it's been awhile alot of your issues your having started in Chaterhouse. When you read the book, you can tell Frank was going in another way. Look at what he did to planet Dune, this is why I find Brain and Kevin books more true than you do. Example Duncan turned into a Mentat in chaterhouse, the Bene Gesserit changed alot having to use their feelings in Chaterhouse as well."
dune,2h4g7l,HarlockJC,2,Tue Sep 30 03:30:56 2014 UTC,"Not sure why you're talking about Chapterhouse, cause apparently the Harkonnen had them when Paul was born.   From the Dune Wikia:  ""The earliest known usage of a No-ship can be found in the Prelude to Dune trilogy. House Harkonnen had developed the shop using a Richesian scientist in their employ. Once the ship was finished, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen executed the scientist to keep the No-ship secret. The No-ship was first used in Dune: House Atreides in an attempt to frame Duke Leto Atreides for an attack on a Bene Tleilax ship while inside a Guild Heighliner.""  The Baron killed the inventor of the No Ship to keep it a secret is such week storytelling for them to just cram whatever crap they wanted into the Dune universe. It's a great idea to only make one of these things, not like it's a major game changer in the universe or anything it. Things are not invented in a vacuum, it may stake someone else a bit longer to create something, but if the conditions exist someone else will come up with it in the near future, not 10,000 years later.   It's a myth that technology was lost after the fall of Rome, the knowledge was still out there, the infrastructure was gone that would make that knowledge useful was lost. Sure some literature was lost, which is unfortunate, but the themes, ideas and concepts all remained. Even if real knowledge was lost, it's not like the Romans were going to the moon, or splitting the atom 1500 years ago.  When you say Frank was going one way, that's why you think Brian books are more true, what do you mean by that? How does anyone override the actual creator of a series? What justifies, in your mind, that Paul had been off Caladaan before Dune to go on adventures, which directly contradicts Frank's original story that is the basis of the whole Dune Universe?  You're welcome to enjoy the books if you want, but you should at least see them for what they are. My girlfriend loves the ""real housewives"" shows, she knows it's trash TV, that doesn't stop her from enjoying them. The Brian books are essentially Fan Fiction, except he isn't a fan, he disregards any Original content that doesn't go with HIS vision of Dune. Brian Herbert is a failed writer who is trapped in the shadow of his Father, the only success he has had is through his Father's creation, so in order to justify his existence makes these changes to the Cannon."

I see no reason to attack Brain character, it seems to me that your just looking for a reason to hate on the guy. It's not like he didn't write stories with his father, and if memory serve me correct Frank Herbert thought people how to write as a living before writing Dune.  I don't see who Paul going to other planets when he was training to be a duke one day would have contradicted Frank's stories, though I will give you they got the birth place wrong. I think your just looking too much. There a few thinks you have to ask yourself what would it have taken for you to be happy with the stories or would you have rather have never seen a ending for Chapterhouse, would anything have been good enough for you, if Kevin Anderson wrote them alone could you still be blaming the books on greed alone.  You may call them trash, it reminds me of those Star Trek fans who love only their 1 Star Trek series and will not try any of the other series because they are not as good or don't follow the cannon 100%. This discussion getting us no wheres, just think of the questions I asked you. It's the same type of questions I pose to Star Trek or Stargate fans."

I started with the prequels, but found them utterly devoid of anything that made Frank Herbert's Dune series special to me. And then I just gave up on Brian. I honestly don't think you should just take my word for it, though. Give them a try for yourself and decide for yourself if you like his stuff.  If you like them, cool. If you don't, cool. Keep in mind that Brian Herbert never wrote any of them by himself, though. For what it's worth, that's my only warning to people who are thinking of reading his books. I realize it's all very subjective, though.   In this sub, the war between the two factions continues and will probably never end."

I think he worries about the story itself. He worries because of what it says of humanity, that the story is being spread. It says that they want their hero. Even if Paul led the Jihad, even if he spawned a tyrant, they would still love for the great hero to return with all the riches (static, hoarded riches - not even the currently favurable ""jobs for everyone"" spiel) and make everything alright.  He worries because he is afraid that whatever leads us to single out a hero and follow without question may be stronger than he thinks. Or quite possibly simply because it tells him something about how many people (even if it is not all) that will still end up enslaved or murdered in the name of some hero, in all the corners of the Shattering..."

dune,2gxp9b,_miles_teg_,2,Sun Sep 21 05:31:48 2014 UTC,"A ghola Paul could very well be waiting at some spice hoard somewhere. That's gotta be pretty disturbing. However, I always thought it had something to do with Paul being secretly alive once before. Force fed spice just as Leto was.  Now, the hoard of spice and paul being kept alive by it is a good analogy for the hoard of others inside Leto keeping him alive. The fact he uses the word hoard makes a good case for the analogy. FH is very deliberate with the use of words. Technically Paul is alive with the hoard of others inside Leto.  Also, Paul was supposed to be in Leto's position but couldn't go through with it. So if he is still alive, and has just been waiting while Leto sacrifices everything, that would make Leto a little upset."

dune,2gxp9b,Shoeboxer,4,Sun Nov 2 20:27:43 2014 UTC,Because.. Where does spice come from?!  Leto II (technically III) wanted to cull and severely limit the spice availability. His entire plan rests on Arrakis being the only place where spice is found.
dune,2gxp9b,Trevoke,5,Sat Sep 20 15:01:31 2014 UTC,"But isn't the eventual synthesis and commoditisation of spice by the Tleilax a necessary precondition for freeing mankind in Leto's design?  If this great hoard is real and is found after his reign but before spice is commoditised, then the political structures that would emerge from the fight to control the Hoard would be very much at odds with what he wants. It'd be the imperium all over again, only with spice an ever-dwindling finite resource.  Obviously this ignores the fact that the worms reappear on Rakis after Leto's death as I can't remember whether that was part of his plan."
dune,2gxp9b,toxicasshole,2,Sat Sep 20 21:07:46 2014 UTC,"I think it's because it is possible for the story to be true. If it were anyone but Paul (and some others later on), Leto would be able to see it."

dune,2gxp9b,charlieb,2,Tue Sep 23 15:48:53 2014 UTC,"The navigators couldn't see him because he was in control of the future. Navigators used limited prescience to find safe passage for their ships through foldspace. Since Paul had obtained a higher level of prescience, when the navigators tried to look into his future they were blind to his path. At the end of dune when Paul and the fremen have defeated the emperor and his armies, Paul is now in political control of the entire human race.  This political power combined with his prescience meant that he personally could effect the future of the entire universe. This is why the Navigators were blinded when they tried to look at or beyond Paul's future, because he alone saw the many paths and had the power to choose. This is echoed in children of dune when Leto II meets Paul in the desert.  When Paul sees how far Leto has gone to take control of the future (ie: sand trout ) he is blinded to it, and he recognizes that his son has now taken over the reins controlling humanities future."
dune,2gxp9b,MrBacon42,2,Wed Sep 24 18:16:02 2014 UTC,"I don't read the first book as much as the last three but iirc, at the time, Elric was the best the navigators had and he was taksed with finding him. There was nothing in Paul that made him invisible to prescience. It was just he was the best at the time. After Paul made prescience possible, that is what caused all the problems with the golden path and Leto having to create Siona."
dune,2gxp9b,Uncle_Malky,1 point,Tue Sep 23 16:47:56 2014 UTC,"Fear of the myth of a superhero would bind together the galatic empire despite Leto's plans for the golden path (aka burn the house down force everybody to scatter).   The idea that a huge repository of the old resource that kept the empire functioning, guarded by the messiah who would lead them, super-hero like, was specifically what Paul and then Leto spent their lives to prevent.  edit: prevent that reality, not the idea of it. As long as people believe it, they'll act on it in some regards, this meant they would backpedal on the golden path and possibly lead to humanity's extinction."
dune,2gxp9b,Psyladine,1 point,Mon Sep 22 13:16:19 2014 UTC,Because alien intelligence is outside the grasp of his prescience and the sandworms were likely brought to Dune by aliens long ago.

dune,2gv3nt,SpatulaPuppet,12,Fri Sep 19 14:46:03 2014 UTC,"Water doesn't poison the sand trout, only the worms. Sand trout actually seek out water, and entrap it well below the surface. When they absorb water, their excretions form a pre-spice mass, which grows like a fungus, and eventually explodes onto the surface. When this process of water entrapment becomes prevalant enough, and the environment is sufficiently dry, some of the sand trout that survive the spice blow can then grow into their second phase of life, as sandworms. Leto II in Children notes that sand trout originated off planet, ""eons ago"", but that's all we ever get."
dune,2gv3nt,ginbear,2,Fri Sep 19 16:16:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I was talking about the fish (razor fish?  hunter fish?  book is at home so I can't think of the name) that they use to keep the sand trout that they drown in its enclosure.  They mention them in Children of Dune (and the earlier novels if I recall)."
dune,2gv3nt,ginbear,2,Fri Sep 19 18:37:05 2014 UTC,"You mean the ""predator fish"" the Fremen keep in water reserves to keep the sand trout away? That's the only other fish I can think of. No idea where those come from."
dune,2gv3nt,naibenjamin,3,Fri Sep 19 19:01:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  I was wondering where they came from, but I guess they could have been purchased and brought from off world.  I had initially thought that since the Fremen put such a high value on all things natural the idea of bringing in foreign species may have been antithesis to them."
dune,2gv3nt,Kaneshadow,2,Sat Sep 20 00:01:30 2014 UTC,"I've always been a little confused in the life cycle of the sandworm. sand trout are basically a nymph type stage of the sandworm right? then develop into makers? if so, this question is asking the origins for the sandworm which as I recall is never fully explained in the books."
dune,2gv3nt,toxicasshole,7,Fri Sep 19 16:24:36 2014 UTC,Did you read the end of Children?  Leto explains a great deal of it.  Basically the 'trout stitch themselves together to encapsulate the water.  From there I assume they elongate into a tubular worm shape.
dune,2gv3nt,Kaneshadow,1 point,Fri Sep 19 17:09:28 2014 UTC,"This is a bit of personal speculation, but I've always assumed the rings in a mature worm were each grown from an individual post-larval sand-trout."

dune,2gv3nt,Kaneshadow,1 point,Sat Sep 20 22:22:30 2014 UTC,How big is a sand-trout? I remember a description of Fremen children playing with them and collecting some sort of water-based secretion on their fingers so I imagine a trout to be a protoplasmic blob about the size of a fingernail with a small number of cilia extending from its body.  It's been a very long time since I've read Dune but I'd love to compare head-canons as the kids say.
dune,2gv3nt,Superdorps,2,Sat Sep 20 22:31:44 2014 UTC,In my head they are hand-sized.  But I don't know if that's ever stated explicitly.  They're big enough for the kids to bite them and suck the goo out.  I imagine they're bigger than a fingernail.
dune,2gv3nt,Kaneshadow,2,Sat Sep 20 22:35:46 2014 UTC,"It's not stated exactly, but figure somewhere around eight inches square or so (because when Leto II starts putting them on his body, one of them covers his hand entirely to just below the wrist).  At least, that'd be my guess."

But rarely have I seen anyone booted from the place...  Compared to the official forum, where people are banned for asking the wrong questions, it is very, very open to controversy.  That said, it is mostly frequented by OHers and hence more welcoming to their discussions."

Those books suck, you shouldn't read them, they're the worst, DAE hate Brian and Kevin.  Someone should be allowed to bring up discussion regarding a novel and if you don't like that work then just walk away.  To address the actual post, I would say that one could write a lengthy, boring book about all the things that Thufir Hawat snuffed out.  Things only get interesting when he messes up.  That's at least how I always rationalized it.  He clearly wasn't perfect, even in the original novels by Frank.  Had he played the Arrakis Affair perfectly then Paul may never have become Muad'Dib.  Things only get interesting when your protagonists make a mistake."

If we're considering why he couldn't foresee the Harkonnen invasion of Arrakis then there's a lot of factors to consider. First off, the Harkonnens were incredibly wealthy as where the primary export for the Atreides was oranges. If you have more resources to devote to an effort than right from the start you're already leagues ahead of your competitors. Additionally, the Baron had be able to subvert a Suk doctor which at the time was unheard of, so it makes it difficult to factor something like that in. Even if Thufir did consider it he most likely dismissed it as unfeasible."

Frank's Hawatt seemed inteligent, competent, though getting old and stuck in his ways, perhaps. He did not see the fremen coming, nor the enormity of the plot against his Duke.

dune,2gjf6n,Rivven,14,Tue Sep 16 07:01:29 2014 UTC,"It's been more than a decade since I last re-read Dune, but here is what I remember.  Duncan saw them and they reminded him of  Facedancers. I think Daniel and Marty themselves talked about studying their former Tleilax masters. (EDIT: it's even more obvious than that )  The case is very strong for them being Facedancers or something that has evolved from face dancers.  It is also written in Chapterhouse that Duncan Idaho, by accessing hundreds of his past life memories, spread over thousands of years, triggered something in his mind, some new sense about the Universe, some new power similar to Kwisatz Haderach power (also thanks to him having Atreides genes), maybe in a similar way that Paul, Leto have memories of their ancestors, which seems be a pre-requisite to gaining prescient powers, a mechanism we didn't know about until it happened to Duncan in Chapterhouse.  This is what Tleilaxu master were probably aiming at, or just randomly experimenting with, when they created Duncan from cells of different past Duncan gholas.  So it is not far-fetched to think that during their past experiments they also somehow created creatures like Daniel and Marty who evolved into something similar to Kwisatz Haderach, just because of their gigantic pool of memories, which triggered the Kwisatz Haderach phenomenon, if I may call it like that. Also possibly with the help of Atreides genes, in which case Daniel and Marty could very simply be face dancers with Atreides genes, which is a sexy theory because it is so simple.  This is something that Leto II had obviously foreseen, which is why he ordered multiple Duncans, some of them 'custom ordered' with Atreides genes mixed-in, as he knew Tleilax masters would keep messing with Duncan in the future. He foresaw Daniel and Marty and their influence on events and knew the threat that they would represent to mankind, so he had to influence events by ordering special Duncans, which would result into creating a Kwisatz Haderach Duncan when Tleilax would mix all the cells into one ghola. A ghola able to see Daniel and Marty, and escape from them, which he did at the end of Chapter House when he jumped randomly into an unknown part of the Universe."

The Bene Gesserit suddenly sprout invisibility and psychic-attack powers, which they promptly forget about come Dune.  The Baron was made fat by others, vs. bringing it on himself and reveling in it.  When you dig into these, you end up having people claiming that basic, English sentences like ""on earth"" to mean ""on a satelite orbiting earth"" or ""you could never distrust a machine"" to mean ""machines betrayed us and alsmost wiped us out"".

dune,2g6b9l,akamerer,11,Fri Sep 12 05:08:23 2014 UTC,"Was green also the Atreides color? Maybe the rise of the house name had something to do with it?  Green makes sense in the traditional fremen sense to me. In a culture where the dead give their water to further the life of the people, it makes sense that the color of life and health is also the color of mourning. It symbolizes the growth and contribution the dead gave the tribe as a whole.  But then the Atreides took the fremen as their people and spilled death across the galaxy. Green has gone from the color of mourning to the very color of death itself. Also it's possible everybody wears green now, to support the new empire. On top of that the culture is now water-rich, where the sands are a sign of both death and times long past. I'd imagine yellow took place as a symbol for not forgetting who they truly were, fremen.  Long edit: answered when I first woke up and my brain didn't work right"
dune,2g6b9l,Alabast,3,Fri Sep 12 09:11:16 2014 UTC,"This was exactly what I was thinking. Green was predominant in the Atreides banner, so the color of mourning was changed to something else. They are a very traditional culture, but by the time a change is needed, they already worshipped Paul, and Alia had the priesthood to help introduce any changes. Easy to make it happen in that scenario."
dune,2g6b9l,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,2,Fri Sep 12 13:20:24 2014 UTC,"i'll hazard to guess that ""herbert and/or his editors didn't catch the discrepancy"" is not the answer you're looking for, and take a shot at answering.   i always thought it was weird that green was their mourning color. in a desert environment, what is green except for growing things? why would that be associated with mourning? whereas yellow is associated with the sun and the sands, both things that threaten death. without anything to back this up, i might postulate that after the jihad, after the fremen legions had seen countless green worlds and seen the changes begin on their own world, they mourned for the desert of their innocent past, and as such that color became the one of mourning.   that doesn't really explain why Alia and Ghani, who are fairly outside the stream of ""everyday"" fremen culture, would embrace what would have to be a fairly recent change in a VERY traditional culture, but thats as best as i can come up with."

I considered this, but it does show up more than once throughout the books, so it seems plausible that it was an intentional shift.   i always thought it was weird that green was their mourning color. in a desert environment, what is green except for growing things? why would that be associated with mourning?   You know, this makes me think of the funeral scene for Jamis, when part of his body's water is poured into the sietch reservoir. That reservoir, and the others like it, are integral to the plan for the massive geological transformation of Arrakis, and it stands to reason that a substantial portion of that reservoir might be filled with water of the dead. So maybe green is a mourning color because all those growing things the Fremen want to see on Dune are bought with their lives."

dune,2fw6ah,mattcolville,4,Tue Sep 9 13:48:37 2014 UTC,"It was made back when players were expected to play a game several times just to understand the rules. It's nothing like a modern game, but it's absolutely my all time favorite board game.  It was designed by the same dudes who did the original Cosmic Encounter, which was already a classic when the Dune boardgame came out, so players back then could be expected to understand the basics. The game is essentially a specific instantiation of Cosmic Encounter.  We'd consider a game like this broken in this day and age, but in an easily remedied way. At certain points in the game, players can ally. An alliance can be of any size and the size of the alliance doesn't change the win condition. So in a six player game, five players can shake hands and win and the sixth player can't do anything about it.  A common house rule, therefore, is to limit alliances to 2 players, and increase the number of strongholds they need to win by 1.  There's also a point in the game where players can bid on weapons and defenses, and this takes a long time for no good reason. Bidding requires you to go around the table, asking each player if they want to increase the bid on a card, and you do this for several cards each turn. It's easily the longest single element of a turn. And without commensurate drama.  So we borrowed the bidding rules from Shogun/Samurai Swords. Each player puts his bid in his hand, all players reveal their bid, highest bid wins. Done.   The game goes MUCH faster and nothing is lost."

dune,2fpz3r,thalendros,18,Sun Sep 7 14:50:07 2014 UTC,"As for some examples of what bothered me the most, there is a certain chapter wherein Tufir Hawat takes his suspicions about Jessica being the traitor to her. The talk they have in the chapter was the absolute worst part of the book for me. They are constantly thinking about hidden meanings and Jessica is prepping Hawat to say something to him and I still think I didn’t understand the most part of what they said. Why could Jessica not just make clear that she wasn’t the traitor?    Ok. Thufir is a mentat, which means he goes off 'data' to make a conclusion. Remember that a mentat is equivalent to a human computer, and can you simply just tell a computer to do something? No, you enter data to make a conclusion, mathematically. As a worldly example, if you were accused of murder in court, do you think saying 'I didn't do it' would work?  Obvious reasons aside, part of the entire scheme of the baron relies on Thufir arriving at the conclusion that Jessica is the traitor. All data points to her, as per the baron and Piter's plan, and the entire scene is meant for Jessica to sow the seeds of doubt in Thufirs mentat logic. You can't tell a mentat something and them believe it, so Jessica was 'prodding' Thufir through subtly that she was not the traitor so as Thufir would logically arrive at the conclusion that Jessica could be trusted. Remember also that Thufir does not like the B.G., another part of the picture that is incorporated into the argument. This means that Jessica had to explicitly use logic and subtly to prove her innocence over her B.G. manipulation.     This thinking about hidden meanings and carefully managing your words comes back a lot in the book, but that was the worst example for me. It just seems to over the top. I don’t hate the politics at all, it’s just these conversations that sometimes drive me mad.   This example falls flat. Part of me rages reading this. Dune is literally about what you just described as a reason you didn't like it. This isn't a kids book with pictures and large print. It literally focuses and has symbolism of words being tools of statecraft and double, sometimes too subtle meanings can mean entirely different things. For example, if two politicians are speaking about something, say tax or whatever, do you think they would come out and say 'taxes are good, more tax'? No. Did you watch the debates at all with Obama v Romney? There you go. Words and double meanings, with very little being answered. Herbert draws this to our attention with his writing and subtle word play. Herbert is trying to show you to always read more into everything a politician or leader will say, because often they are doing the exact thing Dune entails they do.    Examples of what I mean by deus ex machina are things like, when Jessica is trapped in the sand after the sandslide, Paul knows she will enter ‘bindu-suspension’. Why not add the urgency to find her and get rid of this suspension? It is part of her Bene Gesserit training, which comes back a lot and is the explanation for most of the things Jessica can do.    On this point, did you not read the passage? Why would anyone in a dire circumstance panic to get more efficiency? Bindu-suspension is a method to slow air intake and keep you alive for long periods under the sand. That said, have you ever seen a desert? Or even a dune at the beach? You can't just go digging into a dune willy nilly, part 1 because it's harder sand than you think. Part 2 because any movement will shift sand around you and create more to dig. Paul explicitly mentions he panics and has a sense of urgency, he even recites the litany against fear to calm him. In what situation is panicking and excitedly moving going to be a greater help than calm, thought out action? Paul knew she would enter suspension and thus it reassures him he can be calm and methodical to dig his mother out of certain death. Paul is also a trained B.G., explaining why he knew his mother would enter that state. Your claim here is a bit ridiculous for wanting someone to panic in a life or death situation.    Ok, I accept that she can do these things, but she always seems to keep her composure because of her training instead of acting like a normal human with emotions.    She's a B.G. did you skim over half the important bits? They are taught to control emotions, along with every muscle and nerve in their entire body. Did you see emotional reactions from Thufir the mentat even? No, because emotions have no place when you're being hunted down.    An example of other people doing this as well is when Chani returns to Jessica when Paul is in a coma (?). They greet each other in the ‘formal’ way, which is about a page long. In this, they mention grief and Chani wonders if Jessica is ‘preparing her for grief’. Then. Why. Doesn’t. She. Just. Ask. Why does it have to be 'formal'?   When you have sex, do you dive straight in and skip foreplay? Or do you perhaps take your time to make the end result more meaningful and enjoyable for both parties? There's a meme about Brian Herbert with the robot devil from Futurama that sums up nicely a reason why this is done: 'You can't just say how feel, that makes me feel angry!' It's called prose, again, if you want to think less and arrive to a conclusion, this series isn't for you. Every page in this book requires some measure of thinking and patience.    Also, why doesn’t Jessica just tell her? Chani wants to ask, wants to say ‘take me to him’, but she doesn’t. It seems like a missed chance to show some more emotion to me.    Jessica is Paul's mother, who is BG and reverend mother. What makes you think that if Chani asked that, she wouldn't be told 'what can you do that I haven't'? That aside, Chani does say 'take me to him', as she is the one who figures out Paul took the water. Remember also that Jessica isn't terribly fond of Chani, and that Jessica's reverend mother status demands certain respect and formality. Again though, Chani is taken to Paul, how you figure she got there if she didn't ask?  Remember that language is subtle, and again Herbert is trying to show you can use prose to say something without saying it directly.    The worst example of a deus ex machina for me was in the final fight of Paul fighting Feyd-Rautha. Feyd’s blade is poisoned, and Paul senses it when he is cut.  But then he realigns his own metabolism and changes the molecules of the poison.  What? I get that Paul is a prophet who can see into the future, but this? I actually laughed out loud about how ridiculous it was. It seems so random. The only thing I can think of that explains it is the same way how the Reverend Mother can change the Water of Life, but this is linked nowhere.   Did you miss the part where Paul is trained in the B.G. ways? You read the water of life ceremony with Jessica no? She changes around entire molecular chains to change the poison into water, and that didn't make you laugh out loud? Paul is the same, if not a better B.G. than Jessica herself, plus simply realigning metabolism is nothing compared to rearranging entire molecular structure, which a BG can do.     I really liked Dune. I really did. I love the setting, the world, the story, the characters. But these things really put me off sometimes. I was wondering if the next books have more thing like this, because if for example the political talks get more like I just described, I don’t think I can enjoy the books as much. I really want to read the sequels, but I’d like a heads up if a lot more (I don’t mind a bit) of these thing are coming my way. Anyway, feel free to say your thoughts on the matter, or even explain it to me if I have missed something about it.    I would recommend you re-read Dune before ever picking up Messiah because you absolutely will have no idea what's going on. Messiah is arguably the hardest of the trilogy to read because of the hidden meanings and political strife. You wouldn't understand a bit of it as you are, simply because your examples of what you don't like are the absolute reasons most of us fans DO like Dune. Every issue you have with Dune is a major component to what makes Dune, Dune. I'm sorry, but if you don't like the main style and ideas of Dune, then maybe the series isn't for you. This isn't a bad thing, but please don't call Dune bad writing for things that are over your head. Give it another read, and maybe a third read, and really try to process the nuances and subtly, along with what Herbert is trying to tell you; then come back to us here and see what you think."
dune,2fpz3r,enitnepres,1 point,Sun Sep 7 16:01:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks for clearing the chapter with Hawat up for me, it’s been a while since I’ve read it. I obviously didn’t understand all of it at the time, but I do get what the point of it was.  As for your next paragraph, sorry if I made you rage, it’s just that it’s sometimes over the top for me. Something I found in Dune, which also goes for your later explanations, is that you have to accept a lot of things. You have to take the authors word for it that these people can do the things they do because of their training or that is who they are. It comes with the worldbuilding, and sometimes I found it unconvincing. I hope that once I continue with the series a lot of these things will be self-explanatory. In the first book of a series you are confronted with new names and terms, and it can take a while before you understand everything about it. I’m sure when you read Dune for the first time you might have understood everything better than I did, but I’m also sure that you have a better understanding now because you read more of it (the series/rereads), not because you should have understood it completely from the first time.  I’ve read every letter of Dune, so you didn’t have to keep asking whether I read or know something. Yes, I remember the passage in which Jessica is under the sand. It just seems just so convenient to me that every time someone could panic, they don’t, because of their training for example, not because they use common sense or still manage to calm down some way. This is one of the thing I mentioned that you should just accept and move on, not wonder about.   As for the passage about Chani, there is a reason Jessica calls her back (even if she doesn’t know it yet). Not to inform her that the father of her child has been in a coma for three weeks mind you, but exactly because she can help. She suppresses the question to be taken do Paul at first, and later asks it. What I was talking about is the first moment. I get that she stays calm, but it would have been completely natural to show heavy emotion. But this is more in the style of Dune I understand now. Consider this a fault on my part.

Not only have you criticised something you didn't understand, but you aren't showing that you've really paid attention - follow that up with some tiny sense of what a story should be like (never mind that you're talking about one of the absolute classics) and you have a mix of ignorance and arrogance.

If you didn't get why people liked it, but said you hated it, then.. Well, then yeah I would.   I guess it depends on why you'd come and say that and why you didn't like it.   I can understand some people not liking it for a bunch of reasons - some people just hate the sci fi and fantasy genre.   But you criticised it for it's best features.

Not every plot device is a 'deus et machina' you seemed to throw the word around (like Jessica Atreides going into the prana bindu trance) . You failed to see that the whole segment was to demonstrate the usefulness of calm and training in a harsh environment, rather than a cheap plot device to get them out of a bind.   So your understanding of plot was way off, and your naive use of the term was a little embarrassing.   You kept asking why people didn't. Act. More. Natural. - falling to understand that these people were some of the most well trained people walking on a precipice of history.   Your talk of world building wasn't wrong, it just seemed like you shoe horned it into your post to try and seem like you knew more than you did, again, a little transparent.    As I have said before, the issue is not about maturity, but different opinions. I would like to leave it in peace saying that we both love Dune, but to a different extent, and that I still have a lot to read and learn about Dune.    ""the"" issue is what I personally think it is. You haven't convinced me otherwise - then again you're not obliged to.   I'm glad you like Dune, but I fear that you are missing layers of complexity as well as Herbert's strong messages about discipline, self control and how those are important to survival.

I've always felt like he was not as good of a writer because he just tells a story, where Frank weaves in a whole bunch of different layers.

You should probably stay away from the Brian Herbert and Kenvin J Anderson books though.

It really struck a chord with me.   but it seemed like the whole thing at the end with Irulan crying over Paul and that she loved him and didn't know it seemed kind of out of left field   There are many different kinds of love. Irulan never struck me as someone who was romantically in love with Paul, but rather a kind of ideological love. Paul was a Great Man (if you ascribe to that particular theory in regards to history, especially since Dune could be seen as a critique of Great Man theory), and the choices he made/created were almost entirely selfless; Irulon eventually saw that as being a greater ideology than the rather selfish and vapid beliefs of the Bene Gesserit of the time period.  That's always what I got out of her character, anyway. She was a sort of parallel with Jessica: one broke from the Bene Gesserit because of the love of her man,  Irulan did so because of the love her man created in all around him."

Third one goes back to having an action packed plot and still has a lot of character development and a lot of introspection. 4rth one is almost purely philosophical but the scenario presented fascinated me so much that its my favorite. 5th and 6th are pretty much your avarage space opera but are still good."

The BG, the Spacing Guild, other Houses, and family was after him.   He couldn't do what needed to be done.     She saw him as great, and humanity's hope, and was better fit to rule than her father.

dune,2f6fys,neightdog,12,Mon Sep 1 16:22:51 2014 UTC,"Leto could actually move quite adroitly in his sandworm body; Baron Harkonnen could barely roll over by himself. For Leto, it was a matter of convenience rather than necessity."
dune,2f6fys,abnmfr,1 point,Mon Sep 1 17:33:50 2014 UTC,"The cart wasn't just there for mobility though. I can't remember if it's stated explicitly, but I always assumed that it provided extra protection from atmospheric moisture. Iirc in addition to the 'hood' he could close it with, it had interior fans etc. that dried the air inside of the cart."
dune,2f6fys,Joomes,10,Mon Sep 22 14:56:08 2014 UTC,"Interesting thought! The Baron is part of Leto II (just as everyone else, but he is a strong personality seeing as he was able to take over Alia). It does seem like Leto is enjoying distressing Moneo with his grossness, I'm specifically thinking about the scene right after the first assassination attempt when one of his flippers were damaged.  Both suspensor systems are likely both used for comfort but also to lure people into a false sense of security as both Leto and the Baron display bursts of quickness using the suspensors (and Leto even without them). Leto is also using his commission of a new bigger cart to signal that he will grow even larger, probably to subtly distress Ix with the connection physical size and the reach of his power. He wants them to constantly worry about him to drive their innovation of technology to evade his reach."
dune,2f6fys,soylentblueissmurfs,4,Mon Sep 1 17:34:13 2014 UTC,"I think there could be something to that. I forget exactly where it was, but I remember in Dune Baron Harkonnen thinking of himself as a predator, and then in God Emperor Leto II describes himself as the ultimate predator for mankind. So the suspensors could be another way of creating links between the two of them."
dune,2f6fys,RadomirPutnik,4,Mon Sep 1 20:22:01 2014 UTC,"This could indicate the Baron had some inkling of Leto II's predator concept. Remember that the BG's original plan was for Jessica to produce a daughter who would be wed to Feyd, creating the intended Kwisatz Haderach one generation later. This means that the Harkonnen bloodline had some qualities related to Paul and his powers. It is not ridiculous to suppose that the Baron, who was a very formidable (if grotesque) figure, might have sensed some element of the Golden Path and it's need for a hard, predatory tyrant."
dune,2f6fys,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,6,Mon Sep 1 23:16:46 2014 UTC,"I don't really think that the Baron had any idea about the golden path. The Baron was a predator because he enjoyed it. Leto was a predator because he had to be for the survival of mankind. The Baron enjoyed inflicting pain and death. Leto, again, did everything he did out of necessity.   If anything, I would say that Leto used the Baron's presence in other memory for his cunning and ruthlessness, because he knew it was needed. But it could just as easily have been a prime aspect of Harum (the personality that reined in the council of other memory personas and protected Leto from possession) as anything else. In fact, If I had to guess, I would presume that situation to be the most likely scenario, as I dont see any Atreides being likely to put any trust in the Baron Harkonnen.  Especially Leto, having seen the dangers of possession in Alia."
dune,2f6fys,RadomirPutnik,3,Tue Sep 2 05:12:11 2014 UTC,"I would agree that the Baron wouldn't have a conscious knowledge of the Path, or embraced it for the benefit of mankind. That was not his nature. But the tendency towards cruelty and oppression, even if merely instinctual, could have been a necessary element of creating the KH. A large part of Leto's Golden Path was the realization that some cruelty and oppression was necessary for the greater good. The Harkonnen bloodline may have been the vehicle for that capacity, which was not apparent in the Atreides nature. A bit of Harkonnen nastiness may have been considered a necessary evil, at least for the BG's conception of the Kwisatz."

I interpret that to be the sandworm transformation, that he could have gone through as Leto II has.   But if I recall correctly he doesn't passively foresee the future as it will be, but he has to actively look along the various avenues of time to see what choices will bring which futures. Plus, he mentioned not being able to see certain parts just like the dunes of the desert obscure one's sight.   I think it's entirely possible that the pressure became too great for him and he stopped looking at a certain point. But it seems unlike Paul to not feel responsible. So now you mention it I think he may have foreseen that the terrible future could be saved by his son, and that he then made the choices so that the conditions were right for Leto to become what Paul himself could not be. Those conditions might include Alia's usurping."

In fact I remember he made choices exactly contrary to paths he had seen, so that his future will be fresh.   I don't know. I really like the idea though, it seems very much like Paul to keep that backup plan.  But that does make that part in Children of Dune, where Leto tries to convince Paul to help him on his Golden Path, sort of an act on Paul's part. IIRC he first denies help, then accepts when Leto convinces him of the threat that he will try to thwart."

Jessica really should've drank that Water of Life AFTER she was born. But because of the Fremen were being hunted down and had to move, they had to rush the ritual.

dune,2eunzf,StumbleOn,2,Fri Aug 29 20:13:35 2014 UTC,"We know that Paul foresaw much of the future and saw a path too terrible to follow through himself. I interpret that to be the sandworm transformation, that he could have gone through as Leto II has.   In the last ""scene"", Leto basically admonishes Paul for seeing turning himself (Paul) into a worm and not taking that path, telling Paul that he (Leto) is doing what Paul himself was unwilling to do.   As far as ""letting"" Alia to be possessed in order to ""allow"" Leto to rule, I think there is sufficient evidence against that. First, when the twins are making their plans, they have to continually change them based on what Alia is doing, up until they separate. This suggests that whatever they see Alia doing, it's not set in stone. Second, when Alia is given the option to be saved, and she is so conflicted whether or not to be saved or to die, again shows that her fate was never 100% set in stone. Personally, I see her fate being more similar to Leto I in the first book, rather than to Beast Rabban."

dune,2eu89k,madmonk13,9,Thu Aug 28 17:24:15 2014 UTC,"One thing that doesn't come up in the books is relativistic time changes: e.g., the ages of the characters in the stories being shifted drastically in relation to other characters by space travel.  With that in mind, I would think that ""Fold-Space"" travel would be better described as instantaneous or near instantaneous rather than ""faster than light"" (which, although accurate, wouldn't be a strong enough indicator of the speed of the travel)."
dune,2eu89k,bil3y_d4_k1b,2,Thu Aug 28 17:39:25 2014 UTC,"Those relativistic effects happen when accelerating toward the speed of light. A staple of science fiction is that FTL travel isn't an object physically moving faster than light, but changing a property of the universe to make it seemingly move faster than the speed of light. E.g. if you travel 1 light year in 1 day, you didn't physically travel 1 light year, but warped the fabric of the universe for the distance to be temporarily much shorter. Or, I think the way Star Trek works is to change the matter in a bubble around the object moving.  In other words, I wouldn't read into the lack of relativistic effects as prescriptive of the function of how folding space works in Dune."
dune,2eu89k,dauntlessmath,2,Thu Aug 28 23:29:03 2014 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense- understood. I have a degree in comp. sci. (and have read a good deal of sci-fi), but haven't studied much physics."

dune,2eu89k,ItFrightensMe,5,Thu Aug 28 18:11:27 2014 UTC,Think of a piece of paper. To get from one side to the other you would follow a straight line across it and it takes time to do so.   In fold space you would literally fold the paper so the starting and end point would be right on top of eachother.   The navigator makes sure that you don't fold your starting point with a Sun or asteroid that would destroy your ship.
dune,2eu89k,TheSilentWatcher,2,Thu Aug 28 17:48:31 2014 UTC,The paper metaphor is the same used when describing wormhole travel.  I guess the difference between wormhole travel in other sci-fi vs Dune would be that in Dune the Navigator creates the wormhole instead of it being a natural phenomenon.
dune,2eu89k,Chomra,7,Thu Aug 28 18:02:53 2014 UTC,"I've always read it that the Foldspace engines do the moving, the Navigator just makes sure they ship doesn't hit anything mid fold."

dune,2eu89k,TheSilentWatcher,2,Fri Aug 29 17:38:27 2014 UTC,"Actually there may be another difference.  None of the books mention entering anything.  The ships just travel in place.

dune,2eu89k,wedge713,2,Thu Aug 28 18:07:04 2014 UTC,True. There isn't much description on the actual travel. I always invisioned it as the paper analogy but you would take a paper punch and make a hole that the ship would fly through. Slightly different to imagine with real space and 3d.
dune,2eu89k,TheSilentWatcher,2,Thu Aug 28 18:12:03 2014 UTC,"In Lynch's movie when the ship folds space it just instantaneously moves from one place to another.  You get to see the ship just appear.

They were contacted by the first guild navigator who transcended into a merging of space and consciences.   Maybe this is where the ships slip into before as they travel."
dune,2eu89k,vinsneezel,3,Thu Aug 28 19:10:57 2014 UTC,"Possibly. They do, however, describe it as another universe. It doesn't make much sense to me to have to go through another universe to get to different places in ours."

dune,2eu89k,TheSilentWatcher,3,Thu Aug 28 22:20:25 2014 UTC,"The books really don't describe it in detail.  I believe it's a near instant point-to-point translation, based on the movie and other sources (the paper metaphor in Event Horizon seems perfect to describe what I imagine Fold Space to be).  It is caused by the drive system on the ship, NOT the magical powers of Navigators, contrary to what the Lynch movie might show, and it's a very common misconception."
dune,2eu89k,ancientvoices,2,Thu Aug 28 20:44:16 2014 UTC,"Agreed. The ship folds the space, the navigator chooses the points."
dune,2eu89k,ancientvoices,2,Thu Aug 28 22:14:38 2014 UTC,"Some have mentioned that the Navigators (or Holtzmann engines) cause two points in space to coexist, but I think it would make more sense in context for the Navigator to be causing the ship itself to exist in two places. They have direct control over the ship and the ability to manipulate simple matter seems more probable to me than trying to manipulate the gravity, magnetism, etc of two points in space to make the ship transfer. This would also explain the 'winking'/instantaneous and lack of movement between places. Exist at point A, exist at both point A & B for an indiscriminate amount of time, and then the Navigator cancels out the existence at point A. But Herbert doesn't really delineate any of the details, so I'm just speculating. Fold-space is my all time favorite answer to space travel, it's so elegant.  Also, now that I'm thinking about it, the Navigators would actually be looking into the past or present, wouldn't they? It takes the light from stars billions of years to reach Earth, so we can only make guesses as to what's happening right now at those stars. If a Navigator is trying to move a ship to a planet light-years away, wouldn't they have to look at how the star system is aligned at that same moment, not necessarily into the future? I suppose it would be 'the future' relative to the light shining on them at that moment, but it's definitely not time-travel as it's commonly perceived. Or does winky-wonky space-time have a larger part to play that I'm missing?"

I normally recommend my friends read Franks books first and then start on the prequel. Not everyone in this sub will agree with you and I, but I honestly liked the prequels as long as they're taken independent from the main story line.   The actual Frank Herbert books are a different beast. Expect more nuance and less in your face action. But they're hands down the best. If I were in your shoes I'd read the prequel, then Franks books and end it at Chapterhouse.   You won't have to worry about the books dying down. They're incredibly good."

However, frank Herbert is an amazing author and I had no trouble meeting new characters as the books progress.   Tbh though I wouldn't read any of the other Brian Herbert books.

Part of the mystique and grandeur of the original series is somewhat being in the dark about what happened during the Butlerian Jihad. However, finishing the series with Hunters and Sandworms, you almost need to read the Butlerian Jihad series to understand how EVERYTHING comes together.   TL:DR?

dune,2egj6g,kengou,10,Fri Sep 5 23:27:30 2014 UTC,"Aside from knives and swords (typically rapiers) there are lasguns, projectile weapons (typically only ever seen on Arrakis, they'd make no sense elsewhere), and ""slow pellet stunners"" which are only vaguely mentioned.  As far as fighting techniques go, there are clearly several different types of fighting in the Dune universe.  Shields necessitate a slow-offense fast-defense style of fighting, and typically have two weapons, often a short and long blade, both tipped with poison.  Deep or hard cuts and blows are deflected by the shield, so only the slightest prick is enough to kill enemies; thus, bladed weapons which are very light would be favored.  Without a shield, swords would be preferable to knives in hand-to-hand combat, but poison remains as effective as with a shield.  This type of melee combat would look much like sword or knife fighting looks in the present time.  The only time I recall seeing blade fighting without a shield is in the gladiatorial arena with Feyd Rautha, but it could happen in a few circumstances like assassinations.  Those living on Arrakis would most likely have little need for poison tipped blades, preferring Crysknives (for Fremen) and regular knives/swords (for others).  However, since shields outside of the major cities are inoperable, make sure your desert-fighters have old fashioned projectile guns.  They're effective and cheap.  If you have characters with Bene Gesserit training, you could easily make up some ""weirding"" techniques only available to them and not more normal characters; for example, the extremely precise toe-kick to puncture an organ (from Dune) is something I don't believe anyone BUT a bene-gesserit-trained fighter could pull off.  You may also have traits for your characters like ""shield trained"" which would incur some negative dice modifiers when that character fights without a shield, since they wouldn't be used to it.  There's plenty of material to play around with using examples from the books.  Best of luck!"

dune,2dy0ru,dig1tGG,6,Tue Aug 19 02:23:21 2014 UTC,Welcome to Dune! You've actually started with one of the prequel novels written by Frank Herbert's(author of Dune & the original novels) son. You can check out the chronology of the series on this page. If you have any other questions feel free to ask!
dune,2dy0ru,IVHoltzmann,6,Tue Aug 19 02:46:41 2014 UTC,"This depends on what kind of stuff you like in your books. The original series explores a number of philosophical and political ideas and concepts, while the prequels and sequels to the original books are much more straight-forward plot-driven science fiction.  If you have no huge preference I would strongly advise you to read the original series by Frank Herbert before moving on to read the prequels.  The original series (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God-Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune) can be considered to have different canon to the prequels and sequels written by Frank's son Brian, and Kevin Anderson. The reason I say this is that a lot of the backdrop to the Dune universe is left intentionally vague, or only partially explained by the author in the original series, whereas the prequels and sequels often deal explicitly with various items of history and culture that are left up to reader interpretation in the original series.  This means that the reason I'd suggest you start with the original series is twofold. Firstly, they're just better books, but secondly it will be much easier to remember which bits of lore and canon are from the original 'core' canon, and which bits are from the new expanded stuff that's been written more recently. This second part is also kind of born out of thinking the original series is just straight-up better thought-out and written, including all the backstory lore etc. that the new books tried to expand; I like being able to keep straight which bits of lore go with which 'version' of the Dune universe you're referring to."

dune,2dy0ru,FlowTheSpiceMust,2,Tue Aug 19 14:37:37 2014 UTC,You've got yourself in a pickle! As others have said you started on the 2nd book in a prequel trilogy. These take place long before the original 6 Dune series. I read the original 6 then came back to the trilogy you've started and found it to be more enjoyable than I imagine it would be reading them chronologically. I highly suggest stopping and reading the original 6 first. Going back and discovering the origins of characters and factions you already know is rather enjoyable

dune,2dv0m4,Pentay,1 point,Mon Aug 18 22:11:27 2014 UTC,"Hmmm. Interesting! I hadn't considered the thought. I figured 'messiah' implied religion, since otherwise it might just be a coming-of-age story... What do you think of:   Dune is a messiah story with many elements of political, socio-economical, spiritual, religious and evolutionary commentaries woven into a subtle storyline that exalts the human condition without glorifying it.   I added 'evolutionary' because of the God-emperor conversations, which are topics which only make sense when you span thousands of years, but it's not really the right word."
dune,2dv0m4,Trevoke,1 point,Tue Aug 19 02:12:47 2014 UTC,"Well I think it's a lot better.

I can't help but picture him as a 6'6"" version of the dwarf from LotR (Gimli?). Hawat and Yeuh are spot on!   I'm not sure about Idaho. I can't really picture him exactly, I just think he looks less... lenny kravitz-y. And those arguing that Idaho could have been black, I seem to remember a lot being said about Idaho being an Arteides in God Emperor, what with Leto using him for his breeding program. That and in Heretics, one of the young gholas is specifically described as having a tanned face, but pale shoulders. It's somewhere in the first 2-3 chapters.  Good takes on Paul and Duke Leto. I always imagined them with different hair, but still good. Lady Jessica seems spot on as well, maybe could be a pinch taller. I think I remember her being described as not quite middle aged but looking younger than she actually was (could just be my imagination, after all, I picture her as an empowered Olivia Wilde)."
dune,2dueky,babybabyhaha,2,Mon Aug 18 18:24:12 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  I dunno, I pictured him on the squat side, with a gut, since he's referred to as a ""lump of a man"" on numerous occasions, but it's up to speculation. I personally liked the variety he brought along with the shapes of the other characters.   Same with Idaho, again I haven't read any of the other books at this point, so my concept is solely based on what I read in the first Dune novel, which of course is also up to interpretation."
dune,2dueky,Sandwormwood75,2,Mon Aug 18 22:21:18 2014 UTC,"Dude, you've gotta start reading them. The story really shifts tone beginning in the 2nd book on. It's much more philosophical than the first one as well. Dune Messiah is the second one, which is short and sets the stage for the third book, Children of Dune (my favorite). Children of Dune jumps to God Emperor of Dune (no spoliers), which jumps to Heretics, the one I'm currently reading. It's worth investing the time."

dune,2dueky,Chewblacka,1 point,Mon Aug 18 23:32:10 2014 UTC,"Vibroblade:       A vibroblade resembled a short sword with a high-tech look and feel and consisted of the same basic design as other vibroweapons: the weapon's hilt or handle usually contained a compact ultrasonic generator, causing the blade to vibrate at an incredible speed, making even the slightest glancing blow become a gaping wound. Vibroblades were dangerous to use against electrical weapons, as they conducted electricity.  Electrocution, however, would be the wielder's last concern. Traveling up the length of the blade, the electricity would connect with a vibroblade's energy cell and ultrasonic vibration generator. The result would be a miniature explosion with enough force to take off a hand. Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Movies are visual, and I think Lynch's interpretation of the Weirding way doesn't at all conflict with Maud'Dib's transformation of the Fremen from a savage tribal existence to a force so strong that it changes the fate of the known universe.   In the novels, Maud'Dib's name is a killing word in the sense that his name is on the lips of every fighter he inspired, so in a sense the sound of his name was a weapon.

God Emperor Leto, however, does have the memories of the entire human race. He did know Paul as a young adult in his first life and so can talk about him. He uses the term ""Muad'dib"" because that is how Paul was known. The last Duncan Idaho in the later books had the memories of all the Duncan Idahos restored and so he can remember the Paul from the second book. Jacurutu was a place where an outcast tribe of fremen had their seitch. (They were outcast because they stole water). This tribe was wiped out and the fremen declared Jacurutu to be forbidden.  So then the spice smugglers took up residence there because they knew it to be the perfect place to not be bothered by fremen. Can't really explain this one. Just a decision made by Mr. Herbert I guess.  It may be mentioned it later books - I am not sure."
dune,2dpvcl,mjquigley,2,Sat Aug 16 15:11:59 2014 UTC,"(1) To add to that, going back far enough, everyone is related, so BG Other Memory reaches very far and wide. but only in the female line.   I don't think Leto had access to the memories of everyone who has lived. He had Other Memory and prescience though, and his other memory wasn't limited to one sex.   (2) I noticed this too on my read through, Duncan does seem to remember things about Paul that happened while he was dead. This is an issue that comes up in God Emperor. Duncan at this point is a ghola, made from cells from the original Duncan Idaho. So when his ghola memory is awakened, he only has access to memories up untill the point that he saves Lady Jessica and Paul and sacrifices himself. Only after this, Paul begins his rise as Mahdi, and takes the name Paul Muad'Dib.   But the Duncan in God Emperor appears to describe Paul as he knew him, as a young man, and refers to him as Muad'Dib. These memories could only have come from the first Idaho ghola: Hayt.  It is a little inconsistent. There is evidence that the God Emperor's Duncans were made from Hayt cells, as he also remembers Chani as well as Ghanima and Leto II:  ""Idaho remembered a strange child-twins, really: Leto and Ghanima, Paul's children, the children of Chani, who had died delivering them. The Tleilaxu history said Ghanima had died after a relatively normal life, but the God Emperor Leto lived on and on and on .... ""  But there is also evidence against it:  ""The wily Tleilaxu still produce my Duncans from the original cells."" ""There have been slips, the fake Paul slain and the Duncans wasted. But there are always more cells carefully preserved from the original.""   ""I remember my death,"" Idaho said.

dune,2dpvcl,Ace1999,1 point,Mon Aug 18 10:05:31 2014 UTC,"1) The Bene Gesserit had a practice of sharing memories at death. IIRC Jessica receives Reverend Mother Ramallo's at her death, during the water of life ceremony (this is why they had to rush the ceremony, because Ramallo was dying and if she didn't share her memories then they would be lost forever). This practice exponentially increases the reach of Other Memory. Jessica now has all of the memories of her past ancestors, RM Ramallo's memories and all of her ancestors, plus the memories of the women who shared their memories with RM Ramallo as well as all of their ancestors, on and on. At least, this is what I took away from it.  2) When it comes to Duncan, I just kind of say 'magic' and let it go. The later books...well, let's just say they're not without their faults. This is one.  4) I personally think this is a test of will. Most animals recoil from pain and will try to flee; this is assumed to be a base instinct. If a person removes their hand from the box, that means (to the BG at least) that they do not possess the strength of will that differentiates humans from animals. A human can use it's intellectual strength to overcome physical pain, similar to how the BG manipulate their own cells but in a much less literal way."

But, I just watch it to be in that world for a little while. I think David Lynch did a great job creating one possible vision for Dune.  But, there are a couple reasons that the movie is flawed:   Dune is a complex, dense and fascinating book. It is a challenge to boil all of that down into a movie script. The movie was made in a time (1984) when movie studios were not keen on making three movies to explain one book. So, shortcuts and plot changes were necessary to make the movie work in the 2 hour movie time frame.   That being said, I don't think it is impossible to make this movie, but there needs to be the money, dedication and vision to do it. For a fascinating account of one famous failed attempt in 1975, you've got to see the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune."

dune,2djxjp,daveuclahorn,16,Thu Aug 14 16:50:37 2014 UTC,"The sequels are definitely worthwhile. The first two sequels, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune are direct continuations of the story that begins in Dune. The third, fourth, and fifth sequels take the story in a very different direction.   I would suggest doing some research to see if the sequels sound interesting to you and continue or not on that basis."
dune,2djxjp,rclowery624,11,Thu Aug 14 17:01:38 2014 UTC,"They are incredibly necessary, imo.  The entire series has a story and theme that carries over for millennia; the first Dune is just the prologue to the TRUE story.  I can't imagine the Dune series as individual books, it really is (more than) the sum its parts."
dune,2djxjp,kengou,9,Thu Aug 14 17:13:40 2014 UTC,"The fourth book is the best in the series, in my opinion."
dune,2djxjp,Thooorin_2,15,Thu Aug 14 21:19:07 2014 UTC,"Dune 1 is very much a scifi adventure with some politics and cool tech. Messiah is a ridiculously deep philosophical and political book, and Children is more story-focused (like Dune 1) but represents the conclusion of the politics from Messiah.  The second trilogy is a completely another animal. Set millennia in the future, everything has changed and thus every single plot point is the realization of some thread from the first trilogy. God Emperor is another very political and philosophical book, carried by dialogue between some of the better characters in the series. Heretics and Chapterhouse are a continuous story further exploring this new world, new characters, and the same themes from a very different perspective.  The Prelude books, Hunters, Sandworms, and Heroes are all, frankly, awful. They don't even rise to mediocrity when it comes to science fiction, and there's so much great sci fi in the world that there's no reason to read it. While everyone knows Herbert meant to write another Dune novel, and Hunters/Sandworms claims to be that novel, there's so many places where its obvious the authors filled in the blanks without comprehending even a little bit the deeper thematic sweep of the series. The ending of Chapterhouse is cliffhanger, but in some ways that's very appropriate for the series.  The Legends series is basically a story all unto itself. Like I said, the prose doesn't even break into mediocre, but the story, when taken by itself, is kind of fun.  So, in other words, Dune represents a sort of prequel to a really massive and deep exercise about the universe and the fate of the human race. The sequels are better than Dune in one way or another, and I'd hazard to say the second trilogy is even better than the first."
dune,2djxjp,ulvok_coven,3,Thu Aug 14 17:54:11 2014 UTC,"Wow thanks for the great summary, after these responses I think I'll definitely finish the first trilogy and then take a break to see if I miss it and want to tackle the second trilogy.  The first book was much more intelligent and political than other sci-fi I've read recently and was pretty refreshing (but at the same time more challenging).  Glad to see there's a solid subreddit dedicated to the series as well."
dune,2djxjp,rclowery624,-1,Thu Aug 14 18:16:31 2014 UTC,"It's not a second trilogy, that guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  God Emperor of Dune is a standalone book, and arguably the most important one in the saga."
dune,2djxjp,ulvok_coven,-1,Fri Aug 15 07:33:00 2014 UTC,"The second trilogy   There is no second trilogy. Just because there are 3 books left after Children, it does not mean that they form a trilogy. God Emperor is a standalone book.  In fact, Heretics was the first book in what would have been the second trilogy, Chapterhouse was the second, and Dune7 would have been the third.  Except there is no Dune 7. Therefore there is no second trilogy."

And if you think GEoD is really standalone, you don't understand the series on any more than a superficial level.

I think it does a great job of continuing the story and giving you another view of some of the main characters.   Children of Dune I was on the fence about. I didn't find the story as interesting and it didn't do much for me. I would recommend at least reading the second one, because doing that made me read the third."
dune,2djxjp,Kills_Zombies,4,Mon Aug 18 05:06:55 2014 UTC,At least read Messiah and Children of Dune. Those follow up directly with the events of Dune and are definitely worth while.

dune,2djxjp,FiggNewton,2,Thu Aug 14 18:12:04 2014 UTC,"The (Frank Herbert) sequels are at least as important to your understanding of Dune as the The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are to your understanding of why Luke and Anakin Skywalker were the important characters of the original Star Wars Trilogy.  Also, I'd say it is quite important that Dune: Messiah through Chapterhouse: Dune be read in sequence. While some have events transpire between the end of one and the beginning of the next, the rest very adeptly carry the story's thread in a hand-to-hand fashion, and, more importantly, they carry it in such a way as to constantly shed light on the facets of the preceding novels while simultaneously reminding the reader (i.e., you) that the illumination provided is also a highlight of the shadows it casts, in that all that is revealed is part of a greater philosophical approach to the continuity of human life.  TL;DR The more of the Dune novels you read (and especially in immediate sequence) the more of the overall Dune universe you will understand, especially in reference to the importance of each and every decision by each and every character (which resonate throughout the entire Frank Herbert narratives) which may not have seemed to be of any great import at the time they were made.  STL;SDR: If you liked Dune, read the rest of the Frank Herbert series. It will do nothing but expand your thoughts on and understanding of the first novel.  Edit: Don't read the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson prequels/sequels unless you want to delve into the territory of numbered installations (e.g.: Friday The Thirteenth v. Jason X). One is indisputably wonderful canonical story-crafting, and one is an installation of enthusiasm inches away from mindless and page-turning entertainment within the framework provided and is truly and individually (person-to-person and book-to-book, much like Jason X or Rocky V) merit-based."

Without the actual Rules of Kanly in front of me, I couldn't say for sure what was allowed and what wasn't, but you can get a pretty good idea from the context. For instance, the assassination attempt on Paul with the Hunter-Seeker seems to have been allowed under Kanly."

And certainly the surface-level plot is not even remotely the whole story of Dune; there's so much philosophy and thematic underpinnings that take multiple readings and analysis to really get fully.  That's probably what people refer to when they say it takes a few readings to ""get"" the first book.  They're referring to everything BUT the plot.  The other 5 books, though, are quite a bit more complex in plot and universe-building, and I encourage you to continue with reading them."

Noble family betrayed and destroyed, surviving heir and his mother rally the natives and revolt, young hero returns triumphant, gets the girl, and becomes emperor.  But then you have to go deeper. What were the motivations? What do the people and the characters represent? How did the subtle things in the first book set up the sequels? Is Paul really a hero? What are the implications of his revolution? How has upsetting the power base changed the stability of the empire? Why did it matter that Paul cried for Jamis, and by extension, what did that, combined with the Missionaria Protectiva, do to royally fuck up everything in the future?"

dune,2dalyc,unklespaz,1 point,Sat Aug 16 16:15:42 2014 UTC,"Well, in the books it said Muad'dib was entirely and fully aware of the plan to take a worm from Arrakis. I wanna say Stilgar offered to stop it, but Muad'dib said to let it happen the way he knew it would and that just one worm wasn't enough to start a new spice cycle. I wanna believe Edric was sent under pretense to deliver the Ghola Idaho, but another reason for both his and Mohiam's visit was to muck up Muad'dib's prescience enough to kidnap a worm without him knowing exactly where. That's just a theory of mine though.   You also have to remember at the time of Messiah, Muad'dib wasn't very popular among actual Fremen, as he had been called water-fat by true Fremen. Most of the Fremen that were against Muad'dib were probably in on the actual worm-abduction plot themselves, as many of the supports of the plot against Muad'dib were high ranking Fremen such as Fedaykin and Naib; two sects of very powerful and knowledgeable Fremen. I'd argue many of the desert Fremen were either aware of the plot and helped guard it, or were unaware and chose to remain simple Fremen at different areas of the desert. Once you account for all the smugglers that could be bought, and Fremen who could be controlled through promises of old time, combined with Muad'dib's murky visions,  kidnapping a worm wouldn't be that hard."

It bears some resemblance to the first book in terms of overall plot, but there's a lot of stuff that Lynch changed in there.  I think what that film accomplishes best is done visually.

FWIW I don't really think your enjoyment of the books will be spoiled in retrospect if you watch this spectacular visual treat.  Granted, it is a Lynch film and therefore disjointed and strange, granted it does not follow the storyline religiously, nor even closely at times, but (and these are the words of Frank himself) visually it is almost exactly how Herbert pictured the people and places in the Dune universe...it also has Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, the best match of role and actor I could possibly think of! And the rest of the casting is almost spot on as well.      Lose yourself in what could be described as a tribute to Dune - to my mind Lynch's Dune is closer in concept and more faithful to the original ideas than say, Star Wars Episode 1 was to the original Star Wars, but ""it does not survive whole"" :-).  Just remember that the film had to make shortcuts to get under time limits, budgets, technological constraints, contractual obligations and the usual film guff to even make it to the screen in the first place!"

Even if we would have access to all the footage, we can't remedy those.  But truly, you are correct. This film is probably as close we are going to get to the feeling of the book. Read, then watch with an open mind and no expectations."
dune,2czdxw,Malk25,2,Fri Aug 8 20:28:21 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with you about the cuts, the weirding modules and the rain - both Herbert and Lynch did explain the reason behind the rain and modules...the modules were because there was not the technology available at the time to show the 'blurring moves' of the Weirding Way the Fremen had learned under Jessica and Paul (and Lynch/Herbert did not want 'just another Kung-Fu movie') and the rain was put in at the end to provide a conclusion to the quest that the Fremen were on in the film, namely to obtain enough water to change the face of Arrakis.  Herbert was dissatisfied with the ending, because he wanted to show the perils of someone PLAYING at being a god, not a man BECOMING a god and being able to make it rain.  I got this from a preface to an anthology of FH short stories, where Herbert wrote about his experience of making the film with Lynch.  I for one would truly love to see a proper, sympathetic rendering of the story with today's technology - imagine what it would look like, shot by Lynch but with the feel of something like ""Gravity"".  It would be awesome!"

dune,2cypwt,JohnZoidberg42,13,Fri Aug 8 08:26:48 2014 UTC,"Basically the Spacing Guild has a monopoly on interstellar travel.  Interplanetary travel or travel from surface to orbit/moons can be done without the use of the Holtzmann engines folding space and a Guild Navigator's prescience to guide them.    The Guild will transport anyone and anything provided that you play by the Guild's rules.  In the first book, when the Atreides are on the Heighliner on their way to Dune, Paul looks out the window of their lighter (which is a smaller craft capable of landing on a planet's surface) and sees a lot of similar craft.  Duke Leto mentions that some of the ships may be Harkonnen, but they need not fear for their safety as nobody would risk losing their ability to travel by firing upon another vessel while they're under the protection of the Guild.  The Guild's ban on satellites over Dune is due to bribes paid by the Fremen so the Emperor / fief-holder of Dune would not be able to see their terraforming project from space.  I don't believe it's mentioned again in the story, so I'm not sure if there are similar guidelines in place at every planet."

Basically navigators are the only ones who can navigate folded space for long distances since the spice allows them to see into the future so that they don't run into a planet or sun. There was faster then light travel before they discovered folding space but it required thinking machines (navigation computer) so after the ban on thinking machines folding space was developed which was also faster.   The smugglers would take off from the surface and then get into a guild Heighliner to jump far distances.

dune,2cp2pj,Ace1999,2,Wed Aug 6 23:13:50 2014 UTC,"!!!! possible spoilers if you haven't read God Emperor!!!!  I have problems with these answers; not to argue as most forum threads go but just in the spirit of intellectual debate :) So, mentats, let me posit this: Prescience wasn't/isn't/won't be absolute. There are many possible futures just as there are many possible paths through fold-space. A navigator selects the ""best possible"" course based on his prescience. Other paths might also get you to your destination but at possibly higher risk/longer time. It is a choice though- through prescience they see possible consequences of every choice. Then they pick one. Think this way: good chess masters consider the effect of their actions several moves ahead. A mentat projection is a mathematical/statistical of a huge amount of data but comes down to IF/THEN... taken through several orders. Those with prescience can ""see"" and mystically comprehend all of a universe worth of data and make projections to an order far beyond any human or thinking machine. In the end though, all they can (or want to) see are moves/options/paths and the most likely results of the actions they choose to take. Which one they choose is up to the result that they either want or are willing to accept. Paul saw ""The Golden Path"" and refused it; not because he thought it was ""wrong"" but because morally, he himself could not accept it. He picked a different path. Leto II picked a path and actively insured it would come to pass. just my opinion, I could be wrong...  tl;dr Prescience doesn't eliminate free will."

I've since been gifted a copy by somebody else.  So now I have two sitting on my shelf.  This was over a year ago, and when I offered the game back to him he said he ""wasn't worried about getting it back.""    If you make me an offer I will pass it on to him, and I feel confident he will accept some money for a game none of them seem to care about.    It seems to go from anywhere between $50 to $250 dollars on ebay depending on condition and edition.  I'd say this one is ""fair"" at best.

Since the Fremen are, in many ways, islamic, oral sex might not be an issue after all."
dune,2cln1q,Troyandabedinthemoor,-5,Wed Aug 6 00:33:08 2014 UTC,I diaagree they are islamic. The guild the bene gesserit and the fremen are to me a great metaphor for jews. The spice is the torah. Arrakis palestine. Consider also the quisatz haderak (sorry don t remember how it is written) is similar to qifaz hadere (again sorry check wiki) wich is a jewish mystical superpower. I remember when i was studying judaism i had this epiphany that made me realise this.  Those group are different aspect of judaism. I know he uses a lot of arab terms but it is just a really tiny veil. My opinion  sorry i am on the phone and it is a pain in the ass
dune,2cln1q,aaronespro,6,Mon Aug 4 18:20:36 2014 UTC,"He uses lots of terms from all the Judeo-Christian religions, the implication being that the religions have been seeded and manipulated over time by the Bene Gesserit (as well as natural evolution with time).   The Jewish aspects to the Fremen are more that they were waiting for a messiah-type figure and the coming of a time of plenty (when there is water on Arrakis). In terms of how they are portrayed in the books they're definitely more similar to Bedouin/Tuareg people than Jews, and their Jihad between books 1 and 2 is definitely based on Islamic terminology and history.  It's doubly doubtful that the Fremen represent Jews, given that Jews specifically (not in any metaphor form) crop up in chapterhouse."
dune,2cln1q,aaronespro,-1,Mon Aug 4 18:36:13 2014 UTC,i have heard that jews exist in this universe but i am not there. to me still the first book started with this intention and the movie also. the fremen are similar to sabra. jews born in israel but i agree the beduin image is very strong. still my opinion is that is is all a methapore for the world as today and the world to come in the after books. acutally i am courious to see the worm god. read about it on wiki but i am just discovering and i am so exited. damn i am on vacation in prague and i am chatting about it in a hostel!!  also the fact that the messiah is not entirely jewish wich i think is a requirement. just half blood.
dune,2cln1q,kamatsu,2,Mon Aug 4 18:46:46 2014 UTC,"The thing with the Dune series is that it's pretty complex. A lot of it went over my head when I read the books (I only finished reading them for the first time a few months ago). There are some seasoned Dune veterans around who will probably flesh out the symbolism a bit more, but it's one of those books where you can take from it what you will. The thing people love about Dune is that there's little black-and-white, you're allowed to think for yourself about what's going on.  Don't spoil stuff on wiki! In my opinion at least there's some really good stuff coming up for you throughout the series, I'd kick myself if I'd known beforehand.   As for the Messiah, that was Paul was it not? I don't want to get into this too much because I've only had one pass through the books and much of the religious and historical symbolism was lost on me, and because I don't want to spoil anything for you.

dune,2bus1g,Mentatjuice,21,Sun Jul 27 12:46:45 2014 UTC,"Frank Herbert said he wanted to write a Messiah story, and he delivers within the first two pages. ""Will he be the Kwisatz Haderach?"" He is a boy who has prophetic dreams, the son of a Duke, a fiercely proud boy. Young, 15, and his physical development seems to come late. We also learn about the Bene Gesserit - Latin for, essentially, ""will have behaved well"", an interesting revelation on this group.  Then we see through Paul's eyes and thoughts how the world suddenly opens up to him. There are people his mother respects, even fears. How terrible are they?  As we switch to Gaius Helen Mohiam's point of view, we learned that Jessica controlled the birth, or could have... And that she disobeyed.   His mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it... the pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.   We see there is a very complex web in the world. It has been woven for centuries, and cannot be broken. We get a feel that the Bene Gesserit are spiders and that they exist everywhere politics exist.  Finally, what do we see? We see a world where black-and-white exists, meshed with many layers of gray. There is a level of ... Almost magic, though it is not presented as such. And there are limits that we are trying to overcome.   I read this book when I was maybe ten years old The concept of separating the human from the animal struck me very deeply, and still does. The concept of self-control and minutiae of observation also struck deep.  This chapter told me that living as a child was fun and naive... That the world was big, so big, and that humans had so much potential! I felt an obligation to examine my potential, to explore it.  That's what this first chapter did to me.    I'll use this to also keep track of the sentences / passages which I think are important. On a previous read, I used the ebook highlighting feature, now I need to transcribe them because I can't find an API to just download them. I intend on doing ... Something with those, later. I'm not sure what, yet.   A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness... focusing the consciousness... aortal dilation... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness... to be conscious by choice... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct... the animal destroys and does not produce.... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs... all things/cell/beings are impermanent... strive for flow-permanence within... He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit way–in the minutiae of observation. Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. The old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura–even in death. The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind. ""Pain,"" she sniffed. ""A human can override any nerve in the body."" The tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: Sand through a screen. I observed you in pain, lad. Pain's merely the axis of the test. Your mother's told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation. Hope clouds observation. Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock–for breeding purposes. He felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness."

dune,2bus1g,RadioSlayer,10,Tue Sep 30 01:02:51 2014 UTC,"Please forgive this post if it sounds too clipped or ""professional"", but I really want to say this, and I'm typing this out in Notepad++ first, because if I don't, my thoughts will meander everywhere, and we will end up with reddit's longest post, and it will end very off-topic (I'm familiar with how I can ramble, lol). I will be as precise and brief as possible.  I feel that the David Lynch movie and the mini-series both fell short in the portrayal of several of the characters, the first HUGE one being The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. I completely understand that producers are not ""artists"" and that there are time limits in media (and audiences), but that doesn't mean that there might not be a better way to present the essentials of a character.  The current portrayals seem show a battle hardened crone spitting hateful words to try to shock a young man into adulthood. I feel this is extremely one-dimensional.   There is certainly much more to her than being hateful and spiteful. When I read her here, I see someone treating Jessica more like a mother, and Paul more like a Grandmother. Here is my evidence.  To Jessica:   -""Is he not small for his age, Jessica?"" - Some see this as a stab at Jessica, chiding her for her choice, very passive-aggressive (""Well, if you would've had a daughter like you were supposed to, she would've developed faster.""). I see concern for Paul in this statement. -""Sly little rascal."" - I see her admiring not only Paul and how well he has accepted all of his training, but Jessica and how well she has trained him. -""He's a cautious one, Jessica."" - Same. -""Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?"" - I believe she says this with a little hurt in her voice, but not in a passive-aggressive way.    To Paul:   -""Can't go around maiming potential humans."" - Most of the things the RM said before this was short, to-the-point, and professional. This is coloquial, said with a smile. She seems to be letting the relief of the test being over infect her speech. -""Sit down, little brother, here at my feet."" - Wow. How many in the Bene Gesseret school at that age would give their left arm to hear this! To be treated by an RM as a sibling and to be invited to sit at the feet of the Master! That's real love she is expressing towards him here, even if he doesn't see it as such. -""Some day, lad,"" the old woman said, ""you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a measure of doing."" - I believe she is speaking from experience, and is also expressing her admiration for how Jessica was able to accomplish it.  In addition, she is seems more confrontational towards Paul before the test and much friendlier afterwords. It seems to me that she is more ""rough"" in speech with him before the test because she knows she has to hurt him to conduct the test, but she doesn't really want to. She is human, and harming another human with no empathy would be very animal-like, even thought she knows it has to be done, just as much as Paul understands the necessity of it afterwords. After the test, she seems relieved and even somewhat jovial, first because the test is over and she doesn't have to hurt him anymore, and second because he did pass, and he is ""human"".   Thinking of the RM this way, I will leave it to you to interpret how exactly she says and means: ""They tried and died.""  tl;dr - Several characters are very one-dimensional in the movies. There are more to them. RM is more like a grandmother, IMHO."
dune,2bus1g,Aerron,5,Sun Jul 27 20:35:51 2014 UTC,"I like your thoughts, you're right. I always thought that her comment of ""can't go around maiming potential humans"" was more of a very pragmatic one, carrying a lesson in itself. Paul is now worthy of being a student, so he can be taught things.  If you're going to test someone, then you have to make sure that when they pass, they're not going to be less than their full potential."
dune,2bus1g,sparvin,4,Sun Jul 27 22:17:47 2014 UTC,"I agree with your thoughts on the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.  I think it's easy to forget that while the Bene Besserit order is practically a force of nature, it's still comprised of real people, with real emotions, and motivations."

This time is a bit different because I am approaching it as a writer myself (if you want to write the best, read the best!)  I totally agree with your comment about the setting, OP. Herbert manages to build such a beautifully detailed world without mentioning too much about it. I did feel that this might be because the films and miniseries 'had 'planted' images in my head. On consideration however, I don't think this is the case because even the scenes not portrayed 'on screen' were incredibly vivid for me (the wet room/greenhouse in Arrakeen, the evening meal with the Harkonnen spy and Kynes).

Essentially its a prada bindu technique to defeat the flight or flight response allowing you to make a clear level headed decision based on logic instead of one driven by primal instinct.

They are intermixed, so the litany is her using it for the moment of facing him at either the trial or when he's in prison for whatever reason.

I suggest you now go read the Wikipedia plot synopses for the next two to see where frank may or may not have been going, then check out some fan theories before rereading the entire series! Charterhouse is one of my favourites now but it's finer points are very very understated.   By this I mean - frank only paints the wider picture in passing comments, instead waffling on for page after page about the specific meaning of each of his characters' bodily inflexions. If you imagine that the main character, present in every book, is the Golden Path; it's a really interesting development in the life of our plucky hero. With all Shaitans dead, the GP has whittled down from a mighty river to a tightrope, which Odrade must cross with the axe at her back. Odrade is just a modern pronounciation of Atriedes, and it was her that wrote the Manifesto in Heretics and was changed by it.   All of Leto's Universe has been handed to Odrade, just like Leto's message in the cave suggested. They have a professional army of millions and the widespread cult of sheeana. They can make gholas, they can make spice, they can make males with the powers of HM. Leto has given them everything including his worms and his planet (they have the new Dune). Against them is the burocratic matriarchy, who have sexual powers - in Leto's day they were called Fish Speakers, now they're called Honoured Matres. Can the last Atriedes break free of the last legacy of Leto's prescience (ie his fish speakers) and create a future where anything can happen?"

dune,2blojq,Chivio_Yshtar,5,Mon Jul 28 06:04:14 2014 UTC,"I believe ""Daniel and Marty"" might not be as random as you think.  Even though Daniel is a name that can arguably still be used in the Herbert universe (Paul and Duncan are...), Marty is a very specific 20th century contemporary English name contraction that seems extremely unlikely to survive the aeons.  Because of this, I always thought that using the name Marty was a clue: Herbert outright states that Daniel and Marty are New Face Dancers who have gained power by accumulating countless lifetimes, but he never specifies what those lifetimes were.  One just assumes that they gathered so many memories that they became incredibly wise and powerful. One just assumes they went with sheer quantity of memories in order to become knowledgeable.  I posit that Herbert, by using the name Marty, was hinting that some of the lives the Face Dancers accumulated were some of the lost Bene Gesserit who went into the Scattering but never came back.  This means that those two Face Dancers had been the only ones to accumulate BG Other Memory, enabling them to become the supreme beings that they are depicted as. This explains how they had access to the name ""Marty"".  Side note: I agree that Chapterhouse is the worst book, but that's only because Herbert was very carefully setting up the final book to end the Heretics trilogy. Chapterhouse kind of had to be relatively bland, since he was saving all the juicy stuff for the final book. Dune 7 was going to be the be-all, end-all, supreme climax. Shit, the way he dropped that hint about the nullentropy capsule in Scytale's chest left me tingling with anticipation.

I imagine they had a relatively small army that could be deployed quickly anywhere on the planet by ornithopter or ship. Seeing how successful their raid on Giedi Prime was (and how the troops were probably used to that kind of action) I'd guess those are the situations they train for normally.

Of course, it wasn't Shaddam himself who noticed these threats to the throne; he was much too stupid. Fenring was the perceptive one, specifically where it concerned the Fremen. Shaddam was too busy getting sidetracked by CHOAM kerfuffles and Harkonnen spice hoarding to see the real harbingers of House Corrino's decline."

dune,2b6vhy,Sihathor,9,Sun Jul 20 05:31:38 2014 UTC,"Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of Dune — the magic spice (spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), the giant worms (maggots digesting mushrooms), the eyes of the Freman (the cerulean blue of Psilocybe mushrooms), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, the Bene Gesserits (influenced by tales of Maria Sabina and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico) — came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use of magic mushrooms.   Interesting. In his biography Frank gave credit to peyote (making a tea from the plant but accidentally including the strychine element and becoming sick afterwards), that gave him the hallucination of seeing 'time as waves'. Looking back, I don't doubt he had a multitude of influences however; I do doubt the maggots element somewhat, as in his own words credited the shai hallud origin to ""ship worms, grown enormous"", which made sense given his naval background, and his perception of the desert planet as analogous to an ocean world (the dunes move under fluid dynamics, just at a pace that makes them seem solid to us)."

dune,2b77dk,FauxShizzle,3,Sun Jul 20 21:20:50 2014 UTC,"This is what I could find.  Little before half-way through:   The access tube, brilliantly lighted automatically once they sealed the portal behind them, was decorated with Harkonnen griffins on walls and ceiling. Teg was struck by the image of a young Patrin stumbling into this place for the first time (The shock! The awe! The elation!) and he failed to observe Duncan’s reaction until a low growl swelled in the enclosed space.  Duncan stood growling (almost a moan), fists clenched, gaze fixed on a Harkonnen griffin along the right-hand wall. Rage and confusion warred for supremacy on his face. He lifted both fists and crashed them against the raised figure, drawing blood from his hands.   Little after half-way through:   Lucilla sat in the room she had chosen for her personal quarters. It was a small space with an ornate bed filling an inset into one wall. Gross and subtle signs around her said this had been the room of a favorite Harkonnen hetaira. Pastel blues with darker blue accents shaded the fabrics. Despite the baroque carvings on bed, alcove, ceiling, and every functioning appurtenance, the room itself could be swept out of her consciousness once she relaxed here. She lay back on the bed and closed her eyes against the sexually gross figures on the alcove ceiling.   Roughly 70% through the book:   Lucilla pivoted on one heel, sorting the room’s details: that Harkonnen griffin worked into a crystal table, the exotic fabrics on chairs and couches."

dune,2aot0s,desertsail912,11,Mon Jul 14 18:35:19 2014 UTC,"He wrote six full-length novels that were very similar in themes and construction. To assert that the seventh was going to be a radical departure is, at best, dubious.  Besides, at the end of Chapterhouse Daniel and Marty come right out and say explicitly that they are Face Dancers. It's not implied or alluded to; it's right there in black and white. There's nothing anywhere in the entire series that even hints at the things that were introduced in the prequels and then brought back in the last two books.  Not that I'm trying to dredge up an old argument here. Like the deuterocanonical books or dislike them; I'm not telling you to do either one. I'm just expressing my opinion that I think what you said is farfetched."
dune,2aot0s,LipsAnd,5,Mon Jul 14 18:49:54 2014 UTC,"On that note, also at the end of chapterhouse, Daniel and Marty make a snide comment about gholas. Eats at me that I don't know where this goes, I feel like Frank definitely was going somewhere with that thought"
dune,2aot0s,syncsynchalt,4,Tue Jul 15 01:52:46 2014 UTC,"To be clear, I am absolutely not saying that Marty and Daniel are robots, I think they're face dancers, just like Frank says. What I am saying is that there might some element of thinking machines in what ever's driving back the forces from the Scattering.   When Leto II gets Siona to go into the spice trance, I think she sees machines returning. Also, the way that Duncan pulls all those weapon specs out of the air seems to imply that he's accessing a database."
dune,2aot0s,twistysolenoid,2,Mon Jul 14 19:10:29 2014 UTC,"I don't see where you get that idea. You probably read it already knowing what Brian wrote, and found a way to bullshit yourself into making that seem plausible. We all try to rationalize The Brian Sacrilege one way or the other.  Like the turtle said, those two characters were face dancers. Those two characters are indubitably the masterminds of whatever is going on. There are no machines. There is absolutely nothing about machines in that book. The face dancers have accumulated untold billions of lives and have become de facto gods, there's no need for some pathetic facile evil sentient robot.  The only thing that happens is the ""Cyborgization"" of that Sisterhood driver, and that is only used to point out how desperate Odrade is for resources, even going so far as to defy the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad just to save a competent technician."
dune,2aot0s,syncsynchalt,4,Mon Jul 14 19:35:07 2014 UTC,"Yes and no, I actually came on this idea by reading the Hyperion series. But read these quotes from God Emporer:    No ancestral presences would remain in her consciousness, but she would carry with her forever afterward the clear sights and sounds and smells. The seeking machines would be there, the smell of blood and entrails, the cowering humans in their burrows aware only that they could not escape... while all the time the mechanical movement approached, nearer and nearer and nearer...louder...louder!  She had to be made to recognize that his primary consciousness worked in a Fremen way and that, like the terrible machines of that apocalyptic vision, (emphasis mine) the predator could follow any creature who left tracks.   Now, is she viewing the possible future that is prevented by Leto II following the Golden Path, or is Leto showing her what will happen and what they are doing to survive?  And how do you explain Duncan ""downloading"" all those specs on those weapons from the Scattering?"
dune,2aot0s,syncsynchalt,7,Mon Jul 14 19:59:19 2014 UTC,"My interpretation is and has been that if the Golden Path had not been seen through, Ix would have built exterminating machines that would have ended humanity, by nature of all of humanity being ""reachable"" via prescience.  I'll have to re-read God Emperor to see where I got the Ixian implication, I don't know if it's explicitly stated or whether it's my reading of the constant mention of Ix constantly stretching the boundaries of allowed technology."
dune,2aot0s,syncsynchalt,2,Tue Jul 15 02:44:22 2014 UTC,"Leto's dying instruction to Duncan and Siona was to not fear the ixians because they can no longer create arafel, the cloud at the end of the universe. Presumably the machine apocalypse she saw.  Clairby's cyborgism, the understated but oft mentioned tech of Chapterhouse (3d midair projection communication, hover vehicles, pneumatic people-tubes, Siri-style Ai) all seemed to be leading up to a big Tech reveal. I think book 7 would have overthrown the Butlerian prohibition either way.  Duncan and Odrade both ponder the tachyon net during Chapterhouse. I think in a Duncan passage he recalls the  nickname tachys. The net to which he connects clearly belongs to the old people (stop spying on us!). And besides, what else were murbella's sisterhood sposed to fight"
dune,2aot0s,StashTheBashar,1 point,Tue Jul 15 20:39:19 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  Obviously I need to re-read GE, the Ix reference in there clear as day.  Book 7 seemed an opportunity for a universe reset, references like the Futar were hinting at a completely ""alien"" human society returning from the Scattering (I should note that I haven't read a word of Brian's work).  If I object to the idea that the enemy is machine, it's only because I don't think an emotionless enemy makes for good storytelling, and therefore assume it wasn't planned."
dune,2aot0s,StashTheBashar,1 point,Tue Jul 15 21:03:23 2014 UTC,"I agree to that to an extent, but what is chasing the Honered Matres back from the Scattering? And where's Duncan getting all that data about the technology in Chapter House?"
dune,2aot0s,StashTheBashar,2,Tue Jul 15 18:07:51 2014 UTC,"Personally I think there's a missing player that would have been introduced in the seventh book, and been entirely new:  BG:HM::Tleilaxu:(x)  Where (x) is some alteration of the Tleilax, or rebellious face dancers, or Richesian, or what have you.  Yes, (x) could be entirely mechanical, but could also be machine-assisted, or be psionic (though getting unlikely by 1985), or have Clarke-style ""magic"" technology."
dune,2aot0s,StashTheBashar,1 point,Tue Jul 15 20:22:46 2014 UTC,"That's where I'm headed in my thinking. I avoid Richese b/c that's more Brian's territory, but beyond that, yeah. What is x and how does being invisible from prescience help you defeat it? Beyond the ability of seeing No-Ships, what do Teg's abilities add to the fight? Too many questions."
dune,2aot0s,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,2,Tue Jul 15 21:31:56 2014 UTC,"I've never read a word of Brian Herbert, so the only basis I have for Richese is that it's mentioned as the other technological house, after Ix."

dune,2aot0s,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,6,Wed Jul 16 01:05:41 2014 UTC,"I think that the 'terrible machines' can be interpreted in a purely canonical way if you accept that the vision she had was a metaphorical one.  Siona was not prescient - the next Atreides to show ANY prescience whatsoever was Miles Teg, when he found he could see the no-ships.  I believe that Leto gave the her the vision in that form to better emphasise and explain his reasons for his Golden Path; to terrify her by showing that if she left traces, ANYTHING could find her.      Another interpretation is that the event she was shown was a thing in the common Other Memory of the Atreides (perhaps an echo of the Butlerian Jihad) and Leto was pointing her to that as the price of failure of his Golden Path.  I form this opinion on the word 'ancestral'.      As for Duncan downloading weapons specs...it is said several times after he was in his final ghola 'incarnation' and had been restored to all his (sort of) Other Memory that he still did not know all the things the Tleilaxu had done to him.  The downloading could be interpreted as a manifestation of the ability of the new Face Dancers to absorb others' memory, still without having to involve anything to do with Brian's massive paradigm shift.       Of course, this is open to wide interpretation - that is one of the wonderful things about Frank's writing style.  I do not think, however, that when he makes a PARTICULAR effort to emphasise something (the nature of Marty and Daniel) it should be as lightly dismissed as his son did.  That is not to say that out in the Scattering people had not gone back to using machines in that way, or that the Scattered ones had not met something truly fearsome that was not human and had started to interfere with the Scattering (remember that in Children of Dune Leto pointed out to Ghanima that the sandtrout had been introduced to Dune - not by humans).  I myself though, cannot agree with the idea of Marty and Daniel being Omnius and Erasmus."
dune,2aot0s,calahil,2,Mon Jul 14 21:24:28 2014 UTC,"And to address another point you made, the descendents of the Atreides can still have the ability to be prescient, they purposefully do not allow it b/c they don't want another 3,500 years of the Tyrant. There are multiple instances in Heretics and Chapterhouse where characters are mentioned as having slight prescience w/o the spice. Dar or Tar has it quite often."

dune,2aot0s,MrBacon42,1 point,Tue Jul 15 20:39:29 2014 UTC,"Well, as I pointed out to /u/Quite_the_asshole, explain, then, this quote:   Energizers appeared next. He had a private arsenal of those: ways of increasing capacities of your troops.  Abruptly, the shimmering net from his vision replaced scrolling weapons and he saw the elderly couple in their garden. They glared at him. The man's voice became audible. ""Stop spying on us!""  Idaho gripped the arms of his chair and jerked himself forward but the vision disappeared before he could study details.   Obviously, Duncan's tapping into something that Marty and Daniel have."
dune,2aot0s,unklespaz,2,Tue Jul 15 18:24:11 2014 UTC,"Oh yes, I do agree with you on his visions, but I just don't think that his insight was as a result of Thinking Machine input...like you said, 'tapping into something that Marty and Daniel have' doesn't need to be explained by BH's Erasmus et al, it could be explained by a random ability in the countless Idaho gholas before him, given to him when he recovered his version of Other Memory.      If you don't agree, that's cool - like I said, this is one of the things I find so good about FH's writing is that he leaves SO MUCH wiggle room for theories to emerge (and, coincidentally, why I dislike BH so much...he nails everything down to the nth degree, leaving no place for the imagination or speculation)"

The Lynch Dune movie was 30 years ago. Even 20 years ago, the mid nineties, there were fewer sci fi videogames, TV was much more limited... sci fi was just different. The Lynch Dune movie, despite being very enjoyable (IMO) is not widely liked. Dune, thank the Maker, never became a media empire on the scale of Star Wars or Star Trek.

dune,2ag3zw,Jagunder,1 point,Sat Aug 2 03:51:01 2014 UTC,"I really don't understand it.   Lynch did a fantastic job to create a visual master piece adequately visualizing the different houses and especially the cruelty and disgusting vileness of House Harkonnen. The acting was supurb. But the story, as depicted in the film, was a bastardized version at best.   The Sci-Fi version more or less remained true to the book. The visuals, on the other hand, were quite lack luster. Personally, I felt it belonged more in a theatre stage production much as one would expect with the large matte scenery. I liked it, though I can certainly see why many people didn't. I watch both, enjoy both, for the differing aspects. Like all things, one must take the good with the bad.  Why Hollywood can't bring together the attributes of both, I've no idea. But, Dune is at best a trilogy on the silver screen. There's way too much of a story, too much depth, to explain in a single sitting. Lynch's version was so full of holes that unless you were well versed in the book, you'd have no idea what is going on. The extended version (2h 56m) still leaves so much out that is in the book."
dune,2ag3zw,robocopper4,1 point,Sun Aug 3 04:23:25 2014 UTC,"I thought the acting was surprisingly stiff and the visual effects terrible...the ships being destroyed on the space port are obviously clay and the troops are also on a sound stage bouncing around...

It made going back and reading it in Highschool fun, because I already knew the story, and I had more ideas about what the world was like, and it really blew my mind that all that was in there, and I just read it for the mind-tricks and laz-guns and crys-knives and sandworms the first time."

One of the middle names of my first son is Paul, and one of the middle names of my second is Duncan.      I think that the readers of Dune will keep its profile high enough that we will see (and do see, from the contents of this thread) enough of  the younger generations reading this great work.  I don't quite know if it will 'shine down the corridors of time for as long as humans exist' ;-)  but here and now I don't think it will relapse into total obscurity."

dune,2ag3zw,Ace1999,2,Thu Aug 7 19:17:54 2014 UTC,"Not so young at 51. First read the series when I was in high school and reread the series multiple times as I have aged. Yes, you pick up more each time you re-read. Every time I went through it I learned something new. Their is so much there, especially in the last 3 books. The detail, the history, the nuance.  Nice to see that younger people are still reading it. Not surprising though. Dune is some of the best sci-fi that I have read.  Having said that you may want to check out Delany's Dhalgren. Completely unrelated to Dune, but still some interesting sci-fi."

MacAvoy nailed Leto II, people bitch cause he was older than the book but his performance was brilliant. I also really liked the actress who played Alia, and the transformation of Paul into the Preacher was very well done by Newman.

dune,2ag3zw,Flumptastic,2,Wed Aug 6 19:46:19 2014 UTC,"I read it at 20. I was in the hospital for a week and I didnt really have much to do. On about the third day A co-worker of mine, who was about 35 or so, came in with his wife to see me. Him and I had talked about books before but I was not a huge reader at the time. The first thing he does is hang me two books. Ones was Robert Heinleins ""Stranger in a Strange Land"". The other was run down copy of Dune. He said he had read it at least 5 times, that is why it was beaten up.   I was amazed that someone could read a book 5 times and not get bored of it. Like I said coming from a person who has read a total of 30 books in his life. (not counting textbooks).   Anyways I read Dune, I could not put it down. I was completely mesmerized by the writing style.The elaborate plot, and the depth of the book. This was also a time in my life where I was going through a depression so the Bene Gesserits' litany of fear really stuck in my head.   Long story short, I have read Dune 1-6 and just started on the Legends of Dune series.   This one book. As changed my life. At a time when I needed it the most, I had something to escape into. A healthy escape, and a lovely one at that.   Right now, I am 22 yo and reading is now my favorite hobby. I want to read everything. I want to be like the mentats the Dune universe. And every time I get the chance I tell someone to read Dune.  So do not fret, generations to come with still love this series."

I remember having read the first 2/3rds of Dune and not finishing it, then one day I woke up to hear words that seemed familiar. It was my father watching the Dune mini-series. I watched the rest of the episode (first) with him then went up to my room and finished the book. I was 14 or so at the time. I personally believe that technology has gotten to the point where a proper feature film without all that ""acoustic weirding way"" bull is a reality in the making. Give Hollywood some time to come back to it.   Also, after Children of Dune, and now that he is famous enough to be doing the Avengers 2/Thor 2 soundtracks make me hope upon hope that Brian Tyler gets the go ahead to score whatever feature length remake we get. That man truly brings tears to my eyes when I hear his compositions. I actually spent 2/3rd of Thor two waiting for the credits to see if he was the composer.   Edit; spelling."

I can't remember exactly. I liked to read very much when I was a kid and didn't have the internet yet. I don't remember much about my first impressions, but I clearly remember that I've read first three books, skimmed through God-Emperor and gave up on Heretics and Chapterhouse because they were ""boooooring"".   The second run was when I was about 16-17. This time around I decided to start with BH's books (First prelude, then legends) and liked it very much. Don't judge me. ;)    After BH's books I've tried to read FH again... and it didn't go too well. ""Eh, it's like halfway through that book and almost nothing has happened! I don't care about whiny Yueh! Gimme badass fremen!"". So I stopped halfway through the book. I guess BH conditioned me to his style and I wasn't ready for the... ehm, ""depths"".  The third run happened this year, after I realised that TWOW isn't gonna get released anytime soon, and I really wanted to read something epic and I was thinking between continuing Asimov's Foundation (on-hold after book one) and trying to re-read the Dune. Chose the latter, and I'm LOVING it. Currently halfway through Chapterhouse. Heretics were going kinda slow though, I almost thought about stopping reading it. Also, I'm kinda tired of countless Duncans. He was in every damn book, wasn't he?  Also, now I'm considering whether to read Dune 7 or not and fear that I won't like it."

I hadn't watched the movie before but knew of it and found the little parts of it that I had seen in an online review interesting enough to read the book after I got it as a Christmas gift.   Before reading it I thought it most have been slightly overrated based on the fact that many people didn't regard it very highly like they do 2001: A space odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke  and Isaac Asimov's books. My opinion has of course completely reversed after reading the book.   The David lynch film though I have to say is probably the worst movie I have ever seen though, I watched it last night after finishing the book. Not only was it not particularly faithful to the story (what adaptation of a book is xP) but the acting was terribly flat as well. I just don't get how you could mess something up that terribly. I mean the story is really pretty straight forward chronological speaking and with a little added narration to get the characters inner monologue I figured it would be fairly easy to film.   I'm watching the mini series from 2000 right now and I just don't understand why they changed the order of certain scenes at all. I mean most of the narrative is still there (much more than the movie for sure) but it's all re-ordered for some strange reason. Anyway I plan on reading the sequels fairly soon whenever I get a chance to head to the library to pick them up."

For that to be feasible, the only explanation would be he makes this process in some kind of ultra-speed. That would also give him opportunity to live inside of himself, reasoning with himself forever, since the possible paths (and he knows all of them, and must do so, that's also the point of the Kwisatz Haderach) are infinite. Seeing prescience as a physical manifestation doesn't make sense when we add in time to ""research"" the paths to the picture.  Paul could follow the paths, he just didn't want to.

The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever."

dune,2agg9v,Ben_zona,24,Fri Jul 11 20:29:27 2014 UTC,"Frank covers this to an extent in one of his interviews.  He basically says that because of the navigator's prescience the guild knew better than to bring water to Arrakis because that would mean the end of melange.  The fremen's Tau Orgies were also a group prescience that muddied the navigator's ability to see that they were secreting water away.    Remember that Arrakis has a dry climate, but the planet isn't exactly water poor.  It once had lots of free water, but now the water is still on planet just not available.  The early vector of the sandworm that encapsulates water is the reason Arrakis is dry."
dune,2agg9v,apjak,11,Sat Jul 12 00:00:08 2014 UTC,"For one, as Apjak points out Paul isn't the only character with prescience ability. Paul's ability dwarfs everyone elses. I would argue that the Navigators are second only to Paul.  Apjak's reasoning is correct.  But something else.  One of the many themes of Dune is how to go about creating a religion. Religions need a goal that cannot possibly come true.  A goal that is passed on from generation to generation.  I have always wondered if the Fremen's dream of a green planet created out of storing the water and releasing it was something that could even work. As I said in an earlier post, the question has a partial answer when Let, the God Emperor has Highliners ship water in from off planet.    It doesn't really seal the deal, but it has a sort of, 'Screw this shit.  My life expectancy is 4 thousand years and even I don't have time for this shit.' to it.  My view of the question is that from a writing standpoint having the Fremen ship water in would screw up Frank Herbert's theme."
dune,2agg9v,SaddharKadham,4,Sat Jul 12 14:45:11 2014 UTC,Not only that but the Fremen already struggle to pay the bribes. A) why would the guild give the Fremen water to lower spice production when B) the Fremen can't even get the spice in the first place?
dune,2agg9v,HughMankind,2,Thu Jul 17 13:35:42 2014 UTC,"Fremen didn't dream about green  Dune as far as I can remember, before Kynes arrived. They just lived in the world they had, solving everyday problems, in terms with Zen as much as I understand it."

dune,2agg9v,apjak,1 point,Sun Aug 10 01:30:32 2014 UTC,"In reverse: Chani is 2 years older than Paul, but seeing as their infant son the first Leto II was killed when Paul was 17 you can assume they conceived when Paul was 16 and Chani was 18.  As to the first, there is no official confirmation of sex, but it's implied in various places.  The important things about the orgies, are that it opens the Fremen up to their own collective unconsciousness (Frank was a Jungian) so that they have a very tangible oneness, also it gives them glimpses of prescience that they share.  These create an intimacy beyond that achieved via sexual acts,  so if sex isn't regularly involved ""orgy"" is still the perfect term to describe the Fremen sharing."

dune,2agg9v,Nouse4livE,12,Sun Aug 10 03:48:04 2014 UTC,"I don't think its really a plot hole. If you are talking about buing water to terraform:   Guild heighliner may be super big, but they can't land on planets, so all the water would have to be brought up and down by lighters. Also we don't know if they would be capable of holding and driving such a mass. Military material and ships may be heavy but nothing in comparsion to these amounts of water. Even if that all could be done and you get lots of highliners full of Water to Arakis, that would be a drop on the desert. Arakis was governt by the Harkonens and Spice trade was controlled by COHAM while Fremen were essentialy laying doormat. Fremen buying Heighliners full of water would have raised many questions.  If you're talking about water like in bottled water to drink:  It wouldn't last longer than any other water on Arakis. The real problem is to contain the water and not lose it to the desert / the sandtrouts. The Fremen had a good amount to live of, but decided to put most of it away for Liet-Kynes terraforming dreams."
dune,2agg9v,Nouse4livE,2,Fri Jul 11 21:13:38 2014 UTC,This is how Leto gets water on Dune in 'God Emperor of Dune.'.

dune,2agg9v,BloodyNobody,4,Sat Jul 12 17:45:03 2014 UTC,"Well aside from the amount of water needed would probably kill whatever planet they took it from, I think that it would give the Guild a clear way to impose insurmountable debts to the Fremen. Also I think Arrakis has the water it needs that's why they don't import it, the water catches etc and the sowing of static landmasses imply that they just needed to hold back the desert and not necessarily import water to the planet.   I would also venture that if this wasn't a gradual process then the shock of that much water given to the planet in such a short period would do crazy things. If they did it over time then the Fremen would have to pay the guild massive amounts of spice to keep them stationed there for years and years.   Another thing to consider is that technically the Padishah Emperor was in 'control' of the planet and none of the people (harkonnen or geidi's) gave a shit about the people on the planet enough to want to convert it to a nicer place. Thus it would only be up to the Fremen to convert it and doing anything drastic like sending for a planet sized amount of water would reveal the Fremen to the Emperor and the universe."
dune,2agg9v,skunkynugget,4,Fri Jul 11 21:26:05 2014 UTC,"Why not pay the Guild with spice to transport water from offworld to Arakis?   In a tactical context, it would reveal how resourceful the Fremen really are. All that the Emperor and the great houses are supposed to know is that Arrakis is a hot shit hole with religious fanatics living in sietches, but it's also full of sandworms and melange. Melange that has to be mined (and gtfo when there's a spice blow).  Kynes might have revealed to House Corrino the connection between the worms and melange, but, if I remember correctly, it said that no one ever read his reports anyway."
dune,2agg9v,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,3,Sat Jul 12 19:53:26 2014 UTC,"aside from that not being very logistically efficient as pointed out by the first two posts, water would kill the spice production.  the only people wanting terraforming of the entire planet were the fremen, as far as the big corporate players are concerned, the guild being one of them, the dryer the better.  it just wouldn't have happened that way.  it took rallying all the indigenous fremen and a very calclulated rebelion to sculpt the planet.  really it was just the fremen that wanted their planet more hospitable."
dune,2agg9v,_Answers,2,Fri Jul 11 22:50:05 2014 UTC,"The Fremen wanted to fly under the radar as much as possible, because drawing attention to themselves would have been a sure death sentence at the hands of the Harkonnens.  Since there's no way to discretely bring in a heighliner worth of water without drawing the attention of the Harkonnens and the emperror, using the water available on planet is the only viable option, regardless of how long the process must take.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the Fremen had a natural dislike for the ""water fat"" people of the cities. Although their way of life was viewed as extremely harsh by outsiders, it was the only one they knew, and they appreciated it fir what it was. Their saying of ""polish comes from the city, strength from the desert"" shows that they understood that their struggle made them strong.   Also, their way of life, harsh as it was, was clearly capable of supporting a large number of people, judging by the numbers of Fremen on the planet. They had enough for what they needed, and as Leto mentioned in God Emperor, ""he never saw a greedy Fremen."""

But they did betray the Fremen bribe when the ecological change they were making became clear to them.   The Guild is like a village beside a river. They need the water, but can only dip out what they require. They cannot dam the river and control it, because that focuses attention on what they take, it brings down eventual destruction. The spice flow, that's their river, and I have built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river."

Any sand storm I've ever seen has looked decidedly sand colored. The storm in the picture looks much darker, especially around the edges.   Of course, its possible that there's dirt from other areas of the planet causing the darker hue, but there are a couple of other things that I feel dont fit as well. The biggest is the ornithopters. The only pilot we ever read about taking a thopter through a sand storm is Paul. He did this as a last resort to escape certain death with the Sardaukar, and the only reason they survived it was his prescience. I think any other pilot would have high tailed it out of there at the sight of a coriolis storm.   Lastly, I think the Fremen would be heading away from a storm, not toward it. Even if their sietch were in the direction of the storm, they seem very nonchalant to me.   These are just my impressions,and by no means detract from the beauty of the piece. Its still a great piece of art with alot to admire."

At the time he was first approached to make a epic Sci-Fi movie he picked Dune before even reading it. He used the source material as a jumping off point for his own ideas. The documentary is more about the team Jodorowsky compiled to create the movie and how those individuals went on to be incredibly influential in aesthetic look & feel of the modern Sci-Fi genre of movies.  I enjoyed the documentary but I recommend going into it thinking of it more as a examination of Jodorowsky's thought and work process than a documentary about Dune.

I'm 31, just finished Chapterhouse yesterday, and finished the other five in the last year.  I surely don't fit in the box you created."
dune,29scpt,calahil,7,Fri Jul 4 03:25:08 2014 UTC,"I agree with this, 100%.  Im in the same boat you are. 27, read all six books in the last year and a half or so, but I have read a 6 of the BH books, and tried to read three more. Some of them were enjoyable to a point, but not nearly as much as the originals. The ones that I started but didn't finish.... well, there's a reason I couldn't make it all the way through them. Mostly that the characters were flat and one dimensional, completely unbelievable as real people, and some were just annoying.   For instance, when reading Sisterhood of Dune, one of the three books I couldn't finish, I just wanted to skip every section that had Manford Torondo, because I knew he was going to do or say something that was entirely unreasonable or illogical because he was an antimachine fanatic. Every. Time. One of the biggest reasons I couldn't finish that book.   The other biggest thing that bugged me was that they tried to do too much with too many characters, and wound up almost having to do their incessant ""this is what happened the last time we wrote this characters part of the story"" because that section was 8 chapters ago. Half of each chapter was a recap of the one before it. It made reading the book tiresome.  Now like I said, some of the books were enjoyable. But I just couldn't get in to the last three I tried to read.   If everyone else could just talk about what they liked and disliked about the books like adults (as you suggested) the whole sub would be alot more accessible. Instead,  we get the ""not this circle jerk"" circle jerk, which is just as bad as the original offense."

dune,29scpt,Twiggy3,-1,Fri Jul 4 03:28:26 2014 UTC,"Wait a week and the debate will happen again. Sometimes the mods do sticky post which devolve into the same thing. The debate never gets had because the FH hivemind always shouts out/downvotes anyone who even was amused by the BH books. 'Rant like a 5 year old' I may when I'm drunk, but it's all been tried and said on the sub before.   Because the debate always turns into ""they're crap and you have no taste.""    To me, the books are interesting because they're in the Duniverse. The example I always use is the Star Wars one. So the newer movies aren't as good as the original movies, but they're still Star Wars stories. They cause you to actually use your imagination a little and discuss different possibilities.   Everyone in the sub who's rah rah FH won't even consider the BH books in the same universe. They're not as good, in some ways. They're fairly straightforward tales. Some would argue that FH work is too not-straightforward. That's why if you look on this sub you'll see a lot of ""I got to Children, God Emperor Chapterhouse and I don't get it anymore.""  IMO I think it's a little ridiculous for ridiculing the BH books that take place 3000 before dune but not ridiculing the books that take place 3000 years after Dune.   I don't like later FH Dune books because I think it's a cop-out to kill off most of your characters, invent a completely new arc, and try to connect them to Dune.   Downvote policy is supposed to about conversation contribution, not disagreement. Someone asked about why I disagree, I reply, downvoted. How is answering a direct question not contribution? Therein lies why this sub blows."
dune,29scpt,ManofToast,5,Fri Jul 4 11:10:33 2014 UTC,"The BH hate comes from him shoehorning FH's stories into a Star Wars world. He had to write the prequels with tech that Frank never hinted at all, eg mechs with human brains, centralized AI control, androids.  All of that to bring back 2 characters BH/KJA made up in the first place and paste them onto Marty and Daniel.   I am not saying he is a bad author. What I am saying is that his ideas should of been put into his own world he created rather then forcing his square ideas into a circular hole. I have heard good things about their non dune related works.   For your point about 3000 years passing from CoD to GEoD. He was telling a story about the pitfalls of shortsightedness and how planning longterm changes causes extreme pressures on humanity and how a single individual sees it as oppression with short sighted vision"

dune,29qkca,lambros009,23,Thu Jul 3 13:07:39 2014 UTC,"No one seems to go into any significant detail, so here's the full reason:  Inheriting Other Memories is a very jarring experience. One requires formidable mental discipline in order to handle the effect that downloading all those lifetimes produces.  Only after many years of rigorous training does a BG even begin to be considered for the Spice Agony. Only after they already have their own identities, only after they're mature and know who they are, and they have mental barriers in place, and are prepared for Other Memory.  This means that, if you download all those lifetimes into a formatted brain (a fetus's brain), that individual has no chance to even form their own identity: they automatically become the sum total of all the lifetimes imprinted on them, and eventually they're ""taken over"" by the strongest of the personas inside them, which are usually evil.  This isn't news: power attracts especially corruptible and/or downright evil people. Those same people, when ""living"" in Other Memory, don't like being a passive bystander inside the host, they want to take over the host completely in order to essentially live again. They take over the host by using their strong will to cause actual physical pain on their host and browbeat into giving them ""a few moments"" of control here and there, and eventually they just don't give it back.  This is what happened to Alia: she starts out as just a very weird very mature child, but as she reaches puberty the inner persona of the Baron starts taking over, and at the end of Children she's been completely taken over, and only manages to take control for one last moment in order to throw herself from the balcony.  The reason why this possession didn't happen with Ghanima is because of the pseudo self-hypnosis she performs in order to make herself believe Leto's dead. She performs this mental exercise before puberty, when Abominations are supposed to flourish.  The reason why this didn't happen with Leto is because a few of the strong benevolent personas (Chani and Paul included) inside him made a sort of coalition to protect his psyche from any evil personas who attempted to gain control. That coalition protects him until he dons the sandtrout skin and sets his Golden Path into motion, and then they become unnecessary, as Leto has become the God Emperor and nothing can stop him now.  TL;DR: If you download other memories before having your own, you're going to be really fucked up.  EDIT: a letter."

dune,29qkca,Realik,6,Wed Jul 16 00:27:34 2014 UTC,"The Bene Gesserit call Pre-Born ""Abomination"".  The reason for that in their history is the possession we see in Alia.  It is not necessarily related to the Spice, but Alia's issues specifically were Spice related which is why Leto II was avoiding the Spice.  Creating a Pre-Born is the Bene Gesserit's ""Abomination"", and the Fremen also have their own history with ""possession"" but their histories dealing with them apart from Alia and the twins are not dealt with in Frank's work."
dune,29qkca,ill_mango,1 point,Thu Jul 3 14:03:02 2014 UTC,"Jessica talks with Stilgar about Alia being a possible abomination and at one point, if it isn't explicitly stated, it's heavily implied abominations are killed by the Fremen. Even so, the idea's encompassed in Istislah while weaker in the ""water rich"" days of CoD are still heavily prevalent."
dune,29qkca,flyincaveman,5,Sat Jul 19 09:57:22 2014 UTC,You should not ask until you are finished with the book. The writer does not tell you what it means yet cause he does not want you to know yet.
dune,29qkca,flyincaveman,2,Fri Jul 4 09:40:56 2014 UTC,"I believe an abomination is one who is possessed by their inner voices.  In Alia's case, she was possessed by her grandfather, the Baron Harkonnen."

dune,29qkca,levelate,3,Thu Jul 3 14:21:06 2014 UTC,But Alia can for some reason as she is most definitely possessed by the Baron. It is never explained how - most likely some manifestation of the Atreides gene or the fact the Baron was more a man in body than psyche.

dune,29qkca,levelate,1 point,Thu Jul 3 16:45:37 2014 UTC,Although you are correct in most circumstances. The Bene Gesserit women could not hear inner male voices which is why the Kwisatz Haderach was such a big deal- he would be able to hear both male and females voices.

dune,29qkca,Momoneko,2,Thu Aug 7 23:15:22 2014 UTC,It's when you allow a past consciousness to take control over you OR they take control by force due to weakness.
dune,29qkca,kamatsu,2,Thu Jul 3 13:54:45 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree with you about it happening ""by force due to weakness"".  It's pretty clearly illustrated that Alia has a very strong mind, she resists possession into early adulthood by virtue of her mind honed by BG training.  In the end, it is not strength but trickery that can allow one to escape becoming Abomination; I don't want to give too much away for the OP if they're just starting CoD, but I can't stand by and let you call Alia weak.  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to geek out though :)"
dune,29qkca,MrBacon42,2,Thu Jul 3 17:38:57 2014 UTC,The end result of Abomination is different from the perspectives of the twins and the Bene Geserit. The solution is also different. You end up with a different final meaning I think. Just keep going and you'll come to a better understanding of it.
dune,29qkca,StumbleOn,1 point,Fri Jul 4 00:25:56 2014 UTC,"I have a follow-up quiestion on Alia & Twins: Why Ghani & Leto can ""dive"" into their Other Memories way deeper than Alia?  I remember Leto thinking about how the language he and Ghani are speaking to each other isn't known to anyone, and even Alia, should she overhear them, would only understand a word or two. How is that possible?"
dune,29qkca,lawofeffect,1 point,Sun Jul 6 10:23:08 2014 UTC,I think it's because she's possesed by 1 person.It mentions somewhere that other memories influence the person less when he is possesed because that person possessing them is the dominant one in their mind.  Not perfectly sure though.
dune,29qb8p,Sobjack,16,Thu Jul 3 10:27:46 2014 UTC,"I'd say ""understood"" is probably a poor word choice.  I was an adult when I first read Dune, and I got all the big threads and themes, but with every reread I've mined more and more nuggets out of the books.  There's a recording with Frank Herbert where Willis McNelly told him that after finishing Dune he flipped back and started reading it a second time immediately.  Frank replied, ""Of Course, I designed it that way."""
dune,29qb8p,apjak,3,Thu Jul 3 13:45:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the quote! I couldn't agree more with your assessment.  I didn't read the books at a young age, I was already in my early twenties and felt I ""got"" the major themes and conflicts in each book, but I still reread the series at least once a year and feel I understand more and am more immersed in the story every time."
dune,29qb8p,albebop,4,Thu Jul 3 17:16:12 2014 UTC,Great quote! I'd have to mirror your comment. I've read the 6 Dune books by Frank at least a dozen times and I still catch things I've missed on previous reads.
dune,29qb8p,IVHoltzmann,15,Thu Jul 3 19:05:01 2014 UTC,Anyone who says they got it all on the first read is full of shit.
dune,29qb8p,stabinthedark_,5,Thu Jul 3 17:00:20 2014 UTC,Pretty much this. The reality is you never know what you've missed until you reread it. If you're finding nothing new you're probably not reading correctly the second time
dune,29qb8p,angryfarmer922,3,Thu Jul 3 17:35:46 2014 UTC,"Totally not. As I tell everyone I recommend the book to, it took me  3 tries to even get through Dune. I had to watch the Sci-Fi channel miniseries first. Even after I finished it, it took me multiple read-throughs to understand what was really going on. For instance, the whole BG separation between animals and humans. For a while, I thought this was a literal, objective difference they were testing for. Like there were secret animal-human hybrids."
dune,29qb8p,RhinoDoom,3,Thu Jul 3 11:03:15 2014 UTC,I first read Dune when I was young... like 5th grade young. Did not fully understand all the details about the prophecies and politics of the Bene Gesserit but I understood the plots and subplots of the whole thing. It was just so cool that I read it again each year and progressively understood and read into so much more of the world and politics.
dune,29qb8p,flyincaveman,2,Thu Jul 3 17:25:10 2014 UTC,"I'm kind of in the same boat as OP, but I read them all when I was 16 or 17. So a lot of the nuances of politics and stuff escaped me. Especially with Chapterhouse and Heretics. I only understood the parts of the story that were immediately taking place and that was about it."
dune,29qb8p,Klinnea,2,Thu Jul 3 14:19:13 2014 UTC,"I was the same age when I read Dune. I didn't get around to the rest of the series until I was 22 or 23. I would say I had a ""surface"" understanding. I knew what was going on, had an idea of why people were behaving the way they did, but some of the more subtle things escaped me. Like the water for oil analogy. I didn't understand the whole ""heroes are bad"" thing either. I've since re-read the entire series several times and I feel like it makes more sense, and that I gather more insight with every read."
dune,29qb8p,flyincaveman,2,Thu Jul 3 14:54:57 2014 UTC,"Oddly enough, those were two things I actually grasped extremely well. The first three books I understood about 70% or so of the subtleties. The last three is where I ran into a brick wall of understanding."
dune,29qb8p,_miles_teg_,2,Thu Jul 3 15:04:57 2014 UTC,I followed the stories just fine but the meanings did not start the seep until much later.  I read them about once a year and have been doing do for around 20 years.  I'm in the middle of Children of Dune now and I am still pick up new things
dune,29qb8p,rocinantevi,2,Thu Jul 3 17:37:39 2014 UTC,"There's a difference between understanding and getting something out of the books. I understood the gist of the plot and the themes the first time 70% or so, but I didn't get some of relationships like Margot and Fenring, for one. I got a tremendous amount out of the books personally. On a second, third and fourth reading I was at different places in my life and I got a whole lot more out of the books each time I re-read them. Like a Rorschach test, you see what you need to see based on what you need in life."
dune,29qb8p,StashTheBashar,2,Thu Jul 3 18:10:03 2014 UTC,"Let me start by saying no, I didn't understand them the first time around.  I absorbed the story perhaps 60% the first time in each (note I didn't say 'understood')  Heretics was the stumper for me - and one of the reasons why I chose my username...it took me at least 3 reads before I actually got the full grasp of the implications of the Atreides Manifesto.      Anyway, I think that I must have read each book over 20 times each now - I still enjoy them and get a sense of anticipation each time I read them.  It would not be exaggeration to say that even now, as an old hand, I still get little nuggets from these multiple re-reads and I think, until you cannot take ANYTHING new away from a story you do not FULLY understand it :-)"
dune,29qb8p,kamatsu,2,Thu Jul 3 18:17:42 2014 UTC,"I adored Dune as a teenager, but bounced off all the later books. I read through to Chapterhouse but I didn't absorb basically any of it. I knew only vaguely what was going on. I realised it's because I focused so much on the ""popular"" bits of dune - the heroic characters of gurney, duncan, and paul; the sandworms and the fremen; and the feudal conflict between Atreides and Harkonnen. I glossed over most of the philosophical undertones, and basically everything about prescience.  I didn't even realise that, in Dune, the heroic tale of Paul is a great tragedy - He ends up doing something terrible to the universe and hating himself for it, but the alternatives are even worse. I viewed him more like a Frodo Baggins character, a completely noble hero out to save the day.   Reading them again as an adult, I can't understand how I got that sort of view of Dune. I'm also listening to the audiobooks now, which forces me to actually take in every word. I'm not missing anything this time, and now God Emperor makes complete sense (but I'm sure later readings will reveal more to me). It's captivating and fascinating."

dune,29qb8p,calahil,3,Thu Jul 3 12:56:02 2014 UTC,Yes God Emperor is jarring at first because we are like Duncan who can not believe this is a way an Atriedes would act like. I ended up more focusing on the Duncan plot because of that and missed the valuable lessons Leto was trying to impart

dune,29ehyw,apjak,21,Sun Jun 29 16:50:54 2014 UTC,"Your stance on details is valid.  Frank Herbert was smart enough to only flesh out the details you needed for the story.  He stated in interviews that certain things were not specified so that the story of Dune would not quickly be overshadowed by real science out dating Dune. Some lesser literates complain about Frank's philosophical ramblings, but that was his point, to create a story to illustrate his ideas on politics, religion, ecology and psychology etc. etc.  I have no problem with the Dune Encyclopedia's fleshing out the details because it doesn't contravene to point of Frank's books.  The sin of BH/KJA that is completely unforgivable isn't their schlocky pop sci-fi style, it's that they completely shit on the point of the Dune Series: to illustrate the dangers of humanity's desire to hand their responsibility to a Hero. Instead BH/KJA end their series by creating a Super-Ultra-Hero."

Each bite contains something different, but it is all delicious. Messiah and Children are each just as good, but there's one or two toppings missing. Still, they're delicious, and you may not even know you're missing out on something.   God Emperor is like a whole other dish, but equally rich, like a poutine. Heretics and Chapterhouse, they are au gratin potatoes and Mom's potato salad.   The KJA+BH books? They are all potato chips. Easier to make, easier to consume, and damn good at the time, but just not in the same league as the tuber that they came from."

With CGI it might be possible to create a blended live-action/animation that could do the series justice. Either way, I think it's hard to do it properly as either a series or a movie. If you do it as a movie the running time has to be very long, but a series has too much need for editing due to time constraints."
dune,29eqc0,RedMushtoom,7,Sun Jun 29 18:35:51 2014 UTC,"I think that going Beowulf on the Dune saga would be a mistake. Granted, the intersection between Dune fans and Anime fans is likely infinitesimal, but at least anime is a really good medium for conveying emotion and it is probably the only medium that can convincingly portray one of Dune's most interesting things: chess-like conversations.  You know, like the one with Mohiam, Scytale, Irulan and Edric, at the beginning of Messiah. Or the one with Waff and the Honored Matre in the shielded room. Or any conversation involving a BG. Verbal sparring, observation of minutiae.  My favorite ""device"" or ""gimmick"" in the saga is the fact that we know what the characters say and what they think. In real time. And most of the time, what they say and what they think are different things.  Frank walks you through each character's thought process, he shows you each character thinking about how to strategically gain ground in the verbal sparring that's going on, and he turns otherwise innocuous word exchanges into gripping encounters.  Live-action could never do this correctly. Did you see the David Lynch movie? The way they portray each character's thoughts? Not very convincing.  Standard western animation is made for kids, so these adult dialogue-driven characteristics are virtually non-existent. Anime has been also targeted at adults for decades, so they have more experience dealing with tense adult situations."
dune,29eqc0,RedMushtoom,2,Mon Jun 30 11:38:17 2014 UTC,"Anime is simply a style of animation. One thing to note about anime is that it's stylized for cheap, fast production that actually leaves out most details for the sake of expediency. That's why a lot of anime characters have funky colored hair. It's so the audience can tell them apart. Getting a hard on over Dune being done in anime dooms the narrative to be a slave to the medium. As far as ""western animation"" being made for kids is concerned the same is mostly true for anime. There are more anime titles targeted towards children then there are for adults. It's only been recently that audiences have started looking at animation to be a medium for serious adult narrative. Animation may be the right medium for Dune, but it's still dependent on how the director decides to portray the events. Animation, in any form, would provide a medium for visually striking ""special effects"" at a reasonable cost. Animation is getting to the point where the human eye can have difficulty distinguishing the animation from live actors. Check this out. Put in the dialog, scenery, and action, and you have yourself a stage for a mind blowing story. At that point, you might as well throw in live actors where possible.  As far as portraying a characters internal monologue is concerned, that's hard to do for any film maker."

The faces all look different, sure, but they lack human detail. Some of the eyes are flat-out unrealistic. There's no detail to the skin. That style of animation is what you'd see in DBZ. There's no room for subtlety of expression. The same can be said of the first image. The third image looks like a movie poster. Rich in detail, but you wouldn't want to animate with it.

In fact, given how the Clone Wars was handled, I would say it's an absolute certainty that it's logistically possible to do the entire Original Series in CG, and do it really well.

dune,29eqc0,Realik,4,Mon Jun 30 17:19:36 2014 UTC,"I think anime is a good medium, because it has a tradition of conveying lots of dialogue\inner monologue subtleties visually.  For example, the scene in Heretics where Waff confronts Honored Matres for the first time. I bring this particular scene up because I read it a couple of days ago and it's the best appropriate example I can think up right now.  Anyways, that scene. When the Matre calls guardians in, Waff notices that one of them is a Tleilaxu Face Dancer. At that moment he experiences a mixtureof emotions - astonishment, triumph, and then faked subjugation and awe.  Now, we notice these things when we read it, because we, so to speak, have access into Waff's head. It's literally spelled out for us. The Honored Matre, however, doesn't notice this rapid change of emotions, because Waff conceals them.  If we adapt this into live action, we have sort of a dilemma. We can't realistically display all that play of emotions in Waff in a way so that the watcher picks it up, but the Honored Matre doesn't. The only way is to change the scene somehow - make it that the Matre can't see his face for a moment, or something like that.  The anime, on the other hand, has long tradition of displaying\conveying  inner thoughts and subtle changes of emotions visually - all these grin close-ups, or concealed eyes, or a close-up on the eyes, or inner reactions, ""visible"" only to a watcher.  If you want to adapt Dune while conveying all those dialogues\thought trains etc, anime would be a go-to medium. Sure it would still look rather cheesy, but it's sort of cheesiness that goes with any other anime.  And you have lots of this stuff happening throughout the books when people speak one thing but think\mean multitudes of other, like Paul's ""Disengage, disengage"" moments, the Guild-Tleilaxu-BG meetup, Leto II and Jessica dialogues, and such.  (Sorry for crappy images, these are the first ones I could find on a short notice.)"

dune,29avzu,enitnepres,9,Sat Jun 28 22:52:31 2014 UTC,Poop isnt really any more toxic to you than pee is (and neither are sterile). Basically where you get all your water is by your colon drinking shitwater all day long. And it is really good at it too. About 12 litres of this watery slugde passes in your guts every day and just about 10% of it comes out and the rest is recycled. When you are dehydrated the poop comes out drier as your body tries to get as much water from it as possible. Likely what the still suit would have to work with would be quite hard lumps of poop and not much of it since the fremen most likely dont eat that many vegetables rich in fiber.

Once you get down to it, Dune is about Paul's family and place in the universe getting threatened by the Baron, and Children of Dune is about Leto's family and place in the universe getting threatened by the Baron.  In each book, the hero hides in the dessert to train, gains powers, and comes back to take control.  Personally, I think Children of Dune would have been better if Ghanima was given more to do.  She just lets Leto take control by the end of the book without giving a challenge or reason.  Now that I think about it, a book that takes place between Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune could be very interesting.  Ghanima could start to see her brother becoming more inhuman, and starts trusting him less.  Leto becomes paranoid of his sister, since she is Muad'Dib's child, she has equal claim to his legacy as Leto II.

dune,28uepb,gigaquack,18,Mon Jun 23 04:25:32 2014 UTC,"This. Through a combination spice awareness, Atreides precognition, and Mentat analysis, Paul saw with near perfection all paths that humanity could take. Almost all of them ended with extinction, and the one that didn't required him to become a monster who is venerated as a hero by those closest to him. Messiah is all about his struggle with that position, his loneliness in being the only person in his circle to see himself for the murderer he is, and his inability to do anything about that without dooming his entire species.  We are meant to admire and detest Paul simultaneously because, as is Frank Herbert's point throughout the series, everyone who's ever been called a hero deserves both admiration and detestation if one only looks close enough."
dune,28uepb,schleppylundo,4,Mon Jun 23 11:05:10 2014 UTC,"Ahh... that's a clear and thoughtful explanation.  thanks.  Though it feels a bit like deus ex machima (if that's the correct usage) in that the author needed to create the detested hero and so needed to have the hero do horrible things.  But if the author had the hero simply start beheading everyone for no reason, we wouldn't have any empathy for the ""hero"" anymore.  So instead the author lets the hero commit all of the atrocities but conveniently explains that the hero ""had to"" - it was not his choice - the LSD visions in my head made me do it (in order to, theoretically, save humanity).  So we, the readers, have an excuse to forgive the atrocities and sympathize with the ""hero"" who was ""forced"" to kill people for simply insulting him.  hrmmm..   yeah, I'm remembering now that the book was alot more enjoyable in my youth when all I read into it was that there was a dude riding giant worms into battle and fighting with knives and electro-shields.  IMHO, The Game of Thrones books do a much better job of portraying an emperor swept up in the difficulties (and guilt) of being a revered (and reviled) leader.  Daenerys Targaryen."
dune,28uepb,ImpurityElement,5,Tue Jun 24 03:58:42 2014 UTC,"I know it's been a while since you posted this, but I wanted to offer this as I've just finished Dune. (I have not read Dune Messiah, but from the brief bits here, it sounds like it is just a telling of the ""Jihad sweeping the universe."")  The line that really made the Jihad make sense to me was one of Princess Irulan's forewords.   He tells us ""The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door."" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning ""That path leads ever down into stagnation.""   ""That path leads ever down into stagnation.""  That line is said once more in reference to The Guild, in the way that they look into the future to ensure safe passage.  It feeds into fear being ""the little-death,"" ""the mind killer.""  Paul at first abhorred the Jihad, and was always weary that it loomed in the future, but that he might be able to stop it.  After truly realizing his powers, he accepts that it is the only course of action, and that it is the only way to stop the path ""ever into stagnation.""  Granted, to accept Paul as a hero, you have to believe that his powers as the Kwisatz Haderach are more than an LSD trip, and believe that he is truly prescient.  I think the book gives you more than enough to believe that."
dune,28uepb,albebop,3,Wed Jul 2 00:39:40 2014 UTC,"A great response! You have a pretty good grasp of the story for someone who hasn't read the second book :)    Regarding Prescience, you put you finger right on the fantastical fulcrum of a BIG part of the entire series; and considering how loosely all the other  ""sci-fi"" elements of the story are (namely the technology), I'd say Prescience is the only real ""fantasy"" element which requires suspension of disbelief, and Herbert does a pretty thorough job on selling the validity of it in the Dune universe, and doesn't just use it as a Deus Ex Machina but as a very compelling aspect of the characters themselves.  Paul would be a very different character if he wasn't plagued by visions of the future, it isn't just a ""power"" he can use.  This, combined with the rich visualization that Herbert gives of the experience (as illustrated by your quote) gives a solid grounding for the reader to accept the Prescient experience as valid."
dune,28uepb,eeeezypeezy,2,Thu Jul 3 17:54:05 2014 UTC,"This is a fantastic post.   I understood prescience in the series to be a vivid vision of all possible outcomes at once, more a hyper-enhanced mentat analysis of the present than a true ""seeing the future."""

He amassed so much power and veneration - tied into messianic ideas of justice, revenge and expansion, that it had to go somewhere.  If he had tried to stop it, denied the fremen their Jihad, etc. - it would have exploded after his death. Maybe as a fractured Qizarate, maybe as one couped by the hardliners. The pent up anger and expextations now that the Messia was here could not be stopped - he just chose to be at the helm when the dam broke. IMHO, it was to ""punish himself"" and maybe to stem the tide. To turn public opinion against his person, take responsibility for the Jihad, so that it could be blamed on him and stopped.  Oh, and a war was brewing in the empire, the stagnation of the feudal system was inevitable, as was the conclusion."

The other 5 books, of the original 6 written by Frank Herbert, are absolutely amazing. The first 4 fit together fairly decently, except that the 4th does kinda of make a strange jump in time that some find uncomfortable. The last two were, I believe, meant to be a separate series jumping off everything that was setup during the first 4. Personally, Book 6 is my favorite followed closely by 4. That being the case, for you I suggest at least reading 2&3 and check out 4, if you're out at 4 then don't worry about it. Most people find it strange to continue the same universe with a completely different cast of characters. Back to your question, ""is it worth reading?"" I say definitely! then again I am spending time commenting on a thread about the book so what do you expect me to say?"

Messiah isn't long and it features a different style than Dune, one that based on your comments you may find refreshing.   Messiah should be the transition step to the third book, Children of Dune. You should without a doubt, honor a dead man enough to read through the trilogy. You're already waste deep in Muad'dib, but you should give his kids a try for sure. Messiah and Children are both different than Dune, and arguably less difficult to get into(as you've already been introduced to the characters) so I think you would be very pleased with the next two in the saga."

Dune: Messiah - 12 years after Dune, deconstructs Paul and the Messiah Myth.  Children of Dune - 20 years after Dune, about Paul's kids.  This is the closest book to Dune, but it gets weird in the final quarter of the book, when one of the characters starts transforming.  God Emperor of Dune - takes place 3500 years or so after Dune.  It's about how the last surviving person from Children of Dune has become a tyrant, and is forcing the known Universe to bend to his will so it can escape a worse destiny.  (You can skip the pervious 2 books and jump to this one if you want.  But you just have to pay close attention to EVERYTHING.)  Heretics of Dune - takes place 15000 years or so after Dune.  It's about the legacy of the planet itself, and we start to see the tyrants actions work against the mysterious threat.  Chapterhouse Dune - takes place on a ship 12 years after the last book.  It involves people talking, on a ship, for the entire book.  For some reason this is many Dune fans' favorite sequel.  Just know that it ends on a cliff hanger that Frank Herbert never followed up, because he died shortly after publishing this."

As a matter of fact, I would applaud his literacy for recognising the deus ex machina element in the book.  Having said that, OP, if you didn't enjoy Dune you probably won't enjoy the rest of the books. It's ok, you're allowed to disagree with the majority :)"
dune,28m3s2,fortean,10,Fri Jun 20 11:41:47 2014 UTC,"It's not a great description in the modern understanding, though. Paul's final strategies are foreshadowed extensively (understanding and controlling the spice cycle, the family atomics), and importantly Paul's fight with Feyd is made clear to be an event on which fate is undecided - with all his foresight, Paul recognizes that that moment in his future is in flux.  I would argue that only the first half is a Greek tragedy - the second half sees Paul choose a fate for himself rather than become enslaved totally by it, which is a lot more freedom than a classical Greek tragedy allows."

Patton and Kennedy were two others he took aim at, but his principle objection was the conservative; the idea that anyone should lead you or that you ought to put blind trust in an authority figure was idiocy, since we're all human and human flaws magnified by power create disasters. Superhuman flaws, then, would create civilization level disasters...  As for the hero ethos, it's more a human feature than western lit. Herbert was familiar with Joseph Campbell (his editor on Dune, in fact), and his Hero of a Thousand Faces, but his son also noted in Dreamer of Dune that the book Frank kept going back to was The Golden Bough, another mythic-analyzing text finding common themes in human stories globally.

The ones who can rally themselves around a leader to the point of religious or quasi-religious fervor would probably more likely to fight together than the ones constantly questioning and undermining that leader and that unity.  However, in the long term, it doesn't last. The power structures that get formed by that charismatic leader, get institutionalized and ossified, and things eventually fall apart, for them to start anew with a different/successor civilization.

That being said, I would believe that spice & sand have a different weight. So in the same way goldpanners pan the riverbed, & harvesters thresh wheat, a harvester would mechanically collect the dried spice blow with the surrounding sand, then perhaps it uses centrifugal forces to separate, compress, & store the spice, & then blows the remaining sand up in air through the exhaust vent, making a dust cloud for Gurney Halleck to observe & mention to Duke Leto during their first Inspection with Dr. Kynes."

I always assumed it was powdery...but it reminds me of mixing salt and pepper and sifting it through. I wonder how accurate the process is, I mean desert sand is different than say, beach sand. What about the small rocks that throw in variables of weight in the sand/spice mixture like pea sand? I can figure it's a filter system, but I can't imagine how it works.   Even with the fremen, that don't have spice Harvesters...how do they manually sift through the spice and sand by hand? I assume with pans...but that makes me wonder again how heavy spice is compared to sand. To me it seems like you would still get sand granules in spice, or rather a heck of a work day in monotony sifting and filtering sand for 12 hours. I can't accurately picture how the process works, though I absolutely lack the education to mechanically comprehend the process."

The Fremen didn't need harvesters to do it because they were only collecting enough spice for themselves, and to bribe the smugglers and guild with.  The occupying houses were responsible for harvesting enough to export to the rest of the galaxy and so needed the teams of collectors using the spotters and harvesters."

dune,2893jr,Psyladine,2,Mon Jun 16 15:08:47 2014 UTC,That would be incredibly dangerous as the gas buildups make spice blows ticking time bombs. The only safe way to gather spice is after a blow when the sun has dried out the compound.

In Maker of Dune he specifically states that he omitted key details of the universe so that the reader's desire to have that knowledge fulfilled would feed into the 'coital rhythm' of the book, and that when it ended abruptly, the mind would go careening off, and in the search for answers, create the tapestry within their mind around suggestive terms and hinted concepts.

Sand is very fine (the most fine type of granular rock/mineral, compared to silt and clay), but the guild navigators stay in chambers of spice gas. If spice is a complex organic material, it won't be volatile enough to vaporize. But if it's a very fine powder (like flour), then it would float through the air like gas.  Of course, it might just be ground up later on in the process. In which case, they could sift out the finer sand during the collection process.

""Great Bled: open, flat desert, as opposed to the erg-dune area. Open desert runs from about 60° north to 70° south. It is mostly sand and rock, with occasional outcroppings of basement complex.""  I take that to mean the 60° line is the boundary of the deep desert. As far as the axial tilt of Arrakis is concerned, I doubt it's as extreme as on Earth. There's no mention of Arrakis having seasons, and Arrakeen has a noted night/day cycle."
dune,282xaj,boarhog,1 point,Sat Jun 14 15:10:02 2014 UTC,"Arrakeen would experience days where the sun never completely set in the summers.    Sun not setting above 60th latitude is caused by tilt in Earth's axis. Earth's axis is tilted roughtly 23,5 degrees regards to sun which causes that. If Arrakis' axis is straight, it would only happen very high north, around north pole.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"

'Who knows what they have invented out there in the Scattering""  I, for one, agree with the viewpoint that the uber Face Dancers absorbed so much knowledge they were essentially gods (incidentally one of his fairly recurrent themes in some of his other works)  They certainly had a whole slew of all the major players absorbed into their personalities.  I am not so sure that Marty and Daniel watch over the rest of humanity, as the point of the Scattering was to make humans so diverse and dispersed that they could not be threatened as a single organism again, nor viewed as a whole again, but, like I say, you have a very good point that can be very strongly argued.

It is based upon David Lynch's 1984 movie Dune, an adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel of the same name.  While not necessarily the first real-time strategy (RTS) game (elements of which previously appeared in Stonkers, The Ancient Art of War, Command HQ, and particularly Herzog Zwei), Dune II established the format that would be followed for years to come.   As such, Dune II was the archetypal ""real-time strategy"" game. Striking a balance between complexity and innovation, it was a huge success and laid the foundation for the coming Command & Conquer, Warcraft, Age of Empires and StarCraft series, and many other RTS games.

A system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has order, a flowing from point to point. If something dams the flow, order collapses.

Such as, how do they block the water off, and what happens to it when theyve sealed it off? How do the trout turn in to the worms?  My guess? I think that the trout use the water to sustain themselves until they change into the worms. The worms dont need water, which is good, because the trout have already consumed it all by the time they change to the worms. If that's the case, the worms having such an aversion to water makes sense, as it keeps them from eliminating the product needed by the trout ro create more worms.   So to answer your question, my hypothesis is that if you dropped a trout in to a cistern, it would consume as much water as it needed, and leave to become a Sandworm. And if it couldn't leave, it would either stay a trout and possibly continue to suck up water, or change into a small worm in the cistern and die from the remaining water. That would depend on whether the transformation was triggered as soon as the trout consumed a certain amount of water, or if it didn't start until the trout was in a location safe for the change to happen.  I freely admit that this is all my own conjecture. I have nothing to back it up because its just how I think it would work. If anyone has a canon source that states otherwise, feel free to correct me."

I doubt something the size and complexity of a sandworm spontaneously appeared, at some point sandtrout had to evolve from something, so it seems likely that they would have a trait allowing them to reproduce without forming a worm.

My sister's has a wider variation, and she's pretty quick to correct you to her version. (Alia and Chani, if you were curious)"

dune,27w8qd,lambros009,13,Wed Jun 11 18:11:19 2014 UTC,"If you want to. The second novel is, in my opinion, the weakest of them all, so I'm not surprised it didn't light you on fire. The third novel closes out the first trilogy and concludes the story of Paul's jihad and is pretty good, I think.  The fourth novel stands alone. I like it a lot.  The fifth and sixth novels are the first two parts of an intended second trilogy that takes place thousands of years after the first trilogy. These are my favorite books in the series. The sixth novel ends on a cliffhanger; it's pretty clear that Herbert meant to write one last book to end the story, but he died before he had the chance. Personally I kind of like the cliffhanger. The overarching theme of the whole series of novels has to do with the dangers of predictability and humanity's quest to become unpredictable, so it's kind of thematically resonant that the story ends with the main characters disappearing into the void so completely that even the author can't tell their story any more.  The bottom line is this: You might or might not like the other books. Lots of people do, lots more people don't. Read them or not; it's entirely up to you."

dune,27w8qd,MortRouge,2,Wed Jun 11 18:16:11 2014 UTC,"CoD is a downer. Rereading the series (second, third, etc. time) it grew on me, though. It is the punch in the gut, after the high of Paul's succes. It twists all the wounds laid open in Dune, and does so expertly.  In my view: Dune is a masterpiece of literature. Dune Messiah is the epilogue that drives home the truly horrible points made in Dune (forcing you to reread it, of course). Children of Dune is the continuation of the same themes and ideas, showing a bit of optimism, really... (All three were planned together, chapters of Messiah written before some chapters in Dune - they are a thematic and plot-wise whole).  God Emperor of Dune is the epilogue to Children of Dune, summing up the themes and ideas that went before. Same theme, new (little to no) plot.  Heretics and Chapterhouse of Dune are really their own thing. I believe, and I think interviews support this, that they were ideas for books, modified to fit into the Dune universe to sell better. They are not quickly written to make a buck without respect for the originals, but they do tell new stories from a new standpoint. I like them, but they are not part of the same thematically tighter whole of the first 3-4 books."

There is another prominent group that thinks it gets progressively better, and those are the people who like the first books adventuresque parts. The series gets more and more philosophical and cerebral, which somewhat dissapoint people who likes direct, dramatic intrigue and action.  For the record, it was Dune Messiah that actually made me want to read more of the series. I get that people think it is the low point of the series, and in many ways is it. But it is quite different from Dune, so I give Herbert some slack. The pacing and writing is a bitt stiff, but the premise is fantastic.  God Emperor of Dune is one of the best sci-fi books ever written, and definately a hidden gem of 20th century litterature in general."

Both are definitely in a different vein than Dune, and much more expansive than Messiah, but have wonderful philosophically interesting conversations between characters.  If anything, Children continues some of the characters that have affected to story, and how they turn out in the end."
dune,27w8qd,Realik,1 point,Thu Jun 12 16:47:52 2014 UTC,"I highly recommend that you continue the series and read Children of Dune. I just finished reading it yesterday and am excited to continue the series and start God Emperor in the next few days.  This is my second read through of the original series I finished all the BH/KJA book over the past couple of years and coming back to Frank Herbert's writing has been a wonderful experience. What I enjoy the most from these books are the conversations between characters and there are many great dialogues in COD. The story of COD is a great examination on the struggles of power and leadership and the difficult decisions that must be made in the wake of Messiahs ending. Every character is plotting to shape the empire for their own benefits and watching all these threads intertwine is a great journey.   Try not to rush through this book, put it down if a chapter you are reading feels slow and come back when you feel refreshed. This is a longer book than Messiah but full of great commentary and philosophy that can be missed if you are reading for the next plot point to develop.  Let your imagination run wild, take time to visualize the imagery FH writes and of course have fun!"

dune,27t4qy,MortRouge,2,Wed Jun 11 09:01:28 2014 UTC,"French is my first language. So, ""literally"" is a problem, due to the fact that the word 'mort' can have a couple of meanings, including a dead male body, the adjective 'dead', and of course good ol' Scythe-Wielding Friend, Death itself.  The definitive article is pretty rarely implied, because it establishes proper grammatical context.  Also, the adjective is not always after the noun. It can be placed before the noun, and it usually develops a new meaning there. My favorite such example is the difference between ""un grand homme"" and ""un homme grand"", but I'm sure you won't need me to explain."
dune,27t4qy,Trevoke,1 point,Wed Jun 11 11:52:02 2014 UTC,Of course. I was mostly interested in the word-order.

dune,27t4qy,Trevoke,1 point,Wed Jun 11 13:08:10 2014 UTC,"Your original response claimed that my nickname is literally translated to DeadRed or DeathRed, using the word-order found in french. Me saying I was interested in the word order does not mean I find something more or less interesting. What I meant was that the other grammatical issues was of less concern for me.  For the sake of understanding, my nickname is taken from The Mask of the Red Death by Poe, which is referenced in The Phantom of the Opera, set in France. Removing ""la"" makes it sound like a given name, with a first name and a surname, since Mort is a common shortening of Mortimer. But the original reference is ""La mort rouge""."

No chance that these two clowns were anywhere in the supposed notes Brian found for Dune 7.  It's literally pissing on his father's grave.  Chapterhouse's ending is infuriating for the reader but it's infinitely better to be left wondering what happened than to have this shit sandwich served to you.  I actually enjoyed the House series despite the books being absolute drivel when it comes to the prose.  Every 20 pages there's a recap of what you just read 20 pages earlier.  Gets pretty annoying for someone who reads 80-100 pages per sitting when 1/3 of it is just regurgitated nonsense.

I like the House Trilogy, granted I read it about ten years ago or so when it came out. The Dune 7 duo had potential and had some good moments but ends up twisting around the plot a decent bit in an odd way. Not a bad read, just not on par with the saga it's trying to wrap up mostly for twisting the plot."
dune,27t2kl,lundse,2,Tue Jun 10 20:25:16 2014 UTC,"I would read it and make your own opinion   Or, you could ask readers you think you'll agree with what they think. Your choice... If you read the other NuDune books and want to know if they are comparable and if any criticism you felt were valid of those books are also held against the two socalled sequels, then I'd advice you to ask and heed warnings.  It all comes down to what you want in your scifi and thought was cool about Dune. Political intrigue, characterisation, philosophical musings in a rich world, or pew-pew awesome lasers writing ultraworms producing ultraspice for ultra-space-time-goddesses and the evil crossdressing robots that hate them.    It is interesting, though, how much time this sub is using on the BH/KJA fanfics. But I think it comes with the territory of being a ""landing page"" for people seeking opinions and knowledge of Dune.

But it is absolutely not in any way Frank Herbert's intention for book 7. If such an outline even actually exists (doubtful). If you are into fan fiction and such it might be a fun read.

I only read those and the House prequels and Dunish 7, and they can all kind of be decent if they re-wrote the FH novels. If they did a reboot and completely went to mass-market sharks-with-lasers-for-eyes they could maybe make it happen.   However, the Dunish 7 books, because they are supposed to be sequels, don't fit in at all and without reading the other KJA/BH books, it's a completely bizarre and very disappointing read."

Since I didn't know English (and barely how to read at all) at the time it was doubly mysterious and alien to me. It was hard not to think of Atreides as having blue uniforms and Harkonnen red after that. Also because of an earlier Dune game this is how Gurney and Chani will always look in my mind. Then I decided to read the books and made the mistake of starting with House Harkonnen (because I liked them in the video games) and even as an early teen I recognized that it was an awful book. I thought the Dune books were awful till recently when I decided to read the originals after seeing the Lynch film.
dune,27s45y,2tothe8th,5,Tue Jun 10 14:59:39 2014 UTC,"Lynch's movie is how the universe looks to me. I've heard that Herbert was involved and liked the look of that movie, calling it a ""visual feast"" at one point. That's enough of an endorsement for me. Does the movie work? Probably not. But it looks good while it's not working and my interest and love of the universe filled in the gaps in the movie that may have tripped up a casual viewer.   Here an article that describes some of Herbert's opinions on the matter.  As far as the BH/KJA fiasco, I stopped reading the minute I realized that it would affect me view of the established universe and not in a good way.   I really wanted to like the expanded possibilities of the scyfy miniseries but the look just didn't work for me. May have been the stupid hats."

To take the first line of their ""additions"" as an example, you already have to chose whether Baron Harkonnen became fat because he let himself go, revelling in the pleasures of the flesh and disgusting people - or because a Bene Gesserit (renowned for being emotionally detached, abhorring revenge as childish and working exclusively behind the scenes of politics and war) infected him with a vengeance-vagina-virus.  One or the other. Either Frank's work is canon, or KJA/BH's is.  That you even consider the vengeance-vagina-virus scenario as possibly canon (and all that entails about the Bene Gesserit's powers, motivations, etc.) is, however, a great example of what OP seems to be looking for..."
dune,27s45y,ellohir,1 point,Tue Jun 10 17:37:56 2014 UTC,"The examples I've said show that I believe canon is determined by the owner of the IP. After the death of Tolkien, it was his son who took his multiple notes and decided which ones were canon and which ones were not. Then he published the canon ones on The Silmarillion, and Middle-Earth evolved and improved a lot from that book.   you already have to chose whether Baron Harkonnen became fat because he let himself go, revelling in the pleasures of the flesh and disgusting people - or because a Bene Gesserit (renowned for being emotionally detached, abhorring revenge as childish and working exclusively behind the scenes of politics and war) infected him with a vengeance-vagina-virus.   I don't think these two are incompatible. The Baron was described as a disgusting person, he liked to pleasure his body tracking and hunting children. He enjoyed running, hitting and killing. Now, after these activities were vetoed by disease, he turned to more passive pleasures. Also, the reverend mother was young back then, and it set an example of how the school is not as monolithic as it may seem (as Jessica and post-God Emperor Gesserit would show later on).  Yes, I agree that BH/KJA are not books that have the style or consistency of BH. But it's where its owners have decided to turn the series to. You cannot decide ""that's not what I believe"", because what happens is what the official books say."
dune,27s45y,lundse,2,Tue Jun 10 17:58:14 2014 UTC,"My definition of canon is the most reductive one: canon is what the original author said was canon.  The fact that Brian Herbert shares DNA with Frank doesn't give him the right to retroactively redefine his father's work, especially when, quite evidently, he is ""a lesser son of greater sires"".  Call it semi-canon, call it canon-by-affinity, call it copyright canon, but it is not actual canon."

dune,27l5mg,AwkwardSexySpaceFish,18,Sun Jun 8 01:03:24 2014 UTC,"I'll take a shot at it, but keep in mind this is all just my opinion. I'm going to go in the order the books would go, not the order they were released.  The Legends of Dune Trilogy  For a random sci fi trilogy, it's not that bad. In the context of the Dune universe, it is, at best, lacking direction and respect to it's source material. Of all the books written by BH KA, these should have been the easiest to write because they could pretty much do what they wanted, seeing as how it was set so far in the past. In the end, you have a somewhat interesting story that ends as anticlimactically as a book can, and if that was all I would give them a pass. The biggest problem with the book is two fold. First, by the end of the books, all the major schools, political factions, and great houses are more or less in place, but in the most ham-fisted way possible. There is nothing really believable about the mentat school(that will make sense to you later) and the hatred between the Harkonens and the Atreides is not convincing at all. The other, and I feel the bigger, issue with the trilogy is that by the end it is clear that the entire series is just BHKA pretty much saying we will change the fabric of the Dune universe in order to tell the story we want, not necessarily what makes sense in the already established works. The reason I say that is they introduce to particular characters that don't really work, but end up being the most important additions to the BHKA version of the Dune universe. It makes it feel as though all the history and tradition of the works is second place to the need to get these two characters front and center so they can...well, I don't want to spoil things.  TL;DR The Legends of Dune trilogy is a decently written sci-fi story, but not a great addition to the Dune universe. Overall, a little below average.  The House Trilogy  Of all the BHKA books, these are my favorite. In all honesty, if you are set on reading anything outside the original works, these would be the books to read. The story more or less centers on Leto's journey from childhood to leader of a great house. And this may be a really unpopular opinion, but I think House Harkonen such a good book, it could have been written by Frank himself (well, almost).  Now, with that being said, it aint all good. Many of the established characters have personality tweeks that don't really mesh with the FH books, and others are different people all together. Some people were turned off by the constant violence, which I can understand, and in many places the story feels more like fan fiction that additions to the Dune universe. Also, there is no subtlety at all, everything is just strait forward and over simplified to the point that it can seem patronizing. One thing Frank was good at was layering stories with intrigue, passion,  and mysticism right next to talks of economics and politics. Nope, not in the house books. Everyone is as one dimensional as can be (maybe not the good Count).  But you could do much, much worse. Overall pretty good books with some minor flaws BUT one major, major, you can't ignore this plot hole that contradicts the later books pretty hard. Anyone that has read the Dune books will know that a certain thing that happens with a certain House is just forgotten about forever* and it makes no sense at all.  TL;DR Of everything they have written, the three House books are at worst the least offensive and at best really decent books that keep the spirit of the Dune universe.  Hunters and Sandworms  O boy..... Of the two, Hunters is the better book. It's plenty exciting, I will give it that, and there is no lack of action or plot. Now with that being said, the action is...hectic for the sake of being hectic, and the plot makes no god damn sense. If you read what I said earlier about the Legend books, this is that payoff of what they were trying to set up. Which would almost be ok, but that means that BHKA decided that what they wanted to introduce was more important than say, understanding what Frank Herbert had written in any way at all. These books, god damn man, god damn. For the grand finale of the Dune universe, it's...underwhelming. Any pretense of characters using common sense or at least resembling the FH written characters goes strait out the door. Good lord.  TL;DR Lots of stuff happening, but no one really seems to know why. I guess if you read the other books, might as well read these too.  Heroes of Dune  Fuck everything about these books. No redeeming factor at all. Hell these books are not even consistent with the other books BHKA had written before. Say what you will about the previous BHKA books, at least the stories were told in a competent fashion. None of the books are written well. It's unbelievably bad. The problem with the word hate is that it can not truly express my feelings for this dreadfully written and completely unnecessary piece of shit. Fuck these books.  Fuck these books.  Seriously, you did all that crap in Sandworms so you can mention a god damn knife? Fuck these books.  And Duncan, what the fuck were you doing? This is your idea of protecting the son of the Duke?! Aborigine fishing!? What?!  Chani, I just.....  Fuck these books   TL:DR Paul is not a fucking Jedi. Eat a dick.    I have no desire to read another book from those clowns after that, so you are on your own for the rest."
dune,27l5mg,goatlll,2,Sun Jun 8 03:55:57 2014 UTC,So the BH KJA books series are basically decent standalone books/series with the exception of Heroes but they don't tie in well with the FH books. Also BH KJA are kind of redefining their own version of Dune (If I'm reading correctly). Is there any sense of depth to them or are they just 'things happen then more thing happen then something else happens and we're done' type books?
dune,27l5mg,goatlll,6,Sun Jun 8 14:03:04 2014 UTC,"Pretty much they fall into the ""things are happening"" style of story telling.   The biggest problem by far with the books is that they feel like, and this is a bit of a stretch but bare with me, the direct to dvd version of Disney movies. Take the Lion King for example. It's a solid movie that has humor, action, and other entertaining elements while at the same time providing a solid story. You are never confused as to the motivation of the characters and you are never just spoon fed character development. Now look at the strait to dvd Simba's Pride. Sure it looks like the Lion King, and you can recognize all the elements from the source material, but the movie overall is lacking. It lost it's soul and no one seems to ask themselves ""Is this story worth telling"" and it shows.  That to me is the BHKA books overall. For every ""Return of Jafar"", you get 6 ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"".   And even that would be ok if we were talking about another book series, but this is Dune. Dune deserves better, much much better. It is, to me anyway, the greatest sci-fi series ever written, and Dune is one of the greatest books ever written without any qualifiers attached."
dune,27l5mg,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,2,Sun Jun 8 15:31:59 2014 UTC,"I think that the ""things happen"" description is pretty accurate for alot of the ones I've read. Hunters and Sandworms were disappointing as the end to such a magnificent series. The last few chapters of Sandworms especially.  SO much deus ex machina.   The House series was ok, although it started out at a low point with House Atreides. The next two books were readable though, if you can get past the areas where they contradict established cannon.   I havent read all of the Heroes books, but I did enjoy Paul of Dune. Recently tried to listen to the audio book for Winds of Dune,and just couldn't do it. The characters dont match up with Frank's original depiction of them, the characters make ridiculous decisions, and the Bene Geserit apparently have people who are called ""guilt casters,"" which is exactly as ridiculous as it sounds.   Started the first of the Jihad books, and it seemed ok. I can't say I got too far into it though.   I also started the first of the School series, Sisterhood of Dune. Finished about 40% of it before I gave up. All of the characters are flat and super one dimensional, not believable at all as real people. I want to finish it, but reading it was almost painful.   At their best, the new books are tolerable sci fi. At their worst, they make your head hurt with their stupidity. My advice is to give them a shot if you want, but to keep your expectations low. Dont start reading them and expect them to be like the originals. If you know what youre in for, maybe you'll be able to enjoy them more than others have."
dune,27l5mg,ellohir,1 point,Sun Jun 8 18:18:40 2014 UTC,"Nice post, I agree on everything. I was so excited when I read House Atreides... A good for worthy of the Dune name to me. The other two House books were a bit dissapointing but ok. Legends really stepped down a lot, so much thay Hunters/Sandworms look like a decent ending.  And I'm not getting anywhere near Heroes. That's just greed to me, writing between chapters of the original books."
dune,27l5mg,ItFrightensMe,15,Sun Jun 8 12:15:06 2014 UTC,Anything not written by Frank Herbert is just bad fan fiction.
dune,27l5mg,banjist,8,Sun Jun 8 01:35:01 2014 UTC,"I just read the two ""final"" books by BH/KJA, Hunters and Sandworms of Dune. I've put it off for years now, but they were at the library and I was bored.  Without getting into the plot too much, my biggest gripe is that they insist on tying every last little plot thread up far more nicely than I think Frank would ever have done. There were some ideas they introduced that I could see being something they built off some mysterious notes they found in Frank's estate, but some of the shit that goes on in the books goes so far off the reservation that it's really almost offensive to the sensibilities of a long time fan of the original six books.  I did read the original prequel trilogy they wrote back when it came out while I was in high school, and it was sometimes entertaining pulp sci-fi. It was nowhere near the standards of the original series and it missed a lot of the depth that made the original books great. I gave up on them way back when after reading the first book in the Butlerian Jihad trilogy and realizing they turned this vague almost mythic and symbolic struggle from Dune lore into basically a giant masturbatorial robot mech wannabe anime story.  I think it's more the cavalier way they handled Frank's legacy set against all the lip service they pay to honoring the man's genius that makes me dislike the books. I read the ones that ""finish"" the series, and to be honest I kind of regret it. The ending was so trite and contrived that even if I could see hints of some ideas that may have originated with Frank Herbert, it was such a slog to get through and such an annoying epilogue to the series that I was mostly just annoyed.  If you want to see for yourself the difference, start out by reading the original Dune, then pick up House Atreides and read the first few chapters. I think the difference will be immediately apparent. Then you can decide on your own whether to continue with them."

dune,27l5mg,vonpoppm,2,Thu Jun 19 18:06:12 2014 UTC,"It's honestly a fact that people are expecting the BH books to be the same as the FH books and when they aren't they end up upset. They are different and if you go in knowing that then you're probably fine and you will either enjoy them or you won't.   I look at it kind of like Larry Niven's Known Universe having the Man-Kzin Wars. While he's well known for Ringworld and the Known Universe series of books, he does have other authors writting stories in the universe. This was done in the Man-Kzin War novels, people sometimes dislike these too because they aren't written like Niven would.   I don't see the issue, to me it's obviously by a different author and it's going to be different. Don't like it that's fine, but you may.

dune,27l5mg,lundse,1 point,Tue Jun 10 13:57:33 2014 UTC,"""Continuity issues"" is a very mild way to put it. I'd say they went directly against Frank Herbert's characterisation of basically every character, redid the history of the universe to their liking/understanding, and spoke directly against the the very point of the entire series. All those things are facts, easily verified by anyone who remembers Frank Herberts characterisation of eg. the Baron, the Butlerian Jihad and the views of heroes he specifically said he was trying to put forth.  ""Hate boner"" I will not adress, except to say you would come across as less childish if you refrained from that kind of language. Your enjoyment of the NuDune books is noted, on topic and obviously a perfectly all right belief to hold and write.  But.  I never talked against you giving your opinion. It was you who tried belittling mine with your inane Lebowsky reference, after you misrepresented the quarrels I and others have, as if the problem could b reduced to one of ""their different"" or ""don't expect the same"".

dune,27jb90,impforpresident,7,Sat Jun 7 07:52:31 2014 UTC,"Some spoilers:      There are a few clues to things that happened, and the desperation of the Famine Times and Scattering in Heretics of Dune, and the origin of the Honoured Matres is (sort of) explained when Murbella goes through the Agony in Chapterhouse.      Something that struck me when reading the later 3 books was that Leto's whole organisation tumbled as soon as he was dead...the Fish Speakers took their share of the spice hoard and wasted it, Arrakis became a battleground for those who sought the legendary spice hoard (to me this implies that the control of the planet itself was not maintained by any authority, at least for the first 500 years or so) but there still remained enough momentum in the Million Planets for the major players to survive, except for CHOAM.      A question that I would like answered relates to yours: How did the Guild survive whole? Were their stores of spice adequate to the task or, as seems more likely to me (given that the point of the Scattering was to 'lose' humanity beyond any capability to trace) did the old, non-prescient ships make a comeback?  The desperation of those times is always emphasised; I think that many of the Scattering efforts were made using those ships, out of sheerneed to escape to pastures new.      My personal take on the timeline immediately after Leto's death goes as follows: Siona and Duncan, now mindful of the need to preserve the Golden Path, start breeding. Perhaps there is love, perhaps not; both of them are pragmatic enough to realize the need outweighs emotional issues. Leto had 3000 years to set up Siona to be massively fertile, and like has already been said, Duncan the Amourous need only look at a woman to impregnate her.  Supposing Siona bore twins in every pregnancy, and that she was serially pregnant.  Her Fish Speaker command would give her a care structure for her children, and places to safely house them, in the remnants of the Empire. (Remember they ARE Atreides, so even then might not be the most popular people) So, 50 years down the line from Let's death there are ~100 new Atreides, more than 50 of whom are of breeding age.  You can bet that the Bene Gesserit would have stepped in to help as soon as they could, but there were still enough of Sionas descendants at large in the old Empire to have made a difference in the Scattering.      Perhaps 200 years after Leto, the Empire really starts to fall apart.  People take these desperate measures and make their own way out into the uncharted reaches, knowing that 'out there' couldn't really be worse than here. I don't think that Siona and Duncan et al were actively pursuing a Scattering policy; I think there was enough disruption to interplanetary trade and politics to make fleeing into the wastes an attractive alternative, especially considering Leto's stated aim of inculcating a wanderlust into humanity.  I think that Siona's mission was to ensure that there were enough Atreides genes in the common pool of humanity by that time to make the 'invisible to prescience' characteristic a common one.  I think that she used the organisation available to her to ensure her success in this mission; it did, indirectly, contribute to the Scattering, but I don't think she was at the dock, making sure each ship was sent on its merry way :-)"
dune,27jb90,StashTheBashar,3,Sat Jun 7 10:31:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I like your personal take!  Very well thought out! Haha, serially pregnant.  I like to imagine that Siona and Duncan did more than just sit back and breed, especially because Leto seemed to impart on them responsibility of leading the fish speakers as he was dying. It makes sense that their primary task would be to get more ""invisible"" babies out there though.    On to book 5 and 6 re-reads!"
dune,27jb90,StashTheBashar,3,Sat Jun 7 10:53:09 2014 UTC,"Oh, I certainly agree that there was SOME role played by Siona in marshalling a response/mitigating the fall-out of Leto's death, since she did have the Fish Speakers and I would imagine that Duncan's morals and position would have driven him to try to help.  I just think that, in a similar situation, I would have done what I could to have kept the Empire functioning whilst allowing people to flee, should they wish to, rather than actively pursuing the Scattering policy, you know what I mean?      One other point that intrigues me is the implication that there were several separate Scatterings within the 1500 years between the death of Leto and the start of Heretics.  Maybe there was one directly after Leto as a reaction to his death, one more as the conditions really worsened, and one or two after that.  Or perhaps it wasn't a case of discrete episodes, more of a sort of 'background leak' with periodically more active phases.  I can't quite make my mind up on this one - what do you think?"
dune,27jb90,StashTheBashar,3,Sat Jun 7 11:20:24 2014 UTC,"Even though it seems most likely to me that Siona bred the rest of her life (ironic right!), she seemed to have an adventurous spirit and a desire to be free of the old empire, so I would like to imagine that she outlived Duncan and lived some kind of significant life in a position of power among the fish speakers, helping those on outer world planets escape the horrors, scarcity, and death that their worlds would inevitably experience.  Hey, because it's late where I am maybe I'll don a quick tinfoil hat.  One of the key philosophies I took out of Herbert's writing was the cyclical nature of the universe.  What if Sheeana and Duncan escaping in the final novel was a direct nod to the original Siona and Duncan?  What if Siona and Duncan bred for a while then somehow caught a sandtrout and became part of the scattering, spreading their babies as they went, carrying a bit of the worm's pearl? Eh?  Anyway, Leto said ""let them flee,"" to Duncan which suggests that people would have started to leave on their own within Duncan's lifetime, which shouldn't have been much longer, maybe 50 more years as an ""older model""?  Duncan's death may have also precipitated a quick decline of the fish speakers without a capable patriarch.   I'm more keen on the idea of several grand scattering events occurring as the empire continued to disintegrate as they would leave greater marks on history.  It also would have made it easier for the more powerful groups like BG and Tleilaxu to send out significant colonies in secret amid the chaos.  Although the scattering is referred to as a period, so there was probably, as you said, a background leak of people constantly disappearing into no-ships.  Kind of scary to think about. Maybe there was a relatively constant flow of people scattering that ebbed when artificial spice was created.  The beautiful thing about the scattering is that it probably continued to occur throughout the time period of the 5th and 6th novels.  If someone really messed up their life it wouldn't be very hard to board a no-ship and blast off into the universe undetected.  If I think about it, maybe the people living within the time frame of the 5th and 6th books didn't know they were out of the scattering era, because the end of the 6th book sees a large amount of the population dying, fleeing the Honored Matres, and then fleeing the demise of the Honored Matres.  Kind of a final scattering of the old empire eh?"
dune,27jb90,StashTheBashar,3,Sat Jun 7 12:03:14 2014 UTC,"You've got some good points there, especially the Fish Speakers needing a  powerful male figure to lead them (that is ironic, as well!) Maybe Duncan and Siona did catch the last stage out of Dodge :-) That certainly would fit in with the idea of not being bound to a single point in space, countless Dunes throughout the Universe.      I do tend to look on the Scatterings as periodic events; like you said, it'd be easier for the major groups to hide in the numbers.  Mess up your life and make a new home? Good idea :-)  I also had not thought about the cyclic parallel between the two pairs of S and D, that is a very good point, thank you :-)"

Also, there will probably be some corrupted Leto II ghola that goes crazy and dies.  I am not prescient, but I am confident I am 100% accurate in that guess."
dune,27jb90,Trevoke,2,Sat Jun 7 22:56:20 2014 UTC,"Siona doesn't hate Leto. She hates what she thinks he stands for, what she thinks he represents. Through the conversation, she learns and changes her mind.  Duncan, well, he basically looks at a woman and she's pregnant. So that's not a hard guess.  We don't know anything, really, about the Scattering. If you hold a very tight grip on an entire universe, with the goal of being that tight grip, then when you release, you'll probably get an appropriate counter-effect.  That can't be all, though. Something must have happened to get... Well, to get some remote Bene Gesserit to eventually create the Honored Matres. I don't think I have any proof of this, but it makes sense, given how similar both groups are.  I'd guess the scattering probably happened a generation or two after Leto II's death (one generation at that point is about 200 years, right?)."
dune,27jb90,Candy_Apple_Grey,3,Sat Jun 7 08:49:51 2014 UTC,"There is an explanation of sorts in Chapterhouse, although it is very fuzzy...Bene Gesserit sent out in the original scattering come across people who have discovered an inferior substitute for the spice which allows them to avoid melange withdrawal; the Bene Gesserit take up with them, bringing their combat skills with them; the spice substitute turns the BG/Mystery People hybrid psychotic, the BG lose their ability to access Other Memory which causes them to lose their mental balance and knowledge of the consequences of too much interference; they become grasping, unstable and ambitious and the Honoured Matres are born."

dune,27ecq7,angryfarmer922,7,Thu Jun 5 17:34:35 2014 UTC,"Part of it seems to be that the Fish Speakers had something worked into their psych to Scatter and expand once Leto II died.  I assume he set up that psychological trigger over the years.  They of course are one of the sources of another group of women to return to the Imperium later.  Secondly there are references that once Leto II dies, things in the Imperium itself go to shit.  The Bene Gesserit reemerge and try for control, the Fish Speakers who don't scatter try to manage (but fail) the Empire.  The result is increasing violence and instability and people flee the Imperium much as many Europeans fled the continental wars and moved to America.    I also assume that the BG's, and other schools, at some point tried to avoid Leto II and his Fish Speaker inspectors by having hidden colonies.  Odds are Leto II knew they were there but he opted not to stop it because he wanted a Scattering. Throughout his entire reign some members of humanity likely rejected his enforced stagnation and Leto II let them sneak out to help sow the seeds."
dune,27ecq7,Cai_E,4,Fri Jun 6 04:39:51 2014 UTC,"I know I'm being that guy here, but Herbert explicitly wrote about Leto shutting down attempted colonies in GEoD.  It was an Ixian colony on some moon if I'm not mistaken?  I might be.  Regardless,  Leto most likely wouldn't knowingly have let anyone escape, it would have undermined his whole plan."
dune,27ecq7,impforpresident,6,Sat Jun 7 07:06:05 2014 UTC,"The wiki, but essentially Leto had controlled travel via monopoly of the spice in order to repress human development, and then with his passing the explosion of that tension led to colonization & growth far beyond the reaches of the prior Imperium, so that the species would never again be under a single rule ala the spacing guild's empire.  You have to remember Frank Herbert was a life long republican and his conservative views were not political points but philosophical ideals. His notions of self-reliance and freedom as tantamount human states meant the idea of a governing body that supplanted those qualities as being despotic, totalitarian and in most cases destructive and implosive.   I don't know if Leto was a direct continuation of Paul's own tragic fate (the millions slaughtered by the jihad), but he certainly warped humanity in order to save it as he saw it; then again, his own foresight was compromised by other players who wished to do the same. So removing central controls in a selfless manner was probably the only altruistic thing possible in such a universe."
dune,27ecq7,Psyladine,3,Thu Jun 5 18:22:23 2014 UTC,Also take into account that Leto II's hellish vision as of machines hunting humans.  The Siona genes shileds humans from prescience and pressumably intelligent machines would develop a form of prescience.

During the invasion several groups got away with the technology.  They were probably eager to get as far as away as possible before a new power center could be formed, doubtless a motivation for many."

dune,27ecq7,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,2,Fri Jun 6 11:16:22 2014 UTC,"I've been listening to the audio book, but its been a little bit since I read God Emperor. But as I remember it, Leto had pretty much stifled almost all space travel. Once he died, there was suddenly no restriction, and people could once again move around.   Another thing to consider is that most settlements in the empire at that time were little more than villages. (I believe that was mentioned when Siona and Duncan were flown to the village where he saw one of his predecessor's children)  There was a serious case of ""the grass is always greener"" syndrome everywhere in the imperium. Leto intentionally created these conditions so that they would spur humanity outward upon his death."
dune,27ecq7,impforpresident,2,Sat Jun 7 04:59:53 2014 UTC,"I was under the impression that most of the people who scattered were actually refugees, or, in essence, FORCED to go.  Characters from the latter novels talk about massive  lack of resources following Leto's death.  This would have caused plenty of civilian death on its own, but I imagine that there wars were fought over the remaining commodities, as well as for power, causing even more strife for folks.  Most people were probably given a choice to scatter with colonies and hope to find new homes and resources, or to die in the old empire.    This idea hinges on my recollection that artificial spice was not developed until a good amount of time after Leto's death. I remember Odrade talking about how the BG sent out little fleets of women with limited supplies of spice, and this wouldn't have happened if the artificial spice industry was up ad running yeah? Someone please correct me if I am wrong about that."
dune,27ecq7,soylentblueissmurfs,2,Sat Jun 7 07:43:48 2014 UTC,"One reason why the empire collapsed so quickly was as one character realized that the bureaucratic organization of the empire was like a wheel where the spokes never touch, with a few capable people taking orders directly from Leto but never collaborating.

dune,27cepj,raskolnik,26,Thu Jun 5 01:28:19 2014 UTC,"There is something to be said about the overall trends of sci-fi/fantasy market. Frank wrote for an audience of thinking adults (such that when teenage-me discovered half of the dune saga in a corner of my school's library, I knew I was 2 steps away from pulling down a curtain hiding some far deeper than my teenage brain could make sense of). It wasn't about how Han Solo shot first with a lasgun, it was about how the technology changed the rules of engagement and warfare tactics, about how the holtzman effect can turn a shield protected mansion into a potential nuclear suicide bomber, and how the landsraad will react to a nuclear attack against one of their own, friend or foe.  Brian and friend wrote to a teenage audience (Or at least what their publishers would consider the teenage audience). They wrote adventure stories, stories of Leto and his best half robot friend, of Vorian and his full robotic friend, of generic villians and occasional sex and violence, just to keep it 'edgy'.   50 years ago Brian would be laughed at, 50 years now Asimov would be turned down for not writing about vampires and teenagers killing each other in a survival game."

The post-Frank books feel like they're a steak already cut up for you into bite-sized pieces. The whole thing is fed to you. You are reading House Harkonnen and the swordmaster trainees from Grumman get kicked out and you know right then that they're coming back. If that isn't enough, the Grumman guys are repeatedly doing everything wrong and reinforcing that the rules don't apply to them. This is no mystery. It is all spoonfed in the most obvious ways possible.   It reminded me of reading Harry Potter and other books written for young people. And that's all fine, but when you compare it to Frank's work it just doesn't hold a candle.  You basically have to read all of Frank's books more than once to grasp them. Everything is secretive and you begin to understand as the story blooms over time. I remember putting down God Emperor a few times and just thinking about it on my first read. THAT is literature.  Sadly, it is hard to get a great piece of work like this published.  Frank really is one of the masters of Sci-Fi, just like Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, etc... His son just isn't even close.

Honestly I think he only did one thing wrong, he set it in the Dune universe. The story of the Legends of Dune trilogy would have actually been pretty cool in its own right. Brains in jars, AI domination, humanity reduced to the level of beasts, sadistic robots. Then humanity rises from its own ashes with the help of a technologically created demi-god. Even the sub-plots could have fit on their own. Finding a new way to travel vast distances, the restoring of a friend to a position of honour, a new sub-species of human with amazing mental powers, humans taught how to think like computers.

His father certainly didnt spend his life clinging to his daddy's tit, why should brian get a pass for doing so?   Maybe go out there and do something meaningful that isn't vacuuming up the money falling out of Frank Herbert's coffin?"

dune,27cepj,lolspeaker,2,Thu Jun 5 09:24:52 2014 UTC,"As someone who enjoyed them... you're correct. I as a Dune fan do not like that I enjoyed the Extended Duniverse material. It's just another Sci-fi story, but it's set in my favorite sci-fi universe ever.        I recognize that the Butlerian Jihad was meant to be a social, possibly non-violent, revolution but I still got caught up in all the pew-pew war that was going on. I recognize that Leto was never supposed to have left Caladaan before Dune but his adventures on Richese(?) with another young prince were fun and exciting.  I realize that the greata enemy was probably going to be something representing of humanities inner demons in a pair of Face-Dancer leaders.Also that the Kwisatz Haderach might have never existed because they would be the perfect human being which does not exist, we need others the acheive true greatness. That being said seeing Duncan and a crew of all the series best characters go on an epic journey was so much fun.        Forgive me if the details are off as it turns out I only read those books once compared to the three or four times I've read the Dune series."

dune,27cepj,JustADirtyLurker,18,Thu Jun 5 03:38:48 2014 UTC,"Because they are insulting both the intelligence of the fans, and the fans directly (anyone who disagrees is a hater, a talifan and banned from asking questions).  Because off- and online discussions are getting tangled and confused over contradictory facts.  Because they are muddling Franks reputation - anyone caught overhearing a random sentence about the prequels/sequels/what-ever-they'll-els will assume Dune to be the worst kind of drivel, and not necessarily know there is another kind of Dune out there.  Because some people who would otherwise be fans of Dune, and quote possibly have their thinking broadened by it (thanks, Frank), are now desperately trying to fit in space-gods, ultra-worms, mega-kwisatz-haderachs and psychic powers into Frank universe.  You yourself claim that KJA and BH have ""extendend a world"", when they have in fact directly contradicted it time and again. That is not extending.

dune,27cepj,GeorgeOlduvai,1 point,Thu Jun 5 17:37:15 2014 UTC,"For what it's worth, some of the criticism showed up before the first book of the prequels was even published.  So, clearly there is an irrational faction who just wants to hate for the sake of hating (I believe we normally refer to it as 4chan :-D), and I can understand the reaction of ""well, we got all this criticism from people who hadn't even read the books..."" and it devolves into just ignoring any criticism as a result of mistakenly assuming that the group that does this sort of thing is larger than it actually is.  The only problem is, usually the most vocal complainers are a minority of the people who have complaints..."
dune,27cepj,metaphlex,1 point,Sat Jun 7 04:05:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, and that sort of criticism is clearly unreasonable.  And while I understand how that can lead to dismissal of all criticism, that doesn't really make it okay to do so, and certainly not to just ad hominem your way out of things."

dune,27cepj,lundse,4,Thu Jun 5 08:02:57 2014 UTC,"Same for me. I gave the chance to the Dynamic Duo by buying the first prequel. I hated it, exactly for the reasons OP said (why do you need to show me the Harkonnens building the no-room on Giedi Prime? why do you need to show me how the Baron got fat?... stuff like that). I probably also entered the ""talifan"" mafia for a while.  Now I just don't care. The possible reason is that non-FH books are quite judged irrelevant by most critics, to the point that they are considered non-canon fanfiction. Common sense and intelligence have already won.  To literature professionals like BH & KJA, in my opinion, there could be no less disturbing judgement on their work that to be considered simple fanfiction. And looking to the fact that they keep going on with the expanded universe anyway, I have more and more reasons to believe they do this only for the money. Sad as that."

dune,27a7zt,rocinantevi,15,Wed Jun 4 15:40:09 2014 UTC,On a related note: why does everyone who does a prequel feel the need to cram in every fucking character from the main series whether they fit or not?

No, what angered me was that Brian Herbert didn't care about his father's entire fucking point of Dune:   ""I had this theory that superheroes were disastrous for humans, that even if you postulated an infallible hero, the things this hero set in motion fell eventually into the hands of fallible mortals. What better way to destroy a civilization, society or a race than to set people into the wild oscillations which follow their turning over their critical judgment and decision-making faculties to a superhero?"" -- Frank Herbert   And how did Brian choose to end the series?  With an infallible superhero.  To hell with him."
dune,27a7zt,annarchy8,16,Wed Jun 4 17:09:02 2014 UTC,"Never in the history of writers has anyone missed the fucking point so hard on so many levels. The tone, the gravitas, the morals, the message.   Frank could write an essay on the subtle cues, motivations and behaviours on multiple overlapping players from just one character walking into a room.   Brian be all like ""and then Duncan went away for ten year and became the best sword master ever and when he came back he was all like cool and was a badass"""
dune,27a7zt,saqwarrior,2,Wed Jun 4 20:36:59 2014 UTC,"Well, to be fair, the robot did give him the off button for the entire fleet.  That's not a superhero -- he didn't even do anything.

dune,27a7zt,Psyladine,6,Wed Jun 4 20:04:53 2014 UTC,"Well that pisses me off even more. What possible flaws did Leto II have that Duncan didn't have? Leto II was basically a Jesus figure; with endless compassion, he knowingly accepted thousands of years worth of suffering, to prevent a disaster that only he could see, on behalf of a humanity that would revile him for the effort he made on their behalf.  You know what? Don't answer that... I don't even want to know. I've spent more time these past two weeks, talking about BH and KJA, than the last two years combined. I'm worn out.

dune,27a7zt,mrkeked,4,Wed Jun 4 22:53:28 2014 UTC,"It's not about his relationship or lack thereof with his father. It's the shitty quality of his fanfic novels that are, let's face it, not just letting him make ends meet. I would be as upset if it were any other author, honestly. And, wait. Brian had to have a co-author for all of his books, didn't he? He couldn't have an original idea, couldn't get the gist of the idea he shamelessly stole from a dead man, and he had help writing all the schlock he's churned out. Yay Brian Herbert. Ugh."
dune,27a7zt,lundse,0,Thu Jun 5 00:16:40 2014 UTC,But I agree with almost everything you said. I just feel that you can say all of that without including that his father is dead and he's tap-dancing over his grave. It's just bad taste and over the top.
dune,27a7zt,desertsail912,3,Thu Jun 5 07:04:17 2014 UTC,"Wel,, he is riding his fathers legacy for all it is worth, milking the family name and not doing a single thing to mitigate the damage to his fathers work and legacy.  If he were genuinely trying to make good books. If he had released any notes he might have and said ""draw your own conclusions, incidentally here's mine at sale in the foyer"" he would not be as reviled as he is now.  See Christopher Tolkien for someone who is making money of the family legacy, while respecting it."

Aside from that, I'm sure that Frank Herbert would be thrilled that Brian could make ends meet on the back of his success. And yes, even if that meant desecrating every last drop of his work.   Frankly I think you're wrong, but even more importantly I don't really care what your imaginary Frank Herbert might think about it. Brian Herbert butchered the entire premise of the Dune universe, and if his father were to be so blinded by his relationship with his son that he overlooked it, well then he would be wrong as well."
dune,27a7zt,devious_204,1 point,Wed Jun 4 23:13:00 2014 UTC,"Of course you can voice your opinion, I didn't say you couldn't. I was just disagreeing with it. And yes, this might be an imaginary Frank Herbert where the real one might have been unhappy with his son's choices. Nevertheless, my point remains: It is REALLY bad taste to say something like ""You are an insult to your father's memory"". It is also extremely unfair because we don't know these people and I think that's the one point where BH and KJA are absolutely right in complaining about (hence me mentioning yesterday's article).   Yes, his novels are bad. Outside of the odd person that buys one by mistake, the market takes care of itself. I suppose that there are a few people who like them, so why should I be mad at their happiness? For others like you and me, we've tried them out and we didn't like them, so we left them alone. There are thousands of books that I leave alone without becoming upset about it. To be all worked up and make it about his dead father just sounds like Westboro Baptist Church picketing to me.  Regarding my last point, so Brian butchered the entire premise of a masterpiece. What of it? I know we all wished he left it alone, but wasn't it his intellectual property to piss away? Speaking as a father, if I could secure my children's future with something I made, the only thing I would care about would be how it would benefit my children. My fans would come a very distant second. Would your father be more concerned about my sentiments regarding a piece of fiction over you and your well being? So, my imaginary Frank Herbert, like any decent father that I know of, wouldn't care. He probably wouldn't be happy that Brian didn't inherit his quality as a writer, he would be painfully critical about it, but he would be the first to drag himself into the mud if that would help his son get a little ahead in life. To hell with us fans."

I know we all wished he left it alone, but wasn't it his intellectual property to piss away?   Intellectual property is an oxymoron, and even if it were not abhorrent in itself, it would grant only legal license. He does not get of the hook for what he did, just because he is leally allowed to do it.   So, my imaginary Frank Herbert, like any decent father that I know of, wouldn't care.   So a decent father should not give one whiff about his own legacy, the lessons he believed needed telling and teaching to everyone, when some progeny could stand to gain a buck? It is not like Brian was starving in the gutter and is just now getting by, is it? I don't buy that a good parent must damn him or herself, and their fans or other ""allies"" for their sons and daughters to be able to buy their third swimming pool."

'' This is not just a clever-sounding koan for achieving enlightenment and impressing your friends; it is a rigorous, demanding principle that neither Herbert himself nor his successors could fully adhere to.   Amen to that one...  His comparison of Dune to ""Deadwood"" does bring up an interesting point though: instead of a film, perhaps Dune would work best as a serialized drama on premium cable, like Game of Thrones. It's already got six books and we know how it was intended to end. If someone could keep Brian Herbert and his cracked out ideas out of it, it could be a bigger phenomenon than GoT."

The large time jumps are not really an issue, especially in the day and age where we have hit tv shows that recast every season, like American Horror Story or True Detective.

dune,279vl0,duriel,1 point,Wed Jun 4 08:53:33 2014 UTC,"Dune was a part of the scifi convention fandom of its own time.  It is hardly surprising to not see a large fandom with regular group meetings all across the world for Dune; fandoms require continuous renewal to maintain public interest.    I personally do not long for any big Dune renewal, myself.  I reread the original six novels every few years, and pass them along to friends and acquaintances.  That's quite enough."
dune,279puh,DTNightmarecinema,5,Wed Jun 4 05:31:51 2014 UTC,"I frankly suggest you read the next books in the series and finish all six books, anything I may say about why GEoD is because of events later on. People like GEoD because the implications of Leto's actions, as well as certain paths he may have designed, become apparent in what happens later on."
dune,279puh,fortean,3,Wed Jun 4 09:59:36 2014 UTC,"Herbert claimed he never partook of peyote after one bad early trip (which led to his visualization of time as 'waves' by which you could see farther by elevation and rhythm), but he must have been smoking something to come up with that one."
dune,279puh,Psyladine,4,Wed Jun 4 15:51:25 2014 UTC,"I love the combination of the epic time-scale and the presence of Leto II. How he as the ""ultimate predator"" pressured humanity to evolve and realize it's fuller potential. It really pushes the scope of the series and puts everything before and after into a greater perspective. It is not solely about power and factions, but about civilizations and the purpose of humanity."

Instead of ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" it's ""dictatorship of all of mankind's history"". So when Leto died, it was like all of history was laid to rest - an ultimate cathartic event. In terms of readability, there are more random nuggets of wisdom in Leto's musings than most other books by any author  EDITED to say that if you imagine Duncan Idaho as tv GoT Jon Snow, you're gonna have a good time"

These people are so removed.  I can't believe they decided to address fan concerns via the paraphrased filter of a letter.  I don't see anyone accusing Brian of hating his Dad, I would be more inclined to believe that his manner of ascendancy (on daddy's shoulders) has lead him to delusions of authority and grandeur.  He probably views Dune authorship as some sort of Caliphate which he is rightful successor to (or he took the idea of genetic memory a bit too seriously).  Further, I at least had never questioned Paul et al coming back as being part of Herbert's plan, as KJA said, it is in Chapterhouse, and Frank does set up for it definitively.  My problem lies in the way that happened in KJA's permutation, and how it was handled (perfect example, Leto II being able to turn into his worm self and back at will: WTF?! THIS ISN'T X-MEN!).  I don't want to SEE the God fucking disks, I want to see the legally verified content of those disks!  I don't doubt they exist, Herbert was a copious note taker, I doubt KJA and Brian followed what was on there as closely as they should have.  These people are so stupid I could vomit."

I notice Paul of Dune and Winds of Dune enjoyed poor reviews and the series is now on hold in favor of a different series, which is also getting mixed reviews."

However, I am constantly upset when BH/KJA say things like,  ""We are extremely proud of every one of our DUNE novels and have not let a single one be published that we didn't feel was the absolute best we could do."" When I read things like that from them I kind of feel insulted on a personal level because there are blatant discrepancies between the First Six and the prequels."
dune,277tqa,IVHoltzmann,5,Tue Jun 3 23:50:34 2014 UTC,"KJA does not understand criticism. He wants to exist in a vacuum where everyone drools over his writing. Kevin is not a strong writer. His contributions are uninspired attempts at serious science fiction. At its core, his Dune novels are boilerplate, pulp science fiction of the lowest common denominator."
dune,277tqa,lolzerker,3,Wed Jun 4 00:41:16 2014 UTC,"Dune was Frank Herbert's property, his legacy, it's like he built a house. It's completely natural for him to want his son to benefit from it. To do something with it. To add to it, expand it!  So I question his son's motivations not at all. When my grandparents died, their notes to my parents were filled with comments about how much all the stuff they had accumulated was worth. And how much value could be got from selling it. My mom did the same thing when she died. They love the idea of the things that they built, bought, invested in paying off for their children.  The problem lies not in Brian Herbert's motivations, which I do not question, they seem entirely normal, but rather the way he went about it. Kevin J Anderson just isn't the kind of writer you want to take over for Frank Herbert. He seems like the kind of guy you pick because you wanted done quickly and in a workmanlike fashion. You want someone reliable.  But Dune is a masterpiece. It is not something created by a journeyman, it's something created by a grandmaster. If you're looking for someone to continue in that vein, you need to do a little more work! You can't just scour the bestseller list and pick the guy who seems to be the most consistent."
dune,277tqa,mattcolville,4,Wed Jun 4 05:35:43 2014 UTC,"Is it too much to ask to see the outline itself, not photos of the disks it's on? Until that content appears I'm never gonna feel closure with the Dune Universe.  I've read (and to some degree enjoyed) some of the prequels, and their version of Dune 7, but there's no mistaking that they weren't written by Frank. Even a vague fucking idea as to his intentions for 7 would be amazing; so much of my enjoyment of the original 6 is from the vague outlines of ideas that he evokes and often never fully explains.  Honestly, I would love to read fan-fiction based on those notes, even while accepting that it's not real canon for the series.  I mean, what reason can they have for not releasing those notes? The only one I can think of is that no-one ELSE can 'mess' with the IP if they don't. Well guess fucking what, you messed with the IP yourselves already, the only reason I can see for you to keep the notes secret is so that you can treat yourselves like holy fucking secret-keepers. ""We're the only ones WORTHY enough to know the mind of Frank. Everyone else can fuck off""."
dune,277tqa,Joomes,3,Tue Jun 3 22:28:21 2014 UTC,"I would give much to see even limited scans of Frank's notes. Putting up two photographs of floppy disks is kind of, well, asinine when Brian practically fumbled over his words describing his excitement in Road to Dune of finding the crates of his father's so-called notes.  THe gold standard for this is Christopher Tolkien, who went as far as publishing annotated notes his father left in crafting the world's greatest fantasy universe. Brian is a shadow of an author and a son to that legacy."

If you then read any of the books by Brian or Kevin you can instantly tell that they are not the same voice, not from the same mind.   Once one realizes that... yeah, I still can't imagine why people read them. In another harsh response, in another thread, I said that people who like the 'other' books are not in the same fan club as I am in. I stand by that.

The explanation went that Beverly had died, and Frank was in a bad way emotionally after her death.  So here he is, he's written another Dune book, his characters are getting more and more powerful, everything's building... but for what?  The story could go anywhere, but he didn't know where, and honestly, he just didn't care as much anymore.  So he writes himself and his wife in as characters, pawing at Duncan through the net, trying to lead them to some unknown conclusion.  Duncan sees it, outwits them, and escapes to a universe where Frank can't see where he's going.  The characters declare independence of their creator, off to adventures that Frank won't write anymore.  So Frank is left with the memory of his wife, snipping roses in the garden, and not worrying about what's going to happen to the gholas.  Again, this was before any discussion of discovered notes or prequels.  Even at the time, it was a pretty unpopular opinion, but it's the one I've always preferred."

Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune cover the last segment of the story.  Whether or not you choose to think of the two as Face Dancers or SoD Spoiler is up to you.

The problem with Brian and Andersons books isn't that they suck as stand alone books.  They actually don't suck as stand alone books. It is that they suck as books that are put next to Frank Herberts works.  The idea that there books and Franks books should be read as an uninterrupted series is flawed.  This is the reason everyone hates them so much.  But if you take them as there own thing to stand on there own, they are pretty average in quality.  I found that they are being categorized as 'young adult (YA)' books.  I am fine with that.  I think that is the perfect category for those books."

There is absolutely nothing in their fan-fiction universe that was Frank's."

It's not at all the same level of quality that the original is but it's still a book with a plot and it has the benefit of using the excellent characters that Frank created so it's not bad. I wouldn't call it amazing but it's worth a read or two.

I particularly dislike the explanatory paragraphs that pop up so frequently in the non-Frank books. Frank didn't hold your hand, which is part of the reason he is such a fantastic author. I miss that as I'm presently finishing the last of the non-Frank books. Far too much unnecessary explanation.   In an effort to make the books more accessible, they just ended up writing shittier books."

dune,277b28,desertsail912,2,Tue Jun 3 19:22:56 2014 UTC,"I don't know if he was working on any books strictly speaking, but he had a lot of notes (apparently that's where a lot of the subject material for the new books came from), and part of that was a continuation for the main story after book 6."
dune,277b28,arnoldo_fayne,2,Tue Jun 3 20:16:05 2014 UTC,"I know about the notes. There's another post in here linking to rebuttals or objections from KJA and BH regarding the opinions of purists like me. It's as lame as their books but whatever... it includes a picture of a floppy disk.  I dunno... perhaps needless to say, that isn't enough for me. I just don't buy the notes thing. The right thing to do, if there were notes, would be to publish them or donate them to a library or just sit on them. I still don't think they should have tried to add to the existing legacy and there's nothing that either of them could say that would convince me otherwise.  What I was asking was whether or not Frank ever said that there was another book coming. Did Frank Herbert think that the story was unfinished after 6? Again, I find that hard to believe since it seemed that 6 concluded not just itself but the entire series. It was a perfectly suitable ending. I have trouble believing that he wrote the ending to 6 with the intention of writing a 7."

It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.   . . .   All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you’ve always known.    . . .   Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, ""I am not the kind of person I want to be."" It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied.    . . .   The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: ""I feed on your energy.""   . . .   There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.   . . .   Experts and specialists lead you quickly into chaos. They are a source of useless nit-picking, the ferocious quibble over a comma. The mentat-generalist, on the other hand, should bring to decision-making a healthy common sense. He must not cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happening in his universe. He must remain capable of saying: ""There's no real mystery about this at the moment. This is what we want now. It may prove wrong later, but we'll correct that when we come to it."" The mentat-generalist must understand that anything which we can identify as our universe is merely a part of larger phenomena. But the expert looks backward; he looks into the narrow standards of his own specialty. The generalist looks outward; he looks for living principles, knowing full well that such principles change, that they develop. It is to the characteristics of change itself that the mentat-generalist must look. There can be no permanent catalogue of such change, no handbook or manual.

Young man, do you think we are born with ideas?""  Blizzard totally stole the real time strategy model, a unique and entirely original form of play in a virtual environment, from Westwood.

Breaking the fourth wall for a moment, remember also that, despite being a seminal work of sci-fi, Herbert was using it as a vehicle to explore the human condition; the greatest part of the tech that exists is there to augment human capability, but would not function without humans.  The only example I can think of that does function without human agency is the no- technology... I, for one, cannot think of a way that this could work without some sort of computerized feedback to achieve its mimesis.      Also, consider that FH wrote this when the potential of computers had not been fully realised, there was no public internet, the smallest functional computer was the size of a dining table and there could be no conception of sites such as Reddit or Wikipedia.

There is a history, for thousands of years, where there were entire planets enslaved by Omnius, the one thinking machine that made copies of itself and implanted itself, which I believe was once a man's mind, all over the universe.  In short, the technological singularity happened, and it was VERY, VERY, VERY bad.  It almost ended humanity.  The internet, and communication via anything other than basic (radio, data) means is prohibited, strictly because of the vulnerability to thinking machines.  The Imperium of Man almost died from the internet, thinking machines, and the old Titans (the first twenty men who encased their minds in machines).   That's why Dune was a 'post-technological' world. Everything that had to do with machines had already been dreamed up and forgotten.  Baron Harkonnen used artillery to seal men in the caves during attack.  His generals didn't even know the term 'artillery.'  He had to go to the archives and have ballistics special made to do it, and most people in the society of lasguns and shields had no idea what these maula (gunpowder) pistols were, as they had no aiming assist and required ammunition, worked with springs and mechanics, and were completely useless against shields.  In short, they were pointing deadly sticks and fighting against lasers that could cut rock.  Everything we could have dreamed up, we did in Dune.  Then it almost killed us.  Then we forgot it and outlawed the rest.  Only the best tech was kept.  Shields, lasers, repulsors, folding space.  The rest is basically useless.   And robots almost killed them all.  So NO ROBOTS."

Frank was a deep thinker who needed extreme examples to explain the simplest parts of life, the ability to survive as a species, as a very complicated process that isn't as surefire as everyone expects.  Think of the general 'hardness' of Dune.  Most other Sci-Fi writers at the time were doing 'trouble in paradise' stories, and Frank dropped you in HELL.  The whole universe was muddled hell.  Nothing is simple, nothing is given.  Even those with great powers just suffered more because of it.  He's a wild departure from what other Sci-Fi was.  With the exception of Joe Haldeman's 'The Forever War' which was an illusion to coming back from the infantry in Vietnam and not seeing the same place you left, Dune is unique in how it beats up the reader and carries the pain of generations on it's back."

Regardless, I always pictured Arrakeen as a much poorer place than I feel like the city in the picture is. But I think it totally works as the same city after 1500 years of build up and prosperity. Although it shows desert, so I guess it'd have to be after GEoD.  As for the actual art work, I think you did an excellent job with it. I like the size of the person in the desert.

They were more likely to have their hand in the water business or CHOAM than they were to be involved with spice in any way.

dune,26l4o0,mattjohnson0715,7,Tue May 27 06:35:52 2014 UTC,"I honestly can't remember what the appendix is. I think there are some ecological notes in the back. I know that the first novel includes a sort of glossary, which you should definitely keep bookmarked. Dune isn't especially heavy on the jargon, but what it has can be pretty impenetrable.  There are a fair number of names to remember. Paul, his mother Jessica, his father Leto. Their mentat Thufir. Their doctor Yueh. Leto's men at arms Duncan and Gurney. And that's just the Atreides house.  But here's the thing: It's worth it. It's a really good story. The book asks a bit of you. It asks you to take it seriously, to really buckle down and be an active reader. To keep all the characters straight and to accept some unfamiliar vocabulary and to read between the lines sometimes. But if you're willing to do as the book asks, it rewards you with a very, very entertaining tale. And then there are the other books in the series, and boy, is that a whole other conversation entirely.  Anyway, be patient, and stick with it. It's worth it."
dune,26l4o0,dauntlessmath,4,Tue May 27 06:43:34 2014 UTC,"A lot of stuff is introduced and never explicitly defined (e.g. a word used by characters who already know what it means). You can often figure out what they're talking about from context, but you have to be patient and remember. If you're the type of person that gets frustrated with that, then go to the appendix every time you see a word you don't know."
dune,26l4o0,Mentatjuice,4,Tue May 27 06:41:28 2014 UTC,"I've read Dune maybe 10 times. Each time I find some new depth or facet to the characters and places that I hadn't previously noticed.

dune,26l4o0,StashTheBashar,4,Tue May 27 09:32:57 2014 UTC,"The very first time I read Dune many many moons ago (and I have literally, and I do mean literally, worn out four paperback copies of it) I read it without looking at the appendices first.  I did this for no other reason than to get the feel of the book from the personal viewpoint - by this I mean how an invisible observer to the events would actually feel, being there in person.      I don't think I am giving too much away by saying that most of the jargon is explained there and then, or can be derived by a little thought.  For example (SPOILER) when RM Mohiam goes to test Paul, she pulls out the needle on a thimble and asks him if he recognises this, she says ""this is the Gom Jabbar, the high-handed enemy"".  Most of the terminology is explained in a similar way, either immediately or fairly soon afterwards.  Others you do have to derive from context, but they are still accessible.  Use the appendices if you need to before you have finished the story (as Herbert says ""to increase understanding is a laudable goal"") but as the others in this thread say, you don't REALLY need to if you just take your time, read and absorb what is going on and keep the characters straight in your head.

dune,26l39u,yellowstoneTRUTH2k14,7,Tue May 27 06:13:12 2014 UTC,"The machines were the navigators in pre-Jihad. Remember that Frank's great conceit was humans rejected thinking machines (computers and all the technology enabled by them), and replaced them with human equivalents bred for millenia to specific purposes.  The spice was probably what enabled the jihad to begin with-the prescient powers enabled by the drug gave them an alternative to machine-driven spaceflight.  By the time of Dune they've concluded the spice is unique to Arrakis and therefore is the lynchpin of the empire, but one that had already been founded by space-faring humans over the past 10,000 years."
dune,26l39u,Psyladine,4,Tue May 27 12:06:50 2014 UTC,"I think the idea was that they played the percentage game; the intended route was surveyed ""normally"" then supra-lightspeed engines were used.  This would not absolutely guarantee safe passage, but a high enough likelihood of success that it was a viable, if slightly risky method of travel, especially for cargo.      I cannot remember anywhere in the original 6 books any real indicator of how the Empire was maintained before the advent of spice, but I do remember reading FH's first 'draft' of Dune in one of his compilation/autobiographies.  This draft put a whole new slant on spice - Arrakis was still the source of it, but it was an exceptionally concentrated food source, not the spice we've come to know and love.  Duke Leto was given command of Dune and he was the first to find out that the worms made the spice.  My point is that, in this version, space travel is so slow (by comparison to the foldspace/huge multiples of lightspeed concept) that it took months to get from the centre of the Empire to the edge.  If you compare that with a historical empire before the advent of steam, internal combustion and flight, you will see that an empire can be maintained with this length of travel time.  The point of the spice in this version of events was to provide the most compact and efficient food source to allow greater room for cargo or passengers aboard the spaceship during its months in transit.  This also implies that FH's original take on spacecraft was that they were not the huge, energy-rich conveniences that they became in the final draft, but rather they were limited devices that were only used out of necessity.  There is a passage in this story that concerns the Emperor complaining to Duke Leto about how long it took him to get to Arrakis and how crappy the accommodation was - not something you would expect the Emperor of the Known Universe to have to endure or even acknowledge!"

That story ironed for me the notion that the Spice was named for the spice trade of the 17th century, and the Guild was modeled on the Dutch East India Company (the secrets of navigation = secrets of navigating the seas). Also the notion of spice being a luxury desired by all but only produced in exotic places, irreproducible in native lands...   Dune was truly an amalgamation of a thousand ideas. Herbert really outdid himself."

Its foundation is Canadian whisky, and the taste otherwise resembles the candy with a similar name, Ferrara Candy Company's ""Atomic Fireball"" candy.  It is bottled at 33% alcohol by volume (66 U.S. proof).  According to the official Fireball website, the product was developed in Canada in the mid-1980s, and for a long time was little known outside of Canada.  Fireball is now widely available in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and can also be found in Israel, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, Australia, Ireland,  and various other countries.

dune,264qj5,ArchivalHashtag,3,Wed May 21 16:40:03 2014 UTC,"1) As Paul and Alia both describe, seeing the future is not seeing all of the future. They see peaks on an undulating horizon. So, at some point Paul saw most of the future but when the Dune Tarot is mentioned that is just Paul and Alia being prevented from seeing other parts of the future that they would like to see.  2) Paul and Alia couldn't see Korba because Korba thought that he was doing their will, or what was best for them. He was loyal to them. As is stated in the first meeting of the conspiracists wherein Irulan attends, that is is only suspected and not entirely known how it works but it is suspected that sympathy or loyalty might be sufficient. Is Irulan loyal to the conspiracy above her loyalty to Paul or to the government he represents? Korba thought he was doing what what was best so...  3) ""Disengage"" was just a warning or reminder to himself to stop looking at a future that he'd already decided he couldn't/shouldn't change. His choices were between Chani dying during childbirth and something much, much worse. He was just trying not to torture himself with a future that he didn't like but couldn't change."
dune,264qj5,TheAtheistPaladin,4,Wed May 21 18:30:50 2014 UTC,"I took it as Paul didn't want to follow the golden path, because he knew how lonely he would be, and how brutal, to lose his humanity. Of course this isn't in Messiah that it says that but Children and GEoD.  He love Chani so much he didn't want to live a long life without her. He felt resigned to how he saw one of the few paths into the future with Chani living the longest."
dune,264qj5,TheAtheistPaladin,2,Wed May 21 22:50:08 2014 UTC,This isn't the case though. When Paul and Leto have their chat out on the sand Paul admits that his vision didn't extend as far as Leto's. He had an inkling of what his son was doing but he couldn't have made the same choice as his son as he didn't have the same vision.
dune,264qj5,TheAtheistPaladin,1 point,Thu May 22 14:26:16 2014 UTC,"I thought that Paul, (after going into the desert), didn't want to use his vision anymore, and let the empire go its own way, otherwise the future would be 'set' to what he saw. (Edit:Which was the issue in the first place)  When the people of Jacurutu took him in they tried to get him to predict stuff for them, he refused, but they still didn't want to kill him cause of his value.  Of course there is another way to see it too. Possibly Paul saw what kind of ruler he'd have to be to prepare humans for the golden path, but didn't see how to extend his life long enough ( ignoring that BG can keep themselves looking young, which is taboo to them, see Alia being accused by Jessica). This is why Paul preferred his Jihad over the alternatives; a brutal tyrant crushing the will of the people suppressing progress and mobility(to a degree).  Tl:Dr I will have to go back and read those two books again. I just read them 5 months ago.  The last time I read those two, I have a greater appreciation for them."
dune,264qj5,TheAtheistPaladin,2,Thu May 22 23:21:41 2014 UTC,"I believe that Paul saw two paths, one was the end of all mankind and the other was a provisional sort of future that included the Jihad, the death of Chani and we don't know how much else. It certainly didn't include what Leto II ultimately saw and executed. Too, there is the dual (or to borrow a word, quantum) nature of the oracle in that the prescient simultaneously know an unchanging future that is full of possibilities. There are choices to be made, or observed, but the experience of prescience is yet a curse.  Edit - the quote below corrects my first line here. Whatever Paul saw, it was dire. He paid a price for the Jihad."
dune,264qj5,Yeeeuup,2,Thu May 22 23:31:31 2014 UTC,"Did Leto II ever say his father refused to start the Golden Path? It seems that was something from GEoD, am I wrong? If so, wouldn't that mean he (Paul) did see it(The Golden Path)?  I'm unsure if Paul saw Krazliec; though Leto saw it through Paul when Leto was very young."
dune,264qj5,enitnepres,3,Fri May 23 00:51:41 2014 UTC,"From Children of Dune:   ""I cannot lie to you any more than I could lie to myself,"" Paul said. ""I know this. Every man should have such an auditor. I will only ask this one thing: is the Typhoon Struggle necessary?""  "" It's that or humans will be extinguished.""  Paul heard the truth in Leto's words, spoke in a low voice which acknowledged the greater breadth of his son's vision. ""I did not see that among the choices.""   Of course the chapter that leads up that is useful as well. And yet, other lines in other places add ambiguity to it all. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but I don't think Frank was as clear about prescience, in print, as he could have been. He might be the only one who could definitively answer some of the questions we have."

dune,264qj5,nanogyth,8,Wed May 21 21:05:47 2014 UTC,To know the future is to be trapped by it. Leto II liked surprises.
dune,264qj5,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,1 point,Wed May 21 22:03:25 2014 UTC,"He would have seen it the same, yes. And yes, it's stated a few times that he often didn't resort to looking at the immediate future because he wanted to be surprised instead. But at the same time, it was also said that he could look ahead as needed implying that his longer experience with being an oracle might have taught him to be a better oracle. I'm thinking of when he dispatched his Fish Speakers to deal with the attackers in Onn, he used his prescience to decide precisely where to send them. Finally, it is also implied that sometimes visions came unwanted. It is presumable that, over thousands of years, Leto had many more visions than even he might have wanted. He could have known a lot more of the future than is ever explicitly stated."
dune,264qj5,nanogyth,3,Thu May 22 14:29:00 2014 UTC,"Probably going to get buried, but...   It's not so much that Paul remembered everything.  It's that he locked his vision into the present.  He could see a little bit ahead, but not far.   Paul saw the golden path, he simply wasn't strong enough to take the change that Leto did."
dune,264qj5,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,4,Thu May 22 04:55:29 2014 UTC,"It's been a little bit since I read Messiah, but here are my thoughts.   For #1, I dont know if he memorized everything from the stoneburner forward, but I think maybe just the major events. Prescience is certainly described as having limits, seeing the valley but nothing past the mountains. It seems to me that being able to truly act as though he still had eyes, would require that his prescience be able to constantly reveal whats about to happen next as opposed to everything in one shot. Bear in mind, he could still see even in Children when he was the Preacher, and that was, what, 9 or 10 years in the future? Even as a mentat, I would find it hard to believe he memorized a decade's worth of actions.   For #2, I would say that it is more likely that Paul knew, but let it go because he knew that the stoneburner and the events that followed had to happen. He clearly seemed to know the stoneburner was going to be detonated, yet he was still there to be blinded by it. I dont think its too much of an assumption to say he knew how it got to Arrakis.   For #3, I dont know if it would have been possible for him to save Chani without killing the twins, if at all. Also, we know from (spoilers)  Paul and Leto's conversation toward the end of Children  that he knew one of them was going to have to join with the sandtrout and become the tyrant to ensure that humanity survived. Paul was unwilling to do that. Perhaps he knew he had to sacrifice Chani so that their son could save mankind?"
dune,264qj5,nanogyth,2,Wed May 21 19:13:20 2014 UTC,3. Paul wasn't expecting a son at the end of Messiah. He possibly saw his own death as inevitable and was just arranging things for the safety of his daughter and to avoid anyone falling for the temptation of Scytale's ghola choice.
dune,264qj5,KiefKong,1 point,Wed May 21 20:23:16 2014 UTC,"Calm down, buddy. I said it had been a minute since I'd read it. I knew he wasn't expecting one of them; I just thought it was Ghanima.  That being said, Paul still knew someone was going to have to join with the sandtrout to shape humanity into what it needed to become to survive.  Which child he was expecting to do it is irrelevant."
dune,264qj5,cheesemagic,1 point,Wed May 21 20:48:13 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean you were wrong, just that things didn't play out as Paul had envisioned. His choice of future wasn't what we end up seeing.

dune,266732,tyereliusprime,3,Thu May 22 07:40:02 2014 UTC,you mean like all those long plot relevant conversations where subtle facial ticks and differences in tone give more information than the entire conversation itself?  cant imagine how that would be difficult to put on film.  /s  seriously though i thought the sci fi mini series made a pretty decent shake at it once you get past the brown eyed fremen walking around outside without suits.    giger did do an amazing job though.  wouldnt expect any less from that guy.

Obviously, in the books, the weirding way makes sense, but there's pages and pages that set it up into context. Since movies are shorter, throwing in an organization of hyper-kung fu nuns without the proper context would have been laughable.  Sometimes when making movies based on source material, sacrifices have to be made for the sake of story-telling. If you're going to be mad at Lynch for something, be mad about the rain that would kill the Makers. But then again, that was a decision by the producers, not by Lynch himself."

dune,266732,dauntlessmath,-3,Thu May 22 01:37:48 2014 UTC,"That's a good point, man. I can't help, but think Firefly portrayed the culture in a more subtle and tasteful way though. At the very least characters didn't maintain an awful accent while speaking English. In Children of Dune the bad accents carried over even when they weren't using Arabic words. Either way it may not have been the best comparison.   I'm not insanely familiar with Chinese, so maybe you can expand a little more? Are you a native Chinese speaker? Did they portray the culture and language well?"

I barely remember anything about it at all. I remember thinking the actress who played Ghanima was a high point … or, frankly, maybe she was just nice to look at.  I don't speak any Chinese myself. My then-girlfriend had a coworker who was Taiwanese but grew up speaking Mandarin. She described the TV-Chinese in the show as getting all the pronunciations right but basically not including any tone at all, so it was either meaningless gibberish or meant things entirely other than what it was intended to mean depending on the word. I can neither confirm nor deny this, but I trust her opinion."
dune,266732,uatec,1 point,Thu May 22 01:54:57 2014 UTC,"My wife is a native speaker and I've been speaking Mandarin for a few decades.  Not only do the actors suck at speaking a tonal language, there are some really odd word choices.  It's like Joss wrote the dialog in English and plugged it into Google translate.  No native speaker appears to ever have looked at the word choice and commented on it.  The written characters are normally okay, but when Malcolm tries to swear it just ruins the scene because it is so hilariously bad."

I can't tell you how many people in the US when reading the Harry Potter series pronounced Hermione 'hermy-own.' I knew it was pronounced her-my-oh-nee because I've spent a lot of time in Ireland and knew the name.  For years people reading Tolkien pronounced Smaug as 'smog' not as 'smawg' as it's supposed to be pronounced. My point is that once people start pronouncing things one way, it's very difficult to get them to go back to the way it's supposed to sound like.  Is that a big enough reason to ditch watching the whole mini-series? Of the adaptations of the various Dune novels, it's my favorite. Yes, there are a lot of things wrong with it, but still."

dune,25k2oy,fortean,2,Thu May 15 15:19:47 2014 UTC,"I did not intend to come across as trying to convert you - I simply wanted to opine that I felt that you were missing out on some good material.  On that note - Outside of Dune, what else have you read of Frank's? I'm partial to the ConSentiency universe, the WorShip universe, and the Lewis Orne short stories, though I adore most everything of his I own."

It's extremely hard to be objective about this issue, and even though my opinion is unlikely to change, I truly appreciate your patience. And for what it's worth I think the mods are doing a very good job keeping things even in this subreddit even h though I'm sure they're equally pationate about their position."

Other than the Dune books, The Dragon and the Sea (that wasn't all that memorable to me) and a couple of short stories I admit I haven't really read anything more. I actually do own the WorShip books (I just checked my library) but apparently I haven't had the time or inclination to read them in the past, what, 20 years :) Thanks for the tip, I'll put them on my reading list."
dune,25k2oy,fortean,2,Thu May 15 16:38:03 2014 UTC,"I'm sure you will enjoy them. Start with the prequel, Destination: Void, then continue to the Pandora trilogy, starting with The Jesus Incident.  I have not yet read Dragon In The Sea/Under Pressure, though I do have it - I have not read it yet mostly because it's not quite the niche that I enjoy most from Frank. I will give it a try though, when I have the time.  Whipping Star was fantastic - I highly recommend that as well."

dune,25k2oy,Psyladine,3,Thu May 15 18:06:42 2014 UTC,"You are absolutely right, and one of the reasons I'm following this subreddit is because I want to see what others think of BH's universe. I don't usually (if ever) participate in discussions here because I'm very well aware how passionate I am on this subject, so I usually remain quiet.  In retrospect, perhaps I should have remained quiet; I'm unlikely to convince anyone and no one is likely to convince me. It does seem, however, that Dune fans are firmly divided into those who enjoy BH's work, and those who abhore it. There doesn't really seem to be middle ground."

dune,25k2oy,Psyladine,4,Thu May 15 17:30:25 2014 UTC,"We have Dune in common the way we have nostrils in common, or concrete. It's a superficial and completely pointless commonality.  fortean's comments in this thread will do for mine though he was more polite about it, in print, than I am in my head. Like him, though, I generally don't comment or respond to anyone talking about BH. That's a little bit because I have a 'live and let live' philosophy but it's mostly because I've learned it is pointless to try to change someone's mind.  If you like BH's books, if you've spent a single dollar on them, you aren't in the same fan club that I am in. BH is pissing all over his father's legacy with every word he writes and he's doing it for money. It is a travesty that he is allowed to publish those novels, with those names, implying that they are somehow part of the same universe. His books are trash fanfic and he should be ashamed for implying they are somehow canon with his ""super secret daddy's notes."""
dune,25k2oy,Psyladine,3,Thu May 15 17:35:34 2014 UTC,"do you think you can disregard your distaste to BH books to discuss topics in the FH novels with me?   I rarely comment on them. As I said elsewhere, I generally ignore comments on them as I don't like to get riled up.   Why don't you offer a topic for discussion and i will keep my responses to the original canon?    I don't really have a need to discuss the books. It is enough for me that I read them and think about them. I am really only here, and usually limit my responses, to helping newbies get past any confusions they encounter. I'm going to leave my future contributions to that and continue to ignore posts about artwork, documentaries, the wiki, the non-canon books and etc.   PS: how do you stand on the 1984 Dune movie?   I haven't seen it since 1984 and will not see it again. I have as much use for that as I have for the documentary or Brian's books, none at all. I am a fan of the original six books, FHs other books and no derivative works at all. Of all of the derivative works though, it is really only BH's that rouse my ire. To me, his books seem like a betrayal. I've said enough on that for now though."
dune,25k2oy,baronvonpenguin,2,Thu May 15 17:42:15 2014 UTC,"this isn't an argument between sides that disagree on some small issues.   Also, it isn't fair to generalize about all of the purists based on my particular stance. I abhor the new books. That isn't necessarily true for the others who are fans of the originals only. Many of them are much milder about it."
dune,25k2oy,baronvonpenguin,1 point,Thu May 15 18:15:43 2014 UTC,"People who ""love"" brian's works cannot love Frank's. They are almost oppositional in quality, form and function. One is a tragedy about the fall of a family and the perils of the superhuman in society. The other is simply a tragedy."
dune,25k2oy,Psyladine,2,Thu May 15 18:19:14 2014 UTC,Generalizing. Two demerits to House Psyladine.
dune,25k2oy,baronvonpenguin,2,Thu May 15 18:22:39 2014 UTC,"Sorry capitan, I just can't see it. To know Herbert's works is to know...poetry, nuance...a deft hand that strays from drawing conclusions, and builds on a lifetime of convictions and observations about a range of the human condition told in a narrative that spans decades and millions of words, and millenia of passing.  Brian and Kevin's work is star wars with a different brand. But I understand words are hard for some people, and ideas even moreso."
dune,25k2oy,baronvonpenguin,3,Thu May 15 18:30:32 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I've never read any of Kevin's other works. I tried to get into the Hellhole book, and it just didn't appeal to me. I've never read anything Star Wars - Just not my cup of tea - Besides, I can get all the Star Wars I want from the original inspiration, Dune. :P  I guess I'm just not as bothered by the difference in the writing. Any criticism I might have for the books is easily eclipsed by my lust and greed for more Dune in any form.  Frank is definitely my favorite writer, though. I've read everything he's written that I could get my hands on, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Frank has had a profound impact on my outlook on life, my philosophy, my positions on so many issues - Religion, politics, social behaviors, etc.  I've yet to find any other author that comes even close to the quality and depth that Frank brought to bear in his works. He's hard to top, so I don't even bother to compare.  For me, the new books were simply appreciated. Rather than being stuck re-reading the same six books again and again, great as they are, I now have more than three times the original material to fill my little bouts of free time with, and I'm grateful for that. It bothers me not that BH and KA aren't Frank, because I never expected them to be."
dune,25k2oy,Joomes,2,Wed May 14 18:31:05 2014 UTC,"I fail to see where Psyladine mentioned you personally, or even contextually - In context, the comment was about the authors of the books, which I consider fair game. We're discussing the quality of the stories, so when someone believes the latter books to be of poor quality, they are allowed a bit of leeway in criticizing the authors - It's a delicate balance - What is the acceptable limitation of dissent?  I believe that it's a fine line between saying ""I think Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are talent-less hacks that are milking the Dune universe for their own monetary gain, rather than out of respect for the cannon."" and saying ""The authors would do well to pull out of each other before setting pen to paper - Perhaps then they could focus on the writing, rather than fucking people in the ass.""  The first is an observation, validated as someone's personal opinion. It implies nothing about the author that is not based solely in the perspective of the writer's opinion. The latter is useless. It does not serve to express the writer's opinion, but instead relies on a view with no basis in fact whatsoever. It's only purpose is to denigrate the authors personally, and does not further the discussion in any way.  This is what I mean when I ask for civility - I don't expect your opinions to change, nor do I ask you to change how you feel - I only ask that you take the time to ensure that your comments express your opinion, or your stance on another person's opinion.  It is hard to be fair, but I feel that within the construct of the guidelines, there is little wiggle room for misinterpretation.  I understand if you sometimes don't agree with how I respond to things; that is your right, but please do not assume that I am taking sides here. I try my very best to weigh things in context as well as by themselves to determine whether they adhere to guidelines or not.  If you disagree with me, PLEASE, speak up, say your piece. I am not at all opposed to being corrected or re-considering things. If you have a valid point, I cannot argue against it."
dune,25k2oy,fortean,3,Thu May 15 15:56:15 2014 UTC,"Look, I don't want a war here, least of all between us - I'm harder on you because I want to think that you are more capable of taking the high road. We are both fans of the entire series, and as hard as it is to try to pass over people who are vehemently opposed to the new books, we should strive to pave the way for civil discussions.  I grow frustrated because I feel that rather than trying to work with me, you are very focused on trying to work against me. I am trying not to take sides, because I feel that my role as moderator should be an impartial one.  This issue has continued to plague our community here, and it unnerving to feel like I'm being placed in the middle of it just to try to keep things civil here. I cannot do it alone. I need everyone here to pitch in and police themselves.  Perhaps it is better that I go back to being a silent partner in this endeavor, and to limit my duties to policing spam alone.

One question though-if this sub is so horrible and full of grumpy old ""Orthodox Herbertites"" or whatever we're being called this week, why do fans of the BH series bother posting about them here? I mean, they already have r/nuDune right? I'm not saying that I want all discussion of the new books banned or anything, but if the majority here hate the new books, and you already have a separate place to discuss them, why are you so upset when we old timers give our honest opinion-that they are badly written trash that are an insult to Franks memory?"
dune,25k2oy,totes_meta_bot,3,Thu May 15 15:48:35 2014 UTC,"I'm not upset that people don't like the new books. I welcome them to share WHY they feel as they do, because I feel that frank discussion breeds understanding. The problem is that the passions here run hot, and all too frequently, differences in opinion quickly devolve into personal attacks which have zero bearing on the matter at hand.  I don't like Apple products. I refuse to buy any of them, and I have many reasons why - However, I don't leverage my dislike of Apple as a reason to denigrate people that do. All I can do is share my reasons why I don't like them, and allow for them to respond.  I am a moderator of /r/nuDune as well, by invitation. I'm not particularly active there, mostly because the sub isn't very active itself. The /r/Dune community is much more active, so I spend the lion's share of my time here.  I don't think there should be a separate place for the new Dune books - I'd much rather we were all able to be civil and disagree without it turning into a schoolyard brawl. If it's Dune, it belongs here.  Personally, I'm more forgiving of the new books. I overlook a lot, partly due to my thirst for more Dune story, and partly out of understanding that BH and KA are not, nor ever will be on Frank's level. Frank was a visionary, and a true literary treasure. Nobody here will refute that.  The contention here is all around the reception of the new books - Some of us are happy to have more, and some of us are quite upset, because in many ways, the prequels DO seem like a cash grab - Frank wrote six books, and died before he could complete the seventh.  Using his notes for Dune 7, BH and KA attempted to continue the story, and have apparently found enough of a warm reception to successfully write more than a dozen further books in the series.  If the fandom were all of the same mind in feeling that the new books were total trash, and an affront to Frank's legacy, then they wouldn't have been able to continue. Publishers would have told them to take a walk.  We're a pretty large fan community here; but in the whole of the fandom, our number is rather small. I'm not surprised that we have a shifting balance of people who see the new books as good or bad.  All I want is for us to be able to carry on conversations here about Dune in it's many forms, to be able to be honest about how and what we feel about them, and to do so without it devolving into squabbles where the topic is thrown out the window in favor of calling each other names.  If this community is to thrive, it's success is in all of our hands. I cannot control how the users here behave, nor should I have to. Each of us should be able to acknowledge that we share a deep love of Dune, and to walk upon that shared ground with pride, respect, and dignity."
dune,25k2oy,fortean,2,Thu May 15 15:51:41 2014 UTC,"My post wasnt really directed at you, I agree with what you say completely.  It was more about the fact that the only requests for censorship of peoples opinions Ive seen in this sub are from fans of the BH books.  If you like the new books fine, your opinion is just as valid as anyone elses. But if you want to be able to praise BH without having to hear any disagreement, there is already a sub for that. Playing the oppressed martyr, and calling people elitist for criticising the authors or books when you already have somewhere else to discuss them just comes across as trolling."

I said several times that I welcome other peoples opinions, and that I dont want BH discussions banned. r/nuDune is a place for fans of the new books to discuss those works without having to put up with Primary Herbertisers having a different opinion. r/Dune is for people to discuss anything related to Dune, including their reasons for loving or hating the new books. You see how that works? You've got a place to say whatever you want and not have to hear any back chat about it.  Say you are a fan of the FH books. You tried reading the BH books, and even forced yourself to get through 5 or 6 of them in the hopes that they would get better. But you cant, its just not the same. So you come to r/Dune and express your opinion. A lot of people agree with you, but then some dick comes along and starts calling you elitist and saying that you hate reading and that by expressing your dislike of the new books you are some great oppressor.  You stomp around this place throwing personal insults around and then go screaming to the mods when you get the same back."

I was mostly reading game magazines at the time, but ran across the miniseries on VHS. Picked up both miniseries (Dune and Children).  My brother and I were homeschooled, and wound up watching both series 30 minutes at a time on our lunch. Im pretty sure it took us at least a month.   Later we picked up Emperror: Battle for Dune. Enjoyed the game thoroughly. Got a job, a social life for the first time ever, and forgot about it for several years. Then one day I was at work, and my store had gotten in a shipment of discount books that we were selling for three bucks. Saw Paul of Dune, grabbed it, and, again, promptly forgot about it.   Then about a year or so ago, I was bored at home and felt like reading something. A friend at work had been talking up Dune, especially the Jihad series, so I was planning to read Dune chronologically, starting with that. Said screw it, read the book I had, and became engrossed in the world again. I read all three House books from the library, on my phone. Then I read Frank's original six books.   Mind. Blown.   Tried to get into Sandworms and Hunters, but it was like eating Salisbury steak after having a 22 oz porterhouse. Finished them anyways, just to see how the story ended, which was badly.   Ive since tried to read Sisterhood , but cant get into it. I don't know or care about any of those characters, most of which are extremely one dimensional. The only one I have any real feelings about is Manford Torondo, and those feelings are pure, unadulterated hatred.   I still plan on reading the other BH/KJA books.

Taking something unfinished, chopping it off, and saying ""Now it's finished, because it ends here.""  ""I will not train you until you can see your hands grow old and young in front of your eyes.""  ""Come see me when you can move your big toe independently of any other muscles in your body.""  Water is really important. Things that are important determine what actions mean.

dune,25hwa1,Trevoke,2,Thu May 15 14:34:38 2014 UTC,"I had vaguely heard of the series, being familiar with Scifi literature and movies, but didn't know anything about it.  A friend recommended it to me, knowing the sorts of things I was into (martial arts, philosophy, scifi), and described some elements of it that really enticed me.  So I bought the book, and then every subsequent book thereafter, up until House Atreides (first and last Brian Herbert book I'll read, ugh).  Then re-read the series at least half a dozen times.  I'm constantly seeing connections between Dune and everything else in the world, in history, in other fiction, and in my life.  I have a degree in philosophy and I still consider Frank Herbert possibly my favorite philosopher.  His ideas aren't necessarily all original, but they all come together in a cohesive way and the man is absolutely brilliant."

Now I'm halfway through God Emperor and feeling pretty confused by everything. Which is okay, because I've found with Frank Herbert, I have no idea what is going on until 3 AM when I can't sleep and it all clicks at once.

dune,25hwa1,Psyladine,2,Thu May 15 06:04:57 2014 UTC,"Our basement flooded when I was 12, and we were forced to the drycleaners for a few weeks. We'd have to sit there for close to two hours with nothing to do and little to see, while a week's worth of laundry would get washed, dried, folded and repacked into the station wagon.  On the last time we went, someone had put an old copy of Dune in the wash by mistake, and threw it on the floor when they left. It was aged terribly, the pages alternating between falling out and stuck together, some parts ink staining blotting out entire sentences and words, but I had nothing better to do, and started to read it. I considered leaving it for the person to come back for their book they'd left behind (ha!) but those two hours reading it had pretty much cemented that I was going to read the rest.   A lifetime later I hadn't read much more of Herbert, but I did value his style and work highly, and studied everything about the man I could get my hands on. The influence of Dune and how far this little scifi novel about deserts, drugs and international relations went is a testament to the reach and power of science fiction, something Hebert appreciated above all."

She's a Lynch fan already by way of Twin Peaks, but I just thought it was too weird.  The mini-series had it's problems, mostly due to budget, but I personally liked Alec Newman as Paul, and also James McAvoy as Leto, and I thought that they adhered more closely to the books in the story-line.  I do acknowledge that the Lynch film was cut to pieces, and doesn't reflect Lynch's true vision for the film (I have around four different versions of that film alone - The Spice Diver Fan Edit is well worth finding), so I try to take it with a grain of salt, but there were still some very strange decisions made overall.  Between Lynch and Joderowsky, I feel like neither one could just be faithful to the material, they just had to make it their own with weird characters and costumes. Neither seemed to understand that the Bene Gesserit were supposed to be highly adept at seduction, have exceptional control over their body chemistry and musculature - They are quite formidable. They aren't supposed to be bald and irritated, or have things coming off their heads.  Not that the mini-series got them quite right either, but at least they had hair and were attractive.  I guess that I just feel that the feel of the mini-series was far closer to my imagination than the Lynch version, and I've never done enough drugs for the Joderowsky version to make any sense."

dune,25bv1w,banjist,2,Mon May 12 05:44:39 2014 UTC,"Dune (video game):       Dune is a 1992 video game, based upon Frank Herbert's science fiction novel of the same name. Developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Virgin Interactive, is the first of the Dune computer games. Dune blended adventure with economic and military strategy, and is considered by many the most immersive Dune computer game. Loosely following the story of the novel, the game casts the player as Paul Atreides, with the ultimate goal of driving the Harkonnen from Planet Dune, while managing spice extraction, military, and later, ecology through the native Fremen tribes. As the player progresses, his troops are equipped with weapons from ""crysknives"" to atomics, tap into Paul's latent psychic powers, and get acquainted with such characters from the book as Chani and Liet-Kynes. Available for the Amiga and IBM compatibles, it was one of the first floppy games to be converted to CD format, which included footage of the David Lynch movie, voice-acting for all speaking roles, and highly improved, 3D-rendered travelling and location screens. This version (a mix of the Amiga graphics and the extras of the PC-CD version) was also released on Sega's Mega-CD console. Also worthy of mention is the audio track created by Stéphane Picq and Philip Ulrich, released by Cryo (formerly Exxos) on the now extremely rare album Dune: Spice Opera.

dune,255yqi,sandpet1,6,Fri May 9 22:34:58 2014 UTC,"Exactly, there is nothing in the book that indicates they are related, beyond the similarities of living in extremely harsh environments and becoming hardier because of it.  The 'corruption' in the Fedaykin is there to show how dangerous the messiah complex can be, and to lead into Leto accepting the terrible fate that was his Golden Path"
dune,255yqi,Mad_Mack,5,Sat May 10 00:11:10 2014 UTC,"Exactly right IMO.  ""These Fremen are magnificently alive!  I've never met a greedy Fremen"" Idaho said.  When their day-to-day survival was not assured at all, and nearly all hands were turned against them,  including their environment, they had neither time nor space for corruption.  By comparison, ""The lowliest Sardaukar trooper lived in the manner of anyone in a House Major""; once removed from Salusa Secundus  their immediate survival was relatively assured and they had time to gain and appreciate the finer thing their position had to offer."

dune,255yqi,RobertNevill,2,Sat May 10 14:41:25 2014 UTC,"Salusa Secundus was the third stop during the Zensunni Migrations. The Zensunni ancestors of the Fremen were split up on Poritrin, with half being sent to Salusa Secundus and the other half being moved to Bela Tegeuse. The Zensunni lived as slaves on Salusa Secundus for nine generations(4492 AG-5295 AG) before Emperor Ezhar VII arranged for them to be moved to the planet Ishia.  While there may have been a small amount of interbreeding between the Zensunni and the Sardaukar, I wouldn't, by any stretch of the term, refer to them as ""related by blood"". Their time on Salusa Secundus was pronounced by an atrocious death rate due to the harsh ecological conditions of the planet and a purge by the Sardaukar who tried to convert them to their religion."
dune,255yqi,IVHoltzmann,2,Sun May 11 01:19:30 2014 UTC,"Sardauker are not a racial Demographic. they are prisoners from across the Empire. Especially considering Salusa Secundus was depopulated and the entirety of the planet turned into a prison after it's nuclear destruction.   food for thought though, it's very possible that some of the population of Corrin has Zensummi bloodlines in it."
dune,255yqi,macjoven,1 point,Sun May 11 20:03:20 2014 UTC,"The time frame I'm referring to is thousands of years before the events of Dune. The Imperial Sardaukar descend from the Sardau tribe that conquered Salusa Secundus. True, their population was constantly replenished with an influx of prisoners. However, Salusa Secundus is described as an unforgiving planet on par with Arrakis. This fact, combined with the absolutely brutal upbringing of Sardaukar potentials, would ensure that only the hardiest prisoners would actually survive to become Imperial Sardaukar. This leaves a lot of room for inbreeding, over thousands of years. A lot of this depends on your definition of ""racial demographic"" though."
dune,255yqi,RobertNevill,3,Sun May 11 22:17:49 2014 UTC,"If you run the numbers you will find that you have more ancestors 800 years ago than there were people on earth. Talking about special kin relationship over thousands of years is almost meaningless because everyone is related to everyone else, if only a little bit or they have been isolated so long that similarities beyond basic humanity is moot. Or both."
dune,255yqi,RobertNevill,1 point,Mon May 12 13:45:18 2014 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know that about the Sardau tribe. the books always refer to Salusa as being a beautiful world before the atomic attack by a renegade household."
dune,255yqi,lundse,2,Mon May 12 15:51:05 2014 UTC,"Theoretically, there could be ""fremen"" that are Sardauker. But the Sardauker are not a ethnic demographic. They are a very culled and winnowed prisoner population which are force conscripted into service on salusa secundus. The prisoner population is stated to be the worst criminals in the empire. So picture the worst of the worst, indoctrinated and rigidly trained/disciplined similar to Early Roman Legions.   ** AKA the French Foreign legion circa 1800's (Sardauker) vs. Early Mongols (Fremen). I see the Fremen as a conglomerate of several cultures. Mongols for their war fighting, Bedouins for their ethnocentric/stoic society, and possibly Japanese Bushido Clan Period."
dune,253z6w,enitnepres,9,Fri May 9 06:33:37 2014 UTC,"I think Leto meant survival as in there would be such a scattering that no one force could end humanity as a whole no matter how great the force. There would always be more humans deeper in space no matter what; Even if someone or something say, killed, maybe 100 billion people as a means to cause extinction."
dune,253z6w,Jack_Burton_Express,7,Fri May 9 10:24:48 2014 UTC,"Well, the scattering itself means that the human race will live on in one form or another. Even in Leto's worm form there is hidden humanity within him. The consciousness and history of humanity will always be remembered in his writings within the Stolen Journals. That's the way I interpreted it, could be wrong."
dune,253z6w,ginbear,5,Fri May 9 07:15:54 2014 UTC,"In my interpretation of Leto's plan, the Golden Path isn't meant to ensure the survival of the human race, but to break it apart and set different people on different evolutionary paths   It can be both of those things, but ""evolve"" in this sense can be a muddy term, as the Golden Path was not limited to genetic evolution. The golden path, and the scattering was meant to make humanity into something that could never again be controlled by a single force. Muad'Dib was able to seize power over the empire because of the Spice was such a force, under which all of humanity operated. Leto saw this created dependency, prevented humanity from growing/evolving and would ultimately be something that would be used to cause the destruction of humanity.  One of the overarching themes of the Dune series is that dependency and comfort create weakness and adversity creates strength. Humanity had become dependent on spice, comfortable even, and had ceased to advance as a species. By restricting the Spice over thousands of years, Leto weaned humanity off its Spice dependency (forcing them to develop alternative solutions (ie. no-ships, etc)), and the famine times created the catalyst for the Scattering."
dune,253z6w,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,3,Fri May 9 20:32:16 2014 UTC,"I think that there are alot of things in the last three books that support the idea of an evolving human species. Leto's breeding program introduced invisibility to prescience into the majority of the human population. With that trait, which came from the Atreides genes, came things like Odrade's ability to detect dangers to the sisterhood and Miles Teg's ability to see no ships and speed up his metabolism and reactions. On the other, less controlled side of that coin, is the Honored Matre's muscles bypassing the brain and reacting instantaneously. (Think of their meeting with Waff toward the beginning of Heretics)  And all of that is over just 1500 years.   The only thing that I think sets that apart from the original statement is that the people who possessed those abilities were still intrinsically human. They hadn't become a different species, they were simply ""more evolved"" humans. So while I feel that Frank definitely showed an evolution of the species, I dont think they were headed toward becoming another species entirely, at least not any time soon."

I believe he saw the failure of the human race as a actual possibility and thus, step by step, forced the scattering and reduced inter-planetary trade. I believe he instituted a intentional pogrom to cull the bloodlines and force individual reliance and owner ship of each planet. Think about how King Leonidas selected his fighters from the agoge to march to the Hot Gates. He selected soldiers from all agoge's and classes to insure all of the groups knew loss and were willing to fight because of it. Human nature is a fickle but dependable power."

I now see the scattering as a large collection of planets occupied by Fremen like people, and these people would bow down to no evil Baron H."

dune,253z6w,Joomes,0,Sat May 31 07:30:09 2014 UTC,"I don't see any reason for quick evolution.  There's still Navigators and others traveling throughout the galaxy allowing a spread of human genes.  Besides, we've basically ended evolution these days anyway, in the future it would be even more controlled."
dune,253z6w,wedge713,6,Fri May 9 15:24:06 2014 UTC,"Besides, we've basically ended evolution these days anyway   No, we haven't. There are plenty of selection pressures driving evolution by natural selection today. There are also plenty of examples of evolution by the removal of selection pressures that used to act on us.  Example of the first: sickle cell anaemia (a disease whereby if you have both copies, you die, but if you have one copy, you get malaria resistance) has shown very rapid expansion in terms of its prevalence in the population even over the past 50-100 years  Example of the second: With the advent of easily and regularly accessible caesarian section births, the selection pressure for women to have very wide hips is being removed. Even within the past couple of generations, we have seen a reduction in average hip sizes in Western women.   in the future it would be even more controlled.   Eh... The Bene Gesserit and Leto both had breeding programs, sure, and other organisations potentially had their own. However, these directed breeding programs only affected a relatively small proportion of the human elite (the resources required to have breeding programs larger than this simply didn't exist). It's actually pretty heavily implied that the combination of a feudal social structure with relatively low levels of scientific innovation over time during the Old Empire would have exposed humans to greater selection pressures than most western humans today, although not necessarily those living in poorer countries.  The implications we get in the later books are that the scattering has lead to a massive increase in genetic diversity, and that there are likely to be all sorts of new human traits that have appeared out in the far reaches of human expansion."
dune,253z6w,Joomes,-1,Fri May 9 16:07:46 2014 UTC,"You're right, I should have said we've basically ended natural selection.  We are still evolving, but it's a controlled evolution and not necessarily a good thing."

Nah dude, we haven't. Go back and re-read my post above. Artificial selection (which I'm assuming is what you're talking about when you say 'controlled evolution') is not practiced in humans. It's still natural selection even if the selection pressure is a result of modern cultural/scientific effects that weren't created specifically to alter the route of evolution. Nor do we currently alter human genetics directly (there have been trials to try and treat genetic diseases, but none of them have worked) to influence evolution in that way.   We have not ended evolution by natural selection. In fact, there is genetic evidence that human evolution by natural selection over the past 5-10 thousand years (approximately the time during which we have had 'culture', which supposedly buffers us AGAINST natural selection) has been faster than at other points in human history, and faster than the evolution by natural selection of various other mammals."

It is multi-threaded, like Dune, deals in huge concepts, the Messiah complex, the survival and maturation of the human race, the capriciousness of god-like beings, the definition of humanity, fate and the consequences of interference, like Dune.  I wrote my BA thesis on an analysis of the concepts in this book, and how they describe the human condition.      It is a part of a series of 4, although it is BY FAR the best of the 4.  The other 3 are adequate, but this is a superior book, and to me, ranks alongside Dune itself as the best of his writing."

It is a challenging and sort of esoteric read, as it is not (in my copy at least) arranged into chapters and only really serves as an un-necessary preface to The Jesus Incident...I can save you A LOT of trouble and precis it for you, if you want. SPOILER ALERT.      SPOILER ALERT - all you really need to know about what happened in Destination Void is that a spaceship with an organic brain for its computer was sent to Tau Ceti, ostensibly to set up a colony there.  I say ostensibly because it is a secret known only to the directors of this operation that there are no planets around Tau Ceti. The brain went mad and died before the ship left the Solar System and the remaining specialists were forced to develop an artificial intelligence to control the ship.  As the story unfolds it becomes clear that this is not the first ship to try to do this - artificial intelligence has a history of going ""rogue"" and destroying its creators, so sending the colonists out to the safety of deep space is regarded as the best bet; it has, so far, not been a success, but the directors of the project keep trying with new ships and cloned humans.  The main body of the story is set around the efforts to make an artificial intelligence with suitably human characteristics and enough self-awareness, self-consciousness, and all the other elusive elements that make up intelligence.  At the end of the book they succeed in creating an intelligence that calls itself Ship, and makes the journey to Tau Ceti in a matter of seconds, where it has created planets to receive the colonists.  At the end of the story, Ship poses the question/statement: ""You must decide how you will WorShip (sic) me"".      The Jesus Incident opens an unspecified but huge amount of time after this story."

It's about a Native American man who works at a summer camp. He has a vision that he needs to redeem the world for the atrocities visited upon the natives by the white people, so he captures a young boy from the camp. The novel is their conversations as the man takes the boy to a cave to kill him.  It's hard to find, but it's beautifully written.  Also, make sure not to stop at Children of Dune.

And yes, it is largely because Odrade is so awesome that those two are my favorites. I like the BGs in general, so the fact that the last two books really revolve around them was a delight for me. I tend to really enjoy ""a day in the life"" type writing, and seeing some of the inner workings of the BGs, and the mundane parts of their lives (Meetings, lunch in the cafeteria) was really enjoyable for me, and made the universe just that much more real.   I'm also really fond of Lucilla and Miles Teg. By Chapterhouse, Murbella has really grown on me as well."

dune,24v7ed,judgebread,8,Tue May 6 22:31:35 2014 UTC,"Heretics and Chapterhouse are written from the BG point of view (IMO) because they are the only 'consistent' organisation from the Dune times whose aims we can understand, almost from the first chapter of Dune itself - ""Ever sift sand through a screen?"".  They have never deviated from this mission over the 4500 years of the span of the story.  It sort of brings the story full circle in a way, for me.  Also, remember that 1500 years of history and anarchy have to be explained and digested before you start getting into the main story.      The writing style is slightly different; although there are enemies they are, at first, not sharply defined, and the usual intrigues are still there.  I think these two books are exceptional, since even in the writing there comes a sense of emptiness and fatigue from the Scattering/Famine times, but someone has already made the point - kick back and don't expect to read and absorb it at the same pace that you might have read the others at.      There is one last point - actually something I would like to discuss, but I don't feel like it merits its own submission.  This is the issue of timescale in the various books, and something that never ceases to engage me with Dune and FH.  Thee are the timescales as I understand them:      Dune - 20 to 25 years span;      Dune Messiah - 2 years;      Children of Dune - 10 to 12 years;      God Emperor - 1 year;      Heretics - Around 20 years;      Chapterhouse - Around 20 years.      My point with this is that the last two books cover more time than the others in the series and are, I feel, written in a slightly less urgent style because of that.      Oh, and Miles Teg!"

dune,24v7ed,apjak,3,Tue May 6 22:22:11 2014 UTC,"Well, in Heretics Sheeana is about 8 at the start of it and Idaho is about 12.  I made the assumption that it would take about 15 years to finish training to be a Reverend Mother...that would put her at 23 or so; also Idaho has at least 5 to 10 years being made ready to be restored to his memories.  There is some not inconsiderable time between the disappearance (and stashing of the Bashar(!) in the no-globe and the restoration of Idaho's memories - say 6 months or so.  This brings us up to between 16 and 18 years since the start of the story.  The episode with Waff on Rakis and all the other Tleilaxu dealings take about another 6 months, so we're pushing 17 to 19 years, give or take. 20 is a nice round number, especially if you dd in the fortnights etc it might have taken for other events, like the meeting of the BG and the Tleilaxu ;-)      Same thing in Chapterhouse, really, although perhaps 20 years is pushing it a bit.  I take ghola Miles to be around 13 to 15 when he is re-awakened; the sandtrout take around that amount of time, or perhaps a little longer, to make their presence felt, so let's say 15 years.  I don't see the final events happening right one after the other, perhaps over a period of a year.  I don't know why, but the oblique references, like the no-ship having been on the ground so long it had sunk into it, the length of captivity of Scytale, the passage of time and the smooth repetition of the Agony pondered on by Odrade, all give me around 20 years for this storyline.      What do you think?"

Still not nearly as compelled as the previous books.  I feel like god emperor was such an absolutely amazing ending that going further is almost insulting. To go from the heady monologues of leto ii to the Indiana Jones esque antics of teg feels like a step back. It feels very similar in tone to the first book, which was grand don't get me wrong.  Think I'm just biased. God emperor may be the most compelling piece of fiction I've ever read, and leto ii the most interesting, relatable character."

I did a wikipedia refresher after the first three because I was curious if I was a bit lost; I would not discourage anyone from doing that.  Herbert has this way of making me feel like I don't exactly grasp what's going on, but in the end I actually did get it, I think was just super curious and unsure.  Reading the synopses on wiki helped me solidify my understanding of what was going on.  If you are loving what you've done so far, there is no reason to wait.  Enjoy God Emperor!  Personally, it was the most mind blowing book for me, and probably the most impactful book I've ever read...  but book 5 is the best standalone book in the series, in my opinion."

dune,24tfyp,Vongman,2,Tue May 6 04:05:38 2014 UTC,"The best way is to just dive right in. While it can be a good idea to refresh yourself on the first three works, God Emp is almost entirely seperate in it's own way. It truly is apart from the rest of the series by far more than just time; in a way, Heretics feels like a much more natural continuation of Children than God Emp does, and yet without God Emp, the series itself loses a large part of it's meaning.  God Emp is, in many ways, Frank's crown jewel in that he puts it all on the table. There's nothing like reading God Emp. Not other works of fiction, or philosophy, or even the other Dune books. There isn't really a way to ""prepare"" for because the vast majority of the book covers new ground and topics; wildly differing themes and ideas from the first three, yet inclusive of the themes already presented within the series. It truly is a work that stands alone in it's breadth of imagination with regards to socio-philosophical ideas."

The first three, Dune, Messiah, and Children, form a trilogy, and are all close enough to each other to be labeled as such.  God Emperor was written to bridge the gap between this first trilogy, and the next three books afterwards that Frank had already put the planning in for. Due to it's distance from the rest of the books (~3500 years after Children, ~2500 before Heretics), it cannot be grouped with other books in the same way that the first three are.   Heretics and Chapterhouse were written afterwards and, with the addition of the unfinished (by Frank) ""Dune 7"", would have made the final trilogy, effectively capping off the series. Frank died before finishing the seventh book, leaving his notes and ideas behind for his son, Brian, to finish the story with his friend, splitting it into two books (Hunters of Dune, and Sandworms of Dune)."

These, as you will remember, were capable of complete absorption/mimicry of a person, right down to their cellular memories. I am not sure that Marty and Daniel were anything other than Scattered Face Dancers who had absorbed/encountered so many people that they became as powerful a they evidently were.  I believe (and I could be completely and utterly wrong in this, but a parallel strikes me) that FH left this deliberately somewhat vague in his usual style, to allow the reader to draw their own conclusion.  In Heretics, I think it was Darwi who noted that one of the names the Tleilaxu called themselves was ""The Unnameable"", a name usually reserved for gods.  FH has written other stories about accumulating so much knowledge that godhood (or something close) is achieved - I just wonder if he was using this theme with Marty and Daniel."

Dune Messiah and Children of Dune really go beyond where most hero complex stories end. God Emperor is so far removed from the hero complex.

Dalak, second-cousin of Count Hasimir Fenring, is never referred to by a title so I'm forced to believe that before his marriage to Wensicia he had no formal title. Given that Wensicia was Shaddam's third daughter, her children would be far down the line of succession and that would make her marriage opportunities much less grand than those of her older sisters. Taking into account her position as the third daughter of the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe and considering she was marrying someone of lower standing, it would make sense for Shaddam Corrino to press for matrilineal succession, thus giving all her children the Corrino family name.  P.S. - For those interested, if you subscribe to Original Dune, Farad'n was born to Count Dalak Kenola and Wensicia Corrino. So, everything I said could still technically hold true."

They really are one story.  Dune Messiah is the Empire Strikes Back of the series in that it is the unhappy, second act of larger story.  As for the possibility of staleness: it just doesn't happen.  Frank Herbert didn't subscribe to the ""more of the same but bigger"" school of sequeling. However he does get pretty heady and many people of TV generation of readers find the latter books to be quite... Dry."

In the appendices the quote is ""Afflicted by a Hero"".  In Dune Messiah you have the deconstruction of the Hero that you followed for all the right reasons, a paragon of virtue claiming what is rightfully righteously his. His Myth gets torn apart, and you see all the worst things his prescience foresaw.  I think many people don't like this lesson and would gladly turn their personal responsibility over to a guru."

I've never really been sure why I don't like it so much as the others in the series, but I just don't. I think it's possible to appreciate the themes etc. of a book even if you don't enjoy it directly for itself. It's just never really stood out to me as one of the gems of the series in my semi-regular re-readings."
dune,246tqv,Joomes,3,Sun May 11 02:58:50 2014 UTC,"I'm finding that I am somewhat struggling with the style of writing as yeah, he's pretty damn dry. The writing style takes some getting used to it seems and for a lot of people it's putting them off. I really want to push through because so far it is a good story and I really want to read something of higher quality than the ""made to be turned into a movie"" books that are popular these days. I am glad to hear that he keeps things interesting (even if dry) and that was mostly what I needed to know for my decision. Thank you everyone for the helpful responses."
dune,246tqv,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,3,Mon Apr 28 16:50:49 2014 UTC,"I would suggest reading all six books, without a doubt. There's a jump in time between both sets of books that can be jarring at first, but its definitely worth working through. Alot of people, especially on this sub, like the fourth book better than all the rest. My personal favorite is probably the fifth. Either way, the latter half of the series definitely has alot to offer, and when you get down to it, you'll never know if you'll enjoy them if you dont at least try them."
dune,246tqv,JesterJosh,3,Mon Apr 28 16:01:55 2014 UTC,"I made it through God Emperor earlier this year and and am struggling to make my way in the next book. General consensus is that Frank's books are great, but after Chapterhouse Dune the books written by the son fall short."
dune,246tqv,MortRouge,1 point,Mon Apr 28 15:12:26 2014 UTC,"Book 4, God Emperor of Dune, including me, is believed by many to be the best book (many don't as well, like people who liked the swashbuckling style of the original book and feels like Dune Messiah was a let down). You can even stop reading after that one, because the two last books are more a separated duo. I guess some people call it two triologies, but I more feel like God Emperor is the epilogue to the three first books and the last two books stand on their own."
dune,246tqv,apjak,3,Mon Apr 28 16:13:55 2014 UTC,God-Emperor is the bridge between two trilogies as far as I'm concerned.  It's a pity that pancreatic cancer took from us any chance of getting a legitimate ending to the loose threads in Chapterhouse.
dune,246tqv,Fuck_ALL_Religion,3,Mon Apr 28 17:38:17 2014 UTC,"Interestingly, I dislike Messiah, but think that God Emperor is the best book in the series.  I can forgive Messiah for being uncomfortable.  apjak's comment elsewhere in this thread, about the deconstruction of a hero, is a major part of that.  But that does not make a book bad.  My real problem is something about the writing style that I can't quite identify.  The important plot elements are there, but are handled differently than in the other books, somehow flat, as if Frank phoned that one in.  A necessary, but lackluster, transition to Children.   The writing picks right back up in Children, though, which shines again, and by God Emperor, it's brilliant.   I more feel like God Emperor is the epilogue to the three first books   I couldn't agree more.  It brings closure to an epic story.  What comes after it is a new and separate story about the long term effects of the events in the first 4 books."
dune,246tqv,zeruch,1 point,Mon Apr 28 18:18:36 2014 UTC,"The best books (IMO) after the first, is the last two. Book 4 is in effect, a transitional book that swings one from the era of the first trio of books, and launches the foundation for the next two (which actually take place some time after the 4th)."

Only really issue if he can sing the bawdy songs, but if they can auto tune Britney to achieve platinum records, I'm sure they can clean him up in post production.  Danny can glower like a champion and that will be key.  Thufir Hawat: Bruce Willis.  After all Thufir is on his third generation of Atriedes and starting to look a little old and grizzled, but still a warrior-mentat.  Bruce did excellent work in the Fifth Element in terms of handling SciFi.  Duncan Idaho: Does not exactly fit the books description wise, but Jet Li.  Suave, good actor, and he'll give an excellent performance in Duncan's death scene.  You can step beyond the books and produce a solid action scene there, show more of Duncan's death.  On a related note, raid the martial arts film establish for guys to play Fedaykin.  No SciFi channel dressing people up in weird shit and waving around swords.  Get the professionals in for the sword fighting.  Paul: Kit Harrington with a bit of a tan/makeup for a Mediterranean appearance (Jon Snow, Game of Thrones).  Assuming Kit can do action well enough to carry off the weirding way.    Chani: The two names in my head are likely too old.  I'd call up Takashi Miike and ask who he'd cast as female lead if he was doing a honor film with a female protagonist.  Really play up Chani's killer instinct.  If we were doing this in the mid 2000s, Eihi Shiina for sure.    Jessica: Priyanka Chopra.  Or perhaps Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity from the Matrix).    Leto:  Sean Bean (Eddard Stark).    The Beast Rabban:  Look for a more or less unknown name out of the pool of younger, really built folks.  I think appearance is the biggest key here, if he has the neanderthal brow you're off to a good start.  Dude should look like the kind of guy who wins power lifting medals for an Eastern European country but has his career end after he test positive for every supplement known to mankind and a few new ones.  The Baron: If only James Gandolfini was still with us. I can think of a few actors who could do do the Baron and much of it comes down to who looks the best in the fat suit.    Feyd:  This is were I start to go off the rails.  In the books I was always left with the impression of Paul and Feyd being ever so close.  Perhaps if Feyd had been trained by a BG mother and then exposed to massive amounts of spice, who knows.  I'd seriously consider using modern computer tricks to have the same actor play Paul and Feyd, with practical and computer driven differences.  The final fight scene would be a bitch, but I think you could swing it.  House Hog looks more Aryan, with the Barron being syphilis ridden Hitler and Feyd being the blue eyed dude on the recruiting poster.    The two Guildsman: Patrick Stewart and Sting."

dune,23u3eg,KiefKong,42,Thu Apr 24 05:01:29 2014 UTC,"There's some dialogue that explains this, but I don't have my book handy. Here's the gist of it: An animal caught in a trap will try to escape, even at the cost of a limb. But a human — a thinking person — will know that there is a greater purpose behind the trap, and will withstand the pain of it to have a chance at eliminating that greater purpose.  It's implied that the Bene Gesserit use the gom jabbar as one of many weeding-out tests that all contribute to their breeding program. If Paul — or anyone subjected to the test — had been unable to withstand the pain, the needle would've made a quick end of him, removing him from the bloodline and leaving humanity stronger for it.  The bigger idea here is that the Bene Gesserit perform both functions in the service of their breeding program: They breed different bloodlines together to reinforce desirable traits, but they also cull. This is something that turns out to be very influential on how Leto II sees his role and purpose."
dune,23u3eg,Hapax_Legoman,1 point,Thu Apr 24 05:17:58 2014 UTC,"This is a good explanation, but let me add that the test was specifically for the bene gesserit, the reason Paul was subjected to it was because Jessica had trained him as a bene gesserit."

dune,23u3eg,skunkynugget,5,Thu Apr 24 15:14:43 2014 UTC,"It's not as complicated as some of these replies indicate. It is definitely not gender specific as matt implies.  You've already deduced that they aren't trying to tell humans from aliens that look just like humans. Everyone is homo sapiens. Rather, they've narrowed the definition of humanity for their own purposes and that is what they are testing for.  The specific trait they are looking for is nothing more than self-awareness. They want a person who is able to put themselves into a proper context rather than someone who just blindly reacts to whatever the universe throws at them.  Think about the example given in the book, the actual test, and then think about some people you know. You might know a guy or a gal who fits that 'unthinking' definition; this would be someone who believes strange things without reflecting upon them, merely because they conform to some ideal or it might be someone who 'shoots first' and asks questions not at all. Have you seen Trainspotting? Think about the differences between Renton and Begley. Some people, put into that position, wouldn't even listen to the lady; they'd just yank their hand out at the first opportunity or they'd think they could out think her or out move her and fight back or come up with some trick. Others would realize there is more to this test than a box and a needle and they'd try to figure it out before acting."

dune,23u3eg,watermanjack,5,Thu Apr 24 06:03:57 2014 UTC,"I don't think it ever says, but I think it is doubtful. Unless my memory wildly betrays me, the fact that Jessica had taught him Bene Gesserit ways, to a male at all, was highly unorthodox, and controversial, much like the fact she gave birth to a male at all."
dune,23u3eg,Psyladine,2,Thu Apr 24 06:21:53 2014 UTC,The fact that Feyd was a planned product of the breeding line meaning there was no need to test him. Does that sound right?
dune,23u3eg,MortRouge,1 point,Thu Apr 24 06:37:58 2014 UTC,"It doesn't.  Part of their ethos around breeding is that they let it happen naturally. Feyd might have a lot of genes that they want passed on but there is no guarantee that they will be passed on. They would test everyone who is important to them. That said, they might not test Feyd merely because there is no suspicion he could be something more and they really only want his kids. Whether he passes the test or not could be immaterial so long as his son could pass it."
dune,23u3eg,david_e42,2,Thu Apr 24 14:47:09 2014 UTC,"They don't test everyone, just the daughters as the sisterhood is exclusively female. Self control, discipline and the ability to reason are ways they ensure their members have the canniness and endurance to serve the Gesserit plan.  Paul was an anomaly and expected to die, hence the reason his mother cried as she left, but he defied expectations.  If no male has ever passed the test, it would mean the male lines would be wiped out every generation, which wouldn't serve the interests of ht breeding program."
dune,23u3eg,mattcolville,3,Thu Apr 24 14:11:21 2014 UTC,"To clarify, ""humanity"" to the Bene Gesserit is a characteristic that is separated from the main biology of humans and is a certain trend that has to be strengthened through evolution, or in this case, eugenics."
dune,23u3eg,vinsneezel,3,Thu Apr 24 11:22:26 2014 UTC,"The gom jabbar business makes me think of the story of Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac.  Sure, it's the parent rather than the kid being tested....but then again, it seems to me the test is as much a test of Lady Jessica and her loyalty to the bene gesserit as it was of her son."
dune,23u3eg,Psyladine,5,Fri Apr 25 15:35:41 2014 UTC,"At the beginning of Dune the Bene Gesserit are two generations away from completing their breeding program.  Their plan is for Lady Jessica to give birth to a daughter, marry that daughter to Feyd, and then breed those two together. Their son should be, according to the Bene Gesserit calculations, the Kwisatz Haderach.   The Kwisatz Haderach is a male Bene Gesserit. Not just a male Bene Gesserit, a male Reverend Mother. A Reveredn Father, if you will.   Jessica knows this. When Leto says he wants a son, she disobeys her instructions to bear a daughter, and gives him the son he wants.   She secretly suspects and hopes that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach. Any offspring of theirs was going to be very close to the ultimate product of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.   The Gom Jabbar is a test given to girls taught in the Bene Gesserit way. There's no indication it's typically lethal for girls. Probably the majority pass it, no problem.   But since boys are not trained in The Way, the test kills them. In fact, it's likely the only boys ever tested are prospective Kwisatz Haderachs.   Not only does Paul pass, thanks to his mother's teachings, he passes after Reverend Mother Mohiam tries to force him to fail!  So the Reverend Mother thinks maybe Paul is the one."
dune,23u3eg,macjoven,5,Thu Apr 24 07:23:30 2014 UTC,"There's no indication it's typically lethal for girls. Probably the majority pass it, no problem.    There are two aspects the the test. The test itself is a box which, when your hand is placed inside, makes you feel great pain. Like this skin is being flayed and burned from your hand. In reality, it's just your nerves being fooled into transmitting the pain.   The second is the gom jabbar itself, the poison needle you get pricked with if you lose. It's definitely implied (if not outright stated) that failing the test results in a prick with the needle. However, when Paul finishes, Reverend Mother is shocked that he lasted longer than any female Bene gesserit."
dune,23u3eg,Psyladine,4,Thu Apr 24 11:10:51 2014 UTC,"It was meant to kill Paul, in revenge for his mother bearing a male instead of a girl (the child of Duke Leto was to wed with Feyd, thus ending the Atreides/Harkonnen blood feud).  Basically they forced Paul to go through the ritual as if he was the girl that was supposed to be born, and would be indoctrinated into the Gesserit sisterhood. He ended up surviving, the first to ever do so, and it gave the reverend mother pause, that he might be a generations-early iteration of their long term master plan for the human species: breeding the Kwisatz Haderach.   tl;dr: it was a rigged test, and Paul still won. The mother even exclaims that no sister ever endured so much. She realized he was something too good and too rare to pass up by killing, even if it set back the breeding program by a generation or two."
dune,23u3eg,macjoven,3,Thu Apr 24 14:08:43 2014 UTC,"The meaning to kill Paul was suggested as unconscious lapse on the reverend mothers part which she realized as soon as she was done rather than the plan from the beginning. The BG have egos just like everyone else, they are just generally more aware of it. In the last two books they have become super-conscious of their own egos and arranged everything they do and say to take them into account and are suspicious of themselves to a degree which which would dissolve any earlier or other society in days."
dune,23u3eg,Psyladine,1 point,Thu Apr 24 16:41:14 2014 UTC,"I mean, she said it was an ""oh I must have wanted you to fail..."" but there was the whole drop of 'no man has ever passed the test' to consider as well. She was certainly sending him to a certain death, averted only because he was trained in the Gesserit ways. apostasy! That was the truthtrance/water of life that no man had ever survived.   But given that she has a more hostile stance towards Paul at the end of Dune, in contrast to her cool demeanor at the start, I have to wonder if Herbert meant to show her as a treacherous snake by action."

They were completely blind sided by Paul and were scrambling to make the best of a bad situation. If they had really wanted him dead at the beginning of the book, he would have been dead. By the end of the book there was nothing they could do, and even when they succeeded (kind of) in Dune Messiah, it did them no good. I don't think she was especially treacherous. She kept what word she gave, it just did not extend very far."
dune,23u3eg,aDDnTN,2,Thu Apr 24 17:59:18 2014 UTC,"Given the necessity of society on genetic manipulation and close breeding/training, it wouldn't surprise me if the BG were the backbone of society to begin with. They were portrayed as scheming old women (true to Herbert's experiences I suppose), but it looked like they served a valuable and necessary service for humanity.  I feel like the Reverend Mother would have been happy to see Paul fail and die, and punish Jessica for her transgression, but true to their purpose couldn't let a find like Paul go. Though they knew the Harkonnen betrayal coming ('nothing for the father') so it's a wonder if they knew they were all going to die anyway.  Everything after Dune is damage control, they've failed in their 1000 year mission."

dune,23u3eg,banjist,1 point,Thu Apr 24 18:12:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah that was a strange bit, i wonder if RM was lying-she did say that noone had endured that much, so maybe Fenring outlasted it to some degree.  Or maybe not tested at all since he was useless to the genetic project."
dune,23u3eg,aDDnTN,2,Thu Apr 24 18:30:55 2014 UTC,How is Fienring tied into this?
dune,23u3eg,cheesemagic,3,Thu Apr 24 22:19:10 2014 UTC,"At the end of Dune Shaddam pulls out his final trump card; Fenring is a lifelong friend, as well as an assassin trained in the weirding way. He definitely has the potential to kill a weakened Paul, but doesn't, out of a sense of fraternity; Paul represents success where Fenring was a genetic dead end; to kill Paul would be to admit his own life had no purpose.   So he refuses to help Shaddam and damns the Corrino house in the process. But if he was genetically screened, its possible he endured the gom-jibbar same as Paul, another victim of the Bene Gesserit's scheme to control human evolution."
dune,23u3eg,dragonvulture,3,Thu Apr 24 22:44:36 2014 UTC,"Maybe Paul's test was meant to take it to the limit in hopes he would fail and disgrace/humble Jessica, while other potential male genetic lines were tested to some extent to ascertain the usefulness of continuing their lines in hopes of achieving something more Kwistazy."

dune,23nhtw,Luc-Pronounced_Luke,9,Tue Apr 22 03:56:54 2014 UTC,"One important substrate in Herbert's thinking is the movement known as General Semantics. It's out of favor these days, but it influenced a number of science fiction writers in various ways.  This is the system that brought us the phrase ""the map is not the territory.""  Herbert's preoccupation with the ways our languages can mislead us was also a major part of GS, and is probably the largest obvious influence, but in some sense wondering just how much humans could do without computers seems in the spirit of GS, too, though Herbert has his own take on the issue.   (Personally, I consider drugs like the spice a technology as much as a computer is.)"
dune,23nhtw,wmblathers,6,Tue Apr 22 12:38:43 2014 UTC,"As for the Litany, I've wondered if Herbert got that idea from the Vedas, Atharva Veda Samhita II.15:   As both the heaven and the earth do not fear, are not harmed, so, my breath, fear not. As both the day and the night do not fear etc. etc. As both the sun and the moon do not fear etc. etc. As both sacrament (bráhman) and dominion (kṣatrá) do not fear etc. etc. As both truth and untruth do not fear etc. etc. As both what is (bhūtá) and what is to be (bhávya) do not fear etc. etc.   I believe there are a few more similar such hymns in the Vedas."
dune,23nhtw,wmblathers,3,Tue Apr 22 14:34:56 2014 UTC,"Their name comes from the Jesuits. In the biographies of Herbert, it's consistent that his mother's sisters, a group of jesuit aunts, would try to get him alone and then force their faith on him with semantics and what he realized later in life were fallacious arguments, but in the situation you felt persuaded to truth.   The idea of scheming religious women undermining society in a parallel political structure survived into his novel of power and human relations. The stuff about the Voice was a fantastic exaggeration of the power some people have in debate to just overwhelm and control you and your responses."

The references to the ""Orange Catholic Bible"" which I took to be a futuristic new version of the current catholic bible suggested to me that the Bene Gesserit are basically ""Space Nuns""."
dune,23nhtw,GreggoryBasore,2,Tue Apr 29 13:23:02 2014 UTC,"Very much so, at least I picked up on it. I don't know of any phrases or attitudes that really back it up but here's what I picked up on.   The Empire(before Paul): Roman empire- Their own over confidence lead to their destruction.      Paul's Empire: a mix of Holy Roman empire and crusading nations wrapped into one.      Bene Tleilax: Muslim nations- mostly their attitude about outsiders and theocracy.      Bene Gesserit:The women/people throughout history that have held the real power while no one really knew.      Guild: Those who had boats and controlled the spice trade.      Leto II's empire I think now reaches into the future, it's a prediction that someday, possibly through the extortion of a priceless resource an empire will rise that dominates all of Earth."

Her definition of ""human"" resembles Nietzsche's Ubermensch, and the gom jabbar test (and the metaphor of the animal that weakens itself to escape pain versus the Human who endures pain to become stronger) resembles thought experiments commonly brought up in discussions of his work.  I can't say with any certainty that the similarities go deeper than that, or even that they're accurate to the extent I've described them: I only took intro-level philosophy, and that some years ago, but that comparison jumped to my mind immediately when we studied Nietzsche and hasn't left since."

A BG can be the secret spy, much like how the SS functioned. If they don't like you, you aren't seen the next day.  Furthermore, they spend time manipulating culture and religion to fit their own ideology.  This is shown in the first book, where Jessica talked about how the BG manipulated the local religion.  The Bene Gesserit only care about you if you serve as part of their plan, otherwise one can be discarded.   The feminist part is fairly obvious.  It's a society of all women, they're masters of sex, men only exist to breed more Bene Gesserit.  Gender equality is not there whatsoever."

A trait that was not shared by the BG as far as I can remember. I think thats why its so difficult for me to get the connection you draw between the two.

Obviously, Herbert didn't think highly of religion, which hold men in much higher esteem.  So then we see an all female faction that's exceedingly powerful, going to the extreme (note the word extreme) that men are just breeding cattle, and they they have infiltrated and subtlely modified every religion in such a way where they can channel the people's zeal to meet the BG's own ends.

The only exception being Road to Dune which is a collection of articles, letters, alternative chapters, etc. Road to Dune and Dreamer of Dune, a biography about Frank by his son Brian, are really only worth reading if you REALLY get into the series and want the full dirt.  tl;dr - dune, dune messiah, children of dune, god emperor of dune, heretics of dune, chapterhouse dune, and FUCK ABSOLUTELY ALL the other so called sequels and prequels. they are fucking awful."

Then wrote said canon into the sequels that were supposedly based on Frank's own notes. Despite the fact that the latter BH&KJA works contradicted the original books in several places. Even if they'd been excellently written, which they most assuredly are not, the flagrant cashing in and disrespect would be offensive."

It's fast paced, lots of cool gadgets, etc and the occasional deus ex machina to keep the plot moving.  The kind of scifi that is great when you want some mental fast food to read through.  The books by KJA and the son seem to want to be more that type of work, which is fine.  There are lots of places you could do that in the Dune Universe.  The two problems these works have is they cheapen the characters Frank Herbert wrote and they aren't that good at action either.  Regarding the character cheapening, mild spoiler since you've already played some of the games:  In Dune itself the Imperial family and the Atriedes have blood ties and both families are genetic contributors to the Bene Gesserit attempts to shorten the way.  Thus Emperor Shaddam IV is presented as being capable, whereas in the prequels he's more of a caricature of a lazy, entitled wastrel of an aristocrat that anyone with half a brain could depose."

The broader strokes of who the Enemy is I can see as something Frank envisioned, and I can imagine some pretty interesting discussions about philosophy, spirituality, humanity and politics that could have followed from that storyline with Frank at the helm. I have no hope that any of that will come from KJA, and the fact that the best things I've heard about these books basically boil down to the fact that they aren't as awful as they could have been doesn't make me very hopeful.

dune,23lmq5,Scytle,25,Tue Apr 22 11:56:17 2014 UTC,"Let me save you another round of heart break.  Dune ends when Frank died.  Period, the end.  Brian and Kevin's versions of dune are not worth it.  Imagine the most beautiful painting you have ever seen, now imagine someone takes some crayons and does their best to reproduce it.  Even if they do a really really really good job, they are still trying to recreate a master work with crayons.  They lack depth, they are like junk food, tasty but ultimately not filling.  They are high end fan fiction, they contain no gravitas, its full of robots and laser and all sorts of pulpy sci-fi cliches, they add nothing to the narrative, and only serve to dilute an amazing tale.   If you want more dune after Chapter house start over again with dune (its what I do, i read them in a constant cycle), or get the Pandora books, or EYE (collection of dune short stories), or really just read all of Frank's books, you will find little pieces of dune in all of them.    I can't recommend enough that you stay away from the Brain/Kevin books."

dune,23lmq5,wordplaya101,4,Tue Apr 22 13:05:35 2014 UTC,"I vehemently disagree on one point. The new expanded universe books do what their name implies. They expand the universe, they add to the story, as opposed to dilute it. admittedly they do not make art out of every sentence like Frank did. They read much like modern novels, and we do loose out in that regard. However, if you treat the EU novels like lore compilations, somewhat akin to the  silmarillion (Lotr fans forgive me) then they shed light on parts of the universe that the fans would not have seen otherwise.   I recommend that you give them a try if you are interested. Caveat lector: they are very different style, and have some canonical errors.  That being said, I enjoyed them and they sit on my shelf in a place of honor alongside the originals."

dune,23lmq5,Klinnea,3,Mon Apr 21 21:12:14 2014 UTC,"Agree, the house books were a fun romp in the dune universe.  The Butlerian Jihad trilogy was painful - I can't believe that I finished it."
dune,23lmq5,ulvok_coven,5,Tue Apr 22 13:43:42 2014 UTC,"I found the Butlerian Jihad books really, really dull. Probably because those books take place in a universe similar to Dune's but not quite--there's no Spacing Guild yet, no Bene Gesserit, etc. So the one thing that the Brian books had going for them, which is the opportunity to spend more time in this place, (for me, anyway, YMMV) is lacking.   I liked the House books. They were too simple, and they suffered from a lot of artificiality, but they were overall fun reads. It's just hard to get past some of the issues, like things that are great big game-changers with consequences for our characters take place, but in the Original Series, which take place in the future from the House books perspective, these huge events are never mentioned, never referred to...it's like they didn't happen! ;) (I am particularly bothered by the Kailea and Rhombur storylines--not to mention, the big-ass statue that supposedly stands in the harbor but is apparently gone a mere 15 years later. Not just gone, but utterly forgotten.) But still, if you just must have more time in the Dune universe, you will at least not feel as though you got bitchslapped by KJA and Brian Herbert after reading.  I would not go anywhere near the sequel books. Just awful. Horrible, horrible writing, meandering storylines that suddenly end and you're just sitting there like ""I stuck with this stupid-ass journey, and it ended like THAT?!""  So, to try to sum up: From my perspective, all of the non-Original Series books suck. However, I am not sorry I read the House books, although they are deeply flawed. I wish I had stayed away from the Sequels, and   the Butlerian Jihad books were just plain dull. Didn't even bother with the Interquels."
dune,23lmq5,cakes92,5,Mon Apr 21 23:00:27 2014 UTC,"So, if you like Dune, you like subtle characterization, precise language, convoluted and extremely dense plots, and thematic subtexts which bring together numerous facets of sociopolitical dialogue and criticism without leading you by the hand or soapboxing.  Brian Herbert likes robot villains and very early sci fi style. The characters are virtually indistinguishable, if he has a point he hands it to you, he retcons a whole lot and isn't subtle about it...  If Brian wasn't writing something with the word ""Dune"" on it, he'd be considered extremely weak but fairly readable sci fi. He definitely hits his stride in the Prelude where he can write whatever the fuck he wants, but the Jihad books are sick with attempts at writing something big and important, and the Dune 7 books are just yuck.  I would definitely suggest reading the synopsis of the Dune 7 books, because there's some stuff which makes a strong case for being Frank's ideas - there's an Honored Matre reveal and a Duncan Idaho reveal which after the fact seem to be totally obvious - while there's some stuff - robot supervillains and look, guys, more sandworms! fuck Leto! - which is pretty obviously not.  There's also the school of thought which says the cliffhanger is the best end possible for certain thematic reasons, which is a fun line of thinking.  As for the Prelude books, I'd pick those up for a quick read, just so you can see what you're 'missing.' The remainder aren't worth your time. There's too many great books in the world to waste time than a passing moment with him."

You've just gotta take it with a grain of salt, it never is nor will be Frank Herbert's Dune but I found it entertaining.

It is set in the far far future, where an artificial intelligence (Ship) has achieved the status and ability of a god and is trying to make the humans in its care realise their potential and be weaned from the care of Ship.  It poses the question of how they can achieve ""WorShip"" but will not give them any hint how to achieve its demand. It is an epic read, that will bear at least 3 or 4 readings.

This opinion might be anathema in this subreddit, but regardless, I suggest giving the Brian novels a try. For me, the later Frank Herbert novels were disappointing in and of themselves. ""Paul of Dune"" returns to a much-beloved timeline in the Dune universe and even though the writing is admittedly simpler, the novel is still a good read. From what I understand, the KJA/BH Dune sequels are much more hated than the prequels and the interquels. I suggest starting with the interquels (""Paul of Dune"", ""Winds of Dune"") first, as they compliment the main series.  In terms of similar high-concept, era-spanning science fiction series, perhaps turn to Asmiov's ""Foundation"" or Simmons's ""Hyperion""."

dune,233dwg,RonSnooder,10,Tue Apr 15 14:13:40 2014 UTC,Sounds like what you're looking for is the reading group at Jacurutu.  Forum is set up by chapter number and has header quotes and synopses for each chapter of Frank's Dune saga.
dune,233dwg,apjak,4,Tue Apr 15 14:44:09 2014 UTC,"This seems great, thank you!"
dune,233dwg,midgetlotterywinner,2,Tue Apr 15 14:47:13 2014 UTC,"That is really cool, thanks for the link.  I'm having a helluva time getting through Chapterhouse, which is weird because I read all the other books in the series in the amount of time it has taken me to get 60% of the way through this last one.  It's just tough to pick up some momentum on it."
dune,233dwg,apjak,3,Tue Apr 15 17:49:45 2014 UTC,"Understood.  There is so much internalizing in those last two, that it's easy to loose the story in the psychology and philosophies of the characters.  They, like Dune Messiah and God Emperor of Dune really improve in the second reading once you can place the mental worlds within the events as a whole."
dune,233dwg,sg_med_student,4,Tue Apr 15 18:02:23 2014 UTC,"I loveeee Chapterhouse. Sorry that it doesn't add anything to the conversation, but I just had to say it!"
dune,233dwg,lazy_troll2,9,Wed Apr 16 09:45:53 2014 UTC,"Why not start over? Dune is a book that you need to read a few times before you ""get"" everything anyway."
dune,233dwg,MortRouge,2,Tue Apr 15 14:32:53 2014 UTC,It should be read like the Qur'an/Bible/Torah.  Seriously.

dune,233dwg,MortRouge,3,Tue Apr 15 18:41:34 2014 UTC,But that's the interesting thing about Frank's writing style ... it is so convoluted and at times distant that you actually feel that it is a religious text. And then all the proverbs! I wonder to what extent he actually designed with that in mind?
dune,233dwg,Luc-Pronounced_Luke,1 point,Tue Apr 15 19:51:27 2014 UTC,Probably something as simple as making the series become more alive.

dune,233dwg,jdmf87,1 point,Thu Apr 17 09:47:18 2014 UTC,"This is what I came away thinking, too. I just finished it for the first time yesterday and I walked out of the text thinking I should have been reading it in a biblical hermanuetical style instead of a standard narrative style. The reader is expected to simply understand theFremen history, tradition, and lifestyle without any real exposition it seems, and I feel like I missed out on a great story because I was too busy getting frustrated at the missing exposition.   Maybe in a year I'll go back, devour the appendices, and then try again."
dune,233dwg,mkggm9,5,Sun Apr 20 17:13:05 2014 UTC,"Put it down and start over in a few years.   my first read through I was 14 and didn't understand anything. I was quite bored by the experience.   my second attempt I was 18. Comprehension was up, but not enough. Still struggled through it for a month. Status: bored.   round 3 took place at 22. Got half way through it before I gave up. In all fairness it was a rough time in my life and I was often distracted.   I'm 26 now and right in the middle of the book. I started all over and I am completely amazed by it. I just started it the other day and even with a full time job and a work out schedule that takes up almost 30 hours of my week, I'm flying through.   my opinion: Dune is a fantastic novel that takes some time, some maturity/experience on part of the reader, and requires a bit of attention. But it's so worth it."
dune,233dwg,macjoven,2,Tue Apr 15 16:14:31 2014 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. Put down, and give your mind a rest so that you can read the whole thing freshly at another time. I started reading Herbert's The Jesus Incident twice before finally getting through it a third time a few years later. Sometimes these things take time. Reading should be fun, especially something like Dune. There is absolutely no reason to brute yourself through it because you think you should or because everyone raves about it."
dune,233dwg,DoctorSlump,2,Tue Apr 15 21:56:00 2014 UTC,"I had the very same experience with Dan's Simmons Hyperion/Endymion. I couldn't get through even the first book, so I just stopped. Fast forward to 5 years later, and I'm done with all the books in a few weeks.  With Dune though, I had no problem finishing the original books when I was 16, but it's a state of mind, I guess."
dune,233dwg,dauntlessmath,5,Wed Apr 16 09:55:36 2014 UTC,"Herbert, though a great writer, is a difficult read, and he leaves a lot up to the reader to just figure out. Too much, sometimes, I think.   Most versions of the novel have a pretty in-depth appendix which helps when you read a word you don't recognize. It can be pretty tiring to read it like that the first time, but it is an option."
dune,233dwg,nahhan12,3,Tue Apr 15 14:48:50 2014 UTC,I love my kindle but this ^ makes reading Dune as a paperback much easier.
dune,233dwg,Shoninjv,2,Tue Apr 15 15:54:16 2014 UTC,"I'm exactly at the same part. I lobe this book and the Universe that I discovered playing Dune game on my old pc, back in the 90's. Then I saw the movie... Now I'm discovering the book.   I'm a big reader, and Dune is really interesting, it's the discovery of this universe, it's like being born. You don't know about the world but it exists already."
dune,233dwg,trabo,2,Tue Apr 15 16:10:04 2014 UTC,"I think it's normal to fade at times through a long series.  Take a break and don't hate yourself for it.  Pick it up and continue reading until you really decide you don't like it.  Some people just don't like it, and there's nothing wrong with that."
dune,233dwg,bugbitch,2,Wed Apr 16 03:23:33 2014 UTC,"I'd suggest putting it down for a while, and then maybe starting from the beginning, especially if you feel like you don't remember what's happened earlier.  It'll probably go faster the second time around.    I absolutely understand not feeling like you have enough time to read.  I'm also a student with a heavy course load and a lot of time-consuming readings for my courses that make it pretty hard to make time to read recreationally.  My solution (which may not work for you, so take it or leave it) is to wake up early, go to my school's dining hall, and take an hour to eat some oatmeal, drink some coffee, and read whatever novel I'm currently reading for fun.  If all your classes are super-early, or you're just not into reading complex books like Dune early in the morning, it might not be the solution for you.  But if you're like me, and enjoy having a little time in the morning to eat, drink coffee, and read a good book, it might work.  It doesn't take away from time that I'd normally be spending on coursework, and I find that it makes for a really pleasant start to my day.  Finding time to read is hard, and this is the best time I've found for it, personally.    Best of luck with it!"
dune,233dwg,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,2,Wed Apr 16 06:04:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this is exactly my situation. I wouldn't mind reading some early mornings before class, but as a journalism student I'm up and either reading some news(or trying to) or up and having breakfast with my girlfriend as we live together.  The problem is there are times when I really want to read it, because I remember some detail that makes me think ""Oh man that book was getting good"" or read something that reminds me of the setting or the spirituality or something and I think ""ohhh Dune, I should read that when I get home,"" and by the time I get home, something else has stirred up another story or book. I'm a huuuge bookslut :/"
dune,233dwg,oswaldcopperpot,2,Wed Apr 16 15:16:50 2014 UTC,"Honestly, you're best bet is to start over. I say that from an enjoyability perspective. I had something similar happen to me with Dune Messiah.  The stuff is dense, but the pacing is also very good once you get into a rhythm. Try starting over. There's a good chance it will feel new, or that you won't find it as taxing."
dune,233dwg,oswaldcopperpot,1 point,Thu Apr 17 01:15:34 2014 UTC,Its kinda like game of thrones. It's actually much more captivating when you know what's going on during a second viewing. Just re read it. 400 pages is like only 2-3 days if you are re reading.
dune,233dwg,oswaldcopperpot,1 point,Tue Apr 15 14:33:45 2014 UTC,"Because with my workload now 400 pages could take me like a month. I wouldn't really have a problem re-reading, in all honesty, but also something very descriptive and explanatory of the book/universe would be quite helpful in general even if I re-read it."
dune,233dwg,PictureofPoritrin,1 point,Tue Apr 15 14:41:28 2014 UTC,"I see. Personally, I wouldn't be able to read any book at that speed without completely losing track. I grew up on Stephen king though, so 300-600 pages a day was the speed i needed to get through those. You could try watching the two part sci fy movie. It's pretty close to the book."
dune,233dwg,oswaldcopperpot,1 point,Tue Apr 15 15:10:19 2014 UTC,"Judging from the general opinions of the miniseries and movie(s) and the reverence for the book, I think that would border on heresy. Plus I love reading more."
dune,233dwg,AFUTD,1 point,Tue Apr 15 15:41:56 2014 UTC,"The miniseries was ok. The movie was good but not too much like the book. The miniseries suffered from bad acting and had more of a stage feel with all the painted backdrops. William hurt / duke Leto was awful but the baron and Jessica were great. Seriously, the only answer here is just to reread from the start. If you just want to cliff notes the whole series just head over to Wikipedia."
dune,233dwg,siatabiri,2,Tue Apr 15 15:50:35 2014 UTC,"Ian McNeice was deliciously evil and scheming as the Baron, and Saskia Reeves was outstanding as Jessica.  Alice Krige did well with it in Children, but I didn't think she was as good in the role as Reeves."
dune,233dwg,Providing_the_Source,1 point,Tue Apr 15 22:48:49 2014 UTC,Feyd was pretty good too. I still preferred kyles Paul for some reason. He had more of the prodigy feel to him. I didnt see much chemistry between chani and Paul in the miniseries. I just realized there was a children film. I'll need to check that out.
dune,233dwg,GreggoryBasore,1 point,Thu Apr 17 12:33:33 2014 UTC,"I'd suggest waiting it out until your workload is less and then start again. Personally, when I was reading Dune I couldn't just stop mid-way, in the middle of a chapter, or even between chapters, because doing so would mean to get ""out of the zone"", so to speak, and I'd end up not understanding much of it. It's kind of like stream of consciousness.  Dune isn't something you want to half-understand and only kind-of enjoy. Wait it out, give it a year, read other stuff, and get back to it when you have the kind of time to put in 4-5 hours of reading every day."

dune,22yvho,covey,5,Mon Apr 14 01:35:29 2014 UTC,Ah too true its been years since iv read the original series i thought it was just hinted that they were face dancers. Its sad that we will never know how Dune was supposed to end but i enjoyed the extra books for what they were.
dune,22yvho,Kaneshadow,3,Mon Apr 14 01:42:32 2014 UTC,"ah nice thanks, i really wish we got to see where he was going with this. If the expanded books are indeed based on notes left by Frank maybe they took the independent face dancer idea and gave it to Khrone instead and reworked the Marty and Daniel back story to what we have now"
dune,22yvho,Hoeftybag,1 point,Mon Apr 14 01:58:05 2014 UTC,"Hahaha... In seriousness though I believe they had his notes.  I think each of the books contains like 1 note per hundred pages, and KJA just plied his trade on them."

dune,22yvho,stern93,8,Mon Apr 14 02:31:46 2014 UTC,"I agree with /u/JinxPutMaxInSpace that they're just supposed to be advanced Face Dancers created by the Tleilaxu in the scattering.  While it's theoretically possible that the Unknown Enemy the Honored Matres were running from were indeed thinking machines, I don't think they were in any way, shape, or form similar to what Brian & KJA gave us with Omnius and Erasmus - two of the flattest, most ridiculous caricatures I've ever seen put into a novel as ""main characters.""  Frank also would have come up with a better ending than 4 plot bailouts in a row to end the series.  At the end of Chapterhouse we have Murbella in charge of the BG, and Duncan, Sheeana, Miles, Scytale and the Jews on the no-ship.  Scytale's nullentropy capsules that Brian & KJA ran with with their ghola-fest in Hunters of Dune were, in my opinion, a red herring / a bargaining chip that Scytale would have tried to use, but that nobody on that ship would have been willing to accept.   Now Daniel and Marty - they see the true main character of the series, Duncan Idaho, on the ship and lament that he escaped them again.  Duncan is the one who can see the tachyon net that they cast, which leads me to believe he has some sort of higher level powers.  Maybe not quite Kwisatz Haderach level, but powers important enough that he is the only one capable of stopping Face Dancer domination/ascension.    Dune 7 should have been the no-ship's inhabitants (mainly Duncan) surmising this plot, then returning to warn the BG of this, since they were the only real political force left in the Imperium, eventually leading to a BG/HM combination force making a last stand against the Face Dancers and Futars. This is despite Duncan and Sheeana completely disagreeing with the path the sisterhood was on, they understand the threat to all of humanity.  With the way Frank wrote, it could have ended with the eradication of the entire political structure and another scattering/famine time event.  TL;DR basically what /u/JinxPutMaxInSpace said, but expanded a bit."

It was not a logical hate (Though there were logical reasons) - it was pure and uncompromising hate.   There is no way that any daughter of Duke Leto was going to be wed to Feyd.   Perhaps Jessica understood this and figured she'd just give Leto what he wanted because it really didn't matter. Not to mention that she felt the possibility of creating the KH a generation early. In a way perhaps she was trying to save the program it's inevitable failure.

With an Atreides son, there is no motivation to marry with House Harkonnen (heirs need to be male, so the daughter would have been married to the Harkonnen heir, binding together the two houses).  You also have to remember that the BG didn't just want to get a Kwisatz Haderach, they were behind-the-scenes politicians. Even if they were able to convince the Atreides to marry a subsequent daughter to the Harkonnen heir, the Harkonnen & Atreides ruling lines would still be split."

In Islam Iblis is a jinni who refused to bow to Adam (ʾĀdam). The primary characteristic of the Devil, besides hubris, is that he has no power other than the power to cast evil suggestions into the chests of men, women, and jinn, although the Quran does mention appointing jinn to assist those who are far from God in a general context.

And I would say to you that the Brian Herbert novels are seriously damaging to all the cool stuff in the Frank Herbert novels.  EDIT: I'd like to say why in particular I'm against Brian retconning stuff. When you've heard Dune a few times, you realize how very subtle and careful Herbert's writing is. For me at least, it's always better to err on the side of ""he meant to say nothing"" then it is ""he had an idea of what he wanted for this."" For the books as a thematic and philosophical whole, the things that are left out are important, as important as the things included. And so the Brian Herbert spinoffs jamming explanations in where none were indicated tends to disrupt the deep currents of Dune."

That applies to some of the acting performances as well as the actual art direction (though, as a theater guy, I do appreciate the deliberate use of painted backdrops). The dialogue can be dull sometimes as well, but I think that's more a result of the style of the book itself, and the difficulty of conveying characters' thought processes.  The script itself is a pretty accurate adaptation of the text, with any changes made serving to better tell the story over a miniseries format (heavier character arcs) and adjust for the era it's being told in (again, Irulan's increased presence)."

dune,226fs1,Al-Shamar2,9,Fri Apr 4 09:21:13 2014 UTC,"Could not find your particular reference -- or what enitnepres was pointing to -- and while I doubt that any of these are what you are looking for, I went too far down the rabbit hole to stop.  Dune (Chapter epigraph, p. 215 my version):   Muad'Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps teh choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us ""The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through  it, time becomes a narrow door."" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning ""That path leads ever down into stagnation."" - From ""Arrakis Awakening"" by the Princess Irulan   Dune (Chapter epipgragh, p. 271 my version):   Prophecy and prescience -- How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered question? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the ""wave form"" (as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife? - ""Private Reflections on Muad'Dib"" by the Princess Irulan   Dune (p. 288 in my version):   The prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealed -- at once as source of accuracy and meaningful error. A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.   Children of Dune:   ""Muad'Dib showed you two things: a certain future and an uncertain future. With full awareness, he confronted the ultimate uncertainty of the larger universe. He stepped off blindly from his position on this world. He showed us that men must do this always, choosing the uncertain instead of the certain."" His voice, Alia noted, took on a pleading tone at the end of this statement.   Chapterhouse: Dune (p. 128 my version):   As she spoke, Odrade sense the chasm beneath her, the nightmare hunter with the axe ever nearer. She wanted to sink into the nightmare, turning there to identify the one who stalked him, but dared not. That had been the mistake of the Kwisatz Haderach. You do not see the future, you create it.   Chapterhouse: Dune (p. 161 my version):   And I dare not use even my small prescience to guide us. I could lock our future into unchanging form. Muad'Dib and his Tyrant son did that and the Tyrant spent thirty-five hundred years extricating us.   Dune: House Corrino:   Humanity knows its own mortality and fears the stagnation of its heredity, but it does not know what course to take for salvation. This is the primary purpose of the Kwisatz Haderach breeding program, to change the direction of humankind in an unprecedented manner.   And, for good measure:  Prelude to Foundation by Isaac Asmiov:   You don't need to predict the future. Just choose a future -- a good future, a useful future -- and make the kind of prediction that will alter human emotions and reactions in such a way that the future you predicted will be brought about. Better to make a good future than predict a bad one."

dune,226a70,WoofWoofington,7,Fri Apr 4 07:13:55 2014 UTC,"Dreamer of Dune had a bit where Frank was teaching a cw class and he got some flack for the use of the Voice (calling it impossible). Frank responded that, just from looking at them (his class), asked them if they believed that he could pick out certain topics and through tone and pitch in his voice rouse them to anger. They agreed, and Frank said that was the basis for the Voice, trained and perfected over millenia.  The others, like the mentats, were based on his grandmother, who was a savant with math even unschooled. Even though the term didn't exist at the time, I wouldn't doubt if the basis for the human calculators were things like autism and math prodigies. People selectively bred and trained exclusively for thousands of generations, subtly manipulating and controlling human evolution.  Whether it would work or not is another thing, but Herbert posited a scenario where it did, and the piece is convincing enough to work for the story."
dune,226a70,Psyladine,4,Fri Apr 4 12:46:04 2014 UTC,"Take or leave this as you will, but since mentats and voice have been covered, I'd say different aspects of Esotericism and the Western Mystery tradition have some corollary.  I was struck in Children of Dune by Jessica's first exercises with Faradn with the hands.  It reminded me of some of my first basic Occult instruction.  I would say Occultism also pops up, although somewhat negatively, in the underlying principles of the Missionaria Protectiva, in its principle that religion can be reduced to a repeating set out symbols and psychic processes, which can be tailored to individual needs.  As a practitioner of Magick, I will readily say that the entire modern take on The Western Mysteries was summed up best by Herbert via Odrade with:  ""This is the awe-inspiring universe of magic: There are no atoms, only waves and motions all around. Here, you discard all belief in barriers to understanding. You put aside understanding itself. This universe cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be detected in any way by fixed perceptions. It is the ultimate void where no preordained screens occur upon which forms may be projected. You have only one awareness here —the screen of the magi: Imagination! Here, you learn what it is to be human. You are a creator of order, of beautiful shapes and systems, an organizer of chaos.""  Reading Crowley, Bardon, Fortune, Levi, all the way back to Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Appolonius of Tyana, you'll find no more or less has ever been claimed essentially by Occultists.  Granted, Occultism does tend to be tinged with various religious aspects, but modern Chaos Magick is secular, and involves some serious mental training (""Liber Null & Psychonaut"" Peter Carroll ). IMO, the best regimen of concentration and self-analysis exercises is put forward by Franz Bardon in ""Initiation Into Hermetics.""  The yogic practices of Hatha Yoga are intense (you'll spend 1-3 months learning to make your body shut up, before turning to your mind), and are outlined in Crowley's ""8 Lectures on Yoga.""  Voice has corrollaries to some forms of mentalism, and you might want to give Neuro linguistic programming a look for the same reason (you can do it yourself, don't let anyone sell you anything but books, and then sparingly, a lot of scammy stuff in NLP nowadays.)  Well, that's all the stuff of the top of my head, hope this helped.

I feel at once like reading it was something I should have done long ago, but also something I wouldn't have even come close to fully appreciating, had I done so in the past.   I would like to note one parallel to Dune-style mind training. Since ancient times, there has been the Art of Memory, where people train their minds and use imagery to enhance their recall. People in pre-modern times who were so trained were able to recall a lot. Sort of related, might be people in societies who memorized entire epics and huffaz (singular hafiz) people who have memorized the entire Quran. Training people in such techniques would probably be helpful to the Bene Gesserit, for the purposes of the Missionaria Protectiva, by allowing legends to be transmitted for centuries, if not millennia.   While obviously good for Mentats, I would be surprised if Bene Gesserit also used similar memory skills in order to maintain their mental registries of different individuals, and stuff like that.   The Art of Memory has also become a part of Western occult/esoteric practice.

dune,221kt4,rtubbs,27,Wed Apr 2 20:36:38 2014 UTC,"For my part, the movie commits two big sins. The first is the use of voice-powered ""weirding modules"" which are related to nothing in the books and which are just kind of bizarre. The second is the magic rain at the very end.  The first sin I learned to forgive. Somewhere years ago I read an article or something in which it was explained that the movie invented the idea of ""weirding modules"" specifically to avoid turning the whole thing into a kung-fu movie. In the books, the ""weirding way"" — which became a core part of the Fremen way of fighting during Paul's jihad — was basically a martial art. And while the books do a very good job of glossing over that aspect of it, if the movie had been faithful to that aspect of the story, it totally would've been more or less cinematic kung-fu. Which, I think, would've looked really silly on screen.  Now, Lynch didn't have to invent the weirding modules for his screenplay. He could've just skipped over that aspect entirely and instead depicted the Fremen as brutal killers in the ordinary way. But instead, he created the weirding modules to give the alliance of the Atreides (meaning Paul and Jessica, really) and the Fremen something special, something decisive. And I'm like … okay, all right, I'll give you that one. I see where you're coming from, Mr. Lynch, and I'll grant you that one on good faith.  But I think I'm saying something non-controversial when I assert that the climactic rainstorm was just stupid. Again, I see where Lynch was coming from. The whole film has been set in this desert, and what better way to depict the good guys winning than to make it rain? Okay, fine. But it just didn't make any sense. If you don't know anything about the books, then you're just seeing this character apparently making it rain in the desert by sheer force of will … which is as deus- a deus-ex-machina as anything you'd care to name. And if you do know anything about the books, you know that making it rain on Arrakis would literally destroy human civilization, because it would kill the worms and shut down the flow of spice.  But despite the movie's flaws, I still think it's a great piece of cinema for one reason and one reason only: The production design. Every visual aspect of the film is just gorgeous, from the costumes to the sets to the casting. If you can set aside the dicier aspects of the screenplay, Lynch's movie is a fantastic adaptation of the book. It captures the mood and tone of the thing pretty much perfectly.  Also: Atreides battle pugs. As far as I'm concerned, the Atreides battle pugs are totally canon."
dune,221kt4,sqig,7,Wed Apr 2 20:51:00 2014 UTC,"Which, I think, would've looked really silly on screen.   One of Herbert's largest failings is the problem of sheilds and lasguns. Specifically, that you cannot avoid shields being hit in large scale combat, and the sub atomic blasts these cause.  Never mind the weaponising of this as a practical tactic: suicide charge or sniping your own man when he's engaged in close combat..."
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,11,Wed Apr 2 21:47:09 2014 UTC,"If I remember right, Herbert described the interaction of a shield and a lasgun as being totally unpredictable, anything from pop-pop-sizzle to planetary annihilation. That made it impossible to weaponize.  But of course we all know the real reason for shield-lasgun interaction is that Herbert didn't want to write about laser-gun battles. So he tweaked his world building such that that kind of stuff was ruled out."

dune,221kt4,sodimcdodi,4,Thu Apr 3 00:16:27 2014 UTC,This also has always bothered me. The weakness of a shield to a lasgun is catastrophic as to make use of a shield in the first place completely unreasonable. This kind of weapon imbalance doesn't make sense; it's not very harmonious.
dune,221kt4,generaltsao,3,Thu Apr 3 03:22:42 2014 UTC,"Well. No. The shield makes completely invulnerable to anything but a slow knife. All conventional ordinance, explosives, even a swinging sword can't penetrate the shield which is also nearly weightless. Also remember that it has been this way for a very very long time so what we thing of as conventional weapons like firearms or cannons are as outmoded as bows and crossbows are to us. Could they still be useful in the right circumstance? Yes. But most soldiers will never bothered being trained with them because most of the time they are useless."
dune,221kt4,Orphanleni,4,Thu Apr 3 11:16:23 2014 UTC,"You misunderstood me. The ability of shield to provide protection from a knife is completely lost to the fact that a lasgun will kill everybody. Tell me, would you use a body shield if just one enemy shot just one shot at you, you and your entire troop is dead.  No, you wouldn't wear a ""shield"" that could kill your entire troop, it does not make you invulnerable, as the lasgun reaction is basically nuclear.  It makes the idea of shields ridiculous. Would you wear an item that is one bullet away from going atomic? No way."
dune,221kt4,generaltsao,4,Thu Apr 3 12:03:25 2014 UTC,I suppose the idea is to use it in close-quarters only. To prevent getting your head chopped if in the event you are cornered.
dune,221kt4,generaltsao,4,Thu Apr 3 12:20:21 2014 UTC,"But they still use it to protect the entire house, relying only on the inability to differentiate between atomics and lasgun reactions to protect them. Hey, I love Dune. Love it, but this is... absurd. Would you rest easy if you and your entire family are only alive because you don't think your worst enemy (who is in cahoots with the Emperor) won't have the balls to risk doing a NON-ILLEGAL mass murder with lasguns and shields only because it will resemble a nuclear attack?  They do this even AFTER Duke Leto learns of lasgun shipments to Arrakis. At this point, the use a house shield is dangerously irresponsible. Unfathomable, really. Beyond logic.  Why not just give the family atomics over to prove you can't do it, then you're in the clear."
dune,221kt4,Dhritarashtra,1 point,Thu Apr 3 12:24:45 2014 UTC,"Because it would be seen exactly as an atomic attack, which would led to the oblitaration of the house responsible of it."
dune,221kt4,Orphanleni,3,Wed Apr 9 22:09:31 2014 UTC,Mutually assured destruction. It is roughly analogous to the Cold War where if one side used a nuclear weapon the other would as well. Because of the fact that both sides CAN do it means neither side will. And also that not using a shield means you are just as susceptible to a lazgun as you would be if you weren't wearing a shield but now your enemy has zero reason NOT to use a lazgun.   But really it is just a literary tool to make it so these backwater Fremen can affect a battle involving a modern army.  I like the fact that Herbert is basically saying that Lazgun and really all other military technology is so advanced that it has become nearly useless to do battle with and only act as a deterrent because of the mutually assured destruction
dune,221kt4,generaltsao,4,Thu Apr 3 12:28:32 2014 UTC,"It is not mutually assured destruction, it's more like 1 person sacrifices themselves to destroy the entire other side. That is not mutual. Hell, it doesn't even take that. A house shield is stationary, so just place a timed mechanism on a lasgun pointing at the house shield.   I am not battle planner, but I think I just invalidated your concept of mutual destruction  (this applies mostly to Arrakis, where the Atriedes insisted on using a house shield despite knowing Harkonnen agents were in the area and had lasguns.  And while we're here, anybody want to offer a reason that no guard was near the Duke when Yueh did his dirty deed? He's clearly all alone, well that's strange and by strange I mean so stupid as to strain credibility, but hey, I'll allow it. The story is great)"
dune,221kt4,Orphanleni,5,Thu Apr 3 12:31:11 2014 UTC,"Well until WAY later in the timeline we don't know how big those explosions will be on either end. We only know that neither faction would want it. But again still stands my point that 1 person with a lasgun could destroy an entire platoon, legion, whatever if the weren't wearing shields.  The lasgun is a horrific weapon in its own right. It has gone out of fashion only because of shields. Though I see your point I still think I would take the shield (obviously not on Arrakis) over nothing because if I'm going to die by lasgun at lease I will have my revenge.  Also any timer and/or targeting system worth a damnedest would have long ago been banned by the Butlerian Jihad. A clockwork timer could work but you would have to be very lucky.   The house shield is weird because we don't know if the size or power of the shield makes a difference in the lasgun/shield interaction.  But if the tone were any indicator the resulting explosion would threaten everything on Arrakis. But certainly destroy the only city with supplies like water for your troops. So not a great idea to go blowing it up."
dune,221kt4,ellohir,2,Thu Apr 3 12:50:39 2014 UTC,"After the fear of being completely anihilated, the humans decided two things:  No more thinking machines. No more mass destruction weapons. Including lazgun-shield effects.  Being on the verge of extinction does that to a culture."
dune,221kt4,generaltsao,3,Thu Apr 3 16:48:26 2014 UTC,"That's not cannon. The lazgun-shield effect is not referred to as illegal at all. They treat it as a very dangerous consequence of inadvisable usage of a lazgun and/or shield.  The concern is that the shield explosion resembles an atomic blast, which is illegal, however, it is not clear why one could not make a compelling case for the truth if in fact no atomics are used."
dune,221kt4,ellohir,2,Thu Apr 3 16:58:22 2014 UTC,"I didn't talk about legality, but as what is widely considered acceptable and what not. Nobody cares about Rabban killing fighter slaves or kids, as abhorrent as that may look. But pseudo-atomic is going too far, and everyone knows who's enemy to who.  Atomic use is punished with global atomic attack on the home planet and considered a perfectly reasonable rule. Being sneaky about it isn't going to work when destroying a planet capital.  But that's just my explanation though xD"
dune,221kt4,Joomes,2,Thu Apr 3 17:08:51 2014 UTC,"Actually in the original series the reaction you get is pretty pot-luck. It can produce a pseudo-nuclear effect based around the person wearing the shield, it can do basically nothing and make a tiny explosion, or it could do exactly the same thing to the person wielding the lazgun. It's not consistent."
dune,221kt4,LiterallyCarlSagan,5,Thu May 15 21:10:20 2014 UTC,"The Great Convention forbid the use of atomics in battle.  Also, it is mentioned somewhere in the book that the explosion made by a lasgun beam hitting a shield would kill both the attacker and the attacked."
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,5,Wed Apr 2 22:03:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah the problem is las guns that hit the holtzmann field shields causes a sub atomic explosion. It ranges and this danger is what (in Herberts imagination) prompted a return to the martial discipline of knives and close quarters combat.  The problem being that, while individuals might be sane enough to follow that protocol (the same way soldiers today would likely not shoot at a pressurized air tank), battlefield conditions make orderly avoidance of shields and lasgun detonations inevitable.   If anything the convention would have banned the shields. Suicide attacks are not unknown or uncommon in the dune universe. It's a phenomenon that is unaddressed and frankly is a gaping logical hole."
dune,221kt4,infinity526,8,Wed Apr 2 22:07:57 2014 UTC,"Battlefield conditions didn't cause issues though, because off of Arrakis nobody used lasguns in battle. They were only used on Arrakis because it was well known that shields called the worms, so nobody used those."
dune,221kt4,Jicks24,2,Thu Apr 3 05:53:48 2014 UTC,I felt that way as well. Weren't disputes between great houses settled with espionage and assassination? NOT all out war due to war being seen as wasteful.
dune,221kt4,infinity526,3,Fri Apr 4 11:24:18 2014 UTC,Yes.
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,2,Fri Apr 4 16:19:42 2014 UTC,"That's completely innane that people would not use the best weapons available. In a society that uses suicide attacks, lasgun/shield explosions become the defacto tactic."
dune,221kt4,aDDnTN,4,Thu Apr 3 13:01:39 2014 UTC,"I felt like Herbert never considered using the lasgun-holzman effect as an effective weapon.  Suicidal warriors or turrets on timers, would have been effective."
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,3,Thu Apr 3 13:43:03 2014 UTC,"I think the technology frustrated him; he wanted it to work but he didn't want people dependent on it (this is a theme echoed in his own lifestyle as well as his books).  For instance the Spice is called the driver of the universe, when more appropriately the Holtzmann engines are, but the weird prohibitions on computers creates an imbalance that a naturally occurring resource fills.  Likewise the shields means a return to the feudal terms of combat-knives and martial discipline, with a convenient hand waving of high tech weapons.  Even the harknonnen secret came down to ancient artillery used anachronistically along with the oldest tricks in the book. The much vaunted house atomics never even make a presence, just an implied threat against spice reserves (though frankly the Fremen relations with the Guild should have ensured a large enough store to prevent a temporary shortage from Paul's little insurrection, in the same way the Harkonnens had a store of spice on Geidi Prime.)  I get what Herbert was going for; Dune's a melting pot of so much material (much to conflate and hide what I believe is the core of his story), a few cracks aren't going to break a million word saga (never mind what was to come later).  edit: totes wrong on those atomics."
dune,221kt4,betaray,6,Thu Apr 3 14:04:15 2014 UTC,The much vaunted house atomics never even make a presence   They were used to breach the Shield Wall.

dune,221kt4,aDDnTN,1 point,Thu Apr 3 16:53:00 2014 UTC,"HM engines, shields and gravlifts have been around for so long they are commonplace, nothing special. Not unique and made in numerous places. The spice has only ever come from one place, cannot be learned or cultivated anywhere else, and is entirely necessary to maintain the empire.  He who controls the spice, controls the universe.  PS: you can read more about the creation of the hm effect in the heretical butlerian jihad novels by the abomination, aka Brian Herbert."
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,3,Thu Apr 3 17:24:16 2014 UTC,"Chicken & the Egg; how was folding space down before the Spice? Banning calculators meant Mentats, banning nav computers meant guild navigators? You could say Arrakis was a barren desert world whose discovery made the transition from computer navigation feasible, but it's a bit like a feudal society that doesn't believe in circuits running a power plant, isn't it?  The holtzman engines drive space commerce, issues of fuel are never addressed, but given house atomics and the advanced state of technology, nuclear power or fission/fusion doesn't seem out of place. But the navigation itself is bizarre in its redundancy."
dune,221kt4,aDDnTN,2,Thu Apr 3 17:29:59 2014 UTC,"Shields weren't banned on arrakis. it was just very unwise to use one most of the time, because it would summon every worm within 100 miles."

dune,221kt4,sqig,5,Thu Apr 3 14:00:42 2014 UTC,"I have to admit, I LOVED the pugs. I was thinking to myself during those scenes...""If the Atriedes DID have canine companions...i suppose they WOULD be pugs.""  Like I said, I think the problem was that it was an acid trip for those who haven't read the books, and at the same time had aspects that felt like betrayal to the original source material.  But the movie LOOKED great, Arrakis looked fantastic. And to be honest, the more I think about it, this movie was probably the BEST you were gonna get for 1984. other than director choices (like the rain and such), not much could have been changed to make it any closer to the book (except maybe making the story a little more coherent).  It's too bad, because I think in 2014, we have the capabilities to make a GREAT Dune movie (even though I think we would be better off making a Dune series, like Game of Thrones)."
dune,221kt4,realfinkployd,1 point,Wed Apr 2 21:10:35 2014 UTC,"Have you seen the Dune miniseries Syfy made some years ago? I think the consensus — certainly my opinion — is that while it was considerably more faithful to the book, it just ended up being kinda crappy. The production design was incredibly cheap, the visual effects were weak, the performances — despite hiring some strong actors — weren't up to snuff, and so on. So we have an adaptation that wasn't extremely faithful that looks gorgeous, and an adaptation that was extremely faithful that ended up being kinda disappointing."
dune,221kt4,tzneetch,11,Wed Apr 2 21:20:12 2014 UTC,"I mostly enjoyed it, the primary thing that hurt it for me was the hats.  Good god, the hats."

I just can't watch another sound stage with a painted backdrop/green screen without turning it off. Much better adaptation of the source material, but the execution leaves much to be desired"
dune,221kt4,sqig,1 point,Thu Apr 3 17:27:05 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen it so I can't say for sure, but from what I've read it was a small project, right?   Game of Thrones/Walking Dead style shows have taken a style that allows effects and story to be of good quality (most of the time).   I would need to watch the series to form an actual opinion, but I feel like a Dune series, chopped up so that it has enough time to explain itself, would be more successful that a Hollywood film (unless this film was of adequate length, and the longer it gets, the more certain audiences are turned off)."
dune,221kt4,insidiom,5,Wed Apr 2 21:47:42 2014 UTC,"It was pretty low-budget, as I recall.  I think the overriding problem with adapting Dune is that the story becomes increasingly cerebral and un-filmable as it goes on. The first book has a relatively conventional story, then the second and third become increasingly conspiratorial and convoluted. Then you get a 3,500-year time skip and you're thrown into God Emperor half of which essentially takes place in Leto's head.  The second trilogy is more conventional, with the Matres carrying out their war of extermination and Teg and Duncan as point-of-view characters, but then comes the graphic sex, and it ends on a cliffhanger.  There's a reason Game of Thrones adapts well to the screen. It's because Martin spent years as a TV writer. The Dune books aren't written like a prose screenplay. They're much harder to adapt."
dune,221kt4,iceph03nix,1 point,Wed Apr 2 22:19:02 2014 UTC,"Well, if a network such as HBO were to pick up a potential Dune series, I think censorship wouldn't be TOO much of an issue. Budget and Censorship wouldn't be a problem I think.   But you're right as far as plot and plot length. It would just get harder and harder to keep the story coherent. Its just a shame that the series has largely been left to gather dust, for the most part."

dune,221kt4,mattcolville,2,Thu Apr 3 01:23:56 2014 UTC,I'm just saying that there's little holding a good Dune series back other than the nature of the series itself.
dune,221kt4,sqig,3,Thu Apr 3 02:20:12 2014 UTC,"I think everything you say here is fair and on point.  There are some who take their critique of the 84 movie a little too far, IMO, and I think that yours just cuts right to it.  There are a few other things (Screaming Baron, etc...) but these two points stick out to me the most.    If I could stomach the new series for more than 30 minutes, I might feel differently about it - but I keep thinking that after five minutes, I'll be starting a new level in The Battle for Arrakis.

dune,221kt4,poisonandtheremedy,2,Mon Apr 7 14:22:10 2014 UTC,Patrick Stewart is awesome. But...  Man... My Halleck was so much better. He was... super relaxed but always prepped for murder. His instrument was more compact and he had it slung around him. He was like a cowboy. Like a... Mathew Mcwhatever kinda guy.   His poetry wasn't forced. It was casually said. Almost in song but casually said yet always respected.  They went too hardcore on Gurney in my opinion and wasted Patrick Stewart as he would HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT FUCKING MENTAT -- THUFIR. Just my two cents. I could write a book on that movie and my perception on it.
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,11,Thu Apr 3 04:03:57 2014 UTC,"Frank Herbert just sort of glosses over the fact that the Bene Gesserit, in addition to everything else they do, have their own near-superhuman martial art.  Lady Jessica masters Stilgar in an instant and Stilgar is a Naib, which means by definition he is among the best fighters on Arrakis and the Fremen are shown being the most lethal fighters in the Imperium. And Jessica smokes him.   When you put that in a movie, it's going to look weird (wait, Francesca Annis is also a lethal killer?) and it's a distraction (wait, the Bene Gesserit are the greatest fighters in the galaxy?) that strains credulity.  So the wierding modules, while coming out of left field, are at least comprehensible and something the audience can hang their hat on while the plot plays out.   The explanation for why the Emperor want to rid himself of the Atreides is never well-explained in either book or movie. Duke Leto is well-liked and has a cadre of fighters he's trained within a hair's breadth of the Saudukar. That's an idea, it's not easy to show. It has to be explained and audiences don't like having things explained to them.  I think it could be done, but it would take a lot of set-up. You need to establish that the Emperor's power comes from the Saudukar, and then show them, and show Duke Leto's men being their equals."
dune,221kt4,poisonandtheremedy,4,Wed Apr 2 21:34:40 2014 UTC,"This is why I think a series would be better. Focused, prepared episodes with enough time to express a story would work better I think than a singular film. One stab at explaining the story would be riskier than explaining it in segments.  Although I do admit that a show would be difficult to sell if not just for the type if novel Dune is.  No matter how a fan looks at it, to someone who is not immediately into sci-fi or fantasy, the content looks weird. It takes time for some people to understand and appreciate it. A show would have a difficult type staying true to a series while maintaining an attractive look."
dune,221kt4,Psyladine,3,Wed Apr 2 21:53:23 2014 UTC,"And if you want to establish that the Emperor's power comes from the Saudukar, you have to somehow touch on the fact of Salusa Secundus and its brutality, and how the Saudukar are the product of their environment, and how the Fremen in turn are the product of theirs, and … yeah. It's all so very cerebral. Great in a book, harder in a movie."
dune,221kt4,ElCrowing,3,Thu Apr 3 04:14:02 2014 UTC,"The explanation for why the Emperor want to rid himself of the Atreides is never well-explained in either book or movie.   Not implicitly, but Thufir posits a calculation to Harknonnen that the reason is Leto's men (being trained in the Weirding Way) were growing close to Sarduakar level of fighting ability, hence a political threat. The Harkonnens were being seen as vile but useful pawns to do the Emperor's dirty work; this feeds into Vladimir's discussion with the 'killer rabbit' and his own machinations of political power.  It does seem strange the Bene Gesserit would need martial power given their knowledge and use of The Voice, and even more disturbingly that Lady Jessica was allowed to sire Paul at all, and that she was passing along that secret information to the Atreides family...well, why doesn't everybody? It's one of those unexplored consequences."

Sheeanna and Duncan escaping into the great unknown and out of reach of ""Daniel"" and ""Marty"" represents the story and characters truly escaping the ultimate prescience: the author and editor. It gives a very fitting and literary conclusion to a story whose central themes are control, foresight, and the pitfalls thereof."

dune,21x4vc,smpm,2,Tue Apr 1 17:01:44 2014 UTC,I think it was a tribute to his wife as the whole book was. I also wonder if he knew he wouldn't be able to write another book so he just placed himself and his wife in the world that was a grand part of his life.   It was not so much breaking the 4th wall and kinda plot device to help Duncan with attack on the Junction as much as translation of the entity into the book.  The afterword of the book made me think all these things.
dune,21x4vc,HughMankind,2,Fri Apr 4 06:57:58 2014 UTC,Does it say how far back the Face Dancers have been in control? Probably sometime after the Scattering? (I know in Dune 7 they're like fucking robots or some shit but let's pretend that never happened)

dune,21x4vc,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,4,Thu Apr 17 03:07:17 2014 UTC,"●I ...kind of liked 7 & 8, but I still feel that Daniel and Marty were supposed to be face dancers. I wonder if maybe Frank was heading toward face dancers who got so lost in the personality of their mark that they forgot they were face dancers. I think having someone realize they're a face dancer and then use that ability to fight the Tleilaxu, or the other face dancers, would have been interesting.   ●I don't think the Jews were a cop out, but they did come out of nowhere for me. I dont see any reason the Bene Geserit would have any problems with them, as they mostly keep to themselves. Especially considering the fact that they agreed to help each other. The BG want to shape humanity, but they're also all about power. Having knowledge of the existence of a group of people who wish to remain anonymous gives you alot of leverage with them.   ●I don't think that FH would have introduced Scytale's null entropy capsule without a reason, but I dont see him bringing back nearly as many people as they did in 7 and 8. Maybe Paul, because hes the obvious choice if you're bringing back someone to help you prevent the end of the universe. And Paul would probably want Chani, possibly even Thufir and Leto I. But BH and KJA brought back EVERYBODY, and I feel like that cheapened the idea of bringing back anyone at all.   ●I dont think that Miles Teg was a KH, I think what we saw with him was just a manifestation of his Atreides genes. Much in the same way that they allowed Lucilla (I think) detect threats to the Sisterhood via limited prescience.  Of course, she WAS Teg's daughter..."
dune,21x4vc,desertsail912,2,Tue Apr 1 19:19:52 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure M & D knew they were face dancers b/c they have a discussion about the Master on Duncan's ship, one of them says ""Always whistling at us, always making it necessary to stomp them down.

But some of the others could have ""forgotten"" what they were. For instance, the fd that replaced the high priest seemed to be getting really into character so to speak, and I just thought it would have been a really interesting way to go with it. Frank spent alot of time talking about what it means to be human. I could totally see him taking a face dancer through some sort of existential crisis after finding out hes not who or even what he thought he was. What makes a person a human being and not an animal? Our experiences or our DNA? If the experiences he remembers aren't really his, does that make him less human than if they were?"

For #2, I seem to recall hearing about a fan asking Frank about the Jews, or maybe his wife was Jewish descent, so he got them in there.  For #3 Scytale does have those genes but I sincerely doubt Frank would have had them all put in axlotl tanks. I picture him (Scytale) trying to use them as leverage.  For #4, I personally think Miles would have been instrumental against whatever was forcing the people from the scattering (honored matres, etc.) back to the ""homeworlds.""  Oh, and for the ending, I don't hate it... more frustrated that I'll never get to hear how it really ended and I really don't trust Brian's continuation b/c it doesn't sync with the original six books."

I read the first few pages of House Atreides and... Not so hot. It straddles the line between poor imitation and outright baring no resemblance to Frank's style of writing. Plus they made Paul join the circus? Wtf?  I just wish they would release Frank's notes on Dune 7 so we'd have some idea as to where he wanted to take the series."

dune,21x4vc,Psyladine,5,Tue Apr 1 14:28:44 2014 UTC,"Of course there's the theory that there never were any notes and that BH/KJA just made up everything from their books on their own. I think that's probably got some truth to it, though I think some of the ideas may have indeed been Frank's - it's just a little too tidy and spiteful, serves only to legitimize the wall we've put up between Dune 1-6 and the rest, and the only ""evidence"" is the books being (arguably) bad and contradictory - and as a writer I can tell you that will be true of a lot of ideas that you go through in the notes stage of something that big."
dune,21x4vc,smpm,2,Tue Apr 1 20:54:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah in truth all I have to go on is Brian's analogy in Dreamer of Dune that he came across the box in a shed years after his father passed away, and that material prompted his prequel/sequel/out of the fucking blue yonder series.  I suppose we'll never know, though with Frank's copious habits regarding notes & research (by his own admission), I would not be surprised if there were cabinets full. Certainly the draft material that composes Spice Planet came from somewhere (itself worth the price of Road to Dune as a look into the mind of Herbert's first conception of the story that would grow into Dune)."

However! Frank does mention that the tleilax have been in contact with the scattering for a long time - this could be the infiltration point for the FDs and then when the tleilax planets are destroyed they are the only ones left after. Well he brought the jews in because the whole series was about Islam and Christianity with barely a mention of Jewish influence, a lot of words are loosely based on the islamic language and taken directly from as well. To me it felt like a cop out, ""Oh we've been hiding behind the scenes since earth! oooOOOOOoooo"" They magically have their own 'no-ship' and follow jewish tradition as it was on Terra (earth right?). Honestly with FH bringing duncan back all the effing time I don't see any problem with BH and KJH bringing them all back, I mean why not? The Tleilaxu have the DNA from every major character in the books and that apparently everyone in the universe looks like an Atreides and has their DNA. I mean even Miles Teg is a copy of The Red Duke. Miles, hmm - dunno. I really liked him and his powers though. Seemed like Frank just had to make some other kind of kwisatz haderach that wasn't some human worm god thing. He had limited prescience so maybe he's just an evolved form of kwisatz that can live within the non-prescient times (meaning everyone is atreides and prescience can no longer work)"
dune,21x4vc,desertsail912,2,Tue Apr 1 17:22:26 2014 UTC,"What interested me is that the Jews were in direct or indirect contact with the Bene Gesserit for awhile. The BG have been tailoring the human race for quite some time, so the fact that they permitted Judaism to persist in an underground fashion is... I don't know. Weird? Out of character? I just wonder if Frank was actually going somewhere with them, or if as you mentioned they simply existed to fill in the last gap in representing monotheism."

There are the six original dune novels by Frank Herbert. Then we have the expanded universe by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson.    Read it all. It is all good stuff on its own merit but if you begin to compare you will certainly be disappointed.    The original series will make reading the expansion all the better.

IMO, it's more of a vague pass leading out of the ""vast valley of death"" the KH and his children saw in humanities future. Maybe Paul could see some of the ""direction"" the path would take, couldn't handle it, and that's why he decided to abdicate.  Did leto see his own death from the beginning? imo, likely, but it didn't matter because his death was one of the steps on the golden path. Or perhaps he did, and was unable to see past that?

dune,21lfdl,schleppylundo,6,Fri Mar 28 15:25:14 2014 UTC,"It's important to note that the B.G. plans didn't seek a prescient leader, simply a male who was capable of becoming a Reverend Mother with access to both male and female genetic memories - R.M.s up until Alia (and then, I believe, only later in life rather than as preborn) could only use direct female lineage, Muad'Dib and his children had the ability to look back on first-hand experiences of all human history. This race memory, and other B.G. techniques, is probably the most fantastical element of Dune.  My interpretation of how this becomes prescience: His Mentat training, presented with tens of thousands of years of human knowledge and experience, allows him to see clearly the patterns of history that will repeat themselves, in various forms, depending on the choices he makes. The Spice, meanwhile, enhances awareness of those memories and data analyses and combines them into the Oracular Vision. Paul's prophecies are most often described in the context of a hallucinogenic trip, which suggests that maybe the mind is not designed to handle the combination of analysis and memory which Paul has access to. His Mentat and Bene Gesserit training, again, combine here to allow interpretation of these visions.  There are still a few things that do not fit: before Arrakis he had no data or memories that could lead him to envision the existence of Chani, and yet he dreams of her while still on Caladan. But then I'm not sure anyone but Frank will ever know the explanations for everything in the series."

I don't think the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad were ever monitored by a central authority. They were akin to the racial memories that the God Emperor set out to create. They were a lesson from history that was so vivid that nobody could forget them and that all helped to police. It was similar to the Great Family atomics and 'rule' of retaliation that all 'understood.' There was no Landsraad rule that all signed on to, it was just an unspoken understanding, ""we aren't going there.""  So then, after the reign of the God Emperor, not only was nobody monitoring that but it is almost a given that somewhere, someone is going to go down that road again. That is fine though, that is why the God Emperor did what he did. Even something as terrible as the thinking machines cannot be a threat to humanity after The Scattering."

dune,21ev0w,Generic123,3,Wed Mar 26 18:22:46 2014 UTC,"I see the development of the machines that were used after the Scattering ""crowded the proscriptions of the Jihad"", like Moneo's memocorder, but had a hugely essential difference, in that the machines still needed humans to function properly.      The important clause in the Jihad was the ""thinking"" condition.  Self-awareness (and therefore independence of action) was the lesson that Humanity was taught to avoid in their bones by the Jihad.  SPOILERS POSSIBLE If you look carefully at all instances of machines in the latter canon, they are augmentations to human abilities that are not deemed to break the golden rule that ""Mankind must not be replaced"", like the Ixian Navigation Machines or the Command Collar that Teg used in the final battle in Chapterhouse, these are good examples.  The Navigation Machine was not entirely trusted and was usually used in conjunction with a Navigator from the Guild (""You see, we do not absolutely require your spice"").  The Collar was just an augmentation unit for Teg to make command of battle easier; there was no machine self-awareness in that either.      I completely agree with u/CheapTennisShoes in that there was no centralised Jihad Police (well, before Leto II, anyway), there was no need with the lesson so deep in Humanity's bones, and that the Scattering was the ultimate safety plan for the future, just in case there was anything that he could not foresee in the time that he was willing to look forward to."

dune,21cfr9,mcvoid1,12,Tue Mar 25 19:04:16 2014 UTC,"Is it a way to subvert prescience thought up by the conspiracy? How would it do that?   It is used partially because it had become fashionable at the time to seek the future (populaces emulate the power base.) The flooding of the universe with spice makes this possible as everyone who uses it heavily has a tiny pearl of prescience in them (an example of this is the shared consciousness in the spice orgies.)  It is also used by the conspiracy to muddle Paul's vision.   How it works: Remember that it is suggested that the prescient possibly create rather than see the future? The more forces at work ""creating futures"" the more possibilities there are for Paul to sift through and try and bring into his control. Until Leto is born he is the most powerful prescient in existence and able to keep a measure of muddy yet strong control.  When Leto comes, he and his future golden path is powerful enough that it takes prescient power away from everyone, including Paul, because no being will ever be powerful enough to oppose his will (or create a significant future) for thousands of years."

dune,21cfr9,GhostdudePCptnAlbino,1 point,Wed Mar 26 05:33:17 2014 UTC,"I think you're right expect for the idea that the general population has some prescience. The tarot cards are a form of ""prescience"" in that they become a self-fulfilling prophecy; just as Paul becomes locked into his prescient view, normal people (no Atreides-style prescient power) are locked into whatever future the cards create for them. Constantly creating these new futures muddled the future for Paul."
dune,21cfr9,StashTheBashar,3,Sat Apr 26 15:25:04 2014 UTC,"This is one of a few questions I still have. Herbert is not explicit about the answer to this. Someone with a deeper understanding might have a better answer just based on things we learn elsewhere in the books. I'm not confident that I perfectly understand prescience the way Herbert did.  I believe that there is an element of conspiracy to it. Some outside actors know or suspect that the cards will have an effect on the Atreides and so they introduce or otherwise encourage their use.  It is the case that the Fremen are 'closer' to prescience than the average population, that it runs in their genes. Herbert talks about that in a number of places and so the fog could be attributed to that.  I think the bulk of the effect on the Atreides is due to the random nature of the cards coupled with the stock people place in the outcome of a shuffle. The only thing that confuses me about that answer is their use by the BG RM... it would seem she should be above that 'game.' Unless Herbert is getting really subtle there and giving her a motive for their use separate from the more common one; she might be using them as a meditation tool as some are said to use the I Ching. That seems a stretch of an inference though.  I've never been entirely comfortable with the tarot either. I still think I'm missing something."

I suspect it will be an unpopular opinion but I have to admit I'm glad this movie was not made. I don't think I will see this documentary either.  I've seen a lot of derivative work and I've not cared for a single bit of it. The simple artwork and the tattoos and such, those I understand. The more a person's own opinions or visions weigh in on the derivative work, the more resentful I am of it. For me, these books stand on their own. They are a complete work. They need no introduction and no postmortem. They need no gilding or embellishment.  I'm ashamed to say, I don't even feel guilty over being closed-minded on this topic. I've suddenly developed a certain sympathy for other varieties of fundamentalists or fan(atic)s.  It could be that after several dozens reads there are still passages I feel I don't entirely understand. Maybe I think it is too soon to add to them when I haven't even 'finished' them. I'm honestly not sure though... I can see how I react to derivative works but I'm not entirely sure of my own, underlying thoughts.  At the very least, I'm willing to live and let live on it. I understand why people want to read more books set in this universe. I appreciate that they are inspiring works to many. I'm just still in a contemplative stage I guess. After all of these years I'm not ready to entertain another vision of them when my own understanding is incomplete.  I'm aware this all seems faintly religious. I'm not comfortable with that either but here I am, still reading them, finishing one and reading the next, basically non-stop, like some monk in a cell or a Rabbi contemplating the Torah."

I've tried; they feel like empty husks.  There is something precious and immortal about Frank Herbert's Dune series. Jodorowski is not attempting to recreate the books. He used the first one in a way which I would not have believed possible: he kept the essence of the universe, of the world, and made it his own. Jodorowski's Dune is inspired by Frank Herbert's Dune. It is not Dune. It is not even something which pretends to be Dune, or aspires to be Dune. It is unique. Jodorowski brought together HR Giger, Chris Foss and Jean ""Mœbius"" Giraud, who are giants of the visual art in their own mind, gave them a world and let them roam free.  In any case: I'm not trying to convince you. As I said, I understand your position. I just wanted to say that I came into the documentary very close-minded as well, thinking I was going to feel good about the fact that it never happened; and in fact I came out of the movie theater with the opposite feeling."

dune,20rkwh,stupidpuppyface,11,Wed Mar 19 06:06:34 2014 UTC,Yeah I liked the movie.   To watch it as a adaptation of the DUNE story its good. If you are looking for the books translated to the screen then of course they are awful.  But ya know what?  I have the range enough to like both.
dune,20rkwh,insidiom,-1,Wed Mar 19 06:09:49 2014 UTC,"If it adapts the story to film the story should be there. The story of Dune is about the failures in following a Hero/messiah. Paul is unable to save his father, he is unable to prevent his terrible purpose. The desire for a hero/messiah leads the universe into bloodshed and war. That film makes him a bringer of peace and miracles. In this way you can not argue it adapts the story of Dune. It simply has the same setting,."
dune,20rkwh,MortRouge,5,Wed Mar 19 06:18:55 2014 UTC,That's cool dude.  I like the film.
dune,20rkwh,mpierre,-6,Wed Mar 19 06:30:35 2014 UTC,i like the first 30 mins of it.
dune,20rkwh,MortRouge,3,Wed Mar 19 06:35:48 2014 UTC,"This is about the first book. In the first book, he actually is the hero, and the messiah symbolism is everywhere. As a translation of the first book's path for Paul, it's where it should be. In Dune I, there really wasn't much explicit shadowing of what there was to come. That came with Dune Messiah and certainly with GEoD."

By this point, you would expect them to act effectively as a government, taxing the populations of the planets and engaging in trade.  It's unclear when this transition occurred, but it is likely to have been during or after the rule of the God Emperor. Before this point it is unclear where they were headquartered, and whether they had even one sovereign planet to their name (or, more likely, held secretly). Before this transition it is likely that they acted more as a non-governmental organisation, without such influence/control over planets and armies. At this time they would easily have been able to support this by educating rich girls from influential families, acting as political advisors, and potentially trading in secrets."

dune,20j3k4,dauntlessmath,1 point,Sun Mar 16 06:06:57 2014 UTC,"I agree that it would be a worse adaptation, since Jodorowsky planned on taking a lot of liberties with the story, but I think it would still be a great movie in it's own right (albeit very weird/inaccessible).  Based on his other work, I can see Jodorowsky doing a good job with the messianic and environmental themes. I imagine the sietch orgy and water of life scenes (among others) would be crazy visual-wise and the Giedi Prime scenes would actually show the Harkonnens as the evil dudes they are."
dune,20j3k4,Womar23,2,Sun Mar 16 06:52:56 2014 UTC,"Not only do I think a Jodorowsky Dune would be a poor adaptation of Dune, it would most likely keep an actual adaptation from being filmed any time soon, if ever. Jodorowsky failed on his first attempt, perhaps it all just went wrong, but perhaps he never had what it took to pull that kind of project off. Lynch has done some amazing things, but he failed to make a Dune movie that lives up to the potential. Jodorowsky may not be really into making a Dune movie, but his own thing, and that's fine, but not so far as it keeps a proper Dune from being made. Besides, the promise of his take on Dune wasnt his alone, it was all the people who came together wanting to see it happen, and that may not happen again, and if it does, it may be just as mismanaged."
dune,20j3k4,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,2,Sun Mar 16 10:20:36 2014 UTC,"I agree with your first point. Jodorowsky makes extremely inaccessible movies that are filled with inappropriate nudity and shallow pseudo-philosophy. If he was involved in a Dune adaptation, it would poison the brand for a real adaptation for years to come (just like Lynch and Sci-fi Channel have done, but worse). I would much prefer for Netflix, HBO, or the BBC to acquire the rights and make something decent that honors the source material (like a multi-season miniseries that does one book per season like Game of Thrones)."
dune,20j3k4,dauntlessmath,1 point,Sun Mar 16 20:10:23 2014 UTC,"I think your approach may work if done right, but so may a feature film. The Devils in the details and all that. I think something along the lines of the old Steven King miniseries may be right lengthwise. If things are drawn out too much pacing will go, and it'll turn into melodrama. I actually think AMC may be the right channel to do this. Writing wise, I would really like Terry Goodkind to be brought on board, at least as an advisor. His books kind of jumped the shark IMO, that's always a risk in trauma writing, but his being influenced by Herbert and his talent make me want to see him on the team, if hed be interested."

dune,20aqag,aDDnTN,1 point,Thu Mar 20 07:21:40 2014 UTC,"I actually really liked Paul of Dune. Maybe because it was the first book in the Duniverse that I read,  but I enjoyed it, and it got me started on the rest of the series. Haven't read the other two heroes books yet, because I'm still trying to convince my library to pick them up as ebooks, and I don't wanna spend any money on them if I don't have to.   Hunters and Sandworms were OK. There was actually one plot twist that I didn't see coming, which surprised me of itself, but the ending was every bit as disappointing as I read it would be. Three deus ex machina twists to end such an epic body of work? Quite the let down.   I haven't read the jihad series yet, was waiting for my library to pick up the first one in ebook, but they only have the last two, so I just bought it on Google play a week or so ago. I started reading Sisters while I was waiting, but couldn't get into it until almost halfway through. I've been reading it for a month now. Most of the others took me less than a week.   The House books were OK, especially the last two. House Atreides was kind of boring, but worth reading so you know what's going on in the next ones. Also, I did enjoy reading about the Old Duke Paulus."

Read the damn books.

Herbert's first novel in the series, 1965's Dune, is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time,  and it is sometimes cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history.    In Dune, the planet is the home of the Fremen (Zensunni wanderers),  and subsequently is the Imperial Capital of the Atreides Empire.  Arrakis is the third planet orbiting the star Canopus,  and it in turn is orbited by two moons, one of which has the image of the desert kangaroo mouse, Muad'Dib, on it; the other moon possesses the image of a human hand.

We are used to books to the story spanning long periods of time and talking about many characters; God Emperor, despite covering about 25 years in the main story, seems to be, IMO, the story of the last couple of weeks of Leto II.  Of course, if you look at it from his perspective, being millions of years old in the head and thousands of years old in body, it is that long.  It is also a much more personal book, I feel...it portrays, very well, the sameness and repetition/depersonalisation that such a long-lived being must feel, having seen it all before. It is also the perfect bridge and scene setter for the post-Scattering times, where, because of Let's actions, humanity's survival is assured."

dune,202zd3,Thooorin,18,Mon Mar 10 22:30:00 2014 UTC,"Definitely God Emperor.  Leto II is probably my favorite monarch/autocrat in all fiction. He's ruthless, yet you can tell that he's deeply concerned with the well being of his species. He's the greatest human who ever lived, but was only able to achieve that state by giving up his very humanity. Everyone who even tries to combat him is just trounced by his guile and cunning, and yet his plans (within plans, within plans) are working for their benefit too. He's playing 3-dimensional chess on a cosmic board, they're scratching tic-tac-toe in the dirt."

dune,202zd3,joevaded,1 point,Tue Mar 11 03:14:04 2014 UTC,My thoughts exactly. I have read it at least five times. Leto is such a complex character.
dune,202zd3,joevaded,13,Tue Mar 11 14:52:57 2014 UTC,"My favorite book in the series is Dune. (Book 1). The characters are so well introduced, that by the end of the book you feel like you know them personally. I remember reading all the dialogues with Piter and while reading them, wondering ""When's the next time I get to hear from this snarky, snide, psychopath!?"" Or when I was introduced to Baron Harkonnen, it was terrible and horrific the image that was portrayed of him in my mind. Each character was so unique, and their dialogue so different that it gave each person a personality that was distinct from one another. I also like the unknowing of why/what Paul is or needs to be doing on Arrakis. My favorite moment in the book is when Paul realizes he's ""So much more"" and ""Something unexpected"" than what the Bene Gesserit had planned. I, as the reader, didn't know what that meant exactly, but it urged me so desperately to find 0ut.  Some other highlights:  -The betrayal of Yueh   -Duke's Death  -Hawat's capture  -Paul's first kill  -Paul's acceptance in the Freeman Community  -Liet-Kynes' plan  The first book set the stage for the series. It showed us the importance of Paul. The need for a savior on Arrakis. It explains the situation on Arrakis, and uses imagery to make you feel like you're a bystander on the dry dessert planet. It starts out a bit slower, but that's all the better in this book as it slowly draws you in, answering all the questions you have, filling in the blanks piece by piece. Without the incredible details and explanations in Book 1, I feel that the other books would not have the same impact on the reader. Book 1 was a masterpiece, written in the best possible way to start off the story of Arrakis. This is why I hold Book 1 in the highest regard."

dune,202zd3,kengou,10,Mon Mar 10 23:02:26 2014 UTC,"Thinking about it, I suppose that Dune Messiah is my favorite of the novels.  Rather than writing about the Jihad, Herbert simply takes it as a given and moves directly into the endgame of Paul's reign.  In doing so, he deliberately sidesteps the warmongering and obsession with combat that permeates so much of the scifi genre, and instead chooses to write a novel about having absolute authority.    Don't get me wrong, I love all the six Dune novels, but part of me will always love Paul best when he tells Chani that ""Even an Emperor has his favorite clothing."""
dune,202zd3,DruePhoenix,5,Tue Mar 11 00:38:03 2014 UTC,"toss up between the original.... simply because it's the original, or Children because it is an emotional powerhouse"
dune,202zd3,The_Dirty_Carl,3,Mon Mar 10 22:19:23 2014 UTC,"I'm trying to decide and it's really difficult... I love all 6 books.  Let me talk through it.  Ok. Chapterhouse is definitely not my favorite - barely anything happens in it, and it ends unresolved.  I love the political philosophy in it and the battle at the end was neat.  Still, while good, not the best.  Messiah is great, but really is just a lead-in for Children, so it's not really a favorite either.  I love Heretics - God Emperor left me with intense curiosity about the effect of Leto II's reign, and this book explores that in depth.  It also has Miles ""The Flash"" Teg, and really cool battle scenes.  Good action, good philosophy.   God Emperor is, of course, a philosophical masterpiece, it really is the lynchpin mid-point of the story, that holds it together and gives it all meaning.  This is very tempting to choose as my overall favorite.  Children of Dune is a nice compromise between the adventure of Dune and the philosophy and implications of God Emperor.  Leto's new skin makes him a fun superhero for the last portion of the book, and the plot is really good.  I can't really find a fault in it.  Dune... the original.  As a self-contained story, Dune is probably the best in pace and as an introduction to the universe.  Good plot, nice action, great philosophy... again, can't find any fault to it.    Overall, I think I have to narrow it down to God Emperor and Heretics.  Both books really need the other to make their full impact.  And I don't know if I can choose one or the other."

Now, that's just my recollection of it, maybe I'm forgetting some things. I liked the political philosophy (especially the idea that power attracts the corruptible, that was brilliant. very Platonic ideas) but it's probably my least favorite of the series."

It would still be great without any sequels and is completely self contained. In my mind there is Dune and then the Dune series after it.   My favorite of the series, is Children of Dune. The level of plotting in CoD sets the benchmark for plotting in the rest of the books. Also Leto's out maneuvering of everyone as well as his merging with the sandworm is just awesome!"
dune,202zd3,Seanatronic,1 point,Wed Mar 12 20:16:14 2014 UTC,"The first book was great, and I think it will always stand alone better as its own story, but I really wanted to read more about Paul's time with the Fremen before he became emperror. Messiah was an entirely different pace, but still interesting.   Children was really good, and had a lot of memorable moments for me, such as. *SPOILERS * the mother/father game Leto and Chani played, and their struggle with abomination and other memory. Plus Paul and Leto's conversation about the golden path, Leto's time in Jacarutu, and Leto's exploits after he got the sand trout. */SPOILERS *   God Emperror was almost like a completely different universe because of how seperated it was from the first books,  but I was hooked, and all of Leto's conversations were really fun to read. Even if I did have to reread some of them to understand what he was saying. I think I may actually be leaning towards   Heretics as my favorite, if for no other reason than Miles Teg and his story.  But there were a lot of interesting things that I really enjoyed,  like *SPOILERS * the back and forth between the Sisterhood and the Tleilaxu about the great belief, with Taraza and Odrade trying to convince them that they were on the same side. Plus the scene where Odrade found Sietch Tabr and the message from Leto is incredibly creepy and expertly written. */SPOILERS * Chapterhouse was to Heretics what Messiah was to the first book, in my opinion. A great book and well worth the read, but it felt more like the middle part of a much larger story. I really wish we could have seen Frank's ending to the story, because I feel like it would've blown our minds.

For example, Paul marrying Irulan is what legally made him emperor, whereas a son of Shaddam's would've kept control of the Imperium in the Corino family. Alternately, if Jessica's first child had been a girl instead of Paul, as intended by the Bene Gesserit, the next step would've been marriage to Feyd-Rautha (I believe) and one consequence other than the true Kwisatz Haderach would've been a marriage alliance that gave the Harkonnens control over Atreides holdings."

dune,200ijt,five_hammers_hamming,7,Mon Mar 10 02:06:35 2014 UTC,"Messiah is my favorite (although I am rereading GEoD so that might change my views as I missed a lot the first read through) so I'll defend it.    It felt like exposition all the way up to when the nuke went off, which, I take it, was the climax. There didn't seem to be any indications that a freaking nuke would be involved until it had exploded; nothing comes to mind for me as having been foreshadowing or whatever.   except for that time when we hear from Farok the Fremen that Scytale visits that stoneburners destroyed his sons eyes (page 55). I don't want to look for it but I believe the conspiracy members also talk about using a stoneburner on Paul.   That fucking cloud cuckoolander dwarf. Dafuq? And why did it take Paul until the last few dozen pages to have him/it killed? You can see the future, Paul; this creep is clearly bad news even to a non-prescient person (or animal :P) like me.   Bijaz had the name of everyone involved in the conspiracy. Paul need to take him to acquire the names of the traitors. Also the Dwarf was blocked from prescient vision as Paul could not see the Dwarf specifically but could see that he acquired the names (page 232)   The story seemed internally disconnected in a very bad way. What world-building is accomplished in it seems to me to be done by smashing it into the reader's face, not to mention how the new features added to the world (Tleilaxu, et al.) are of such magnitude in the world that they should have featured in the original book, making their absence from such and lack of origin story in the interrim between books suspicious to say the least.   The Tleilaxu are mentioned in Dune as the source of piter de vries (The Baron's twisted Mentat) conditioning. I don't know what else you're hung up on but it was all there (the Jihad, Guild, house Corrino, the sisterhood)   It was poor in the feature that made Dune so enjoyable for me: mental processes. Paul damn near couldn't see any future at all in that book until he got his eyes melted, and those sort of highly mental moments like when Leto says something to Paul with coded language during a dinner party in the first book are absent as far as I remember.   ""Stilgar,"" Alia said fighting to hold him, ""You stand in a valley between dunes. I stand on the crest. I see where you do not see. And, among other things, I see mountains which conceal the distances"" (page 121). In addition there is too much political wheeling and dealing to cite from the book but everyone has plans within plans.   Bringing back a not-quite Duncan Idaho comes out of fucking nowhere. It bugs me. There was no indication that anything special happened to his body until Hayt's introduction, when it suddenly becomes necessary that something special had been done with his body. It still seems like a completely random thing for some Harkonnen and/or imperial troops to do to collect this one dude's body and have it made into a mentat.   again reread Dune. Duncan Idaho was the greatest swords master to live and a valuable asset. It makes sense that the Sardaukar would want him on their side to train recruits being at the point of Dune house Atreides had troops on par with them (implying that ghola's memories can be revived) baring that he's a great bartering chip among the powers at be anyways.   Maybe I just missed a lot of details. I read it months ago, and read primarily before going to sleep. What is there to enjoy in this book?   The humanization and fall of Paul Atreides"

This basically tells me that I'm never going to enjoy this book because it's a book about stuff I don't find appealing.   That's kind of the point of Messiah in a nutshell though. It's meant to show that Paul for all his heroic attributes falls short of being a perfect leader and hero in general. He's suppose to be older and jaded to his roles and duties as a superman. that's what makes Leto's sacrifice at the end of Children so much more meaningful and his character in God Emperor more insightful. Leto II had the capacity to go the extra mile Paul never did.  I think Cortseam said it best with    Dune is the classic hero story, showing the rise of the slightly special child to godlike, superhuman status. It was necessary to establish the world and setting that delivers FH's intended message: don't put all your faith in heroes.

The problem is that Dune is so amazingly well done as a fairly straight forward hero story, that when he spends the next few books destroying and deconstructing such stories it makes people somewhat confused and upset. It is simply not what is expected after reading Dune. It is like if someone wrote a Cinderella sequal which centered around a socialist revolution in the kingdom, and Cinderella became a radical feminist and killed the prince then tried to take power for herself only to be killed by bunny rabbit freedom fighters who were in turn eaten by the big bad wolf who was her son enchanted by the fairy god mother to keep him from the throne etc. There is definitely a sense of ""wait what?!"" about the Dune sequels the first time you read them, which is overcome by peoples belief that it must get better because Dune was so awesome. They do, but they are completely different in style and what they are trying to get at from Dune. So hang in there or don't it is alright."

dune,1zubdx,CyFus,17,Fri Mar 7 21:41:40 2014 UTC,"For all the weird that Lynch added in his adaptation of the story, I remember (I think it was in the foreword to ""Road to Dune"") Frank Herbert said that Lynch's vision of the Dune Universe very closely matched the mental images that Frank himself had of Dune.  Herbert talked of how closely he worked with Lynch, and how he was amazed that Lynch could evoke a feudal society just by the use of uniforms, for example.  He also said about the regrettably necessary addition of the Weirding Module, since the blurring moves of the Weirding Way were beyond the cinematic capabilities of the time, and neither he nor Lynch wanted to have a 'kung fu' style movie. The only bit that Herbert disagreed with, but admitted was necessary for the film was the ending - he said that Paul was a man playing at being a God, not a god who could make it rain.  It would have been a massively longer, more expensive movie if Lynch had tried to make it word for word.    So, for my two pennies worth...Some of the touches in the film are Lynch in all his splendid weirdness: heart plugs, drug-supplying cats, shaved heads, blood showers, Patrick Stewart going into battle holding a chihuhua; the film itself is, of course, not the Dune story we know and love, but I feel that if it could be considered on its own merits it would be a 'good' film.  It has an epic cast (with the possible exception of Sting!), beautiful cinematography and good production values.

Above all, it is a film made by David Lynch, whose style is, to say the least, unconventional and, again, neither everyone's cup of tea nor the most easily accessible; sort of like Marmite, you either like it or hate it - each viewpoint IS equally valid :-)"

The only think that can be said more-or-less objectively is that the quality and depth of the writing is nowhere near that of the books by Frank Herbert, and that the new books can't be considered canon. I don't think anyone would deny that.   Now as for me, personally, I would say: If you're really interested in reading an interpretation of some of the events and history of the Duniverse, and you can treat the new books as a separate entity from Frank Herbert's original series, then there's absolutely no reason not to read them. I actually liked them, but only because I treat them as an interesting, but separate take on the Duniverse. I treat them kinda like fanfiction (and the level of writing is really getting towards that sort of sphere at times in them =D ) - in fact that's exactly how I treat them - like an unofficial fanfiction.   Some people seem to have the idea that reading bad books written by the author's son will spoil the whole series for them, even the original ones, like it'll poison their mind or something -- which I really never understood -- and those people are more likely to tell you to avoid them at all costs.  But hey, if you can treat them as separate from the originals, and you're genuinely curious, you'll be wasting nothing but your time even if it turns out you hate them. And you might, like me, find you enjoy reading one interpretation of the other big events in the Duniverse. =D"

If you enjoy them, all well and good - Don't let the opinion of others put you off :-)      Waxing a little pseud for a mo, Frank sort of said it himself: ""Here lies a fallen god, his fall was not a small one; we did but build his pedestal, a narrow and a tall one""  IMO His was a VERY VERY hard act to follow."

TBH I liked the way the Bene Gesserit came about - that made sense in the larger story as a whole; I liked the way the proto-Guild was almost the ONLY way that humanity managed to beat the Thinking Machines; both of these explanations made quite a lot of sense in explaining where their political power in the canon Dune novels came from.  I think that my mistake was to expect storytellers of equivalent talent to FH taking up the mantle.  IMO one of the talents that FH had that his successors don't is in the 'what is not said is as important as what is said' way.  It is not necessary to know where the Bene Gesserit came from, for example, to appreciate their impact on the Imperium (although it is satisfying); it does not make the canon story any better to know the origins of the Bene Tleilax, or the Guild, or any of the other structures in the story.  And that, apart from the lesser talent, is my major issue.  BH et al have tried to fill every single minute not recorded in the canon books with theirs, and, in my opinion, this has made their efforts fall short."
dune,1zueyb,StashTheBashar,1 point,Sat Mar 8 15:57:42 2014 UTC,"Hi there,  have to intercede here; two bits. The first is Herbert's own philosophy in design; the idea that the most sprawling and ornate elements of his setting are the sparsest in detail. In an interview he talked about his reasoning for that; in things like The Guild, he knew the less detail he projected over them, the more mysterious and vacuous an organisation they would be, and the reader (being curious types) would fill it in with their imaginations. THis echoes one of Steven King's adages about Terror being the most effective fright; it uses the imagination of the reader against them-when a character goes to a banging cellar door, in that moment of hand on turning knob, nothing can be more terrifying than the haunting image around the mind's corner.  So most of what made Frank's work grand was what he didn't write.  Second bit, and this is more 'behind the curtain' than anything, is a famous theory of Ernest Hemingways, known as the Iceberg theory; that the 10% you show is evidence to the reader of the 90% below the waterline-just because it is invisible does not make it less real. So allusions, elliptical references and presence (referrals within a narrative) make something real insofar as it needs to be. How much, for example, did you need Piter and Vladimir to reminisce on kanly for you to get the idea? So much of the story is 'in media res', motions set long before the characters lived, because the intriguing stuff is not the rivalry's start, but its dramatic conclusion.  Most people prefer the dam being blown up, not construction engineers buying supplies for eight months to set up the detonation. Writing is the same way-by exploring the depth of something, you steal both its dramatic energy, and in a way cheat yourself of the only truism in written prose: the power of the mind creates something far realer and far more intense than any media can provide."

dune,1zlzzr,dallyho4,3,Wed Mar 5 08:01:12 2014 UTC,"I think it's just a crazy complicated chemical compound that would require a ridiculous number of steps to synthesise non-organically. There are plenty of chemicals today that we get from genetically modifying bacteria. Given that the Tleilaxu gene-tech is all human based, it might not be too much of a leap to think that no-one has the right sort of gene-tech to figure out exactly how the spice is created organically, and get other organisms to make it for them with the same ease that we would probably do something like that today (we're VERY good at getting things to make proteins for us now).  Chemical reactions won't release anywhere near enough energy for nucleosynthesis. Plenty of chemical reactions are explosive, so I'm not sure where the allusion comes.  In more direct response to your question:  1) yeah, violent chemical reactions often create stable compounds. CO2, for example, is a pretty stable compound, and burning methane in oxygen can be pretty damn explosive. H20 is also pretty stable chemically, and you can make it in an explosive reaction.  2) That's a hard one, as we just don't know what the reaction pathway looks like. Often there are multiple reactions that can lead to the same 'end-compound', and different reaction routes as well. It's not impossible that there is a non-explosive reaction pathway to making the spice.  In reaction the Tleilaxu question, it seems unlikely that they would want to blow up their ""axlotl tanks"" to produce the spice, although it's not impossible. They may well have found a chemical pathway that is non-explosive.  The compounds would be unlikely to be manufactured atom by atom. If this is even possible at all for chemical compounds, it still seems as if it would be much more difficult to do it this way than to do a stepwise synthesis from starting chemicals, as you would do today to produce the compound you want (unless you were getting organisms to make it for you. Even then though, the basic principles of starting with chemicals and reacting them together in a controlled way until you get an end product are the same as standard chemistry; it just so happens that for certain chemicals that organisms have evolved to make already, they're a lot more efficient at it than us using lab equipment)."
dune,1zlzzr,Joomes,1 point,Wed Mar 5 11:18:30 2014 UTC,"I meant allusion in a literary sense. Elements heavier than iron can be formed in fusion but instead form form the pressure or otherwise violent conditions after the a supernova event. Paralleling the ""spice blow"": sandtrout entrap water into a big pre-spice mass which they use to feed and grow. When the internal pressure of the gases are too much, the mass explodes. Only in that explosive event can melange or the constituents of melange form.   I understand for nucleosynthesis, it's not the same process at all, even conceptually, since for a supernova (at least type II) it's imploding core -> shockwave -> supernova as outer layers are expelled. Hence a literary allusion of some substance, some unobtainium that only arises in specific conditions that are difficult to replicate such as the formation of heavy elements.  However, wouldn't such an expensive substance (a suitcase enough to buy a whole planet) warrant intense research by just about everyone in the imperium, which is freaking huge as it is? Yea, there's a ban on computers (well, I'd say AI more than just mere machines, but that's up for debate)."
dune,1zlzzr,Joomes,1 point,Wed Mar 5 22:56:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still not seeing the literary allusion here. It's a bit of a leap. I mean I can kiiind of see where you're coming from, but it just doesn't seem likely to me that it's intentional on the author's part.  Indeed it would. However, it's implied to be an incredibly complex, and huge, compound that is formed by a multitude of sequential steps. Even with equipment and analyses available to us today, it can be pretty hard to identify complicated molecules, and the implication is that it is much more complicated, chemically, than basically anything else we've ever come across. Without access to computers (and I agree, it's difficult to tell exactly what they mean by computers, but for the sake of argument I'm assuming that they don't have access to programming as computationally 'smart' as what we have), the task of identification and replication is made orders of magnitude more difficult.  And you have to remember that although the imperium is massive, it's run very feudally, with a very small 'middle class' and very very few aristocrats. Combine this with an explicit aversion to quick advancement of knowledge (I think it's mentioned in God Emperor that it has long been an intentional policy to stunt scientific growth in order that the ruling class can control any technological advancement and maintain the political status quo), and the observation that in thousands of years of difference, the difference in technology level is less than you could reasonably expect to occur over the next hundred years in our own world, and you have conditions in which you wouldn't expect them to be able to fully identify (let alone recreate) the spice formula for a very very long time."
dune,1zlzzr,smell_B_J_not_LBJ,5,Thu Mar 6 13:41:13 2014 UTC,"There is one good answer already, but I will add my piece as well.  From my understanding, spice melange is not a single compound (like a pharmaceutical drug) but rather instead a complex natural product that consists of many different chemical entities.  This is analogous to natural petroleum, which is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons and Herbert makes it clear that spice is supposed to symbolize petroleum, among other things.  In any event the sum of the parts is greater than the whole and it is seems that certain isolated compounds (ie amal) may be toxic.  Therefore, harvesting natural spice is the best method of production for much of the history of Dune's universe.   Another fact that complicates the synthesis of spice melange is that that organisms which synthesize it have an alien biochemistry.  It is alluded that the worms and sandtrout are actually silicon-based life-forms which are radically different from the carbon-based life originating from Earth.  In this sense, it is a happy accident that spice actually interacts with human biochemistry in the first place.  This fact makes it difficult to manipulate carbon-based life to produce spice (ie through traditional genetic engineering).  The Tileilaxu eventually engineer a solution, but it is only after thousands of years of research."

If I'm not mistaken the largest sandworms known were up to a nearly kilometer in length.  Graboids were perhaps a 10-20 meters at best?    From the Dune Wiki:  ""Many things commonly associated with Arrakis are surrounded in myth and mystery, and the sandworms are no exception. Some people believe that worms from 700 to even 1000 meters existed in the southern pole regions. This was neither confirmed nor denied. See Paul Atreides during his trial of the sandrider for further reading regarding their maximum observed size.  However there is some contention regarding these estimates as Harvester Factories were said to be 120 meters long and still the diameter of a sandworm's maw (or at least the sand displaced by its maw) was described as twice that width. Although this particular specimen was stated to be a large example of the species, a Sandworm with jaws 240 meters in diameter would exceed in size even those of myth which could supposedly be sighted in much deeper desert than the typical spice mining region.""    Also being that they have no natural predator and and seem to not have a specific adult size there's no telling how large the largest worm could possibly become if left alone to grow for millennia.  Cool picture but it should be like comparing a battleship with a poor-man's yacht."

dune,1z6vnq,Sobjack,15,Fri Feb 28 16:56:19 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your analysis, but I think you take major liberties with the source material.  The BG regularly call both Paul and Leto II 'Kwisatz Haderach' (especially in later books).  This kind of throws a wrench into your definition of the term - where did you get the definition for KH in the first place?  While I was reading the book it always seemed that KH was, put simply, a prescient male who had access to his other memories.  Also, NO ONE (including the BG) were aware of the scope of the Fremen occupation of the desert.  Mohiam, a high-ranking Reverend Mother, is completely surprised by Paul's march into Arakeen.  Only the spacing Guild had any clue, and it was only because their prescience was blocked.  This also throws a wrench into your second point about Chani being Harkonnen Corrino.  In general I think Anti-KH is an unnecessary term that came about by your misunderstanding of what the definition of KH actually is.  One of the themes of Dune is the true nature of power, and how many who seek it are unable to wield it.  The BG underestimated the power of a KH, thinking that they could control him.  They were wrong."
dune,1z6vnq,ill_mango,7,Fri Feb 28 18:31:41 2014 UTC,"I agree that the BG thought that Paul was something to be controlled, but because they couldn't see what he could, they were shortsighted.  ... literally.  Ba Dump."
dune,1z6vnq,El_Camino_SS,6,Fri Feb 28 18:38:15 2014 UTC,"I agree with the thoughts above, and I'll go into much further explanation and my own opinions.  I do not think Paul was cowardly for not following the Golden Path. I think he was full of sorrow and wanted to re-unite with Chani and that's why he didn't want to fulfill the path. Not to mention he knew that his son would fulfill the golden path if he didn't this was something he saw, that his sons reign would be a tyrant reign, I believe he says this.  If I remember correctly Paul didnt know that he was a harkonnen through prescience he actually knew it through his bene gesseritt body language reading (can't remember the specific name for it) he notices his mothers hands are exactly like the Baron's. Please correct me if I'm wrong on that one.  Lastly as I understood it Paul was never meant to be able to achieve the Golden Path, the reason his son was able to (as I understood the novel) was because he was full fremen unlike Paul who was born in Caladan, he did not have the fremen ""coldness"" or respect of tradition. Leto II grew up with that and it was ingrained in him. It was the fremen wildness and portion that allowed him to succeed as the KH along with the consciousness of his Father Paul which allowed him (Leto II isn't really a KH he's a potential abomination) to control the other consciousness and personalities he had gained. Paul was all that kept Leto from turning into an abomination.  Great response, very thought provoking, even though I didn't agree with all of it. I will say I do agree with your KH and Anti-KH definitions. Although I don't think Ghani and Farad'n would have produced a controllable KH. I don't think there is such a thing as a controllable KH, IMO his powers would go beyond the BG, and he would eventually subvert them because it is the BG whose political control which leads to all of humanities downfall. The KH would see this and break free of their control.  As El_Camino_SS said they were literally shortsighted."

I doubt you will find many, if any at all that will defend the new Dune books as 'better' - We all know they aren't, many of us expected that. Brian is not, nor ever will be Frank.  The point of the matter for me, at least, is that however bad they may be, the new Dune books are a continuation of a story that we all love. Sure, we'd prefer it was Frank writing them, but as he's dead, it's either take what we can get, or have nothing at all.  I'm grateful that Dune is still on bookshelves, and still being discovered and discussed. We should try to avoid putting people down because they picked up one of the new books.

dune,1z0l5a,JCkent42,6,Fri Feb 28 04:31:15 2014 UTC,"To be fair, I would suggest reading the works for yourself and forming your own opinion.  From my perspective, however:  yes, they are that bad.  Herbert was, to me, a philosopher and mystic using the medium of science fiction as a region of analogy to express truths and insights which a non-fiction summary of the same would not have successfully accomplished or cemented.    His son, on the other hand, and Kevin J Anderson (who in person came off to me as the height of insincerity, materialism, delusion, and pretension) seem to have approached Dune as just another piece of scifi like Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica or what-have-you.    They had an outline, they understood the modern interpretation of world-building and writing as formulae, and figured they were set.  I'll say this now, as my own opinion:  all that made Dune Great laid in the understanding and wisdom of it's creator.  You can take all the elements of Dune's plot and characters and make educated guesses (or business decisions), but you can't recreate the mind and understanding that created them and conveyed deep meaning through them.  Betraying their own shallowness and insincerity, these two seem to exist in the delusion that form equals force, that plot equals theme, and that consumers are too stupid to tell the difference.  I find the fake Dune novels an affront, I doubt Frank Herbert would approve of their existence, presentation, or conclusions, I frankly doubt the existence of a ""Dune 7"" manuscript until and unless I see it personally.  Brian Herbert carved out his ""career"" in the shadow of Daddy's achievements, Kevin J Anderson has been writing formulary licensed dime-store fanfiction for every sci fi series conceivable for over twenty years (he has yet to produce successful or quality original work of his own, despite several attempts).  These prequels, interquels, and sequels, are the culmination of two insincere careers, and they deserve no respect or praise for robbing a distinguished corpse like degenerate literary cannibals.  ....  Phew, that was a rant.  Like I said, try them for yourself, AFTER reading all 6 of Herbert's."

dune,1yyd7f,cheesemagic,23,Wed Feb 26 02:57:12 2014 UTC,"Anyone born pre-wise can see all their memories.  The problem is prevention of going insane.  Adult, experienced Bene Gesserit can only dive deep enough into the memories of the other Rev Mothers that could go through the process.  It is a strictly female thing.  It's also a huge secret of Rev Mothers.  No one outside of their circle in the universe knows this.  The process is a challenge to maintain sanity in the process, and all the other things that go with it.  There are only two male Reverend Mothers, the Kwisatz men.  They're capable of handling it.  Ghani is lucky, because she has Paul inside of her, and a brother that is a full Kwisatz to lean on.  Alia was an abomination.  It was a straight up, dead up thing.  Rev Mohaim basically calls it from the cheap seats across the room at first sight of Alia.  If you can see all the voices in your head, and aren't a Kwisatz, you can't control them.  The Bene Gesserit knew this.  It takes years of internal discipline to get to Rev Mother status.  Alia was doomed from birth.  Everyone in the BG world knew this.  Alia was useful while she was sane.  The abominations were of great value, and the whole breeding program, centuries back, was probably to make a Rev Mother with all the knowledge of an abomination.  Alia, Leto II, and Ghani all share two things that allows them to hear the voices of men.  They're all preborn, meaning they carried the memories in the womb.  Two, they're blood relatives, or children of the Kwisatz.  Alia went insane because she didn't have the memories of Paul (pre-Kwisatz) to stabilize the fight between all of the voices in her head.  Ghani and Leto II are unique.  They had all the abilities of Paul, but they were also preborn wise, and had a chance to dive into shared memories.  In short, they had each other to lean on.    That's why they didn't go insane.  Only a Kwisatz can keep it together.  Leto II was the last of the Kwisatz line."
dune,1yyd7f,El_Camino_SS,8,Wed Feb 26 04:42:05 2014 UTC,"I'm currently reading Chapterhouse, and they mentioned (spoilers?) that they need Murbella to undergo the spice agony so they can learn what happened in the Scattering with their Sisters and the Honored Matres, so I don't think the other memories are only Rev Mothers, just the female line. Also, I seem to remember there being mentions of other memories from pre-spice times, although I could be mistaken. And there's Rebecca, too, who isn't a Bene Gesserit but has undergone the spice agony. I don't think she had any Rev Mother memories until she shared with Lucilla.  Also, Ghani used Chani's memories as a source of strength against the horde as well."
dune,1yyd7f,Korbit,8,Wed Feb 26 05:39:01 2014 UTC,There are definitely memories from pre-spice times. Leto can speak Latin & French. I think he says at one point that he can trace his line all the way back to Agamemnon.

dune,1yyd7f,stovor,2,Wed Feb 26 15:07:04 2014 UTC,Don't forget the large amount of time between the first three books and the last two. Chapterhouse is 6000 to 10000 years after the events of Children of Dune. That's enough time for new capabilities to be introduced into the Bene Gesserits; especially since a large majority have been bred to have Atreides genes somewhere in their heritage due to Siona's masking effects. I wouldn't necessarily assume that things possible during Heretics/Chapterhouse were even possible back in the first few books. It definitely did seem to change from just Reverend Mothers to all females at some point.
dune,1yyd7f,frodogamgee,3,Wed Feb 26 14:35:38 2014 UTC,"Chapterhouse is 5,000 years removed. Otherwise, you are correct. The Rev Mothers mention a few times that they are far more than their ancestors were. I think it was Taraza that scoffs at how weak and primitive Jessica would have been.

She avoided abomination by making peace with the more peaceful members of her line.  Leto II avoided abomination by becoming an amalgamation of a person. He never had a real personality of his own.   Alia went full on abomination because Jessica abandoned her. My reading of the books is that Alia could have avoided the chaos if someone would have been there to help her. She lacked the mediating voice of Paul and his experiences, and had all the insanity of the Harkonnens. Jessica could have guided her and gave her an external anchor to settle her inner life.  As she help, basically, she looked inward and that brought her down. If she had been denied the spice trance early on, she could have kept herself sane. Remember, she overdosed again and again in an attempt to see further. Imagine if she had a mothers love to temper this.  All in all, I think Herbert planned this bit of narrative very well.

As it turned out, Lynch was utterly wrong for the material  but nonetheless bloated, utterly nonsensical if you hadn’t read the novel, and all in all a bit of a mess.   Which is more than a little just like the book. It's not a tight narrative and there's a hell of a lot going on verbally and thematically which is very hard to capture in a movie. Dune isn't a small book. Fitting a big book in the teeny tiny format that is a 2 hour movie is sheer hubris.   A novel that was timely in 1965 seems downright prophetic nearly 50 years later   And people who don't understand the book are going to hammer the director for how obviously and shamelessly political the movie is and who it's ribbing, no matter whether or not it's faithful to the book. Dear god, all of the reviews which somewhere contain, ""I haven't read the book""...   Alejandro Jodorowsky’s unfilmed 1970s Dune adaptation   This is the author who just lampooned Lynch's version for being too long and nonsensical. Everyone who knows anything about Jodorowsky's version says it was going to be like an acid trip. That makes sense.   Regardless, the political (and movie blockbuster)   Dune is an exciting novel and I'm sure a Dune movie could be a cute and exciting over-budget summer movie.

In that future the Ixian navigation machines (used on the Golden Path to replace Guild Navigators) would have been used by someone as prescient hunting machines to wipe out humanity.  The Golden Path ensured the existence of the human race by making it invisible to the oracle and spreading it out. That's what Leto and everyone else sensitized to the Path mean when they call it it cruel but necessary.

And as much for some persons this process takes some 20-30 days, becoming more wise and aquainted with life and it's laws, such with ever changing humanity it takes thousands and thousands of years to mature and start looking in future and planning.   That is why he asks Bene Gesserit about Noble Purpose. Because without it, they, the most mature society in whole Universe, are loosing their path and just trying to be kind of crysis-managers and breeders insted of humans driven by something great.

Of course all of it was to force humanity to evolve, to ensure unpredictibility and enhance breeding patterns, and eventually to scatter out (thus, the Scattering). But the ""prescient-proof"" attribute was not intended. It was an useful side-effect of course, but Leto mostly wanted surprises. That's why, when he finds out that Siona is invisible to prescience, he is (pleasantly) surprised. And also, that's why he continues exposing himself to the Duncans' unpredictable anger, and why he marries Hwi though he can't see her oracle.  EDIT: so typical.

His reign as Tyrant was less like a prison and more like a childhood, nurturing humanity until it had the skills it needed to survive. Do you think it was a coincidence Siona and the no-globes both came to be right at the end of his reign? He oppressed humanity with prescience until it learned to defeat prescience rather than depend on it. That's why he made himself a god and then died, to teach people not to make gods. And it worked, the Bene Gesserit's new motto became ""no more Kwisatz Haderachs!"" and they focused more on survival as a species than on power as a group.

We want surety and safety, and that's the genius of Herbert's work, its informing we the readers of our flaws.  The following isn't really a reply to your comment but how I see the golden path.  The term 'Golden Path' is an oxymoron in that the path is golden, something clear and brightly visible. A prescient path is 'golden', it's clear and visible, by following a thread you are making a reality. As the guild navigators showed this leads to stagnation. The golden path was the unknown and unforeseeable path for Leto, only visible by its absence.   The voids in Leto's vision and surprises he encountered gave indications for directions he should take and the people he should nurture. He setup a pressure cooker and waited, hoping that it would explode before he became completely worm."

I truly believe you've missed the point. The Golden Path itself wasn't necessarily unpredictable; there's plenty of hints throughout GEoD that Leto II was guiding humanity through a specific path, and wanted to teach humanity a lesson that it would never forget. So really, it's been clear to me (and plenty of others in this thread, mind you), that Leto II's objective was very clear to him. He wanted to breed unpredictability into humans, but until he did, humans were very much predictable, and the fact that Leto II himself had taken over the Bene Gesserit's breeding program is proof enough that he actually had a specific result in mind."

dune,1ywrhf,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,2,Wed Feb 26 04:17:52 2014 UTC,"the golden path involved shackling humanity for many ultimate purposes, but imo it was for two main things.  1) to make forced subservience a recent and painful memory for humanity into the far future  2) to lace humanity with the bloodlines that are invisible to prescience, because the golden path had but one fine line to follow through the darkness that surrounded humanity.  Paul and Leto both saw how ultimately trapped humanity was by the menace, but they both saw one way ""out"". That is not to say they knew at the beginning of that path what choices lied OUTSIDE of the single path.  I think of it more as Leto2 lead us out of the valley of death, and into a plain of possibilities, which allowed humanity to develop to fight the menace and end the threat.  But of course, they had a back up plan. those that were not able to be scryed are not on the battlefield. they can hide from navigators and the prescient, which implied that they can hide from the threat.  So in the end, humanity would have been saved from extermination and enslavement, either by their own volition or by hiding in the shadows hidden from prescience."
dune,1ywrhf,hypnobear1,3,Wed Feb 26 15:04:56 2014 UTC,"Leto didn't fear the return of the Scattered people.  Even if the people from the Scattering wiped out everyone in the original empire, Leto would be happy because humanity survives."
dune,1ywrhf,Kolikilla,2,Tue Feb 25 22:02:32 2014 UTC,"He doesn't though.  What he saw was the total stagnation of the human race.  The emperors and empire had basically been running in the same fashion for thousands of years without changing.  There wasn't any growth, and very few new ideas.  By continuously locking down the human race, he basically turned it into a powder keg.  Once he was gone, everyone fled because they could, and because of the absolute power vacuum that he left."
