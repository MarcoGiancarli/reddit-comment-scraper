3amjokes,3cpc2n,jdm0,4,Fri Jul 10 02:45:09 2015 UTC,"large crowds and interesting music   If you're talking about classical guitar, I've never heard of more than a few dozen people going to a classical guitar show. If you're talking about classical music, I'm going to very much disagree and say that playing classical music is the worst to play as a career actually (even though it's one of my favorite genres). Small crowds that get smaller every year unless you're with a top 5 group, unfortunately people don't go to the symphony like they used to. Get ready to put on lots of themed shows with shitty pop culture compilations to get people into the seats.  Also classical music can be boring as hell to play, especially for any non-violin string from some composers like Mozart who didn't realize other instruments were capable of playing anything but one eighth note over and over. If you want to play something interesting you have to stick to the romantic era or play the violin.  Not to mention even if you're a first chair in a medium-sized market you still need to give lessons to supplement income because you don't get paid jack.  Source: classically trained cello player who gave up a scholarship and switched from Music Performance major to Comp Sci in college because a lot of the music we played wasn't challenging and I wanted to be comfortable financially. I'm much happier with cello and chamber groups as a hobby.  EDIT: I reread my comment and I sound like I'm insulting people who play in a chamber/orchestra/symphony for a living and I definitely did not mean to. I have the upmost respect for them and I pay to go see the symphony as much as I can. It's just a really hard career and you do it because it's the only thing you want to do, not because it's the easiest route by any means."
