TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,SmoSays,51,Mon Jul 20 23:57:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand why some people think that male rape doesn't exist / can't happen. It absolutely disgusts me. Fuck any of those people.
TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,west096,48,Tue Jul 21 01:04:30 2015 UTC,"Sadly I might know the answer to this. I'm not male, but I've read on the subject. Note that these are the reasons given by those who don't think it exists, not me saying this is why males being raped doesn't exist. For the record of fucking course it exists.    a woman cannot rape a man because she cannot penetrate him. A, yes she can and B, you do not have to be the one penetrated to have been the one raped.  you cannot have sex (consensual or otherwise) without getting an erection and if you have an erection, you were obviously enjoying it. Whoever believes that either doesn't understand how erections work (it reacts to touch whether or not the penis owner is enjoying it) and that is like saying to a woman, 'Well you got wet so obviously it wasn't that bad' which is both untrue and heinous.  well, he orgasmed so... Yeah no, see above women aren't as physically strong etc. Can't overpower a man. While this does apply comparing the two sexes on average, it doesn't matter. Men are taught not to hit women and many won't even when in danger. Would you kick a kid that hit you? Probably not because your instincts tell you not to harm children. Same thing applies. Also, that's like asking a mugging victim why they didn't just punch the mugger. IDK because not everyone reacts like John McClane?  because women don't think like that. You are too dumb to breathe if you think that. Also, Henry Lee Lucas's mom, rosemary west, Cindy hendy, Carol bundy, to name some."
TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,Laugh_At_Everything,24,Tue Jul 21 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"The second point bothers me so much. They use that kind of logic for a subconscious human reaction. (I.e an erection.) But when the topic of women orgasming during sex comes up, then she can't be held responsible for something she has no control of, and just because her body responds to rape, doesnt mean she enjoys it.   The double standard is real, indeed."
TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,west096,21,Tue Jul 21 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"rant  Feminism has turned into some anti-man movement. Everything bad is caused by men.    When I told my family that a doctor had abused me in 6th grade, my sister told me that it wasn't possible because she was a woman. She did horrible things to me for half a year, which I'm not even sure I'm over yet. It made me paranoid, I couldn't trust anyone. And then these people on the fricking internet think it's not possible. It pisses me off and I'm sure it pisses off other victims.    Rape is absolutely terrible, for both genders, but to these people it's exclusive to women because ""men are powerful"". What the fuck? Isn't feminism ""empowering women""? Shouldn't women be powerful enough to step men? I can't fathom the stupidity of some of these guys. Jesus Christ, this stuff makes me so angry.  /rant"
TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,sunnyta,11,Tue Jul 21 02:24:02 2015 UTC,"It pisses me off, too. Also, some of these women had been (or claim to be because let's be honest, some of their definitions are waaaaaay too loose) raped, and as a result view men as constant predators.   My rapist never physically held me down during the act, or hit me or strike me in any way. Therefore I never fought back. People ask why I didn't push him off or whatever. Honestly, it never occurred to me. I thought it would be easier to just take it and get it over with. And, this is where I was so mentally fucked up that logic eluded me, in my mind I thought if I didn't give in, he WOULD get physical and 'actually' rape me. I know it was still rape anyway, but at the time I thought it was the better option.   I feared men for a while. Like you, I was fucking paranoid and thought everyone, especially men, had some sinister ulterior motive. But you know what? I also knew, logically, that this wasn't true. I also didn't blame each man for the horrible thing that happened to me.   The fear is real. The trauma is real. To tell someone else that what they are experiencing isn't possible because of some retarded belief that women can't rape men is both immoral and cruel. Not to mention wrong.   You're right in assuming it pisses off other victims. But not just male victims of rape, female ones as well. A lot of women against the erroneous belief that male rape victims don't exist were victims once themselves and see these arguments as the same ones that were made to invalidate their rapes. The rest of the women, the ones who hadn't been sexually assaulted in any way, they're just reasonable human beings, like the men who hadn't been through the trauma.   I am so sorry you were raped. I want you to know that if you need to talk, my inbox is open. You should know that it does get better with time. You learn to trust again, learn to understand your triggers (and not the stupid ways SJW's view triggers) and eventually face them head on. I also really hope that bitch doctor gets what is coming to her."
TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,SlapMyCHOP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"i also blame feminist theory that uses the concept of a ""patriarchy"" as a scapegoat. it's too easy for them to blame all of society's ills on white, straight men, so as a result it leads to vicious anti-male behavior and sentiments.   and because society tolerates man-hating in stark contrast to how it views hating women (some patriarchy, huh?), these people are not deterred from what they say and do. there's no stigma attached to attacking men or blaming men, therefore it's widely accepted and perpetuated.   and people are too stupid to think about this for even a split second. i hate the collectivist behavior of blaming races or genders for something when it A) isn't anyone's fault, B) there might not even be as much of a problem as they think, and C) EVERYONE IS AN INDIVIDUAL"

TumblrAtRest,3e0cta,BaadKitteh,9,Tue Jul 21 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Setting aside the ""excuses"" that are commonly used as to why men can't be raped, the underlying reason why people think this, is that to admit that men can be raped is to admit that men can be vulnerable and that they have inherent value in our society. Male disposability is a very real concept. It is why tragedy is measured the aggregate deaths of women and children.  Take Boko Haram as an example. Prior to the kidnapping of the schoolgirls that created an international uproar and near instant condemnation, that very same group had been systematically killing the boys en mass and it didn't even raise an eyebrow. No one cared. It simply wasn't worth reporting.  Look at news articles involving the deaths of large groups of people.  X killed in tragic fire. mostly women and children. Or 31 miners killed in cave in. Men don't even get to be identified as people. They are defined and seen as nothing more than the jobs they do. Is it really surprising that a society that lacks the ability to provide inherent value to a man would also refuse to acknowledge his pain?"

Like, girls like starbucks pumpkin spice... lol white girls! yoga pants? lol white girls! girls is rich? White woman!

My friend tried to get one, had to go through so many  hoops and when she could actually have it done it was at a stage where she didn't feel comfortable going through with it.

He also made an app for the tumblr app itself to make it better.   The irony should not be lost that a lot of people who depended on his xkit extensions (including those who used it for the disability extensions) were part of the witch hunt.

TumblrAtRest,3du0pi,Bortasz,4,Sun Jul 19 13:33:33 2015 UTC,"In my Sociology 101 class, the SJW prof showed us a video about a transgender woman (MtF) wanting to compete in the Women's Motocross Bike Races. The video was trying to push for the fact that because the girl was legally recognized as female, and because they had finished the transition, they should be allowed to compete in the Women's Race. But all the other female racers were very apprehensive about this, and pointed out that the transwoman still had the genetics of a man, which meant they were naturally stronger.   That video irked me quite a bit, being a kinesiology major at the time. Men are clearly stronger than women. Some women are stronger than men, but these are the minority. Just because that transwoman is legally a woman when it comes to how they should be treated in the public does not mean that she is biologically the same as a female-at-birth, which is the unfortunate truth.   I'm all for LGBT rights and equality, but I personally feel that pushing towards treating everyone the same and ignoring the differences is not the right way to go. It's important to recognize the difference, because they do exist, and they can be quite significant. From there, we can start accepting people despite their differences, not ignoring them."

What really struck it home for me was when I read a t-man describe how happy and complete he felt the first time someone (unprompted) addressed him as, ""sir."" Something as simple as that was a such huge milestone that meant so much for that person.  It's why they have cis vs trans. While you always hear, ""cis het male,"" there is also, ""trans het male.""

They used it to prove a point, and they got their point across, no one was hurt (feelings don't count, we should all know that here), and they got their law passed.   The law that was just passed states that you have to have a concealed carry license (huge background checks and a live-fire test similar to that of the police requalification test) to open carry, which is reasonable. Open carry is also banned in public schools, inside university buildings and several other places, but, IIRC, will be legal in the statehouse, which previously allowed concealed carriers to just walk around the metal detectors with their carry licence."

They're limiting them, not forbidding them, despite we (hopefully) will have completly clean energy in the future.  1:50 Technologically advanced guns already existed.  How available were those guns? How's their accuracy, their reload time, their maintenance cost, their price etc.? They may have existed back then, but if only a handful of people could get their hands on to them it would be stupid to accomodate them in laws.   Weapons got infinitely times better than they were back then.

TumblrAtRest,3dk3xc,atomic1fire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:06:00 2015 UTC,"Was the first amendment made when the printing press was around?  Because under your logic freedom of speech only applies to old newspapers.  Muskets were weapons of war, and the US congress probably saw valid reason that citizens have the right to be armed.  The technology may have changed, but that doesn't mean the intent of keeping freedoms safe does.  I'm not advocating walking around with a rifle (unless you have a pretty good reason, like self defense or you wanted to go shoot at things). At Least not anymore then I advocate blasting your speakers when your neighbors are trying to sleep, I'm just saying that the rights are there for people to use, no matter what the era. And on that note, if you do plan on shooting near your neighbors, they might appreciate it if you get a permit to own a silencer to keep the noise down assuming it's legal in your state. Most of the people where I live probably don't mind gun fire during hunting season, but not everyone won't. Also silencers are probably better for your eardrums.  Also open carry laws are highly dependent on state. Some states have concealed carry licenses (meaning you can have a gun, but it has to be reasonably concealed), and some states are even more picky about why you need the license.   I don't have an issue with people who open carry, namely because cops have their guns holstered in plain sight and no one blinks an eye. If someone wants a gun for personal defense or sport, or they have a job related reason such as cop or security guard, that's their business and not mine.  Also, aside from specific people like military police, Military bases may not always allow military members to carry.   If anything that's an argument against gun free zones because you specifically flag an area as ""gun free"" and that is about as good as defenseless."

Henna Heals, a rich community of nearly 150 henna tattoo artists worldwide established by a team of 5 women in Canada, helps women with cancer feel confident and beautiful again by drawing elegant henna crowns on their bare heads:  The intricate patterns that the artists create with all-natural henna paste are a unique and empowering substitute to the hats and wigs that many women use to cover their heads after losing their hair to chemotherapy. “For cancer patients, the henna crowns really are a healing experience,” claims Frances Darwin, the founder of Henna Heals. “This is all about them reclaiming a part of themselves that would normally be perceived as ill or damaged or not nice to look at and making it more feminine and beautiful.”  The traditional South-Asian temporary tattoos, which are made with 100% natural home-made henna paste, last for around two weeks and have no harmful side-effects. Henna Heals also offers henna services for special events and does belly painting for mother-to-be, but they always donate 10% of their proceeds to compensate the cost of the henna crowns they make for cancer patients"

Being worldly and/or open to new things is a virtue. It's supposed to be anyway. People who believe this shit really must fancy themselves as champions of the people. Fightin' for the underdog, right? The blatant hypocrisy.  It's this weird sort of empathy deficiency that completely lacks self-awareness. Because in this quest to sate the messiah complex, these moral crusaders aren't fighting for progress. They're just sitting around patronizing people. I can guarantee that the majority of people (regardless of race or nationality) would be highly offended if you patronize them and treat them like they're on the fucking endangered species list. Nobody needs the defense of a middle-class undergrad with an internet connection. No world religions have a prophecy wherein some silver-haired heroine uses her librarian glasses to save the land from the evil white men who keep eating all the vindaloo.   ""Cultural appropriation"" has become a tool to provoke outrage. We can never stop being offended. If we do we might start making progress, which brings us closer to the supposed goal of scholars specializing in whatever bastardized sub-genre of sociology. Thus there would be no need for their field or their job. Since nobody wants to sacrifice the privilege of getting payed a lot of money to transmute turds into propaganda, we gotta keep this hate machine running at full capacity."

TumblrAtRest,3db0ts,-LevelDevil-,146,Tue Jul 14 21:49:48 2015 UTC,Weird it's almost like being mentally ill makes you hard to deal with. It's almost like.....it sucks to be mentally ill. That it's not romantic but rather terrible and either outright destroys or puts a strain on most/all the relationships you have with others. Huh. Who would have thought?
TumblrAtRest,3db0ts,em-e-chan,43,Tue Jul 14 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"Easily the worst part of any mental illness, developmental disorder, etc. is the interpersonal relationship part. People with the autism spectrum disorders in particular, I know, are in a situation where quite a few of them ENJOY having the disorders, right up until they start needing to interface with people without the disorder and who have no idea what the disorder actually entails or how it truly determines their behavior."

TumblrAtRest,3db0ts,xanderxela,7,Wed Jul 15 03:06:30 2015 UTC,Depression sucks to. Not surprisingly people don't like to hang out with someone whose always either angry or crying.
TumblrAtRest,3db0ts,em-e-chan,10,Wed Jul 15 05:07:18 2015 UTC,"one of my biggest pet peeves with SJWs is that they truly believe that showing something in fiction means the author is condoning it. for instance, having a character do something bad is reflective of the author and how they are condoning bad things.  the fallout of this is that creators are pressured to neuter their work. this gets especially bad whenever a female character is brought into the discussion, as a particular focus is put on how said female character represents all females everywhere, so they can't be flawed or do shitty things, because it somehow suggests all women are like that. it leads to the same, average, boring ""GRRRL POWER"" characters that lack depth and come out all same-y.   this rarely happens with male characters, unless they are doing something to a female character, and then we are back at square one.  like in the OP, complex characters piss people off because they don't understand what depth looks like, with their black and white, morality-centric, smug, holier-than-thou way of thinking."
TumblrAtRest,3db0ts,sunnyta,9,Wed Jul 15 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Building off of that, I really hate how SJWs just need to have everything spelled out in big flashy stereotype-y letters. A character happens to be gay? Why aren't they reminding us every waking minute how much they love cock and banging any male character they see? A character is black? It is soooo offensive that she's not a member of the Black Panther Party and endlessly quoting Zora Neale Hurston (even if she's not African-American). And like we see here: a character is mentally ill? How come they don't act like what I think mentally ill people act like?"

It's the TUmblr side, as a whole, that gets pretty crazy, because they start to delve into gender politics, and many, i suspect, use the show to validate their own gender identity and use it as a crutch.

I mean, she was basically into bestiality by their standards.  It also helps explain why Rose decided to be so fat, as it wouldn't have the same social stigma among her people. Just saying, if you can pick your own form, it's unlikely you're going to pick one viewed as unattractive by the majority of people unless it's for someone with a fetish, or you have an alien mindset towards what's attractive, or you're doing it to send a specific message."

But since she's writing about cornrows, which does have cultural tension behind it, I don't think she's an extreme SJW.  That's the problem I see a lot with reddit and cultural appropriation.

I don't think a ton of people who are getting completely plastered understand anything about the holiday.  That's where I think the main line is for appropriation.

TumblrAtRest,3d6zke,youguysgonnamakeout,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think if you're choosing to wear cornrows you should understand that it was worn throughout African history and that nowadays there's cultural bias against them. If someone wears them, it's seen as ""ghetto"" and unprofessional. They've been banned from schools. Even though it's a pretty traditional hairstyle and is a style that works well with black people hair.  So what Amandla is saying is you can wear cornrows.

The reason they can't is not because they're not fashion, it's because there are prejudiced, bigots out there. A white girl wearing them does not mean she's exploiting anyone, it's a hairstyle.

Don't you see wear that leads, it's just segregation. She's still showing them off, isn't that a good thing? Why wouldn't that help?

I can understand why people get aggravated hearing about cultural appropriation considering how much extremists have butchered its meaning. But Amandla has only stated that she wishes we could respect people along with their culture.    I remember when I was younger, I had my hair braided into cornrows while on vacation. People saw my blonde hair in these little braids and told me I looked ""darling"" or ""trendy"". Strangers would comment on my hair and praise me for getting it done.  Now imagine a little black girl getting the same thing done and try to convince me she would get the same response.   This I what I believe Amandla was trying to get across, however, we have become so defensive against these ideas that we don't want to even consider them. From how I interpret it, Amandla isn't saying white people shouldn't be allowed to wear cornrows, but that we should try and eliminate the prejudice behind who is wearing them."

TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,Purplesheepicorn,29,Mon Jul 13 21:45:27 2015 UTC,Things like demisexuality are just a way for them to pretend they fit in and pull the victim card.
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,feioo,17,Mon Jul 13 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I sort of liked when the ""demisexual"" thing popped up because it made me feel like my general (but not 100%) lack of sexual interest wasn't just prudishness. It's kind of nice to get a little verification that you're not alone, especially when it comes to little-talked-about things like libido. Of course, I would never identify myself as demisexual because that's not a thing, but it was nice to have a ""hey, me too!"" moment."

Not so much my thing, but I still like the term."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,pineyfusion,4,Tue Jul 14 16:24:43 2015 UTC,I kind of think that demisexuality is a thing but it's not a sexual orientation nor do I think that's the correct word for it. The idea of not being into sex unless if there's an emotional connection is a legit one that isn't talked about much. And I think it also suggests that the person in question won't rule anything out pertaining to genders/sexes. So there's also that.
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,feioo,3,Tue Jul 14 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. The idea that is described by the word seems to be less ""sexual orientation"" and more ""sexual desire"". Like it's not an answer to ""who do you like to have sex with?"" it's an answer to ""how interested are you in sex in general?"". Which, to me, is not something to base a sexual identity on.

TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,solus-esse-nolo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure everyone was expected to be 'demisexual' before all the sexual liberation took place, because you'd only have sex after you marry someone and you'd only marry someone if you had an emotional connection.  Some people these days will see that as prudish (even if it's not a forced lack of sex like celibacy, but a lack of desire), so being able to have a word to describe it and say ""me too"" is a good thing."

TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,vagenda,27,Tue Jul 14 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that pansexuality includes people who are gender non-conforming or trans, as opposed to just ""men and women"" like the definition of bisexuality would suggest. I'm not sure if that's accurate or even a significant enough difference to warrant a whole other name, but maybe that explains it a little."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,Novaer,7,Tue Jul 14 02:49:22 2015 UTC,"I personally feel that calling yourself a different sexuality (pansexual) because you can find yourself attracted to trans people is actually quite offensive to trans people. It still excludes them and doesn't validate their gender identities as either male or female. A trans man is a man, a trans woman is a woman. It should still be bisexual."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,vagenda,4,Tue Jul 14 18:28:14 2015 UTC,"See, I agree in principle but I think there are trans people who want to be treated/regarded as cis people of their gender, and there are trans people who embrace their trans identity and don't necessarily want to pass for cis or be thought of that way, even if they do identify primarily as a man or woman as the case may be. Plus, while a trans man is of course a man and a trans woman is of course a woman in gender terms, when it comes to sex and sexual organs, there's a whole spectrum of possibility that doesn't necessarily fall in line with how some bisexuals define their preferences.  Like I said before, I think it's an issue of semantics and personal preference. Someone who fits the description I gave for pansexuality could identify as bisexual for the reason you give, and that's fine, or someone could say that they're bisexual and not pansexual because they wish to be trans-exclusionary in their preference, and I think that's valid too (even if it's understandably offensive). It's a blurry distinction but I think there's a case for why it exists."

TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,food_is_crack,6,Tue Jul 14 04:41:58 2015 UTC,well the whole trans thing i feel is like saying being attracted to people with a specific hair color or race is a whole new sexuality.
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,vagenda,15,Tue Jul 14 04:14:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's say we have a transwoman who has not and does not plan to have surgeries to make her parts ""match up"" to her gender, for whatever reason. Would you expect an average straight man to be sexually compatible with her because she's a woman and presents as such? Or would you say that this transwoman should be pursued by straight women because she has a penis even though she doesn't identify as male at all? And what about bisexual men or women, just because they like both genders doesn't necessarily mean they would be okay dating somebody with aspects of both at once.  That's not quite the same as hair color or race being a factor, it's a specific physical sex-related preference just like hetero-, homo- and bisexuality. Of course, a man who identifies as straight could be with a transwoman like that, or a gay woman, or a bisexual either. It's definitely a matter of semantics and self-identification over a concrete definition, but that doesn't make it too niche to be a term, nor is it irrelevant to sexual preference like, say, sapiosexuality or demisexuality. I think it's valid."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,overcastwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:33:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think it's needed, but I'm one of those shallow people who believes that there are only two sexes and whatnot."

TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,brauchen,5,Tue Jul 14 09:30:40 2015 UTC,"I think that's just arguing semantics.

Let's focus on good medical care and social equality instead of getting all muddled up about the terminology flavour of the month."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,MiffTheFox,0,Tue Jul 14 09:34:34 2015 UTC,My interpretation seems to be that bisexuality is attraction to both genders whereas pansexuality is not giving a shit.
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,sexiestswine,7,Tue Jul 14 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"I call myself pansexual but it basically is just bisexuality. I don't include ""non-binary"" or ""agender"" people as like a whole different gender of people I can be attracted to. I do count intersex people as a slightly different gender, but the population of weird gender identities + intersex people is so small that I really might as well just refer to myself as bisexual. It's basically the same thing."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,JadeSkysong,21,Tue Jul 14 07:49:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree on two points: polysexual isn't an orientation, it means you can be in more than one sexual relationship at once.  Pansexual is also valid, IMO. Of course, being pansexual, I may be biased, but the original argument is   If after explaining your sexuality the person can still ask you “wait, but do you like men or women?” what you just described is not a real sexuality   and I've never had that problem when explaining things. My go-to is ""I like guys, girls, and everything in between."" I may be asked for clarification, but people have always understood when I say that I am sexually attracted to males, females, and people who share physical attributes (read: genitalia) of both men and women."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,amedeus,14,Tue Jul 14 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"Mate, I like women, men, and trans, and I'm definitely just bi."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,Jackibelle,21,Tue Jul 14 07:11:02 2015 UTC,"But that assumes bisexuals are trans exclusionary, and many that identify as such aren't. The pansexual label, to me, seems like it causes unnecessary confusion and clarifies something that doesn't need to be clarified. I used to identify as pansexual, too, but I realized that saying I'm bisexual is enough. I don't want to take a hardline position that I have the potential to be attracted to any possible nuance of gender because I simply haven't seen all of them or couldn't tell them all apart. Trans men are men and trans women are women. I think bisexual is appropriate."
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,Chaoslux,10,Tue Jul 14 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard both sides, and I agree that a lot of definitions of pansexual imply bisexual is trans exclusionary. I think some of it grew out of dealing with a lot of transphobic bi people who were only interested in cis men and women, so a new term was made to show that this person is actually ok with their partners being trans. Then general acceptance grew and bisexual being trans inclusive started being more of the norm and pansexual started coming across and transphobic because ""what do you mean I'm not included in bi? Just because I'm a trans woman doesn't mean you need another category to include me"", just like you were saying at the end.   I tend to take people who say they are pan at face value and not assume they're trying to be transphobic assholes but rather welcoming and accepting people. Bisexual is sufficient, but pan also works basically, and they're more or less the same thing with slightly different histories, and we aren't too hurt by having slight variations on the word (see heterosexual/straight, for example)"

TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,letsnottryanother,9,Tue Jul 14 08:38:23 2015 UTC,Isnt that polygamy?   Polygamy is being married to more than one person. Polyamory is more fitting.
TumblrAtRest,3d5nub,Derzelaz,4,Tue Jul 14 12:00:05 2015 UTC,"+1.  I feel like pansexual is a more correct term for me. I think the term was rather obscure until recently and because of that most pansexuals used to call themselves ""bisexuals"", me including. A lot of people use it interchangeably, and that's alright.  I think most people identifying as bisexual can be attracted to people regardless of gender, but I have no idea if that is the case. Maybe there are a lot of bisexuals attracted solely to ""binary""/""cisgender"" men and women, and thus ""bi"" is really appropriate.  In my opinion ""pan"" makes a lot of more sense than ""bi"" for people who can be attracted to anybody regardless of gender, it is an established term and I think it's appropriate to use it for those people.  It's not too big of a deal to me, but simply because tumblrinas adopt some of these, already existing, labels because it's trendy to them, doesn't automatically invalidate them."

The thing is, those people are wrong. There's no 'redpill' required: only a scientific and objective look at us as a species and at our mental processes."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,ArgonNightmare,11,Sun Jul 12 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"Hahahahahahah.   Man, your statements come across as so hostilely dismissive.   No but seriously go look at the scientific evidence we have for mental processes and how they differ/connect to gender and it's pretty clear that while there are two distinct, well-separated patterns, this is true only because of extremely large numbers, and human variability mixes it all up. Like, sure, there seems to be a bimodal distribution of average brain thought patterns/srructures, but it's not two delta functions or anything.   You also seem locked into the outdated ""sex = gender"" ideology (as evidenced by your comment about hermaphroditism being a third gender when it's actually an intersex condition), and I'm pretty sure out scientific and objective looks have moved us past this idea."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,Jackibelle,-4,Sun Jul 12 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"Your comments come across as purposefully and casually dismissive. You recognize that gender dimorphism is a real phenomenon, yet you then go off into pseudo-science territory with your vaguely defined 'human variability'. I think you'll find that the very nature of ""two distinct, well-separated patterns"" and ""bimodal distribution of average... structures"" means that from a purely statistical point of view what you just said is a contradiction. Either you have data, studies and other evidence which supports the view that the two genders are distinct and overwhelmingly divergent (reality) or you vaguely claim that humans are too variable and in fact the existing data is meaningless (opinion).   Objectively ""sex=gender"" is the pre-dominant scientific consensus in the field of Biology, the relevant science at hand. Your opinion cannot change that. Now you may argue the idea is outdated, but I'd like to see the basis for that outside of the context of a genetic abnormality or disease involving hormonal disbalances or mental illness. I'd like to see how a perfectly healthy and average male can suddenly at an arbitrary point in their life turn into a woman without those influencing factors."

You would be incorrect to say ""all observed values are either 50 or 80"". That's the variability I was talking about. Maybe you want a different word. On average there are strong peaks in certain measurements, but it's not a cut-and-dried thing.  I never said the existing data was meaningless. I said the data doesn't consist of two delta functions.   the pre-dominant scientific consensus in the field of Biology, the relevant science at hand.    When did we agree to make this switch? I thought we were talking about psychology. I agree that for the most part saying sex and gender are the same works for biology because it talks a great deal about nonhuman organisms for which we have no idea about their gender presentation or gender identity, and frankly we don't care because they're animals. And anatomy really concerns itself with sex more than gender because it just cares about the body. So it sounds more like biology is less relevant than psychology when talking about whether sex is the same thing as gender in humans.   but I'd like to see the basis for that outside of the context of a genetic abnormality or disease involving hormonal disbalances or mental illness.   Nothing I can show you will convince you of this because of how you've defined your terms. Shrug I wouldn't say that being transgender is a disease, so therefore it's not a disease involving hormonal imbalances, but I'm pretty sure you'd disagree. But the whole point of pushing against that language is to destigmatize being trans, so it's not a bunch of people who are disordered (= crazy, = we can ignore what they want, = we can freely discriminate against them, as the thinking might go).   I'd like to see how a perfectly healthy and average male can suddenly at an arbitrary point in their life turn into a woman without those influencing factors.   The average man would not. (for that matter, the average trans woman would not at an arbitrary point in their life do this either; it's not arbitrary at all). Go back to what I said about bimodal distributions; the average person is smack dab in the center of one of those clusters, and so by definition isn't one of the people who is on the edge, or who moves between them, or is anything other than completely average. And the staggeringly large numbers of humans means that the average guy is a cis guy. So what?"

Why would the provider bother to provide for a child that isn't his? Further, if women all want only the most desirable men and men want to spread their genes around as much as possible, why aren't hunter-gatherer societies, which are the closest to early human society, structured as harems?*  *It's possible they are and I just don't realize it, so correct me if I'm wrong."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,eyeballfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"I think chimpanzees have the answer to your question (I could be wrong with the specie). There you have the Alphas male that have harem, and there are several betas. However the provider=beta can court one female. Give her extra food. Take care of her and her children... than when she is in heat she march in front of other Alphas  and try provoke fight between her alpha and other alphas. When this happen the female disappear in the bushes with beta provider. There is chance that she get pregnant, and beta just have his child. Translate to humans. I take care of single mother and she will give birth to my children. Since she already survive labor there is chance I will get healthy children. Also why currently living men take care of not there children? Why men take care of single mother? Why adoptions happen? This is answer to your first question.    As two second one... This is tricky. Generally speaking. The society is better off if it enforce some kind of monogamy. And prohibit harems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_polygamy#Countries_that_recognize_polygamous_marriages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts Check this maps. Like you see the bastion of Polygamy are countries with long history of conflicts. In combat primary die men. So you have big surplus of women, that life in very primitive societies, that need men to survive. So it is logical that they allow for polygamy so one men could take care of many women. However the rest of the world is monogamous because of Neotenization. https://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/16sxsn/gww_is_feminism_hate_response_part_i_bonobos/c7z66u2?context=3    Also currently living Hunters gatherers are... let's call it semi monogamous. For example in book by mister Cejrowski he mention that he have to reject several proposition of having sex with wife of chief of tribe. And proposition came from the chief... However she still was his wife. They just were very hospitable.    Does this answer satisfy you?"

People point to nonbinary genders such as the Hjira (sp?) which recently gained federal recognition from the Indian government as being a nonbinary gender for passport usage. There is also the fact that gender roles vary greatly across different cultures and different times, so you'd have to work very hard to prove that something that has been relatively inconsistent can be biologically based.    I will believe it when I see some thorough testing done."

We do not currently have a vacuum where men/women aren't treated differently pretty much from birth. However we do know that gender presentation for male/female/sometimes third genders differ greatly from culture to culture and varies greatly in one culture throughout time. Since we can't test in a vacuum if gender is biologically innate but we can test if gender can vary due to nonbiological factors it currently seems a large part of gender is due to environment.    Here's the definition of gender from the World Health Organization:     Gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,sunnyta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"gender can be reshapen, but by and large, most men and women act predictably even from the very time they're born, with predictable interests and reactions. the brainwash documentary that's been floating around for a while makes a good point of this, showing that even 1 day old newborns clearly show preferences for what they look at based on gender (boys like to look at more mechanical things, girls like to look at faces)  it's not absolute, but it's certainly far more than nurture. evolutionary psychology pretty much affirms that it's mostly biology"
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,ArgonNightmare,-10,Mon Jul 13 13:22:07 2015 UTC,That's cool and all but transgender studies are a pseudo-science that spit on the good name of Psychology. Normalizing what is essentially a mental illness and enabling people to mutilate themselves is unethical and unscientific.

TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,Jackibelle,3,Sun Jul 12 13:10:48 2015 UTC,"The site you linked is behind a pay wall but I'm pretty sure I know the one you're talking about. It looks at outcomes of SRS in trans people and tries to measure their overall happiness, and concludes that the increased suicide rate (among other things) among trans people with surgery as compared to the general population means the surgery is a bad thing.   Talk about comparing apples and oranges. Let's say I was designing a new antidepressant specifically for suicidal people, so I'm naturally giving it to a population with a very high suicide rate (say 50% for the sake of example). If we look at the effect of this medicine and fine out 10% of my study population committed suicide in the years they were on my drug, we might be alarmed because it is so much higher than the rate most people kill themselves. Is my drug dangerous or unethical because it's causing so many of my patients to kill themselves?   No, it's keeping so many from doing it. 80% fewer suicides in the population we're interested in is a pretty good improvement. Clearly 100% would be best and we should keep working, but to throw out the treatment as a complete failure would be unethical because it could have helped some of the people.   Thanks to increased visibility, we now have a better idea of the number of transgender people that exist at all stages of transition. Further, social acceptance of trans people (as opposed to seeing them as crazy people who want to mutilate themselves, or dismissing the idea that they are a different gender than originally thought) would also do a great deal of work towards reducing the suicide rate. Removing body/genital dysphoria can only do so much if the world is full of hate and bigots that try to make your life a living hell, and you lack work, health care, and housing because of discrimination. No amount of surgery will fix that, but it's what contributes to the high population suicide rate that the surgery is trying to bring down."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,ArgonNightmare,-2,Sun Jul 12 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"A pretty solid point you make about SRS itself being correlated with and not necessarily causing suicides. But one thing you seem to miss is the fact that mentally ill people need professional help. Perhaps transgender people are not all mentally ill, but acting like there isn't a strong correlation is simply delusional. Discrimination itself is not the primary precipitant of suicides, otherwise suicide rates among black people in the southern US would also have been vastly (10x or more) greater in the times of oppression. Mental illness is. 100% of suicides can be prevented with the right help from doctors. That help does not involve surgery. Surgery does nothing to help fix what is a mental issue. One does not treat Morgellons disease by removing a patient's skin or dysmorphia by lobbing off limbs."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,sunnyta,4,Sun Jul 12 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"i think you're forgetting a major component in all this; the way they are treated. transgendered people are less than accepted by society at large, so it's no wonder so many are suicidal when you take into account the bullying and nasty bullshit they deal with. on top of possibly being fragile due to the dysphoria, it wouldn't take all that much to push someone over the edge, and facing constant strife and contempt from the people around you would definitely do it"
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,ArgonNightmare,-4,Sun Jul 12 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"If they are that ""fragile"" then they should consider professional help. If they consider suicide and have real clinical depression then they should consider professional help. End of story."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,sunnyta,3,Sun Jul 12 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"of course they should seek professional help. transitioning can be a great deal of help in many cases. without the bias against trans people, i'm sure a lot less suicides would happen. imagine being ostracized by most of society, and the damage it would do to you. gender identity dysphoria is a very real phenomenon and it's a struggle to deal with alone obviously"
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,Subrosian_Smithy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and most professionals recommend transition as part of the treatment process for dysphoria.  Paul McHugh is very much an outlier."
TumblrAtRest,3czrwf,Jackibelle,4,Mon Jul 13 07:33:10 2015 UTC,"100% of suicides can be prevented with the right help from doctors.   Though I mostly agree, this statement is so vague as to be scientifically worthless since if a doctor helps and the patient still commits suicide, we can just exclude that by saying ""oh it's not the right help"".  So not worthless in the sense that it is a very good guiding principle: ""try to get people the help they need because it's effective at saving lives"" but it's important to know that the right kind of help differs between people.   dysmorphia   Dysphoria? I've generally heard dysmorphia with things like eating disorders, where someone has body dysmorphia because how they see their body doesn't line up with how it is (like an anorexic person thinking they're bigger than they are, confirmed with stuff like having them walk through special doorways and they'll try to squeeze through even though there's plenty of room). The body is still the same basic shape (all body parts there, no extra primary or secondary sex characteristics).   Perhaps transgender people are not all mentally ill, but acting like there isn't a strong correlation is simply delusional.   which is very different from ""being transgender is a mental illness"" (especially since that carries with it the connotation that it can/should be cured and until it is the people are broken. Love the US' stance on mental illness...)   Discrimination itself is not the primary precipitant of suicides, otherwise suicide rates among black people in the southern US would also have been vastly (10x or more) greater in the times of oppression.   I'm not sure this is entirely true, but I also don't know specifically when you're referring to by ""in the times of oppression"" (slavery? Reconstruction? SJW-2015?). I think scale helps here. If you have one oppressed person and a thousand people living the American dream, it'll seem worse to that person than if you have a hundred oppressed people and a thousand people living the dream. In the first case, they're alone, isolated, no support groups (which, yes, are non-surgical non-hormonal interventions which absolutely help trans people.) and they get to see everyone around them living better lives and being happy. In the second case, it's clear that it still sucks but at least you have other people to commiserate with, lean on for support, etc. The effect on your happiness of the relative well-being of the people around you (i.e. are they doing worse, doing much better, doing about the same) is sizable."

I’m rattled, maybe unfairly, to see so much devotion funneled toward an older author who, though never in danger of presenting himself as a romantic hero, knows exactly how to write one. Green needn’t apologize for his creative skills, of course. But for someone who wants to encourage strong young women, he sure has them eating out of his hand.   A adult woman who writes about books for a living is basically accusing him of mind control. There is a subtext there that he is grooming teenage girls.  The projection is also illuminating. She feels ""icky"", so it is necessarily his fault that she feels that way.  She is basically saying he deserves this for using his skills as a writer effectively. I think there is a resentment there, very much like the stereotype of the fat neckbeard who resents the hot nerd girl and so accuses her of being fake.

When it comes to fields like engineering and math you must be really dedicated to it and it means sacrificing alternatives.  I believe that many women would be great engineers or scientists, but despite having a lot of passion for it eventually chose some other path they find more fulfilling personally. It seems like women are more likely to chose something human-related than something abstract and technology-related. If this is because biology, culture or whatever I don't know.

TumblrAtRest,3cp2m4,windexo,13,Fri Jul 10 02:40:02 2015 UTC,"It used to be for social equality between men and women - the actual definition of feminism still speaks of this meaning. If my remembrance of like, high school history serves (also fact checking on wikipedia - for what that's worth - haha), it was a push for social equality between the sexes, primarily women's suffrage. This was coined by various things (mainly the internet, I think??) as first-wave feminism.  Then there is second-wave feminism, which was still a push for equality, primarily in regards to the reproductive rights of women (i.e aborition, access to birth control, etc.) This also focuses on equality in terms of the workplace (treatment, wage, blah etc) and family roles and like, social norms and stuff - like how it's totally okay if a woman does not want to be a stay at home mom, but have a career. Again, pretty sure the wave thing is coined by the net, but it helps to differentiate, so I'll take it!  The ""feminism"" that you're referring to in your examples is what I think called the third-wave of feminism. This what we commonly refer to on reddit as ""social justice warriors."" These are the people that bash others and bring people down in the name of feminism, solely on the basis of disagreeing with their own beliefs - What they do is not what feminism really is. They are a hate group that operates under the term feminism and has since given it a horrible name.  There are plenty of people who consider themselves feminists because they know what feminism really means - aka it really does mean equality!! Believe it or not. :D People have been trying to differentiate from the word feminism for the very reasons you named - these people have been calling themselves egalitarians! This also means that you stand for the equality of both sexes.   Honestly, if that was the only kind of feminism you were exposed to, it makes sense that you think it is a disgusting movement, because... well, it is. They are pushing their own agenda of oppressing men and anyone that disagrees. That group of ""feminists"" is one that is very vocal and abrasive, to put it lightly.  Men's Rights and Feminist movements do ultimately strive for the same goal - equal rights and treatment of men and women in today's society - though each group goes about it in a different way. The problem is that group of social justice warriors that is so loud, they drown out the rest of us who know what we should actually be fighting for, be it on the men's rights or the (actual definition!) of feminist side of said fence. So men's rights seems all calm and collected while feminism... doesn't. Egalitarian seems to be the new ""word"" for equality of the sexes, and... yeah! I just wanted to learn you a thing, because I didn't want you thinking that those loudmouth rude-pants people were what feminism was supposed to be about. :)"
TumblrAtRest,3cp2m4,ladyundaria,3,Fri Jul 10 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"Wow...that was actually really interesting. It's a shame the only thing people are exposed to are SJW's. That's probably why so many people go to places like r/MensRights instead of r/Feminism when theoretically they are the same people. Might change, Men's Rights is being brigaded pretty heavily right now and no admin can step in because than it would look like censorship."
TumblrAtRest,3cp2m4,Gyroo-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"Equality is certainly the goal of both feminism and the mrm, but saying that they should be fighting for the same thing is like saying that republicans and democrats should be fighting for the same thing because they both want to create a better society.  Defining feminism as a movement which seeks for gender equality is very reductionist."
TumblrAtRest,3cp2m4,ladyundaria,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:45:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe I didn't articulate myself well enough! Democrats and Republicans do, in a sense, strive for the same end goal - they just go about it in a different way, in the way that they feel is best. Men's Rights focuses more on the issues that men have in today's society, whereas feminism does the place focus on women's end of things. But the other sex is able to benefit from these goals, and does, a lot of the time! For example, in calling out societal standards women are held to such as being extremely thin, the men's side of the issue is brought to light and addressed as well (at least it has in the discussions I've had!) That is why I had said they ultimately strive for the same end.  I apologize if I oversimplified. I didn't think I had in my hasty typing of the novel you replied to!"

If he's a decent dude, he'll at least stop doing it around you, or he'll talk to you about why he does it. If he refuses to communicate with you or acts like there can't possibly be anything unacceptable about his behavior, you'll know that he's likely a douche. Communication, people.   And as for the feminism thing, I think it's legit to not be as into someone if they don't share your values, though there's a difference between not liking third-wave/Tumblr feminism and straight-up misogyny.

A few users on 4chan decided to use the ponies as their avatars, since they thought it was super cute. This was the start of ""The Great Pony 4chan War"". Internet users had flamed each other and sent derogatory pictures to each other. At this time one of the moderators of the website had banned anything pony related from the site as a means to stop the fighting. After some amount of time, the moderator who enlisted the ban had been relieved from his position and users were now free to post anything pony they wanted within their own board /mlp/.

Victorian england was named after the ruling queen Victoria, who ruled the brittish empire - a time when england exploited and controlled much of the globe. The justification of this was cloaked in the same logic many of these racist SJW use, especially when confronted with a minotity with an opposing opinion. Justified with The white man's burden: look here and see these poor uneducated even opressed(ironically) people. We must oiberate them from their backward thinking my colonizing their lands and usurping their leadership.

Only thing is that now this new sort claims that restricting the influence and spread of a minority's culture is to protect said culture from bigotry. On the term victorian i shoild have been more clear that i was refering to the term's modern connotations. In retrospect the gender related things i mentioned may have been irrelevant and in some reguards, inaccurate due to the rising influence of the suffragettes towards the end of the victorian era.

TumblrAtRest,3cfl01,AnticaRocker,11,Wed Jul 8 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"Great article. However, there is one subsection of ""cultural appropriation"" that I find to be valid, and that is costume.  In everyday life, I think it's perfectly fine for someone of any race to wear dreads, kimonos, whatever traditional and cultural clothing they want; but if you dress as a specific group as a form of costume, that becomes appropriation. Being a Mexican for Halloween? That's sketchy. But just wearing traditional Mexican clothes because you like the clothes? You're good."
TumblrAtRest,3cfl01,TopHatPaladin,10,Tue Jul 7 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"But what if your dreads or clothing are part of a costume of a specific person? Is it cultural appropriation to dress up like Bob Marley, or just if you dress up as Jamaican?   And is it not cultural appropriation when people of color dress up like Anglo-Saxon knights and royalty?"
TumblrAtRest,3cfl01,BaadKitteh,12,Tue Jul 7 23:53:29 2015 UTC,"As I see it, dressing as a specific individual is fine, so dressing as Bob Marley specifically wouldn't be cultural appropriation.  Dressing as a ""profession"" (like your knight/royalty example) is a bit trickier, and I had to mull it over for a bit, but I think my conclusion is that it's not cultural appropriation as long as the focus of the costume is on the profession, not the group with whom that profession is associated. Relatedly, I think dissociation from the ethnic group is central to the point: so dressing as, say, a geisha is fine as long as it's not trying to depict all Japanese people as geishas. Likewise, dressing as a Viking would be fine unless the implication was that all Swedes or Danes go around pillaging in boats.  Great questions, though! It's definitely spurred me to consider more of the nuances in my stance."
TumblrAtRest,3cfl01,TopHatPaladin,8,Wed Jul 8 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"So if someone dresses in traditional Mexican clothes, what's the ""implication""? That all Mexicans dress that way? Of course not. That some Mexicans (used to) dress that way, and that it looks cool? Well yeah, that's just how it is, there's no lie being told there.   Country borders are completely artificial anyway... what if a Belgian dresses in traditional Dutch clothing? Back when that was regularly worn, they were the same country. What if a Texan dresses up like an 1820s Mexican? Texas was Mexico in the 1820s! What if a Mexican dresses up like a Texan cowboy? Is that bad? What if a Mexican dresses up like an American to show his gratitude for the country that gave him new life opportunities? What if an American dresses like a Mexican for the same reason?  What if a French person dresses in German lederhosen? That can't be racist, people from both countries have the same looks. What if  Bosnian person dresses in lederhosen? That can't be oppression, Bosnian are the oppressed ones, right — but can it be racism? They're both white, right? But Bosnians aren't even ""white"" according to the people oppressing them in their own country, they're seen as a completely different race.   What if a southern German dresses like a northern German? Ask any German person, they're two completely different cultures. Is that oppression or appropriation?  What if an Indian person dresses British for Halloween? That's appropriating dress and a foreign holiday, but India was oppressed by the UK for years, so does that make it okay? But what if it's vice versa?   And... how can you, personally, tell if a person dressing up doesn't have roots in the other culture? I've seen enough stories online of people being berated and even shamed for dressing up in cultural outfits, when they were actually part of that culture.   Oh, and hey, how do you feel about people dressing up as pirates? You know, those raping, murdering, thieving, massacring, horrible criminals of the past that are now represented with an eyepatch and a stupid parrot, for laughs?  It's much more complicated than you think, and what's more — there is usually no harm in just dressing up. It grants perspective, it opens dialogue. No one who dresses up is expressing ""every single person from this group acts and dresses exactly like this"". Why would you ascribe that opinion to anyone? Even the most stereotypical costume is just a way to have fun. It doesn't glorify stereotyping, it mocks stereotyping, it plays around with it. And, for people who like to put a bit more thought in it, it's a way to cope with cultural lack of understanding and to express their curiosity for whatever they're dressing up as."

I hate when people say, 'you can only make rape jokes if it's making fun of the rapist and not the victim or the act itself,' or 'you can only make offensive jokes when its part of some social commentary,' or 'you can only make jokes about people who have it better than you, i.e., punching upwards, not punching downwards.'

There was low-level fighting on the frontiers until 1812, when the UK joined the Shawnee Tecumseh's confederacy in full-scale war on the USA.   After their defeat by the Americans, relations returned to frontier skirmishing, until 1830, when US President Andrew Jackson ordered the removal of all Indians east of the Mississippi River to Oklahoma. This was the Trail of Tears, and is the lowest moment in American history.   After that atrocity, there was 'peace' of sorts, until the settlement of the Great Plains began in earnest, after the Civil War. The colonization, and the intercontinental railroad that facilitated it, required the 'acquisition' of Indian land, which prompted the conflicts captured in American legends: Cowboys vs. Indians.   After a brief (>30 years) struggle, the last of the free Indian tribes were rounded up and 'resettled' on reservations, where they've been ever since."
TumblrAtRest,3c55o5,Pychoification,5,Sat Jul 4 22:37:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, thank you! My history knowledge sucks, obviously.

I do not think any indian tribe will care so much about the independent day enough to be pissed off about it. If anything, they would probably ignore the day, or celebrate it just for the partying aspect.   Only holiday I can think of that they may be mad about, is Thanksgiving, since it includes them and over-glorify the events that actually happened. But I digress.  TIL!"
TumblrAtRest,3c55o5,Parker_I,5,Sat Jul 4 22:59:06 2015 UTC,"Well yeah thanksgiving is super screwed up for native peoples. I can see people being upset about the 4th because the US without the British was way worse to the natives than before. In fact, the natives often fought for the British side (although that has less to do with the British treating them, but more to do with the British falsely promising them concessions if they helped)  However, we did fight the Revolutionary War over a few things that affected the natives. For example, one of the things that the British did that pissed the Colonies off was to set a line (I can't remember the name of it) in the west that the colonies could not expand beyond. Because we wanted to move westward (which eventually, under Jackson, lead to things like the Trail of Tears), we fought back against the british for our independence.  So the OP isn't really wrong that our independence had something to do with the natives, but she isn't right either, because celebrating the fourth of July is at best tangentially related to native oppression.   So what I'm saying is we shouldn't judge her for refusing to partake in celebration, because it might make sense why she doesn't want to. But blogging on tumblr about it on some kind of crusade is pretty dumb.   Especially when she pretends to be Native American when she isn't. That's what reveals this as the tumblr version of karmawhoring."

I was never big on any holiday.  Either my family did nothing for them, or everyone fought.  So it means nothing to me, especially being out of the house.  I work third shift though, and even though we don't get this holiday off, it happened to fall on my normal day off do in trying to 'sleep in',  but I bet you can imagine how well that's working.

The soldiers in the Northeast were already busy rearranging and disappearing Native Americans on the map. Sullivan's March through Pennsylvania and New York took place in 1778 and 1779.   Sullivan's army carried out a scorched earth campaign, methodically destroying at least forty Iroquois villages throughout the Finger Lakes region of western New York, to put an end to Iroquois and Loyalist attacks against American settlements as had occurred the previous year of 1778 such as the Cobleskill, Wyoming Valley and Cherry Valley massacres. The survivors fled to British regions in Canada and the Niagara Falls and Buffalo areas.[1] The devastation created great hardships for the thousands of Iroquois refugees who fled the region to shelter under British military protection outside Fort Niagara that winter, and many starved or froze to death, despite attempts by the overstressed resources of the British authorities to import food and provide shelter.  The Sullivan Expedition devastated the Iroquois crops and towns and left them dependent upon the mercy of the British for the harsh winter of 1779.   I live near Newtown and a few minutes from Tioga. The history of the area's roads and byways are plastered with historic plaques about Sullivan's campaign. It was kind of brutal."

TumblrAtRest,3bzoda,bam2_89,-5,Fri Jul 3 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"You have valid points, but there are other elements at work here.   How would you factor in women's under-representation, or the fact that many of the things people are citing come from historically sexist ways of thinking (e.g. women can't be expected to support themselves, women aren't fit for combat and should be barred from it, a woman couldn't possibly hurt a man, etc)? Or that women are far more at risk for violence and assault at the hands of men than the other way around? Or the fact that the policies people are listing are decided upon and enforced by men?  To me, it seems like you're grouping together legal rights and ""oppression"" as in social power dynamics with the variety of issues you're presenting. I would argue these things don't always overlap."
TumblrAtRest,3bzoda,eai36,7,Fri Jul 3 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"You're starting wit the presumption that men and women are both equally suited to the exact same things and that the only system that would be ideal is one in which roles and outcomes are identical. Why is that necessarily superior to one in which our differences are taken into account? How are the policies ""decided on and enforced by men?"" Do women not vote? Do women not make largely the same decisions when put in positions of authority?"
TumblrAtRest,3bzoda,sunnyta,2,Fri Jul 3 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that it's very difficult to tell the difference between natural gravitation based on strengths and artificial gaps created by discriminatory policies when we haven't had a lot of time since many barriers were lifted. There are a variety of careers and practices women were specifically disallowed from doing up until the 1980s. That's relatively recent, and too soon to say the differences are natural because we've been seeing upwards trends vs stable numbers of women in certain careers, leadership, and political positions in subsequent decades. I don't agree that the sexes are equal in all things across the board, but I'm not going to accept that the distributions we see today are all due to that.  Women do vote, but policies are largely decided upon by elected representatives and enforced by appointed judges, not voters. Women are a minority in political positions (24% state legislature and 20% congress)  and judicial positions (33%). Again, we cannot say that this is because men are just naturally better suited to politics vs the fact that there have historically been far more barriers to entry for women in politics. There just hasn't been enough time and we're seeing upward trends vs static.  Moreover, I'm saying that it's possible for a group to be legally equal without being socially equal. For example, technically all American citizens are entitled to the same rights, but there's no way you could say that every race is socially treated the same way or put on the same level. It's more complicated than legal rights."

TumblrAtRest,3bzoda,sunnyta,2,Sat Jul 4 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"Women were not allowed to vote in the US until 1920.  The 1963 commission by the Kennedy Administration The American Woman noted discrimination against women in the areas of education, home and community services, employment, social insurance and taxation, and legal, civil and political rights.  The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibited employers from paying men and women different wages for the same job.  Prior to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, it was difficult for a woman to establish an independent line of credit without a husband to cosign. The Act removed this barrier.  In 1961, in Hoyt v Florida, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the state of Florida not to call women to serve on juries and that a woman could only serve on jury if she filed a written declaration to be eligible for the service. This decision wasn’t overturned until 1975 with Taylor v Louisiana.  Marital rape was not criminalized until precedent was set by cases such as the 1984 New York Court of Appeals case the People v Liberta that stated a marriage license is not a license to have sex with a wife. Previously, marital rape was exempt from rape prosecution because rape of a woman was defined as forcible intercourse by a man on a woman not his wife.  The case Reed vs. Reed  in 1971 was the first time the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment also applied to treatment of women and that it meant you could not treat someone differently based on their sex. This officially overturned previous decisions such as Bradwell vs. Illinois which allowed women to be barred from practicing law based on her gender.  Women in law has historically been another issue due to cases such as Bradwell vs. Illinois and the fact that many law schools did not admit women, some up until the 1960s. They have historically faced barriers to entry and official investigations in the 60s and 70s had found that there was active discrimination taking place. It wasn’t until 1920  that women were allowed to practice law in every state.  Before the The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 women could be let go from their jobs for becoming pregnant, and  it was the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 that mandated maternity leave on a federal level.  Women were not allowed to enter the Boston Marathon until 1972  Women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993.  This isn't everything, but this is what I have time for now."

TumblrAtRest,3bzoda,bam2_89,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"only the wealthy could vote before then, so that's a bit of a moot point.   By 1856, that was not true.  You asked how it was women were being oppressed as recent as this century (in the US). How is being denied the right to vote not oppression?   the equal pay act isn't necessarily evidence of oppression. In fact, it's the complete opposite and was an attempt to curb the perceived discrepancies in wages, which was never proven.   Did you read the commission?  And oh my god...it isn't about ""getting to avoid jury duty"", it's about the constitutional right to a jury of your peers. Furthermore, it's about specifically prohibiting women from doing something that men can do freely.  Just to clarify, in your opinion, being denied the right to vote, being barred from practicing law (and by extension, politics), not being allowed to establish your own line of credit independent of man, having no protection from rape by your husband because he is considered entitled to sex from you by marriage, and having employers be allowed to pay you less for the same work is no evidence that women were disadvantaged compared to men and considered inferior to them?  In your opinion, since 1910, women have been considered equal in importance and intelligence to men, and the attitude towards women working outside the home or being in leadership positions was no different than the attitude towards men who worked outside the home or who held leadership positions?  Since 1910, women have not been actively discouraged from the majority of lines of work that a man could have and they faced no significant social stigma for having such occupations?  Women have not been considered inferior to men since 1910?"

Black people realized that they should vote for Black people right after the 15th Amendment, so it can't be that men aren't adequate representatives for both men and women. Only federal judges are exclusively appointees. About half of the states in the union elect their judges, not counting retention. The balance of politicians is also going to be strongly affected by the balance of lawyers, for which there are no additional barriers to entry."

But you're contending that the current distribution of jobs and leadership positions is just because men are naturally better for those roles?

My statement was about violence, not specifically domestic violence, although that is an area that we should be taking note of and I believe more men should be encouraged to come forward because women are absolutely capable of evil and abuse.

I don't think that one gender is dominant over the other, but I'll return to that topic.  The nature and degree of these various inequalities varies heavily with environment, and will be nearly non-existent in some places (well, in terms of actual effect on day to day life, and taken in a historical context, they're already almost non existent, but I digress).  I want to take a moment to define environment as including your physical locale, but also your social surroundings - compare Tumblr to Reddit or a Church to a University, even if all of these comparisons are in the same town.  These inequalities are numerous, but minor in most contexts. In certain environments the burden of not being raped is put on a girl and the choices she makes regarding clothing and intoxicants. In many environments there's this quiet assertion that men are inferior at nurturing children and those who challenge this are viewed with suspicion.  I don't feel that, in this location, I need to make a whole lot of examples, and that's convenient for me. Fill in the blank with any societal double standard regarding gender and it should serve my point well enough.  Now the thing I wanted to get back to is that it's not really technically correct to say one gender oppresses another (in the majority of cases in first world countries). That implies a sort of organized, conscious malice that you see extremely rarely. Rather, it's a sort of monolithic cultural inertia that's still at play.  Despite the fact that I consider it essential to understand this before you can call yourself an egalitarian, it's not so easily digested. Because the relative equality of women in society is very new, temporally speaking, the dominant interpretation is that women are still the oppressed class. That ""still"" is important, it's the cultural inertia at play again: it's the historic default state, a sort of interpretive rounding error.  tl;dr: ""women are oppressed"" doesn't do justice to the nuanced reality, but it's the dominant interpretation thanks to cultural inertia, and despite egalitarian efforts."

TumblrAtRest,3bwkd4,websnwigs,8,Fri Jul 3 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. Hahah. Oh man, thanks for that fantastic last line.  But seriously, I absolutely 100% am on board with the idea that men have it really fucking shitty in so many areas of their life. Trust me, I know that. Both from seeing statistics presented in articles like this (which, for people who haven't seen them, are good to hear about) and also from talking with men in my life.  Trust me, I'm totally on the side of men. And I'm also on the side of women. And the fact that people seem to think those are two different sides is awful, and thats what I was trying to push against.  ""Men face plenty of sexism and discrimination"" is a totally fine title. I would be equally upset to see something like ""Women face more discrimination than men"" because it doesn't fucking matter who has more. This isn't the Oppression Olympics, and you don't need to win by collecting the most oppression points on your punch card.  I'm not trying to dismiss or discredit anything. I'm trying to help course adjust what looks like a really angry movement to something more productive, just like I do on the other side. Us vs Them doesn't lead to useful discussions, it leads to name calling and attacks (like your statement about my supposed ""precious victim narrative"" that I guess I have now? TIL)"

Are you serious? If this were true, it would absolutely matter. Someone dying from a gunshot wound is more important than someone with the flu. The problem is feminists know this, and use this and various other victim narratives to gain sympathy for their cause. Therefore, comparisons like this are useful for exposing their bullshit as exactly that."
TumblrAtRest,3bwkd4,websnwigs,6,Fri Jul 3 17:41:55 2015 UTC,"If I have the ability to treat both the gunshot wound and the flu, then I should do both. There's no sense in saying one of them is worse than the other unless you're trying to allocate extremely limited resources to deal with the problem.  We have plenty of resources, getting thrown every which way. And the vast majority are getting thrown at things which are completely outside this sphere; look at how much time, attention, and money <insert celebrity here> gets.  Since we have more resources than we need to deal with this, it becomes a game of convincing people that they should spend resources on <insert cause X here>. Unfortunately, language like ""X has it worse than Y"" makes it into a competition; it's no longer about trying to get resources, it's about trying to take resources from someone else. Which is a shitty fucking thing to do."
TumblrAtRest,3bwkd4,Jackibelle,-1,Fri Jul 3 18:04:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, language like ""X has it worse than Y"" makes it into a competition   No shit. We agree on this point. Where we disagree is this article turning it into a competition. I'm saying it was already an Oppression Olympics starting with the feminists, and articles like this are using comparisons to show that it's not a compettion, and women aren't the poor helpless victims feminists are making them out to be. That's it."
TumblrAtRest,3bwkd4,websnwigs,3,Fri Jul 3 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"starting with the feminists   Two wrongs don't make a right. If you want to be better than ""the feminists"", don't use the same shady tactics you're complaining they're using. Plain and simple. As I said, I happily call out feminists trying to spin things the other way, but that's not what's going on here, so I can't really have a conversation against a person that doesn't exist now can I? But all of your posts are laced with tons of anger, which makes us vs. them comparisons really appealing to hear, because if the ""other side"" is evil then your hate for them is justified. And that makes it significantly harder to reach compromises or understandings or middle grounds or anything other than more and more hatred.  The language in the title is unnecessarily hostile/confrontational. That's what I'm saying. And it sounds like you agree, but see it as an acceptable practice because ""they did it first!"", which stopped being an acceptable excuse for pretty much everything once we got out of kindergarten."
TumblrAtRest,3bwkd4,Jackibelle,0,Fri Jul 3 18:30:50 2015 UTC,Someone dying from a gunshot wound is more important than someone with the flu   Yeah but someone dying from two gunshot wounds is not more important than someone dying from just one gunshot wound.  Neither should be having gunshot wounds and so that needs to be fixed.

I bet if this article was about how women have it worse, you'd be saying the same thing I did.

Both sexes have to struggle because of preconceived notions about them, purely based on what genitals they were born with.

However, if you really wish to quibble over semantics, you described her as very levelheaded—   levelheaded: having or showing an ability to think clearly and to make good decisions   While questioning her sanity—   sane: of sound mind; not mad or mentally ill  sanity: the ability to think and behave in a normal and rational manner; sound mental health   Or do you feel a person who is mentally ill can also think clearly and make good decisions?  Seriously, though, unless you're suggesting that subscription to a personal god draws into question an individual's mental health, I'm not really certain what your position is. In comparison to both other openly religious people, and her demographic of Tumblr users, this girl shows that she is of remarkably sound mind."

This is basically the ""slippery slope"" in article form.  At the rally celebrating the Supreme Court decision in West Hollywood, speakers were sure to emphasize that while this is a time to celebrate, the fight is far from over. Gay people can still be fired from their jobs and denied housing in many states, to say nothing of the issues trans people face. And that's just in the LGBT community!  The ""culture warriors"" problem he also frames exclusively as an issue with the Left - a partisan approach. I'd argue that the bigger culture warriors are those on the Religious Right; NR currently has another article defending Bristol Palin from criticism calling her hypocritical - even though she accepts fees to give speeches and advocates abstinence-only education while she is currently pregnant with her second(!) child out of wedlock. Not to mention prominent voices on the right defending the likes of Josh Duggar...

It's important to keep in mind that the ""slippery slope"" is a frequently-abused argument, not one that is automatically wrong.  To stick with just the current example, back circa 2006, right-wingers were mocked mercilessly when they speculated that accepting gay marriage would mean that businesses or churches would be coerced into servicing same-sex ceremonies contra their religious objections.   For anyone old enough to remember, ""lol, that's bonkers,"" was pretty much the general sentiment at the time. Fastforward to 2015, however, and the first one is already established law in many jurisdictions, and the second (stripping churches of tax-exempt status if they don't perform same-sex marriages) is a subject of live debate.  I'm hardly a conservative myself, but I'm having a hard time calling their paranoia here completely unreasonable."

You can't ""compromise with culture warriors,"" fine. But the Huckabees and Santorums on the right are culture warriors, too. Ted Cruz is pushing for an amendment to ban same-sex marriage nationally.   This article also conflates gay rights activists with ""social justice warriors,"" which I take issue with as well."

The left is now hypocritically engaged in even worse offenses than Joe McCarthy could ever get away with, and the press defends them. See: Bahar Mustafa and Connie St. Louis vs Tim hunt.  Having spent 20 years openly Jewish in the southern exurbs and rural areas hanging out with rednecks, their vilification and memory-hole-ing of the rebel flag is a disgusting attack on their cultural heritage.  These hypocrites will in the same breath rail against the marginalization of gays and their cultural symbols while attacking symbols of southern pride as ""racist"".  It is naked tribalism.  TL;DR When the press gives the SJW left the same skepticism and ridicule as the religious right, the equivalence you are drawing will no longer be false."

The latter certainly wields more power than the former. Secondly, I'd argue that in the Bush administration (especially the 2004 election won on social issues, specifically gay marriage) the right had a bit more actual clout - getting Rather fired, passing anti-gay amendments, Michael Moore as a sort of national joke, etc.  I don't doubt many view the Confederate flag as an icon of southern pride. But - and I say this with extreme caution due to the word's reception in these parts - I feel like it comes from a place of privilege to not view the Confederate Battle Flag as an icon devoid of racism. As a political symbol, the flag we know today was hijacked by the KKK in the 50s and 60s. We avoid swastikas in the West nowadays because of Nazi Germany; it's hard not to look at the Confederate Flag in the same way... and I'm white.  It's not naked tribalism to support inclusion of marginalized groups, namely LGBT individuals. And southern pride? Well - it does have an uncomfortable history with racism. And it hasn't really been addressed.   In Germany today, when there's a Neo-Nazi rally, ten times the amount of people come out to counter-protest the Neo-Nazis.

The klan wrapped themselves in an already popular symbol of libertarian rebellion used by the likes of rum runners, bikers, truckers, and outlaws. The klan did this because they were a major political force at the time not unlike feminists today and wanted to associate themselves with rugged individualist iconography.   it's hard not to look at the Confederate Flag in the same way   The rebel flag is closer to the jolly roger in heritage than the swastika.    How about we crusade against the jolly roger as a symbol of rape and murder and cast everyone who supports P2P as violent and misogynistic because of pirate captains like blackbeard.   t does have an uncomfortable history with racism.   The current stars&stripes was flown by the US cavalry as it exterminated 90% of the native american population, and flew over japanese internment camps during WWII. Clearly the flag is associated with racism and genocide and should be banned.   n Germany today, when there's a Neo-Nazi rally, ten times the amount of people come out to counter-protest the Neo-Nazis. I view Americans' actions towards the flag today as a similar action   Except polls show the number of supporters outnumber those seeking to memory-hole this flag by between 5 and 15%.  The more conservative orgs polling put it at 70/30 against abolition, the more liberal ones barely reach 50/50. Not one year ago half a dozen southern states introduced vanity plates bearing the rebel flag to mild acclaim. Keep in mind these polls don't isolate their sample pool to the south, either.

TumblrAtRest,3bsksc,vvarden,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:16:19 2015 UTC,"When I said privilege, I was specifically referring to how the flag is viewed. It's never been used in a way to oppress whites - which is why many view it as a sign of southern pride. But 72% of blacks see it as a sign of racism - and there's a reason for that, maybe we should talk about it (and not fly it from state grounds).  Again - I am not talking about banning the flag - just its removal from state grounds.  The Confederacy didn't even last a decade. It broke off from the U.S. under the auspices of ""states' rights"" which, in effect, was just a way to continue slavery. The ""ideals"" of the Confederacy will always be inextricably linked with bondage and subjugation. While the Union Jack and Star Spangled Banner have uncomfortable pasts as well, there's a huge difference between the flags. There's a history of bad, but there's also a history of good - and the flags are supposed to stand for the good.  That's why the Nazi flag is such an apt comparison. The Third Reich didn't last that long, and no matter the heritage of Germany during the time, the red, white, and black is forever linked to the anti-Semitism and fascism of Hitler's rule. Whatever good it stood for is so overshadowed that it's not worth flying - and for many in this country, the Battle Flag is viewed in a similar way.  Erasing history isn't the answer. Taking Dukes of Hazzard off of TV is silly. But we can criticize that without painting all people who view the flag in a negative light as crazies, and we don't have to imply support by flying the flag from government grounds or including it in state flags.   Except polls show the number of supporters outnumber those seeking to memory-hole this flag   I'm not a fan of this argument. A decade ago, the majority thought I shouldn't get married."

If we're going to ban the flag based on what an outside group thinks, then clearly we can ban rap too, as most non-blacks consider it vulgar and profane.   The ""ideals"" of the Confederacy will always be inextricably linked with bondage and subjugation   And the ""ideals"" of high seas piracy will always be inextricably linked with pillaging, rape and murder.  I still don't see how this corresponds to the flags of EITHER faction as used in the second half of the 20th century and beyond.  Maybe you think lazy town's ""you are a pirate"" is teaching kids to rob, murder, and terrorize cruise liners?   That's why the Nazi flag is such an apt comparison.   Keep clinging to this false analogy, despite my having thoroughly demonstrated it false.  ""guilt by association"" is a common sin of tumblrinas.

With the rap thing, you're trying to equate tyranny of the majority with something that impacts a minority. There's more whites than blacks, just as there are more straights than gays. Saying ""hey, maybe we shouldn't fly this flag from statehouse grounds because of its historical use to oppress us"" is pretty similar to ""hey, maybe you shouldn't forbid two people who love each other from getting married because of their gender"". When people can empathize, they can understand.  As for the piracy thing, that's a bit of a stretch. Slavery, segregation, and racism have left deep scars in our nation which haven't fully healed yet - and the confederate flag represents that to many people. Piracy isn't nearly as ingrained in our nation."
TumblrAtRest,3bsksc,ev1lb1t,2,Fri Jul 3 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"tyranny of the majority   That references the majority acting to substantively harm a minority within society.  That flag, no matter where it flies, does no harm.  Offense is not substantive harm. It's also being taken in this case, not given.  The duke brothers' car had the rebel flag because they were fighting corrupt government authority, not because they were racist.  The entire argument against the rebel flag is reminding me of the silencing of academic faculty using the paranoid lunatic excuse of ""micro-aggressions"".   Now, How about tyranny of the minority?   Explain to me why a vocal minority should be allowed to dictate the actions of others in a democratic republic.     Slavery, segregation, and racism have left deep scars in our nation which haven't fully healed yet - and the confederate flag represents that to many people.   And homosexual marriage represents depravity, decay, and a moral threat to society to many people. Do we ban that?  You are advocating a hypocritical double-standard by which it's justifiable to have the subjective morality of a minority rammed down the majority's throat in one case, but not the other.  So which is it.. do minorities get to impinge upon the liberty of others, thus justifying the anti-gay lobby, or do they not, thus invalidating the anti-confederate push?"

Just like the holiday season in government spaces representing all religions equally, taxpayer-funded property should be respectful.  The Dukes of Hazzard being removed from TV Land I agree! It's stupid! I'm not in support of that! It doesn't really do anything. Apple pulling everything - even civil war games - from its App Store is silly too. But when people conflate my position (which is fairly reasonable, I think) with the ban-it-all position, well - that's pretty dishonest and unfair.   Disney's got Song of the South pretty tightly locked up. Dukes isn't racist at all, but given Charleston and the black church arsons, I can understand WB's position, while not necessarily agreeing."

TumblrAtRest,3blon5,c74r3byw,2,Tue Jun 30 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"At the same time, everyone experiences sexism (regardless of sex) and racism (regardless of race) but there's no groups saying ""Be proud to be a white male."" or ""Don't consider yourself a possible rapist just because you're a man."""
TumblrAtRest,3blon5,HatedSovietLion,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think there are a few groups going around saying ""Be proud you're a white male"" and I've yet to see them not be actual hate groups? Is there anything to be proud of when we're already they are mostly the ones who have created institutions that have treated women and other races poorly? Men complain about women always getting the children in court cases, but disregard the fact that most of these laws were made by men because women were only seen suitable to raise a house and children.. and that is all.  I disagree entirely with the sentiment that just because you're a man you're a rapist however. I'm not sure how there can be a whole ideology stating that whilst it tries to relate itself back to an accredited ideology of gender equality.  People should be judged on their actions, not on their gender."
TumblrAtRest,3blon5,c74r3byw,8,Tue Jun 30 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"That's my point. If I ever say ""I'm proud to be white."" People are gonna assume I'm a neo-nazi or Klu Klux Klan member. I'm not saying I'm prouder to be white than I would be being black. But we have all these people saying ""Be proud you're black. Be proud you're hispanic. Be proud you're a woman."" and we always talk about the victim complex. But truly, I'm a little more worried about the next generation of white men who will start to view themselves as racists and sexists and serial killers and oppressors and nothing more because the radical progressive movements just talk about how horrible we are.  The ""Don't consider yourself a possible rapist"" statement had more to do with the ""Teach men not to rape."" belief. It applies that we're rapists until taught otherwise. Just as ""Teach women not to dress like that"" is dumb because it isn't their fault or ""Teach women not to have sex"" is dumb because they're their own individuals. I think we as a society need to take a large step back from race or sex and try to bring all of us to an equal understanding instead of just trying to fix wrongs of the past, we need to prevent wrongs of the future."

That's a pretty good twist on it, but surely it's just a retort to the age old adage of ""if a woman didn't want to be raped she shouldn't have"" as opposed to a personal insult on your gender? Woman are constantly, and have been constantly warned about what they wear and how they should act to prevent another person's actions harming them which is an absolutely ridiculous notion when you think about it? I can obviously only speak from my nation as a whole but I'm not sure there same rigorous preaching equivalent for men but I could be mistaken!  Women and POC probably don't approve of white pride because they  have seen the consequences of systematic white male privilege, though there is no doubt that now with the radical fringes of this 'modern feminism' movement boys will soon be subjected to abuse purely because of their gender, and this truly saddens me."

Men are physically bigger and have junk between their legs which means their natural sitting position is different. That's not to mean he shouldn't try to sit at a slightly more considerate position if public transport is busy, to make room. Whatever, not every man that spreads his legs has chronic back pain and tight pants on, it's just how he sits naturally, this article is pandering to a non-issue, there's no point trying to defend or explain or excuse something that is simply down to an individual's manners and personal comfort."

But then, why wouldn't he sit in the handicap spot? I see them all the time on the buses and subways here in Canada.  And I have nothing against either gender spreading their legs on a transit that is not full, where it doesn't matter because not all the seats are needed.  But if a bus is packed, why should anyone get to take up more than one seat (or at least the amount of seats needed for how wide they are, whatever)?  THATS the problem with spreading your legs on transit. Literally the only problem. I don't know why it's really a feminist issue, but whatever."

That seems unlikely, especially since PTSD was first studied in male soldiers.

It links though to another post which links here  http://psychohistory.com/books/the-origins-of-war-in-child-abuse/chapter-2-why-males-are-more-violent/  The title looks like some shit, but reading a few bits, it seems legit enough.  The relevant passage is this:   The only neurobiological condition inherited by boys that affects later violence is they have a smaller corpus callosum, the part of the brain that connects the right and the left hemisphere.16 The larger corpus callosum of infant girls allows them to work through trauma and neglect more easily than boys. Furthermore, boys who are abused had a 25 percent reduction in sections of the corpus callosum, while girls did not.17 This means boys actually need more love and caretaking than girls as they grow up. If they do not receive enough interpersonal attention from their caretakers they suffer from damaged prefrontal cortices (self control, empathy) and from hyperactive amygdalae (fear centers), their corpus callosum is reduced further, and they have reduced serotonin levels (calming ability) and increased corticosterone production (stress hormone). All these factors make them have weak selves, reduced empathy, less control over impulsive violence and far more fears than girls.18  The central psychobiological question, then, is this: Are boys given more love and attention than girls by their caretakers in order to help them offset their greater needs? The answer, of course, is just the opposite: boys are given less care and support, from everyone in the family and in society, and they are abused far more than girls, so by the time they are three years of age they become twice as violent as girls.19 Boys’ greater violence by this time, including their propensity to form dominance gangs and to endlessly “play war,” are the results of their greater abuse and distancing by adults and being subject to demands to “grow up” and “be manly” and “not be a crybaby” and not need attachments—attitudes taught by their parents, teachers and coaches. By age four boys’ play is full of provocations that test their self-worth: “At 4 years of age, girls’ insults to one another are infrequent and minor…Boy/boy insults, however, are numerous and tough.”20 The so-called “aggressiveness” usually ascribed to boys is in fact wholly defensive, as they try to ward off their greater feelings of insecurity and hopelessness.21 It isn’t “aggression” males display; it’s bravado—defensive testing and disproof of their fears."

TumblrAtRest,3be1e9,VredeJohn,0,Tue Jul 14 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"You have to make the distinction between feelings and thoughts. You don't feel like you passed. You feel like you did a good job on the exam, and without any evidence the suggest otherwise, you conclude (think) that you passed.  Your conclusion is incorrect, but the emotions are very real. How you feel about your exam can be based on a lot of things, and a lot of them are irrational. If you are afraid of spiders or heights, the fear isn't ""incorrect"" simply because ""there's nothing to be afraid of,"" and if you are sad because your favorite character died, you're not ""fake sad"" just because it ""didn't really happen."" Feelings are a product of incredibly complex brain chemistry, and you can't label an emotion as ""incorrect"" simply because they aren't based on physical facts.  Transgender people are aware of the facts. They are perfectly capable of registering the body they are born into. But for some reason, they feel uncomfortable in their own skin. There is definitely a deterministic reason why they feel this way (their neurons are firing in a way that deviates from the norm), and you can argue that transgenderism is a neurological disorder. But if we are unable (or unwilling) to fix this disorder, to change how people feel about their bodies, the next best thing is to give them something approximating the physical form they feel like they should have. To make their lives less uncomfortable.  Saying that the feelings of transgender people are ""incorrect"" is pretty much the same as telling a depressed person that they shouldn't be sad, because they don't have anything to be sad about. And if you do that, you are a bigot and a twat."
TumblrAtRest,3be1e9,HONKFRIEND,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"Saying that the feelings of transgender people are ""incorrect"" is pretty much the same as telling a depressed person that they shouldn't be sad, because they don't have anything to be sad about.    I concede that telling a depressed person they shouldn't feel sad is a shitty thing to do. Because it doesn't work. But this is just what I understand ""incorrect feelings"" to mean - an evaluation of how well the feelings match the actual state of the world not a prescription about what this evaluation implies.  So yes, telling depressed and trans people that they should stop feeling what they feel because they are mistaken is shitty.   you can argue that transgenderism is a neurological disorder.   Well, my impression from seeing how Twitter, Tumblr and blogosphere discusses this (and nudging public speech codes towards) was that even suggesting the fact that it's a disorder will get you labeled a bigot and maybe even a fascist. My bet it is that GID (gender identity disorder) will get removed from future versions of the DSM so as not to offend. We don't want to be bigoted, right?  It's the same with ""acceptance"" movements. In certain circles it's incorrect to say that obesity is unhealthy and to state the fact that most people find obese people unattractive. It is claimed, instead, that obese people are simply differently-bodied, and that the only reason why most people are more attracted to non-obese individuals is because ""society"" has imposed unrealistic body standards upon the blank slates of everybody.  This whole postcolonial ideology basically boils down to the blank slate assumption, that there is no such thing as ""normal"" or naturally ""desirable"", and that society and culture are to blame when people think otherwise. Any trends that do exist, such as most people being straight, conforming, non-trans, non-obese etc. are simply brought into existence by oppression."
TumblrAtRest,3be1e9,HONKFRIEND,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:51:28 2015 UTC,"I object to the idea that feelings can be incorrect, simply because they aren't based on facts. Feelings are a visceral, subconscious reactions tobrain chemistry. The feeling has nothing to do with the world around you - it is a the minds way of interpreting the chemical changes. Drawing conclusions about the physical world based on your emotions is very unscientific, but we're not talking about the real world.  If I feel cold, it might be because of the temperature of my surroundings, but I might also be withdrawing from an addiction or be infected with the flu. If someone told me that my feelings don't match the temperature, I would probably accept it. But what sort of asshole would respond to ""I feel cold"" with ""No you don't"" or ""You're wrong"". If somebody opens an argument with a statement like that, they can't expect to be taken serious.  Sure, you can argue with the conclusions. You might say that since there is no such thing as a ""female/male soul"" you can't be born into the wrong body. But knowing that it isn't a ""soul mix-up issue"" doesn't make those feelings any less real. The brain chemistry that caused them is still there. You might also argue that when a transgendered person feels uncomfortable with their own genitalia, they might draw the flawed conclusion, that they would feel better with surgically changed genitalia. But again, you can argue with the conclusion, not with the feelings.  To address your other point: It all depends on how you define disorder. There is no such thing as a perfect human. There is no universal, right way for the human brain to work. There is only the norm and the average person. You might say that any significant deviation from the norm is a disorder - an flawed brain. Homosexuality was considered a mental illness for a long time, but since this ""disorder"" doesn't hurt anybody, can't be cured and can't accurately be diagnosed, calling it a mental illness seems a bit silly.  Homosexuality still is a deviation from the norm, resulting from a biologically flawed brain, but calling it a disease isn't very constructive. Transgenderism also doesn't hurt anybody, and can't be cured. There is a way to alleviate the discomfort (surgery, hormones), and therefore it might still be classified as a disorder for some time yet, simply to allow this treatment.  In general I think it is unconstructive to widen the definition of ""normal"" to the point where the word has no meaning, but it is even worse to make normality the only acceptable state of mind and body."

I merely said that, if someone says they're cold if it's burning hot outside, then everyone else shouldn't be expected to bend over to make them feel like there is nothing unusual about them. We shouldn't pretend like we've just stumbled upon a new facet of normalcy that we were not aware of and that we need to be inclusive about, on an intellectual and conceptual level.   For example, I would frown upon anyone who would now say that I am cis-thermic and thermo-normative. And that, by me implying that there is usually a relation between cold temperature and feeling cold, I am thermophobic towards transthermics, shaming and oppressing people who feel cold when the temperature is hot. I would also frown upon those saying that society's expectation to turn the AC on when the temperature is above a certain threshold is ""thermist"" and ""bigoted"".  Do you believe I am exaggerating? Because this is exactly how I ""perceive"" the way trans issues are argued for. I'm not even going to say ""those are my feelings and that it's bigoted to say they are wrong"". I am open to a discussion.  If someone feels cold when it's hot outside, I will be sympathetic towards them. But I will not pretend like I don't believe there is something ""not quite right"" with them. I might censor my behavior so as not to inflict harm upon them, but not my thoughts."

And while it might not have been the intended meaning, I wasn't the only one who read it like that, if we're judging from the other comments in the thread.  And who knows? The author of the piece might actually think so (I assume you're not the author).

I'm not even going to say ""those are my feelings and that it's bigoted to say they are wrong"".    If you feel attacked, or discriminated against those feelings are indeed valid. You might not be discriminated against, that still doesn't invalidate those feelings. (And as far as I know, you might actually be discriminated against by trans people - I don't know your life or the people you're arguing with).   But I will not pretend like I don't believe there is something ""not quite right"" with them.   You can believe whatever you want, and I agree with you. There is something neurologically wrong with transgender people. But they don't hurt anybody. Who cares if a person who lives as a woman wants her drivers license to say ""female""? I know the tumblrsphere get's crazy some times, but at its core this isn't about ""cis-hate"". It's about people who just want to live their lives with a minimum of discomfort. If somebody in a dress introduces herself as Mary, you shouldn't require some sort of proof before using a feminine pronoun."

This is my explanation as to why the ""incorrect feelings"" was understood as it was by a majority of other redditors - certain ways of tackling the trans issues have become the norm.

They should not ""feel wrong"" or anything, least of all because it wouldn't help.  At the same time, I feel like the fight against discrimination has gotten a bit out of hand when someone like the author of ""The vagina monologues"" gets bullied by trans activists because the play is perceived as offensive, since ""not all women have vaginas"". Yes, this actually happened (http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6202).  Dysphoria is still considered a disorder.

No one is going into text books and erasing the presence of the Confederate flag. What's going on is that the greater public has decided this is another thing it simply won't tolerate. Much like segregation, homophobia (still in progress), and other negative anti social mindsets. By antisocial I mean any mentality that seeks to limit social acceptance.   If you want to honor the people that died in the civil war we already have the American flag. Much like we demonize terrorists, we should also not be accepting of people who wanted to divide this country.

If a minority chooses to identify with the side that lost, who are we to say they can't? Will banning a flag change their mindset or just whitewash society? Aren't you limiting their social acceptance by marginalizing their beliefs?   I absolutely accept non-violent expression. Yes, one ass-hat has a picture of himself with the confederate flag and shoots up a church. I'm against the shooting, but believe he has every right to take a picture with any flag he wants a picture with.   Was the 99% trying to limit social acceptance of the 1%? Where do we draw the line?

Let's shame anybody that takes pride in a flag that has represented the south for hundreds of years. Good call.  ""The majority"" was not screaming for the flag to be removed before the shooting. If this is ""the majorities"" reaction after this crime, then I think ""the majority"" are assholes for buying into the media driven narrative.  I personally could give a flying fuck about the confederate flag. Never owned one. Never wanted to. It's this knee jerk reaction and general misdirected outrage that let's our media get away with what they do.

In this case, though, I'm not sure that the mental illness is without the inspiration. Racism is taught, not born with. So all hid mental illness did is make him act on what he was brought up to believe. Whomever it was, weather family or friends, someone taught him to hate, his crime was calculated. While mental illness is still important and a large factor for what happened, he is also the byproduct of his environment. An environment which nurtured this hate.

If it is a symbol of racism, why would they be shamed now if they weren't before? It's just a distraction from the real issues.   Racism is not always taught. Sometimes it is learned. If a kid goes to school and is beat up daily by people of another race they can learn racism. If a kid sees another race acting violently every day, watches the TV show Cops, or looks at crime reports, the news, etc. They can learn racism without outside influence.   The South is always assumed to be more racist than everywhere else. I have not spent a lot of time there so I can't comment whether it is or isn't. I have lived in a lot of different parts of the U.S. and racism is alive and well in other parts of the country.   What taught the Sandy Hook shooter hate, Columbine? Racism is a problem in this country but blaming this church shooting on anything besides mental health and gun access is misguided and detracts from the more important prevention/education measures that need to be addressed.

The Confederate battle flag was rarely seen from 1865-1947. What changed? The civil rights plank within the Democratic Party. The flag then became an unofficial symbol of segregationist Democrat Strom Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign that nearly cost Truman the election -- you know, the guy that integrated the military? The flag then wasn't seen much until 1954. The year Brown v. Board was decided. So yes, the flag has pretty much everything to do with racism.   Edit2: and you say us. I'm a Mississippian, born and raised. Our state, indeed our entire region, has a dark past. The Confederate flag does not represent the South, if for no other reason than black people are Southerners too. That flag doesn't represent them. It never has, and it never will.

Accusing a person of being a racist is serious, and I just want you to know I was NOT going there.   So just to be clear -- I am disagreeing with your argument. I know a lot of white non-racist Southerners that share your view. Hell, my old high school history teacher taught me what you are claiming.

Also, and going along with this, there are a lot of people that proudly display the rebel flag with no racial intent or animus. I was one of them as a child. I thought the Dukes of Hazzard was cool as hell, and no way were Bo and Luke racists. Right? Well, I was a little naive. As much as many whites today will (and do) display the rebel flag with no ill racial intent, I can't get away from three things: 1) what I wrote above, about the flag being resurrected in 1948 and 1954. You can't ignore that. Maybe it lost that racist tinge, but there's no getting around that is why it was flying in the first place. 2) Black people, who are just as Southern as my cracker ass, HATE that flag. Seriously. It can't be a symbol of the South and blatantly offend a quarter of all Southerners. 3) Hate groups fly that shit alongside the swastika. It means the same thing to them. Even if you don't associate racial animus to the rebel flag, those motherfuckers do, and have tainted it.   Finally, I'm sorry for my initial self-righteous and combative tone. That shit doesn't change minds. I edited some (hopefully all) of that out, leaving what I think is the crux of my position. I don't think you're a bigot. In fact, I'm pretty sure you're not. That's why I'm trying to change your mind, not be right or make you look bad.   Edit: a few words and typos."
TumblrAtRest,3b4snv,alphetasauce,2,Fri Jun 26 03:22:03 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response, and I learned a few things from it. I will provide you with a more detailed and source happy comment tomorrow when I have a little more free time. I learned originally that the civil war was all about slavery in high school. There were some things about the original narrative that didn't quite add up though, do I took a class on it in college to take a deeper look. When I did I found that Abraham Lincoln wasn't quite as much of a saint as we made him out to be. From scandals with public funding of private rail road companies to the suspension of habeas corpus, to the motives behind the emancipation proclamation.   But I will say that I did not know about the resurgence of the confederate flag being connected to segregation. That's both interesting and makes me sad, because to me, what it represents is the spirit of independence of the south. I truly understand why black people hate it, given what we are taught, but I'm also of the opinion that the violent way that slavery ended has truly left a massive scar in race relations that can be felt to this day, one that in my opinion could have been avoided given time and diplomacy. Instead now I have some truly racist neighbors that make my stomach churn because of their ignorance, but they were fed the same line that both the slave owners and the carpetbaggers of the reconstruction feed the poor whites of that time, ""at least your not black."""

From Georgia, a highlight, the second and third sentences of the second paragraph:   ""The people of Georgia, after an equally full and fair and deliberate hearing of the case, have declared with equal firmness that [our Northern confederates] shall not rule over them. A brief history of the rise, progress, and policy of anti-slavery and the political organization into whose hands the administration of the Federal Government has been committed will fully justify the pronounced verdict of the people of Georgia.""  You don't really get much ""we're leaving because you're against slavery"" than by saying ""we're leaving because you're against slavery.""   Edit - and for good measure, Mississippi:   A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union.   In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.  Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.  I am not putting this up here to imply you're a racist, either, or that you're not intelligent. But too many people play the ""the Civil War was about states' rights"" card, and it's just not true.

TumblrAtRest,3b4snv,Bob9999999999999,8,Wed Jul 1 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"Well, it happened like this:  In the early 20th century, the voting base of the Democratic Party was the South. In the 1930s, the centerpiece of the Democratic Party platform was FDR's New Deal reforms, which established a welfare state in the U.S. Since the South was the poorest section of the country, it made economic sense that working-class Southerners would be the biggest supporters of FDR's policies.  But the left had a problem. Those Southern proletarians voting in the progressive welfare state were more-or-less the same people who put on KKK robes and lynched blacks. The left had, in effect, made a deal with the devil. They could get the economic reforms they wanted, but the cost was that they would have to turn a blind eye to Southern racism or else risk alienating their base. Since the Great Depression was going on, it was judged that economic reforms were the most important thing.  In the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement became one of the great causes of the American left. For awhile, Democratic Party politicians wringed their hands over what to do, but eventually they came fully on board with the Civil Rights Movement. As expected, their Southern base turned against them. In the 1968 election, Richard Nixon came out with his ""Southern strategy"", converting the South's dissatisfied Democratic voters into Republican voters. The working-class South had gone to the right.  With the loss of the working-class South, what was to be the new left-wing voting base in the U.S.? Well, that would have to be the ""New Left"" coalition which had just fought for the Civil Rights Movement and against the Vietnam War. Thus, the new Democratic base was young urban progressives and various marginalized racial groups. As with their old Southern base, the Democrats would have to work to keep this coalition together. This meant identity politics. This meant that from now on, the American left would regard race as the paramount issue in U.S. politics."

TumblrAtRest,3arpus,pineyfusion,20,Tue Jun 23 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"princess feminism    Actually, that sounds pretty good too.  I bet feminists hate that."
TumblrAtRest,3arpus,terrymcginnisbeyond,18,Tue Jun 23 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they do. I'm just not a fan of this feminism that makes women out to be weak and powerless and need to rely on white knights and this feminism that wants all of the perks of being treated equally but yet don't want to sacrifice their pedestals. Personally, pedestals are annoying and overrated. I want to be put on the same ground as men not the same ground and then some. If I fuck up, I want to pay the same damn consequences as a man does when he fucks up."
TumblrAtRest,3arpus,pineyfusion,6,Tue Jun 23 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"And I think that's what feminism used to be about, and should be about, seeking out genuine areas where women are being discriminated against and finding ways, usually through the law to end that and ensuring there's equal opportunity for women, (rather than equity, where the end goal is forced, i.e quotas).  .  I don't think there needs to be a massive overhaul of society to achieve this by 'crushing the patriarchy' or enacting some kind of neo-Marxism either, which is another position many of these SJW's, Tumblrinas and neo-femmes take.  I'm always interested in a female perspective on feminism, because I do think that provides a more unbiased view of this whole thing. Of course I'm going to hate the #tag killallmen, and being told I'm some kind of shitlord that makes 23% more simply for having a penis because I'm a man.  But your opinion (you are a woman right?) does have a lot of traction (without trying to sound patronising), because a) feminazis probably want to win you over more, and b) if they hate men, I've noticed they really hate women who say 'I don't need feminism' etc."
TumblrAtRest,3arpus,terrymcginnisbeyond,8,Tue Jun 23 13:14:01 2015 UTC,"I am a woman and I know you don't mean to sound patronizing. Sometimes tone gets a little screwy when it comes to writing on the internet.   I do consider myself a feminist, even though I know it's become such a dirty word, but I'm more of the kind of feminism that is about being thought of as an individual and not as a group. I don't want my thoughts to speak for an entire group of people, I want the right to suck without it being attributed to my gender, I want to succeed in the world without it being dismissed on account of my gender (in either the ""Well they needed a woman"" sense or the ""bitch probably fucked her way to the top"" sense...btw the latter fucking pisses me off too). I want to be judged for the content of my character and not the gender and sex I identify as. I feel like a lot of current feminism is really really hurting this more than it's helping.   I wouldn't say that I don't need feminism per se. I think feminism in some respects is still important in a lot of places around the world. And I think there are some legitimate arguments in feminism worth having but nobody is having it because some of the arguments tend to go against their other original arguments (i.e. The Pay Gap -- the argument shouldn't be the overall pay gap but instead about the value that is placed on jobs that are held largely by women...that is an argument worth having. But that would entail them having to admit that the pay gap that they argue about is a myth)  This feminism we see today though? The misandry, the microaggressions, the fearmongering, the hate, the inability to listen to anybody making a counter argument? This is not my feminism."

TumblrAtRest,3arpus,Witherkay,-5,Wed Jun 24 00:10:22 2015 UTC,"I dislike Christina Hoff Summers. She's condescending, she uses simple language, and the entire time she speaks, you get the feeling she's holding back from saying what she honestly feels, as though it might be too complex for her viewer. I doubt she could sustain a youtube video over five minutes in length; she'd start to genuinely insult her audience's intelligence. Making jokes about dogs won't convince college-educated feminists to rethink their approach to freedom.   Furthermore, this video is in desperate need of nuance. ""Fainting Couch Feminists"" are not getting their way across the board, as this video makes it out to be. Oberlin College's own Lena Dunham had an episode of her show that skewered the concept of trigger warnings in season 4. Tumblr Feminists are no different from teenage boys on 4chan nine or ten years ago, spewing the same vitriol from their parents' screens. The only difference is that we mistakenly gave these new voices legitimacy, and more and more voices (Whedon, Green) are seeing that they made a mistake. Rather than really snapshot the landscape of the 2015 gender war, or even address the epic backfire that is Yes Means Yes, Based Mom here gives us essentially a sound bite to latch onto. No debate can come from this.   That said, I hate how Hoff Summers is among the voice of reason. What does that say about our society, when this is the standard for debate?"

I typically agree with most of what she says, but there's something... off... about the way she speaks. I'd love to send some of her videos to people interested in this stuff, but by the end I always feel like they come off as overly simplistic and weird (I'm not sure if condescending is the right word... it's more like she is reading off cue cards but can't).   That said, I'm considering reading one of her books. Perhaps she's more eloquent in written form."
TumblrAtRest,3arpus,Domer2012,7,Tue Jun 23 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think Sommers comes as slightly condescending because she (like many) think these feminist-type radical activists are simply ridiculous, and the mere thought of these people make someone with practical sensibilities chuckle and change their tone.

""cis"" privilege is also real, considering all the bullshit transgendered people have to deal with - not being accepted by society as a whole, and having far, far fewer romantic options than the rest of us. straight privilege, maybe, because the world caters more to straight people (and in places like the middle east, it's outright illegal to be gay), but that's hopefully changing. white privilege is tied more to wealth privilege than anything, and although racists exist, they rarely have any power over you, and there are affirmative action programs and other incentives for black people to succeed. also, in africa and other places where white people are the minority, it definitely does not exist. able-bodied privilege... yeah, this one is obvious too  male privilege is flat out not real, though. if anything, women have it WAY better than guys. outside of being more likely to get raped, women have the advantage in the court systems, in school, in gaining employment (due to affirmative action programs and the backlash from not hiring women), and due to the ""protect the women"" behavior, are much more likely to be sided with in any circumstance.  just my 2 cents"

If genders are the attitudes, feelings, behaviors, etc (disregarding the holy crap gender roles possible intrusion there) that a given culture associates with a person's biological sex, the world has a long history of describing people with more than just two genders.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender  I wonder why the APA definition of gender is being held up as a worldwide gold standard for how everyone ever talks about gender vs gender identity."
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,Jackibelle,12,Sun Jun 21 04:51:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm very true, specifically the hijra thing in India where even though biologically intersex is not a third sex, they assign this sort of cultural role to intersex individuals.  However, all these third gender individuals seem to be simply other terms for or glorified forms of 'androgyny' or even blatantly transgender' which is more akin to a gender identity or gender expression that it is to a gender itself (if we follow this APA standard for whatever it's worth), that set of attitudes behaviors and feelings that they associate to a third gender looks more like a mix and match than a markedly different set.   This is my western-centric imperialist shitlord view of course, which probably also answers your question on why the APA is the golden standard.  In short, I wrote that post from what I know about gender, and maybe that's not enough for me to write with a lot of authority I guess haha, thank you by the way, but I still stand by my post even with the implication that all those brown people are dumb and wrong about gender (which is more of a they have different standards for gender than the APA and western society, under which they'd be inaccurate)."
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,Jackibelle,6,Sun Jun 21 05:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for being willing to talk about this, even if you don't end up agreeing with me. :)  I guess my biggest question is: why do we need to push gender identity a level further away from being someone's gender?  The whole ""there are only two sexes, therefore there's only two genders"" just feels awful in light of how often this sort of argument is used to justify statements like ""and therefore he's just a dude pretending to be a woman, and we shouldn't let him[sic] be happy "".  As a side note, the APA guidelines you linked and quoted are from 2011, back when we had the DSM IV(-TR), and have since updated that to the DSM V; one of the big relevant changes was the replacement of GID (gender identity disorder) with Gender Dysphoria, highlighting that the problem the patient is facing is not any issue with their gender identity but rather the dysphoria they're suffering as a result of it. The gender identity is fine.  My point in raising this is that this evidences a shift in their thinking and treatment that has occurred rapidly in the past few years (just look at how the topic has exploded into the public eye recently as compared with one or two years ago), making older references less reliable. The language in http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx flips/breaks apart ""gender identity"" to ""identify their gender as"" many times (see esp. What are some categories or types of transgender people?) which makes me believe the APA is fine with non-normative genders. I realize this is not an airtight case or anything, but at this point I'd return to the question at the top:  Why do we need a difference between someone's ""gender"" and their ""gender identity""?"
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,MissAzureEyes,3,Sun Jun 21 14:29:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm very good points. I guess opening up this door of saying there are two genders and several gender identities potentially opens up to bigotry towards trans and nonbinary people which is far from my intention of course, but I realize how much it sounds like those awful arguments.  My point was this: people don't have genders. Genders exist independently of people experiencing them, they're kind of there in society, people have gender identities. I'm not someone of the male gender that identifies as genderqueer, the male gender was assigned to be my identity but I no longer identify with that set. I'm not sure if I'm being entirely clear.  You're right about the perhaps too old citation, and I agree with all these changes to the DSM. I don't ever want to imply that trans people have a gender and are identifying away from it which causes issues (like GID implied) but that their gender identity is fine and valid but does not align with societal expectations and often with their anatomy. I'm iffy with the ""identify their gender as"" point, I guess I can say that from my experience genderqueer does not feel like a gender but the a descriptor of how I experience different gendered feelings while not describing what set of feelings those are, again hard to explain.  I was making a semantic argument, which I still think is valid (I agree with everything you've said and I recognize them as true but I still don't entirely see how they dismantle the argument itself) I guess maybe just misworded or with unexplained intentions. I was getting upset with people with bullshit third genders like stargender or huegender trying to infiltrate LGBT+ and crafted this argument to explain the reason those identities don't fit by saying more than ""they're bullshit."" I reckon the argument might fail when applied to several other situations, and well I'm very thankful that you're willing to spend some of your time poking holes at this one thing I wrote in a couple of minutes last night, it's very nice to have a discussion like this and I've learned plenty :)  EDIT: Reading over this, I guess I'm imagining gender kind of how Plato sees ideas as these things that exist regardless of people thinking (or in the case of gender, experiencing) them.  In this argument male-ness and female-ness are the ideas, the genders, and how people see themselves with respect to these two abstract qualities constitutes their gender identity. No woman completely ever satisfies all of female-ness as no tree completely satisfies all of tree-ness in is abstract perfection. Am I making any sense?"
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,MissAzureEyes,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"As I point out in my other post, or at least it's implied, rather, there is no reason for a difference in gender identity vs gender. Those two are the same. However, there can be a dichotomy between sex and gender (identity). So you're valid in your confused feeling about it. But I'd say the APA is fine with non-normative genders as it'd make sense."
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,autowikibot,2,Sun Jun 21 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"As I explain it to others, transsexual is where it's not about being another gender, but a complete sense of being in the absolutely wrong body -- you're the wrong sex. You can be MTF transsexual and your gender still be male/masculine, or even tomboy. It could be feminine, as well, or genderfluid. While this doesn't directly relate, I know, it's part of a setup for later. The important thing to remember is that there's a difference between transgender (Third gender) and transsexual, and more often than not, the more commonly referred to ""Transgendered"" individual is a subset, reiterating, known as transsexual.   And that is what a lot of third genders can refer to, a masculine male, feminine male, etc. However, you can also delve into a female-male entirely (such as cases relevant to the Fa'afafine) where you are a female with some male parts (traditionally, before modern medicine/techniques). In those cases, you are female. The husband would be heterosexual and you'd be the wife. You would then, traditionally, go on to perform housewife labour, living your life as a woman. Though, of course, times have changed in that regard. Though that's not the complete case, and I'm boiling it down, and there's some debate on the history. There are a few tribes where there's as many as 16 different genders, allegedly (have no online source, merely comments routinely spoken in my anthropology courses). Or you can be no inherent gender (or a mix of 2 (binary) or more), and those exists within more than a few cultures as well.   So with that said, we can come to understand that, in the history of the world, gender has meant many things and has been used many ways. The gender itself can be as deep or as shallow as it is to each unique individual. And it's important to remember that it may be different for each person. In a lot of Western societies, there's only 2 genders: masculine male, and feminine female. I would say the reason for that, postulating, is due to the same reason as sex is generally an ultimate taboo: religion, and more recently puritans. But we have observed for many years (as in hundreds) that's not the case, and you'll have men who do not fill that masculine role (or do so reluctantly out of fear or being forced), likewise for women. It's less of ""this is how it is, a golden standard"" and more of ""This is evil and sinful"" and then become part of our traditions and cultures, devaluing other aspects that have existed to the point of obscurity where only recently we're seeing those values (third genders) returning because there's finally freedom to do so. You don't have an overwhelmingly large amount of people forcing third genders into different directions. In older times, it was possibly likely you'd be beat or killed, or shunned by society because your actions were sinful. There has always been third genders/transsexual/transgendered individuals since the beginning of human history, however. There are historical texts in a ton of societies (even Western), so it is not something new that people are bringing (unless you mean Tumblr's version). It's, again, something that's being allowed to finally be shown without being seen as sinful by everyone in the Western world.   Let it be known, however, that my words do not reflect a professional. I only have what little anthro education and my own personal experience/opinions to go off of. Also: in no point in my words do I include or support the existence of any extraneous tumblr ""genders"" or philosophies, etc."

I directed this at those who want to permeate trans and LGBT spaces by arguing that they're stargender or spookygender or that can even pretend that this exists.

TumblrAtRest,3akfar,forbiddenone,2,Sun Jun 21 05:28:33 2015 UTC,"What is genderqueer, if I heard somebody calling somebody that I would have assumed it to be an insult."
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,purpleblossom,2,Sun Jun 21 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"Genderqueer (I think) is a sort of umbrella term for things like bigender, genderfluid, and agender (among others) where the person identifies with both, a (for genderfluid, changeable) subset of both, or neither male or female. It is pretty heavily informed by Western sensibilities about gender and the number of them (see the Tumblr link we're all discussing), since it gathers everything outside of cisnormativity into one group. Genderqueer is usually also part of the transgender umbrella, but being a trans woman or a trans guy does not make you genderqueer automatically, since many of them identify solely as male or female, but genderqueer trans people absolutely exist too.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer  ninja edit: Re: insulting, yes, this could easily be used as an insult just like the base word ""queer"", so wait for someone to self-identify with the term before using it to describe them."
TumblrAtRest,3akfar,purpleblossom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:05:21 2015 UTC,"Genderqueer:       Genderqueer (GQ; alternatively non-binary) is a catch-all category for gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine—identities which are thus outside of the gender binary and cisnormativity.  Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:   having an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity;  having two or more genders (being bigender, trigender, or pangender); having no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree, or neutrois); moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid);  or being third-gender or other-gendered, a category which includes those who do not place a name to their gender.    Some genderqueer people   also desire physical modification or hormones to suit their preferred expression. Many genderqueer people see gender and sex as separable aspects of a person and sometimes identify as a male woman or a female man, or combine genderqueer with another gender option.  It can be helpful for some people to consider gender and sex as two separate things.  Genders can include, but are in no way limited to, man/woman, bigender, agender, non-binary, etc. Gender identity is defined as one's internal sense of being a woman, man, both, or neither, while sexual orientation refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to others.  As such, genderqueer people have a variety of sexual orientations, just like transgender and cisgender people do.  Many genderqueer people identify as trans in more current discussions, as trans simply means that an individual does not identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. [citation needed]  In addition to being an umbrella term, genderqueer has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who ""queer"" gender, expressing it non-normatively.  Androgynous is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their gender expression, and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.  Some references use the term transgender broadly, in such a way that it includes genderqueer.

Queer studies and queer advocacy groups are commonly name that now, to reduce the impact of the word is a common method to empower ourself as a community.

TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,ChickensDontClap90,10,Fri Jun 19 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"Oh perfect, the author! You mention in your piece that Autism Speaks is wrong to treat autism as a medical condition, though my understanding is that it is, albeit a highly varied and misunderstood one. I'm not as well versed in the subject as you, of course, just curious to find out more.  Excellent piece by the way!"
TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,nexus_ssg,8,Fri Jun 19 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"Autism is complex. With a huge variation on the spectrum. It is currently only diagnosed by looking at behavior. There is some interesting research with MRI scans showing some structure differences in the brains of autistic people but we are not yet able to use this as a diagnostic tool. So all we have is behavior.  What this means is that it is entirely possible, and indeed in my opinion likely, that there are several underlying brain differences that cause autistic behaviors. It is also possible that some of these differences have completely unrelated causes.  As such autism is not actually a conditon at all it is, instead, a ""symptom"" of probably several different conditions.  So the question then becomes ""are any or all of those underlying atypical brain structure medical conditions"". The answer is not clear on this. For many, indeed for most autistic people I would say no. The atypical brain structures are no more a medical issue than say homosexuality is. Homosexuals presumably also have a slightly different brain structure to straight people but it would be wrong to consider this a medical condition.  That being said some of teh root causes of autistic behaviour could indeed be considered medical conditions. The very severe end of the spectrum is perhaps caused by such differences in the brain that it could rightly be labeld a pathology or even damage. As such it would be entirely appropriate to label this medical.  But for kids like my son. No he does not have a medical condition. He is perfectly healthy> his brain is atypical and that makes him act in odd ways and this makes things like educating him more difficult. But his education problems are more to do with the way we educate kids and boys in particular. The modern education system is very hostile to boys in general and its almost like being a boy is a medical condition (i.e. boys are defective girls) in the context of the modern educational environments (but that's a whole other rant).  Hope that clears things up. Its hard to fit all this into a single essay so perhaps the use of words did cut out much meaning but including an explanation of everything would make it into a book length piece!! But that's what these comments sections are for I guess."
TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,ChickensDontClap90,3,Mon Jun 22 08:35:11 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but my take on it is that autism can't just be cured or prevented like most medical conditions."

I was hoping for a general statement like ""SJW's are hurting the cause they say to support,"" and then see a quote or something that shows me that they are doing that.  It was good writing, but I think it was missing examples of the behaviour you were talking about."
TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,MillCrab,6,Fri Jun 19 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"The cause of autism rights or autism acceptance has the goal of changing the view of the public so that they no longer see autism as an illness but instead just as a difference. The most important people who's minds need to be changed on this mater are the parents of autistic people as this will have the biggest impact on their kids. All the while a parent considers their child to be ill then there is a danger that they will try to cure or modify that child through drugs, behavioural therapies like ABA or worse still dangerous quack remedies like bleach enemas (I shit ye not this is a real thing).  The physical and psychological damage to autistic people who's parents try to cure them is very real and well documented. Furthermore the general damage caused by being view as ill and defective is also clear.   So autism rights is trying to change the opinion that autism is an illness and so mitigate the harm done by this perception. To a large degree I am behind this movement and I think most autistic people should not be viewed as ill (there are some neuances to this position as it is far from clear that autism is just one ""thing""). Treatments should not involve trying to change the autism but rather should focus on strategies to allow the autistic person to function better in a 99% neurotypical world.   The problem with the SJW's is that they are so vile to parents that anyone encountering them will run a mile. As such, parents will be put off seeking any further information on neurodiversity and they will remain firmly entrenched in the autism is bad mind set. Moreover the whole SJW overly sensitive crap they pull makes any member of joe public roll their eyes. So people that have no vested interest in autism rights will see some very vocal SJW crapping on about how some triviality is ""offensive"" and ""ableist"" and then imediatly write off the whole autism rights movement as just another SJW fad with nothing of importance to say. This is simply not the case. There really is a lot of work to so kids like my son can have a decent life. So unlike feminism (which has won most of its battles) the SJW's are starting to ruin autism rights before it even gets started properly. The farce that 3rd wave feminism has become does not really have a negative impact on many women in the west, its just a bit embarrassing. But loosing any momentum on a fledgling rights movement with some genuine issues that need addressing does have a real effect on kids like my son.   Finally SJW overly PC crap is starting to affect the way scientific research is funded. On case in point was the ""controversy"" over some of Simon Baron Cohens research on autism being an extreme expression of the male cognitive style. His idea is that the male brain has a propensity towards greater systems thinking and the female brain has more of a focus on emotional and social skills. This hypothesis was tested on 1 day old babies who he found statistically relevant differences on what they would focus their attention on. I don't know whether I agree with this idea but its an interesting line of research. But apparently the idea that men and women might have different brains is ""controversal"" for the SJW's and as such Professor Cohen is constantly having to apologies and make excuses for his controversial opinions. Its absurd. Social Justice bullshit has no place in science."

People like yourself are quite justifiably dismissing the autism rights movement as ""special snowflake syndrome"" this is probably due to the antics of SJW's crapping on about every disabled person is just a special snowflake. I get it, I really do.  Autism is complex. Some autistic people are very disabled by their condition and with some very severe cases a cure may well be appropriate. But the vast majority do not want to be cured even if they could be. For these autistic people curing them is kind of like trying to cure gay people. Its wrong.

If you could snap your fingers and make your autistic son not autistic, wouldn't you?  If you wouldn't, what possible advantage do you see for him to staying that way?   We don't pretend congenital blindness isn't a medical condition and shouldn't be cured, we don't even treat depression that way in the medical community anymore, why would you want autism to go uncured ?   As I seem to say a lot, it's okay to have a defect, it doesn't make you a bad person.   We can be accepting, and still understand that something is a disadvantage"
TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,Slipdickgreg,13,Fri Jun 19 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"Ok I see what you are saying and to be honest I was exactly where you were on this issue about 4 years ago.   Autism is not like blindness or the other things you mention because for most autistic people the autism is not intrinsically a problem. It only becomes an issue when they interact with neurotypical people. By definition it is a social communication disorder. As communication is a two way thing you could make the argument that neuortypical people have a disability when communicating with autistic people. We say they have a disability only because they are a minority. If the proportion of neurotypes flipped it would be us NT;s that were disabled. This is not the case with blindness. If 99% of the world became blind the sighted minority would not be disabled in anyway in fact they would have ""special"" powers. Now the caveat here is that we are talking about the mild to moderate cases of autism. The very severly affected can indeed have some serious cognitive disabilities as well as social communication problems.  As for why I would not want autism cured? Well autism is an extreme cognative style. Einstein, Tesla, Newton and many many other great scientists were probably on the spectrum. The gene's for autism are heavily linked to extreme skill in system thinking and so we see autism far more prevalent in families with lots of engineers and scientists.   Autistic people are probably responsible for some of the greatest scientific acheivements we have made. Now a blind person could be a great scientists and if we cured their blindness it would not affect their genius. This is not the case with an autistic person. Autism is part of why many people are very very good at what they do.  So it really is not clear cut like blindness. The problem is that most of the exposure Joe Public have to autism is from those aweful ""Freakshow TV"" documentaries. They show the really autistic kids with violent behaviours because that makes for ""good telly"". But this is really not how most autistic people are. Most will be fine as long as we can make some sensible changes to the education system and the work place. They do not need curing any more than gay people need curing."
TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,letuotter,17,Fri Jun 19 15:33:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole nature of being a spectrum disorder means that some people can not only get along as fine as a regular shy person, but the way their brains are wired can grant access to paths of creativity they wouldn't have otherwise. To essentially nuke every form of autism with a cure would deprive the human race of that. That's not to say no cure should ever be researched, because it's easy to say no to a cure when you can live independently and hold a job but it's another when you're so trapped in your mind you can't even speak or use the bathroom on your own.  There's a similar thing with bipolar disorder, although bipolar disorder is a mental illness. The severity of symptoms can differ greatly between individuals, and some not only manage to live normally but they're able to channel that energy into productivity. This is why a lot of celebrities and people in show business have bipolar disorder. Some people would say yes to a cure if it was offered, some wouldn't."

Sure, I don't even really need glasses to drive except at night.  But would I prefer to have perfect sight?  Hell yes, I would.  Autism is not genius.  They're not even related.  Just because a handful of smart people in history (out of the tens of thousands of geniuses who have advanced science and history) may potentially have shared a few symptoms with autism doesn't prove anything.  It's a corollary at best, and one based on pure speculation.  I feel for you and your kid, I really do.  I've worked with an autistic kid in our church's childcare, and it's intimidating to me, because I'm just not sure how to reach out and connect with him.  But that kid has a handicap, and no amount of changing the language will alter that fact.  It doesn't make him any less of a person or anything like that, but he will have a harder time in life than the other kids will, and I promise you that no kid would ever want that.  Would you?  If it's not a disorder, then would you willingly take on a crippling social handicap?  Would you cut off your ability to interact in society by choice for a 0.0005% or whatever chance that you might be super-smart as well?  If not, then I'd reevaluate your stance again.  And trust us, we see Special Snowflake Syndrome all the freaking time here.  You have the most minor case of it I think I've ever seen, but it is what it is.  You're choosing to deny the facts because you can't bear the thought of something being ""wrong"" with you or your son."

Oh if only you knew how wrong you were about this!!! I've had my denial phase believe me. Coming to terms with his autism was a struggle for me and it took me a while to get my head out of my arse and see what was going on in front of me.   Look I understand where you are coming from. I thought exactly the same as you did about 4 years ago. I too would have probably poured scorn on someone saying the things I do now. I too would think they were deluding themselves in an attempt to feel better. The problem is that there is no real way for me to demonstrate that this is not the case here. There is no real way for me to defend against that acussation as its pure supposition. I guess all I can say is read through some of the stuff I have written and ask yourself if it seems to be written by the kind of person who is prone to such self delusions?"

If 2% of the population was normal, and the rest autistic, then the 2% who could effectively work in groups and be strong collaborators would rule the world.  Calling scientists from too long ago to check autistic is hip these days, but doesn't it strike you as strange that our current great scientists aren't?  The scientist who accomplish great things need to be able to communicate, to collaborate and to be part of an operation larger than themselves.  Regardless of whats on the good TV, you have to understand how much harder your son will have it then if he wasn't autistic.  When, if ever, will he have a first kiss?  Will he have a best friend with whom he's willing to go against the world?  Will he ever get to raise a son of his own, and stare into his eyes and see the unique connection of parents and children?  I know you've thought of these things, because I don't think you're stupid.  I've known more asperger's kids than I care to think about, and they have clearly paid a price for any nebulous benefits they may or may not have recieved.  My sister's brother is autistic, and at 5, you can already see the closeness and interconnections he's missing out on compared to other kids.    The greatest minds are healthy minds, and we should strive to make all brains as strong and complete as we can, not to simply call it a zero-sum game and pretend nothing comes with any downsides.  tl;dr 5 IQ points isn't worth your first kiss."

People with milder Autism can be taught to interact perfectly normally with other people, it's just a little harder for them.

TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,StealthMasterMcEdgy,9,Fri Jun 19 18:34:37 2015 UTC,"Autism Speaks is a (controversial, among people concerned with autism) autism research/advocacy group. It's a bit weirder than your example, because autism is more like blindness (you can be somewhat blind) than, say, AIDS.  Their schtick is to approach autism as a disease needing a cure. This approach is very appealing to tired parents and caregivers of kids with severe (as in: nonverbal, non-communicative, will never function independently) autism since it matches their experience, and rich donors, since it matches their desire for an easy-answer ""if I spend money on this the world will get better"" narrative.  The problem is that while their approach works very well for making money and generating publicity, it doesn't work as well on the ""making shit happen"" or ""not alienating the substantial population of people with mild cases that border on presenting as personality differences rather than a life-altering syndrome"".  (The alternative to the ""it's a disease"" stance that AS takes is the ""barring needing a caregiver, it's a normal human variance and needing to step out of the room for a bit when loud noises are happening is no more unusual than a person in a wheel chair requiring ramps instead of stairs, so chill the fuck out"", that polar-opposite organization ASAN takes.)  Also they don't have any autistic people in their leadership and this weirds some people out.  If all of that sounds pretty abstract and boring and not-apocalyptic, that's because it is abstract and boring and not-apocalyptic. AS conceptualizes the autism in a way that is ... shall we say, not comprehensive, and therefore unpopular. Despite this, they get funding, some of which likely would have gone to other better-liked organizations, which makes them additionally unpopular. Between this and their leadership being made up of people who do not have the condition they're working on, it makes them look sort of threatening and oafish.  Does that help?"
TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,ttumblrbots,5,Fri Jun 19 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"""not alienating the substantial population of people with mild cases that border on presenting as personality differences rather than a life-altering syndrome"".   That's not that big a problem in my opinion. If you want to break down autism into ""people who are ok, just different"" and ""life altering"" then we can't be suprised when somebody only tries to address one group. Especially when the groups have drastically different needs.  Opinions are divided on Autism Speaks, but somebody doing something probably still beats nobody doing anything.   As long as somebody is trying, we're probably still ahead of the game compared to the past."

TumblrAtRest,3adp8x,Luke530,4,Sat Jun 20 09:35:37 2015 UTC,"It's also pretty hugely unfair to people like me, who have family members with ASD and are expected to take care of them. My brother in particular is too high-functioning to receive social services, but still has difficulty with holding down a job and being able to drive or take the bus. My mom and I are responsible for taking him to and from work, providing him a place to stay, and de-escalating him when he freaks out in public (he's almost been arrested on several occasions). He's 23 years old, and will likely never improve from this state. You can tell me that autism is just a way of life that should be respected once he's independent enough to live that life without needing constant intervention from others. Until then, it's not fair for anyone to tell me that I'm wrong for wanting a cure."

TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,ProfessorShitDick,12,Thu Jun 18 14:14:02 2015 UTC,Some people can't stand people advocating for something that goes against their world view. Some people honestly believe that women are always victims and men are always aggressors when it comes to domestic violence and someone advocating against that looks wrong to them.  Rather than look critically at their own world view they lash out instead.
TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,saichampa,3,Thu Jun 18 14:23:08 2015 UTC,For some reason a lot of people see domestic violence response/support/shelters as a zero-sum game. So to them in trying to aid men she is actively taking away from women's resources. It's a stupid and small minded way to live.

If you believe that feminist theory is an important part of the definition of Feminism like I do, then radfems simply just take their premises to a more extreme conclusion. I also do not think that the moderates are above borrowing radfem rhetoric when it is convenient for them (for example, one could argue that ""Ban Bossy"" wouldn't have been a thing without the extreme social constructionist perspectives that academic Feminism is so fond of).  But like I said, I don't really know much about Pizzy. She could be a hate- monger for all I know."

TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,Toby-one,29,Wed Jun 17 23:29:59 2015 UTC,Also a lot of the insanity that comes out of Sweden is either blown out of proportions or was rejected and mocked because it was insane. Like the law to ban the male privilege of peeing while standing. It was never discussed as a law it was suggested as an ordinance for public buildings in the county of Sörmland and it blew up into international headlines before the guy talking about it had even actually suggested it as an ordinance... Naturally it was rejected and the guy who suggested it was publicly mocked. Of course that last part never made it into the news internationally.  While on the other hand the Germans actually had a rule that banned men from peeing while standing in public toilets that wasn't overturned until earlier this year when a court found that it is within mens right to pee while standing.
TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,selucram,5,Thu Jun 18 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"These was no ""rule"". Your article talks about a single case where a nutjob tenant sued an individual and subsequently lost."
TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,Toby-one,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:31:28 2015 UTC,Some toilets in the country have red traffic-style signs forbidding the standing position.   The court case was just between one tenant and a landlord (the tenant rents the landlords apartment) but it says that the phenomenon happens all over the country so it is not isolated to this particular landlord. At least according to the daily mail and my point really is that media is complete crap so I wouldn't trust them.
TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,soidboerk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:46:29 2015 UTC,I never ever saw any sign like that that was not meant as a joke and exclusively on non public toilets.  Most public bathrooms have urinals anyway. So such a sign wouldn't make much sense anyway except for stating to use urinals if you only want to pee.

TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,Toby-one,3,Thu Jun 18 16:06:38 2015 UTC,The feminist lobbied to broaden the legal definition of rape meaning that compared to countries like America we have a higher rate of rape reports/convictions (The year that the law was enacted the rate of rape almost doubled and for every year after that it was almost double the rate before the law was enacted) but when you do international victims surveys we land at around average for Europe.  People who aren't very good with statistics often look at a single data point in the 90s and a single data point in 2010 and conclude that immigrants cause rape eventhough if you look at the data for every year it doesn't really correlate at all.
TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,fuckingliterally,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"I forgot that happened over there. Is it a reasonable redefining of the word, or does it basically reinforce this subreddit's view of Sweden as a country?"
TumblrAtRest,3a7ubr,Toby-one,2,Thu Jun 18 20:50:41 2015 UTC,"I think it was mostly reasonable. As I remember the debate it was mostly about stuff like DFSAs (Drug Facilitated Sexual Assault) which is now considered rape. Of course since we now don't define rape the same way as other countries do we now look pretty bad (A feminist even used it as an argument against me ""Well you're from Sweden and a lot of Swedes are rapists so your argument is now invalid.."")  Edit: This problem of countries defining their laws and crimes differently is well known to criminologists and therefore they don't use the metric that most Wikipedia pages use (That is the number of people reported for a certain crime). They tend to use other types of studies before they get excited about a very deviating crime statistics like this.  Unfortunantely I can't really check it out in more detail right now as it's getting pretty late and I need my beauty sleep since tomorrow is the day when all of Sweden get shitfaced and dance around an erect penis penetrating the earth. Aaah pagan holidays are wonderful!"

I find this not only wrong because it ignores places where women may have an advantage over men (no matter how scarce this may seem to you specifically), the focus on outcome equality instead of rights equality completely ignores personal choice (some of which is inevitably effected by biology, though the extent of this effect is debatable)  Best case, this focus ends in loop-holes that ruin a small portion of non-conformists, and at worst case it ensures that everybody is some form of non-conformist and must suffer for it"""

Putting the petty racism of the comment to one side, people shouldn't be afraid to comment and say to you, by every manner of observation, that you are definitively wrong, and that it takes a real ""special"" sort of guy to be able to see what you're claiming to in the picture of a regular guy. To me, he looks as normal as anybody.  For comparison, for those of you who don't know what a gorilla looks like, this is a gorilla. There is no resemblance in the slightest.  You can say ""Oh, but Darwin says..."", but if that's your defence we may as well start comparing white people to chimpanzees (in a genuine, offensive, non-ridiculous/joking manner). Sure, there may be a similar lack of resemblance beyond the fact that the chimpanzee looks vaguely humanoid, but it seems some ""special"" people are just willing to go down that path of vulgarly comparing people to monkeys for no reason except to try and cause offence.  This sub is all about calling people out on their bullshit and watching people get served, but just because you're not a Tumblrina doesn't mean you get an exemption."

TumblrAtRest,3a0hjq,Droidball,9,Tue Jun 16 16:23:38 2015 UTC,The characters are overly complicated for the plot.  It's really unecessary to go through an exposition episode on every single secondary character that shows its face in the show. It distracts from the main story.   Professional writers should KNOW that.
TumblrAtRest,3a0hjq,janiceian1983,7,Tue Jun 16 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought that method of showing the backgrounds of the characters was a significant portion of the entire intent of the show.  Yeah, it's a story about the prison, but it's also a story showing how and where each of these people came to be, how they ended up as who they are. This is emphasized by the intro sequence, I think - the focus is on the faces of inmates, the most empathy inducing part of a person's body. The show is meant to have us realize that these aren't just characters in a show, they're hypothetical people and representative of actual people in the prison system, reminding us that even convicted felons are still people. People with good and bad upbringings, people who got dealt a great hand at life and a shitty hand, people who have hopes and fears and families and struggles and needs and prejudices, just like anyone else. It works, in part, because we as a society so readily dehumanize and ignore felons and convicts and prisoners, and often don't actually think of them as human beings.  Or maybe I'm reading way too much into it."
TumblrAtRest,3a0hjq,Droidball,2,Tue Jun 16 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"You're describing Oz (another prison drama) and I think you'll find the themes your discussing are pretty common throughout all prison tv shows.  Here are the final words of Oz, said by the Narrator, Augustus Hill:  ""So, what have we learned? What's the lesson for today? For all the never-ending days and restless nights in Oz? That morality is transient? That virtue cannot exist without violence? That to be honest is to be flawed? That the giving and taking of love both debases and elevates us? That God or Allah or Yahweh has answers to questions we dare not even ask? The story is simple. A man lives in prison and dies. How he dies, that's easy. The who and the why is the complex part. The human part. The only part worth knowing. Peace. """

TumblrAtRest,3a2jjn,ChickensDontClap90,2,Thu Jun 18 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"This might be the best article on the subject. The Enlightenment is the best set of ideas that mankind has had so far. Out of it came the Scientific Method, the idea that reality is rational and given enough time and study, could be known. Going away from that to Relativism which is reality is governed by your perceptions is a dangerous one. The scientific method brought us everything from knowledge required to for you to see this message to the cure and vaccine for every disease ever eradicated. It's deeper than that. We wouldn't know that diseases are from microbes, that they are other living organisms that have a life cycle or could be killed. We would still be stuck thinking of the bodily fluids as ""humors"" and our ""moods"" as being imbalances between them.  The most powerful element of the Enlightenment was the idea of discourse and challenging of ideas against each other with evidence. The problem wasn't that before the Enlightenment people were stupid and didn't come up with good ideas. The problem was that we didn't have a way to show that good ideas are better than bad ones. Good ideas were lost. Not small things either. The Greeks had theories that the world was round. That idea had to be re-discovered hundreds of years later. The best thing about the Enlightenment is letting better  ideas prevail over lesser ones. This is what put a man on the moon, this is what cracked the atom, this is what will let us defeat every disease there is.  I don't think women and Feminist professors are doing so on purpose nor do I think stopping Scientific Progress is their goal. In fact, I don't think they really could but, the amount of political power they have can end up creating a lot of friction and conflict.  Ultimately, I think Feminism should be engaged in dialog, held to account and most importantly encouraged to foster a culture of competing ideas."

The masses don't have very nuanced views on this subject, and it requires nuance.   But as someone who's been through the system as a minor, I'm not that concerned. All of the therapists and doctors I worked with were primarily concerned with what I wanted or requested, rather than pushing any particular treatments onto me. Absolutely nothing was suggested by anyone else. The only reason I was in therapy at all was because I begged my parents for it. I wanted to change my name, I wanted to come out, I wanted to start hormones, etc., I told them so and they said ""Okay."" That's how it should work, in my opinion, and that's how it does work in my experience. No professional I worked with would ever say, ""Well, you're pretty butch, shouldn't you go all the way to male?"" If someone is gender nonconforming but didn't bring up that they wanted hormones, they wouldn't/shouldn't get them. If they have any hesitation at all about any particular treatment, the response is, ""Well we only want you to be comfortable, so if you're comfortable without this, great!""   It's well known among professionals that gender variance doesn't always last in children, which is why they take a ""wait and see"" approach to delaying puberty. And it turns out that adolescents are pretty darn accurate in knowing their gender, so really all you have to do is ask them."

The problem being that there might be multiple reasons a patient believes that they're trans, everything from actually being trans to internalized sexism.

I feel like if I was exactly the same mind but inside a woman's body, then I'd identify as female. I'd be a female that has interests that are more traditionally masculine, but I'd still be a female. I'd be a female that dresses and acts in more masculine ways, and I'd be a female that's attracted to other females, but I'd look at my body and say ""huh, boobs and a vagina?

It's pretty hard to understand what would make a trans person seek identify as such. But transgender identities appear to be a genuine mismatch between primary sexual characteristic and neurological phenotypes during prenatal development. There is very strong evidence of the biological origins of transgender identities, actually. From Chung and Auger, European Journal of Physiology, 2013: “Gender-dependent differentiation of the brain has been detected at every level of organization -- morphological, neurochemical, and functional -- and has been shown to be primarily controlled by sex differences in gonadal steroid hormone levels during perinatal development.” From Swaab and Bao, Neuroscience in the 21st Century, 2013: “Gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender), sexual orientation (hetero-, homo-, or bisexuality) ... are programmed into our brain during early development. There is no proof that postnatal social environment has any crucial effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.” From Jürgensen, et al., Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2010: “There is strong evidence that high concentrations of androgens lead to more male-typical behavior and that this also influences gender identity.”"

TumblrAtRest,39sz5f,Finch58,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"The SJWs I know in real life do actually address socioeconomic background and there has been a focus on it recently in the same universities that are SJW havens nowadays, but they don't emphasize it enough, or know what they're talking about, beyond sticking it to the rich.  I once asked a SJW why they were so focused on identity politics as opposed to economics, and their answer was, ""You can be the richest black or Hispanic and still be racially profiled, shot by the police, or otherwise discriminated against, and you can be the richest woman and still be sexually harassed, live in constant fear of rape, or have your accomplishments doubted, so don't tell me what I'm doing is unimportant.""  All of this, although exaggerated, is fundamentally true. But the priority should always be on economic issues, because that is what affects the largest amount of people. The problem is, when they do address economic issues, they are as bad as they are on social issues. Unsurprisingly, none of them actually study economics.  I'm reminded of the Occupy movement and the Fight for 15 in those instances- they did not have any understanding of what could happen if their proposals were to actually come into effect besides ""poor people get paid more and rich people make less profit"", because economics is more complex than that and they didn't seem to understand the concerns about possible rise in unemployment, capital flight, or inflation as a result. I'm not saying that their proposals are outright wrong, but the people that are arguing for them aren't convincing.  Even online, whenever SJWs address economic issues, they take their same SJW, oppressed and oppressor, rhetoric with them. Take a look at this article and you'll see what I'm talking about: http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/7-things-people-who-say-theyre-fiscally-conservative-socially-liberal-dont  To them, if you don't support or even have concerns about left-wing economic policy, you must be a corporate shill or a defender of the plutocracy, and an oppressive shitlord to boot."

It's also good for people to keep in mind that most of the world does not have access to trans health care that people in countries like the U.S. have. I'm betting there a lot of people who suffer from dysphoria don't even know being transgender is a thing. Despite having the prerequisite conditions ad you have deacribed, they do not, and probably will never have a choice. There is a third group of people though. Those who transition medically but do not transition socially. They go through hormone replacement therapy, and might even have some kind of surgery, but they still identify as their birth gender.

Unless she is considering everyone Africans because our roots are from Africa regardless of race, but if that's her logic, by today's standards we are also all Africans. Regardless of migrations those that constructed Stonehenge (4000BC) are part of the ancestors of modern britain. Regardless of all that, it's stupid not to consider all those sub group Europeans, we all are, Europeans with very very small different ethnicity variation. Which is not race, it's ethnicity variation.  What now? how much more we are going to divide ethnicity? And later after ethnicity? Are we going into more genetic nuances? Are going to get more and more specific until white man privilege is only owned by Brad from 8th floor in that old building in Boston? What's her point now?

TumblrAtRest,39kbz6,breatherevenge,7,Fri Jun 12 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"Black culture or African American culture Is not synonymous with cultures from Africa, it's distinctly an American sub culture.    Ppeople argue that African American culture is a misrepresentation, since it's a culture from the American Black community and the entirety of the community is not African American descendant.  And unlike other ethnic U.S sub-cultures whose cultures are  brought over from their place of origin, black culture was predominately created within the U.S and doesn't take it's cultural influence from countries within Africa (for obvious reasons)"
TumblrAtRest,39kbz6,FoxRaptix,2,Fri Jun 12 22:15:05 2015 UTC,There's much of American culture that has been created within the US. Why just make the distinction when it is exhibited by American black people?

TumblrAtRest,39kbz6,bananashammock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"That's because it is unique and wasn't specifically brought over from another country.  That's why i said African American culture is often probably improper identification for it.  Since not all Black Americans are African decedent, and that's more apt for parts of the culture where they've tried to connect with their roots.  But Black culture in the U.S is unique, it's based on racial identity because of old segregation/racist practices. They didn't exist as Africans or foreigners, they existed culturally as a group centered around the unifying aspect that was the color of their skin.  They weren't viewed as people they were those blacks and this created a shared identity around their skin color, a shared community around it and a shared culture around it."
TumblrAtRest,39kbz6,FoxRaptix,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"The are are many aspects of many subcultures that are uniquely American, though. And this black culture you talk about? It's very much influenced by the melting pot of America, just like all the others. It's not just something that originated and existed in a cultural vacuum. It's unique and interesting and all that good stuff. But it's not unique in it's uniqueness."
TumblrAtRest,39kbz6,bananashammock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:51:58 2015 UTC,yes and we identity each sub culture in our nation based on some common identifier.  The common identifier was around black identity within black communities back when black communities were near if not entirely 100% black because of racism and segregation laws that centered around skin color.  The culture developed uniquely because of those factors and because we also had laws that often banned practices from their native homelands which created unique distinct traditions.  For example the Black Codes outlawed drumming which meant they couldn't enjoy African Drumming traditions from their homeland and had to figure something else out.  It's not so cut and dry as with other sub-cultures.  There's a lot of debate within about identity

I really can't see how you can define a culture by the colour of their skin.   I think the best way to look at culture is by wheres and whens. Where you were, at what time, or era. The culture in 1950s New Orleans is very different than the culture in New York City. I think that still stands today.   It's almost racist to say that ""black culture"" is shared across all black Americans—defining a race by a characteristic."
TumblrAtRest,39kbz6,breatherevenge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"Right. But are we assuming ""black people"" are only American? What about the black people throughout Europe? I really can't see how you can define a culture by the colour of their skin.    Again, it's an American subculture it's not a global subculture.  It has nothing to do with black people outside the American Subculture.  Nor does it lump in every black person into that culture (though some on both sides of the aisle want to)  They are only apart of that cultural element if they prescribe to it.  It's a very American thing admittedly.  But this is because of old segregation laws where if you were black you were segregated off from the rest.  So a unique cultural identity formed around the color of their skin because of that period of segregation and thus you get a cultural based around that shared racial identity.  Now that doesn't mean someone who is not black can't grow up in that culture and be apart of it (depending on how someone is defining that cultural experience) but that doesn't remove the roots of where the predominate cultural influence is coming from.   It's almost racist to say that ""black culture"" is shared across all black Americans   No culture is universally shared.  But just because not all Irish celebrate Irish culture, doesn't make it any less Irish culture.  It just acknowledging where it came from.  and Black culture came from American Black communities"

Though this did affect their tastes on subject matter, nobody pretended that it didn't (or doesn't) happen.  In my personal opinion as a near-layman and based on others who studied this, I think many courses try to wash over it because they don't want to get into a judgment-based maelstrom that diverts conduct in the classroom. That is, if people start talking about blame and how much is put on whom, then the conversation tends to get defensive and/or offensive.

This isn't so. Britain/England and other countries went to Africa, and when they got there the society they met sold them slaves. This eventually skyrocketed, and the slave trade was born. Now, the argument against this is ""WELL WE FORCED THEM TO"" or ""THEY WERE NICER TO THEIR SLAVES"". That is simply false. They'd been doing it long before us, and you know how they got the slaves? War. We didn't force them either, they made so much money off of it. We didn't need to force them. In fact, we actually had to force them to stop. And slavery still existed in the Middle East officially until 1962. It still exists though.

Females in comedy who allow ""sexist jokes"" are bad because they're obviously just giving in to their oppression to be ""seen as one of the boys"" or ""get laid"" or whatever. Sex-positive and sex-negative feminism are at odds for this reason, sex-positives saying that women have autonomy, and sex-negatives saying that women who sexualize themselves are bad because they increase the pressure on other women (because attraction is a zero-sum game after all).

Early intersectional feminism was intended to be very egalitarian, but in practice it later turned into tumblr feminism which isn't.  Ecofeminism is decidedly not egalitarian (its fundamental principle is that women are naturally nurturing, while men are naturally exploitive).  Womyn Born Womyn, which has mostly fallen out of favor now, was non Egalitarian (Mary Daly is an obvious example of why not).  And there's a bunch of others.  For each group, obviously some members are egalitarian and others aren't (that's the nature of groups).  A good example of an egalitarian feminist is Janet Halley, for example.

Consider the street harassment videos where the harassers were actually all black and latino men, leaving the message that the problem was black and hispanic people talking to white girls.  That kind of thing is why Black Feminism (and Intersectional Feminism) got started (obviously it got started long before those videos).  Remember, I said Liberal Feminism focuses on mostly white women despite being egalitarian in goals.  Egalitarian doesn't mean ""spreading your efforts equally"".  So no, they don't often do stuff for men.  It just means your goal is equality.  They focus on helping women to achieve equality.  And NOW, well, NOW has certainly screwed up (Duluth Model!), but it's also got plenty of egalitarians running around in it too, whose goals are equality even while focusing on women.  It's like how the NAACP is egalitarian, but focuses on helping black people.  If you want feminism that specifically does stuff for men, that would mostly be Equality Feminism.   The Good Men Project was also a feminist attempt to do that.  And note that even if they don't focus on it, plenty of feminism groups still at least talk about male issues (Bell Hooks, one of the founders of third wave feminism, certainly did so, though I find her analysis lacking)."

Listen to an ecofeminist talk about patriarchy and that one might say it's ""the system by which men use corporate power to exploit the environment"", and that fighting that means putting women, with their more nurturing nature, in charge.  Not all branches even use the word (equality feminism basically doesn't).  So that's kind of a nonsense question.   Or the idea of men as oppressors and women as the oppressed?   Most say that women are oppressed, without the idea that men specifically are the oppressors (they'll usually say it is our cultural background itself that causes the oppression).

Since they don't even use the same overall framework, that's just wrong.  Sounds like you're only familiar with specific feminist ideas (mostly 1970s radical feminism, I'd guess).  While many feminists still use that, many others don't."
TumblrAtRest,39c99c,JaronK,8,Sat Jun 13 21:57:36 2015 UTC,To be honest feminism is about raising women to the same legal status as men (something that happend a long time ago).
TumblrAtRest,39c99c,uncommonman,16,Wed Jun 10 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"""Raising"" being the important word here.  Even when women were extremely discriminated against (and even now in places where they still are) - they have some legal perks where they are above men. In total they were still far far below in rights, but they had some rights / legal protections that men didn't.  By your own words - feminism is about raising women to the same legal status as men. So by definition - they don't want to do anything in the areas where women had more rights to begin with.  Obviously they won't try to reduce the rights of women in those fields, but they won't raise the legal status of men in those fields either as that's not in their ""charter"".  So they aren't about equality. They're about making sure women never have less than men - but that's not equality if you ignore areas where men have less than women."
TumblrAtRest,39c99c,Men13,7,Thu Jun 11 05:58:56 2015 UTC,This is correct. And this is why I will never believe that feminists will actually take care of problems of men.

It's not.  Feminism is not about equality, feminism has never been about equality, and feminism will never be about equality.    At its most rational and palatable, feminism is still about the specter of unilateral ""female oppression"".  It's still about seeing everything through a fabricated context where men have ""all the power"", and women are powerless and therefore responsible for nothing.

The reason I find it hard to identify myself as a feminist is because moderate feminists, instead of actually calling out misandrists and telling them why they're wrong, tend to just say ""they're not really a feminist!"" and leave it at that, but they're wrong- if you label yourself a feminist, you're a feminist, just like how it works with any other ideology.   The fact that a lot of feminists turn it around and go ""if you believe men and women are equal, you're a feminist!"" also irks me to no end. All the time, you see feminists telling people that don't identify as feminists that they MUST be feminists, or they're misogynists. Imagine the backlash if the Republican Party said something like ""If you believe in personal freedom, you're a Republican, and if you're not a Republican, you're American-hating scum!""  Tl;dr the definition of feminism is completely irrelevant when you judge it by its negative aspects."

Her work includes the books Who Stole Feminism? and The War Against Boys, both of which are critical of contemporary feminism. She also hosts the video blog called Factual Feminist.  Sommers is known for her criticisms of contemporary feminism. She coined the term ""equity feminist"" to denote her philosophy, which she contrasts with what she calls ""victim"" or ""gender feminism"",  arguing that modern feminist thought often contains an ""irrational hostility to men"" and possesses an ""inability to take seriously the possibility that the sexes are equal but different"".  Other scholars and feminists have called her works and positions anti-feminist.      Sommers rejects claims that she is opposed to feminism.

TumblrAtRest,392wda,Anthrex,3,Tue Jun 9 01:17:46 2015 UTC,"Most of the resources I found online revolve around raising awareness via social media. This is Fahmy Free Press Foundation's campaign page for Atena...they have a link to their Facebook page.  If you're affiliated with a college/university, raising awareness on campus is an idea. See if there's any Amnesty International chapters in your area ( Canada, USA) and what campaigns they have for Atena and Free Speech advocacy."

TumblrAtRest,38yuee,occupied_texas,-2,Fri Jun 12 07:36:12 2015 UTC,"I know that people generally react badly to this and hate to be a party pooper, but I'm still commenting because who gives a shit about internet points.   Of course, anyone can say what they want, it's just that I don't like seeing so many Holocaust puns made whenever Hitler is mentioned. I don't know, it just sits weirdly with me when people make fun of the Holocaust, but I can't stop you and there are huge cultural differences as well so I understand why it might seem okay to many people.  Just dropping in :)  PS: If you're interested and you're an American, the Holocaust Museum in D.C. is a powerful experience and well worth the time, if you can go."
TumblrAtRest,38yuee,95wave,6,Mon Jun 8 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but at the same time I think there's something disarming about laughing in the face of such a terrible tragedy. The reason holocaust puns are funny, at least for me, is not because it's laughing at the terrible fortunes of the people the Nazis imprisoned, or the lives that they destroyed; it's funny because it's taboo to laugh at tragedy. Jokes that poke at or break taboos are often seen as the most funny because someone actually had the balls to say it. Then again, I personally have a really wicked case of gallows humour, so that might have something to do with it as well.  If you consider it in poor taste, by all means. Humour is subjective of course, and not everyone responds to jokes the same way. I just wanted to perhaps shed some light on where these jokes are coming from, as it's not really a malicious place, or one that mocks the victims of the holocaust."
TumblrAtRest,38yuee,A_Drunk_Polak,6,Mon Jun 8 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I know that most of the time, like here, it's not malicious, and I sometimes have a dark humor too.  I like breaking taboos, it just alarms me sometimes how quick people throw out their pre- programmed jokes about showers or whatever because some people are dumb as shit and might actually think it's funny to make fun of that.  But it's really nice that you replied in such a friendly way and showed me your point of view, thanks a lot!"
TumblrAtRest,38yuee,GordionKnot,3,Tue Jun 9 11:15:36 2015 UTC,"You're right, of course. I'd also point out that in America, there's quite a bit more distance between that particular horror and the popular conscience. It's akin to joking about Genghis Khan, or the Spanish Inquisition; we're far more removed from that time and place than many Europeans are. Contrast that to jokes about 9/11 or the Oklahoma bombing; you're far more likely to elicit a negative reaction because that hit home in a very real way. Americans didn't witness the camps, the ovens, the ""medical buildings"" in the same way that the Polish or Czechs did; we just don't have those scars on our collective memory. Lolocaust jokes just feel a bit safer in the States, much as I'd imagine jokes about the Civil War do in Europe. Y'all don't get taught about the mass amputations, the raiding parties, the gangrene in the same way that American children do.  Joking about people dying is kosher with me, but Auschwitz jokes are getting a little overplayed."

Not only is it highly unlikely that the responder actually meant for the OP to kill herself--not that that makes it much better--but what's important is that OP compared herself to HITLER. It gets watered down a lot in the modern day--which is exactly how situations like this occur--but Hitler saw fit to lead a country to systematically murder millions of innocent people and anyone who willingly compares themselves to him is very very morally wrong.

TumblrAtRest,38vrai,FyreFlu,20,Sun Jun 7 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"I fear we created them. Created a world, where people with so petty concerns like micro-triggers are able to prevail and get a decent salary job and create family. And, most importantly, get heard by others, connect into groups and make this madness to some growing standard. Whereas, normal (omg what a trigger word!) life with moderation: a bit of crap in childhood, surviving teenage idiocy, growing up to be an adult, facing who the past made you, finding a partner to share life with, where 2 pasts and their results clash, having family, but go onward without dissecting it all into victim complex, is ignored or even undesired.  This brought tear to my eye in the shower this morning - if this trend continues and spreads through the world, it will end up with war. War resets the society, brings the important values up front, when faced with immediate threat to life and to whom we hold dearest. If we really waste our time for these discussions and trivialities, then we are doomed. If SJWs reach critical mass, they won't ever grow up. They will be able to go through life amidst their own communities, polluting healthy reason and being vocal enough to make the world shittier place.  And thirdly, regarding the trigger warnings, I feel partially guilty. I saw where it started - it was the dawn of fanfiction, mostly after Harry Potter era exploded into millions of fan stories. People claiming they won't read certain ships, because it triggers them, then spamming and threatening authors breaking out of their beloved part of ""fanon"". I waved it off as some retarded teenagers and ignored it, I didn't react. Nobody understood that giving internet to the hordes of the usual awkward-stage youngsters will allow them to easily create communities to support and prevail in their weirdness, and then make it into lifestyle, and then finally into college topics, projects, and legislature proposals.  Just some shower thoughts, damn, should really go back to studying..."

They would surrender within a week.  Also, were they to segregate into their own communities, they would die out pretty fast. Probably in excess of 90% of SJWs are female, and such a society would struggle immensely as the balance of male and female contrast is probably what helps society keep running. Breaking off would mean that their output would be censored, and the fact that they all hate men means they will not have children until they drop their childish opinions, and as such would be eradicated within 40 years."

Some of what he says is actually on point, such as abolition of college tuition, but there is no doubt that Bernie would be the SJWs' favorite candidate. The SJWs I know have all been posting articles about how great Bernie Sanders would be if he became president.

The fact that Hillary is a woman doesn't mean much because she's an ""imperialist warmonger"" and a ""conservative"". And the $15 minimum wage IS a SJW topic, maybe not among Tumblr SJWs, but real life college SJWs, the ones that got involved in the Occupy movement. And SJWs I know love Europe and say that the US have got things all wrong, which I partially agree with but not completely.  Economic SJWs do exist, I've met them, and they're just as bad and shrill as they are on social issues, and unsurprisingly, none of them have studied economics. Their go-to insults when talking about economics are ""corporate shill"", ""heartless"", ""lacking in empathy"", and ""wanting children/poor people to starve""."

Also, just because he is a socialist doesn't mean hes a SJW, the minimum wage increase does make some sense, however I would love to know what effect that will have on inflation, but at the end of the day a 40 hour work week should make you live above the poverty line. Also something HAS to be done about foreign tax havens and the amount of corporate influence in politics, hell, if I could, I'd vote for Hillary if she supported getting rid of tax loopholes and bribery lobbying and had a history of following through on what she said, last thing anyone wants is another Obama.

It's all primary talk...she'll go to her moderate positions once the primary is over. The SJWs themselves are also Bernie fans, and that's who Hillary is trying to get for votes.  I'd say in terms of my views I'm somewhere in between the two. I don't think Bernie is a SJW, but SJWs love his socialist rhetoric and his social-democratic policies, which has both social and economics components that appeal to them. As for the minimum wage, I actually don't like as much as the system they have in some European countries where there are unions and employer's associations negotiating it out. I do agree with his proposal to eliminate tax havens and make public colleges tuition-free though. As for electability? Hillary is far superior with the moderates, so that we don't get a Republican.  The only truly negative thing about Sanders is how far he's actually willing to go. I think there are some far-reaching reforms that need to be done in the United States that only he and Elizabeth Warren support, but I'm afraid that if he and whoever gets elected on his coattails in Congress get some policies wrong, what we could end up with is not Germany or the Scandinavian countries, but rather France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, or Greece.

TumblrAtRest,38vrai,Anthrex,3,Mon Jun 8 04:37:07 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Bernie's a polarizing figure. The fact that he calls himself a socialist and how people respond to that says a lot about how both progressive Democrats and very conservative Republicans think. Though the progressives have been very tight-lipped years ago because their goal was just to get the Bush Republicans out, now that the recession has come and gone and the Democrats have gained popularity, they are being more honest about what they would want if they were to control everything, which is personified in Bernie Sanders. The conservative Republicans, who have always seen any Democrat as a socialist, are saying that they were right all along- that the Democrats were socialists at heart and it is only the threat of the Republicans who are keeping them moderate. That's why you get the lavish praise from the progressives (because he represents what they REALLY want and not what they're forced to take due to having to appeal to moderates and having to compromise) and the ""SOCIALISM BAD DURRR"" from the conservative Republicans (in response to the praise, ""proving"" that the Democrats were all really just a bunch of socialists all along).  I have a mixed, critical opinion of him because while I like some of his policies and know they work in certain European countries, he is such a radical departure from the status quo that I don't quite know what to think of him if he were to get his way 100%. That's why I said he'd better be damn sure that he knows what he's doing, because if he ever gets into office and fucks things up, the Dems will be in the wilderness for a LONG time, much longer than if Hillary were to get into office. It's because the ""socialism"" label sticks better on someone who calls himself a socialist, and he is representing the entire left-wing economic ideology. If he does well, we could see another New Deal, post-WWII era of prosperity and electoral success for the left, which will by then be European-style social democrat by then. If he doesn't, the US will end up even more right-wing than it is now, because there is now ""proof"" that ""socialism"" (anything other than Republican ideology) has well and truly failed.  What I truly want is for either Bernie to become more moderate, or for Hillary to get pushed a little left due to Bernie's influence. If that were the case, either would make fine presidents with a cooperative Congress."

The argument around it is that the jobs that cause the greatest loss of life such as forestry aren't restricted to men, but because men are less valuable socially proper safety procedures aren't put in place and the entire industry in general makes more money because its workers are expendable. When women go to do the job you get ""but honey that's dangerous"", but when men go to do the same job it's justified in a variety of ways, the biggest justification being ""it's good money and he's taking that risk for his family"".  Around here a forestry worker dying on the job costs a company upward of $40k in fines, but that's nothing compared to the cost of buying and in fact inventing all of the equipment that'd need to do the job safely. It's much cheaper to have them out there doing physical labour, risking their lives and placing the onus for safety on them personally with the occasional fine.  Realistically if ""men are more clumsy"" then society would benefit from improving their chances of survival... unless they're simply not on an equal footing with the other gender and are therefore more expendable. You see the exact same disproportionate response when it comes to racial differences in the workplace as well. It undeniably exists.  I've never understood why there isn't just an honest hit list of issues that we need to fix being championed. Ordered by no particular importance, just a list of things that we as a society need to address. It doesn't matter who the issue is affecting beyond that they're people too."

In fact, males who have called abuse hotlines to try to get help with abuse or rape from a woman have been laughed at.  Like he said in the video, he told his friends he didn't like it and they just made fun of him, so he forces himself to view it as hilarious since that is the only way he can cope.

To me, he seems a little more disgusted by the rape in I Spit On Your Grave than 40 Days And 40 Nights, but he also seems to have many other complaints to level at I Spit On Your Grave that likely played a role in bringing the rating so low, so the inclusion of his review in the analysis may not be the most honest. I do think the point overall - that playing a woman getting raped as even somewhat comedic would ruin the movie for far more people/create far more outrage than the scene in 40 Days did - still appears valid, but this does weaken the argument.

Rule 3: DON'T BE A SCHMUCK.   3A: Don't make fun of people with genuine problems like cancer, autism, or depression, or some medical issue that you might not believe is real, but feel free to make fun of anyone who's self-diagnosed with something and is clearly bullshitting. You know where the line is.  3B: Also, treat your fellow shitlords excellently. Don't tear them down just because they're a proud feminist (or MRA, or libertarian, or communist or whatever). Respectfully disagree, if you do. Personal attacks are dick moves, so don't make them (and that goes for how you respond to the mods as well). Name calling or starting a flamewar/general dickheadness will not be tolerated. Be civil, we are here to laugh.  3C: Also, Try not to post blogs where the blogger is under 16. It is not always going to be apparent, but when it is, don't post it. The rationale here is that 13 year old otherkin is a lot different than a 30 year old one. One is a kid that is likely just going through a phase and the other one is a grown ass adult that has made a choice to be otherkin. That is just an example though and other areas we deal with have the same sort of rationale. There is no need for a ton of people goofing on a dopey kid when there are a ton of dopey adults out there.

His parade of horribles—he once saw an adjunct not get contract renewed!—is pretty weak sauce for outrage, even if you try to imagine it being uttered by Rutger Hauer in Bladerunner. I've taught at the college level and have many friends who are academics (tenure track and adjunct) and there's no question that students are often really annoying jackasses. Which is almost perfectly balanced by the ways in which faculty are jackasses. Although it's not completely determined by commercial transactions, college is and always will be a customer experience for students and overall that has empowered them to call shots that are generally good.    Man, the author really shit the bed here. His way of thinking is part of the problem. Students having to be treated like ""customers"" by their profs, not on eye level, else they take their money elsewhere, LEADS (alongside PC) to the sanitization of college debate. US customer service culture is about the most sanitized space on earth, though recently being rivalled by SJW safe spaces.

TumblrAtRest,38i7bu,blolfighter,25,Thu Jun 4 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"No, it makes sense. Providing a name means that you are supplying your prospective employer with a host of reasons to be possibly discriminated against, including your race, your gender, and possibly your religion. On the flip side, depending on where you apply, your name might increase the chances of you getting the job (if your family has a connection to that company, for example).   Of course, none of these things really matter. I believe that we should be moving towards a meritocracy, which counteracts racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. The best way to make sure you are not discriminated against by a prospective employer is by never supplying them with the irrelevant information needed to discriminate against you.   In terms of job applications, what is the difference between a name and, say, a different identification number, like a Social Identification Number (which most jobs ask for anyways)?"
TumblrAtRest,38i7bu,Could-Have-Been-King,14,Thu Jun 4 14:18:06 2015 UTC,"It makes the kind of sense that only works in a purely theoretical vacuum.  In reality, this is a totally absurd suggestion (not for the least reason that you generally need a name AND a SSN in order to do a background check as an employer, and you might need the birth date as well).  And extending your logic only slightly also enables the ludicrous to sneak in under your guise of logic: supplying your age simply enables discrimination against older workers, supplying educational experience is discriminatory against those who could only go to community college, or no college at all, or the alma mater that the HR director happens to hate!  Work experience is just a way to discriminate against the fresh-out-of-school job seeker, or to keep from paying an overqualified employee too much money!  The heart of the SJW mentality is assuming that no one else can possibly be entrusted with information, because they'll always make the wrong/racist/misinformed/hateful decision.  The way you oppose that is by trusting people to be decent and encouraging them along that path into community, not by trying to circumvent them."

I'm only saying that things included on your job application should be relevant to the position you're applying for. I never said anything about omitting details of past work experience, or education, because those are actually relevant to the job.  Let me ask you: do you have to be a woman to be a secretary? Do you have to be Korean to work at a convenience store? Do you have to be a man to be an accountant? Do you have to be Indian to work in a call centre? I believe the answer to these questions is ""no"": anyone can work any job, as long as they are qualified for it. Gender / race / ethnicity / religion should have nothing to do with it. Age is sometimes relevant, depending on the job.   The way you oppose that is by trusting people to be decent and encouraging them along that path into community, not by trying to circumvent them.

Look, you can call it a moderate proposal if you want to, but it's still trying to solve a problem that largely doesn't exist, via means that no business would ever agree to willingly because it only makes their job harder.  The application stage of job seeking is almost always just a way to filter down a large list of applicants to a small list of applicants.  So you're asking all HR personnel to work double the hours or more on finding a new employee with very no assurance (or even much of a chance) that you'll get a better employee out of it, all in the name of some kind of socially progressive mentality.  Since you don't like trying to poke holes in ideology with a countering ideology, I'll just use realism instead.  It won't work."

You're making a mountain out of a molehill simply because of how much you hate SJW's, when realistically there would be very little changes made in the hiring process. I'll leave this discussion at that because it was pretty silly to begin with.  Edit: If it makes you feel any better the same process could equally apply to businesses who are biased towards PoC and women over white men. I don't see why this has to be an inherently progressive policy to have."

I was not allowed to input any information regarding my name, ethnicity, or religious background in the application. When I submitted my application, I received a number that was generated automatically, and I used that number throughout the application process. It was easy, painless, and removed some bias from the hiring process.  On the flip side, I got the job that I'm working at now because I'm the third member of my family to work for my company. I had an ""inside source,"" so i heard about the upcoming job posting before it was made public. And my last name helped me get my interview (which i had to do on my own, and defend my eligibility for the position, as per usual). I like to think that, if I was someone else with the exact same experience and education, that I would have landed the same job. I'm not entirely sure, though.  Removing irrelevant information from the hiring process is relatively simple, and relatively painless for the applicant. I can't speak for HR, but I can't imagine people would object if, instead of putting down a name, you had to write down a government-issued number."

When someone looks over a resume/CV they tend to infer all sorts of things about the prospective candidate, based on the limited information available. Many of those things will be completely inaccurate, yet can carry a lot of weight and it can potentially affect everyone.  'Oh, a white guy called John Clarke? I'll bet he's never had to work hard for anything ever! Well, he's not getting a job here!'  'White chick called Tiffany Cunningham? Probably a typical spoilt daddy's girl airhead who went to prep school and gets everything she asks for. Nope.'

Another method to deconstruct the perception of racism is that they release a report that shows where you are relative to the people that got the position using a bell curve.   In NYC, the gov does it for fitness tests.

I've seen both sides argue it purely from the ""increase pay and the problem is solved!"" line and it just seems incredibly short sighted.  Time would be better spent arguing the specific underlying points  I've seen a number of stats that show that within specific industries, at similar job titles men and women make ~= money.  Obviously that means within those industries we evaluate their work as equally valuable.  However, the overall wage gap stat takes into account stuff like certain low paying industries being heavily populated by women, lack of upper management women (4% of CEOs in the world are women), women dominating certain degree paths with very low job prospects, domestic labor in certain sectors being predominantly female, etc.    On the flip side the % has zero concern for if people are happy.  We assume that the gap has to be zero, but is that necessarily true? eg. Are the women who predominantly do domestic labor happy to be doing that on average?  Would a large # of men be happier being in some of these lower paying roles?  I personally would be happy with domestic day job but that's just me and I know many who would not.  There's also issues around societal determinism and being pushed in certain directions: ""you can do or be whatever you want (as long as it's this one thing!)"" implications from peers, parents, extended family, etc.  All of the underlying issues are incredibly complex and varied (each with their own underlying issues) and it's just easier to throw out the % wage gap than argue for or against each individual problem.  Lastly I really hate blogs like this that try to raise a point and then resort to shit slinging and name calling.  Maybe it's just me but I tend to respect opinions more when they are just the facts without revealing any underlying biases."

The message in the OP dates back to a time when being trans was something you did and got over with as quickly as possible: you transitioned, at that was that; you were a different person before, and now you're complete.

The difference is that the prevailing belief is that the left is completely without those type of people. I see the SJW culture as being analogous to the Tea Party of the right, I'm just a little wary because they seem to be gaining more ground and acceptance. It scares me, as a liberal and a bullshit caller, to see this kind of thing getting traction because the silencing of any views is very wrong in my opinion. Especially in college today, people will listen to the kind of things that I say and most sjw think I am one of them until I don't tow the party line and I'm dismissed. For instance, when a friend said something along the lines of ""oh white people are terrible seriously like all around"" and I call them out on it and say ""well that's actually pretty racist to say"", I find that I'm ""exhibit A of how white people are terrible"" and told in no uncertain terms that I am no longer welcome in their home, just for that. Best part is that the ""friend"" was also white.  I'm so frustrated because I hold very liberal views but the majority of the other people with views like mine have another set of way more radical views that I cannot, as a matter of principle, get behind."

The entire point of fashion is to draw attention, it's completely asinine to argue that boys should just ignore what the girls wear when whether they acknowledge it or not, the whole of what they're wearing is to get people to look.

In the real world you quickly realize that your employer dictating what is not acceptable in the world place is the least of your problems and completely not worth the time it takes to bitch about it.

I'm saying you don't have to wear business casual to get a good education.   But I think you're more saying that the best schools have formal uniforms. If that's the case, you need to cite a source on that because I don't believe that. My school did have a uniform, but you could wear your own jeans, tshirts, IE informal clothing. And we were pretty much the top prep school in the state."
TumblrAtRest,388nu2,iEliteTester,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:30:12 2015 UTC,"My mistake.  It would have been more accurate to say there are clear benefits to school uniforms.  I don;t really know what schools are ""the best"" and was really only considering the high schools in my area, where that statement is true but not necessarily representative of anywhere else.     I'm saying you don't have to wear business casual to get a good education.   I would agree, I think we might have misunderstood each other.  Most uniforms I've seen are at least business casual, but I think it's the uniform, not the level of formality it has, that makes the difference.  I think I might have confused us when I mentioned how formal mine was.  I guess I meant to say it makes it really easy for me to put on a suit and wear it comfortably now, even though my line of work hasn't called for it even once in the 12 years I've been in it.     not everyone going to high school is being prepped to be a professional. So why should we treat them as such?   What's the point of getting educated beyond middle school if you don't plan on having a career?  I'm a carpenter, and even in my trade there is a certain level of professionalism involved.  Sure, you might think of the stereotypes about tradesmen with their coarse language and disregard for social boundaries in the workplace, and those exist for a reason, but there are standards in dress and code of conduct that are strictly policed by employers and contractors alike.  The guys who complain about having to wear jeans and boots and sleeves on a 100 degree day are the same guys who lose an eye because they're too cool to wear safety glasses.  I've been around long enough to be able to pick out which of the new guys is going to end up donating a few pints of fresh blood to the floor, and it's almost always the way they dress for work that gives it away.   I'm of the opinion that everyone needs to learn how to act professionally, even if they plan on never having a job.  It's as important as learning to read and write."

Now, I used to see this everywhere in my high school where it would not be uncommon to see 'nip slips' or just general breast exposure from the boys. I think the deeper arguement could be pinpointed to: men's breasts are okay, women's breasts are not. I think if this specific case were to be put to rest, you would have to judge it with no bias towards which sex has the larger breasts and just look at the bigger question: is this appropriate attire for a formal learning institution?

I can probably understand why guys generally wouldn't suit short shorts, but they're sometimes seen as sexual predators (or this is what I assume) from wearing them.   On another note, these shorts, which I'm seeing on a lot of guys nowadays are pretty damn pointless, because it only cools your calves and shins while leaving your thighs to cook like chicken drumsticks and, additionally, they squash and boil your testicles so you can't ""make babies"" anymore."

Analogical reasoning is one of the most common methods by which human beings attempt to understand the world and make decisions.  When a person has a bad experience with a product and decides not to buy anything further from the producer, this is often a case of analogical reasoning. It is also implicit in much of science; for instance, experiments on laboratory rats typically proceed on the basis that some physiological similarities between rats and humans entails some further similarity (e.g. possible reactions to a drug).

But I've questioned that so many times - if women really did make that much less in the same jobs, why would anybody ever hire men to do anything? - and nobody has an answer besides ""Um, sexism?""  Plus it's already illegal to pay a woman less for the same job as a man (likewise, to pay a non-white person less). It has been since 1963. I mean, geez. If you're confident you're getting paid less and it's not a matter of your pay being performance-based or something, that's fucking illegal, so you go contact the authorities or sue or something instead of bitching about it on Twitter.

Some men work more and some work less.  Though the number of top wage earners who are men really DOES throw a lot of this data for a loop, especially when you take into account how HUGE the wage gap is between the top of a company and the entry level positions."

Women often make the choice to take time off for family, to have children, to care for older relatives, etc.  On the whole, men default to keeping up the burden of being the wage earner, while women tend towards the caretaking roles.  No matter how you slice it, though, it's still an opportunity cost and a choice.  Take a poll of women who work fewer than 40 hours in a week.  I'd bet you money that at least 7 out of every 10 will say that it was their own choice to do so."

When asked about it, he would just grin, hold his arm up, and mime the motion of the bow on a fiddle over his scar, complete with fake violin sounds.  I think it's sort of a defense mechanism. If we don't laugh about it, it'll consume us. Black humour is how we protect ourselves.

I am genuinely curious as to what Mustafa or those like her would think if, say, a black person were calling for the genocide of Mustafa's race. By her definition, that is not racist, and therefore no worse than what Mustafa said, right?"
TumblrAtRest,3832um,phalanx2,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"Are you actually genuinely curious or was that rhetorical?  In the context of sociology, the term racism refers to a systemic and deeply embedded form of racial oppression that exists for the economic benefit of the 1%, for eg, to justify slavery of black people in America, to justify slavery and poverty of black people in India, to justify brutal wars for oil profits in the Middle East, etc. This is not her definition.  A black person being hateful to a brown person is not necessarily 'racist' per se, but it depends on context. A black person calling for the genocide of 'paki terrorists' in America has the effect of supporting a deliberate right-wing islamaphobic agenda, which is expressly to commit wars to control oil for profit in the Middle East, so in this sense, it is racist. Without this context, it would only be hateful, not 'racist'.  In a legal sense, racism is not defined. The closest would be 'racial discrimination', which is ""[the exclusion based on race that has the effect] of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.""  Again, this makes context important. Nothing a black person can say can deny a Turkish person their human rights (for example). However, in the context of right-wing politically motivated islamaphobia in America, UK, it can deny a muslim person (which Turks tend to be) their human rights. So I would argue a black person generically hating a brown person is not racist, unless it is in the context of systemic, culturally sanctioned, economic motivated racism.  source: wiki article on racism"

It will be interesting how that clashes with the far left authoritarian SJW crowd - since history tells me it will be very violent.  On the other hand, this just seems to be an article written in the exact opposite tone and crowd of the SJW's.  It almost sparks anger and hate towards them as a group, someone to be dismissed outright for being ""crazy""  Much like the way the SJW's do to non-SJW's, to the point of attempting to silence critics outright.    Part of the problem I have with the article though is that the far left SJW's do fuel the fire to the real far-right white supremacists/nationalists/ethnocentrists. It fires them up. But in the same exact cyclic way that actually encountering a true white supremacist fuels the anger and amplifies the messages the SJW's spew to begin with.

You have a divide between people who do it as a fetish, people who are straight and cross dress and people who are gay who cross dress. Conflating them all together makes some people mad.    I think most of the push comes from the transgender community as often times early on transvestite is pushed on them when they are trying to do the opposite. Transvestic fetishism has a history in the past of being used against transwomen to prevent medical treatment.  Thus the term transvestite irritates some women as they have been called that and many have had it used against them.   Furthermore the link to the disorder makes crossdressers uneasy because it implies they are mentally ill.   While the word literally means cross-dressing, denying the connection to transvestic disorder is ignoring a lot of factors about why there is dislike of the word. I think if the dsm-VI would remove tranvestic fetishism it would remove a lot of the stigma that pushes people away from being called transvestites.

Also, please, lets talk about what's professional after reddit defended that man at NASA and his oh so appropriate shirt.  Do any of you actually understand what the dress code is like at schools? Dress codes ban tanktops - normal ones, not even just spaghetti strapped ones - because, what, shoulders are too distracting? You're required to where short shorts in the gym and sports - all of which is coed - but you can't wear the same in school. Most use the system of fingertip length, which isn't consistent or fair between body types.   Most people aren't protesting to be able to dress like hookers - they're protesting weird rules and inconsistancies that don't make sense. People are wearing outrageous croptops and shorts and posting pictures to protest - they aren't actually trying to wear those clothes.  At every school, there will be the girls trying to look like they work at Hooters, but the problem here is that dress codes frankly don't make much sense and are bizarrely enforced. The assumption that its the ""tumblr"" kind of girls making a fuss is completely wrong- its all kinds of girls who span the spectrum of subcultures that are against something that makes no sense. If there's one thing that the girl in leadership, the girl in track, the girl in debate, and the girl who loves anime can all agree on, its that the current dress code isn't working at all.  Clothes that would be against my schools dress code: shorts  shirt and of course, these aren't universally enforced.   EDIT: because I got the little controversial symbol, might as well go for broke - when did school become about dressing professional? Why does that make sense? And when does this start - the same dress code applies for K - 12. Isn't the whole point about being a kid to actually be one? I have a twelve year old sister, and I don't know how to explain to her that theres something so wrong with her body that she can't wear the kinds of clothes she normally does, the kinds of clothes that the media says are okay.

The same way a man wearing a button up shirt with the top buttons unbuttoned are inappropriate. Looks matter, as you know, and dressing for the occasion is included. As a kid, your job is to learn in school. At my job, if there was a woman showing off her shoulders or wearing a short skirt, I would not take her near as seriously as one who knew how to dress appropriately for the occasion. The same way I would if a man let his chest hair out set of by a good chain or something equally ridiculous. Basically, this is the way the world works, and it's something you will need to get used to, and if clothing choices are really something that irritate you, you are in for a hard life.

TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,yugiben,44,Sat May 30 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the ""equality is treating everyone differently to get equality of opportunity"" can be flipped. It is also the primary argument that justifies affirmative action and is the same argument that calls treating people based on their character and not their skin color (colorblindness) as racism.  Basically, it's SJWs that typically use the ""equality means acknowledging differences"" rhetoric.  This picture sums it up nicely: https://radicalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/equity-vs-equality.jpg?w=800"
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,hfwang18,8,Sat May 30 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on the argument. Opportunity doesn't mean giving them something others don't have, such as providing extra money for tuition. But It can mean giving them what others have and they don't, such as giving a group the right to vote/go to school. Here they're providing the second thing, a ball that fits their body size. You're not giving them, say, a trampoline that makes it easier to reach the net, because that's something other people don't have. You're giving them something that makes them equal with others."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,Ppleater,1 point,Sun May 31 13:14:06 2015 UTC,"What some people call giving extra to those that already have something, others would call giving to those that don't have. For example, giving extra money for tuition in private school financial aid for some is often considered leveling the playing field and giving to those that don't have an opportunity because it gives poor students the chance to attend that school- the same opportunity as everyone else. The smaller sized balls are similar. You appear to be giving something extra, but to maintain equality.  However, that kind of mindset could be and is applied to justify affirmative action because ""otherwise minorities (other than Asians) don't have the same opportunities to get into the school"", hence why supporters of affirmative action typically call it leveling the playing field or ""redressing historical discrimination"" that kept minorities down so now they need extra to catch back up."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,hfwang18,2,Sun May 31 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"But by the definition I used that's not what it is. They're just warping the definition to suit their needs. They'd do that with anything, it doesn't erase the merit of the idea.   Giving extra money is not the same as the balls because it is, by the very definition, giving them more than others have. It's not giving them a ball they can use, it's giving them a trampoline and saying it makes up for them not having the right ball. Except they do have the right ball, and they have for a while now. They mistakenly believe that they need compensation for not having the ball in the begining, even though that was during a different game with different teams and different rules."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,Ppleater,2,Sun May 31 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"My point is that you are still treating people differently (different sized balls) and calling it equality. It is necessary in certain contexts to achieve equality of opportunity, but the same ""equality of opportunity"" argument could also be used to justify things that are not fair, like affirmative action. The key is evaluating whether or not equality of opportunity exists, and then making changes based on that."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,hfwang18,4,Sun May 31 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"But there's nothing inherently wrong with treating people differently. People are different. That's a fact of life. What matters is if the way you treat them gives them an advantage instead of just putting them on equal footing. If you treat a handicapped person the same as everyone else, then they're at a severe disadvantage. A person in a wheelchair can't climb stairs so we make them a ramp. They aren't as likely to be hired so we made laws about hiring people with disabilities, and we provide them enough money to survive if they can't work at all.   But if we gave them stuff they didn't need, like expensive cars, or extra money (more than they need to live), or free post secondary education, then we're giving them an extra advantage in life that they don't need and others don't have.  Affirmative action is something people don't need. They already have equal opportunity to go to school, get a scholarship, etc. If there's prejudice making things difficult then that's what laws are for. Giving them extra money is giving them an advantage over others. Thus, to my belief, it is not providing equal opportunity.   There's a difference between equal opportunity and extra opportunity. Sjws will never understand that, but taking it away won't do anything but disadvantage people who have the wrong sized ball. They'd just move on to the next and warp that definition as well."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,Ppleater,1 point,Sun May 31 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"According to SJWs (especially real-life ones like Al Sharpton/Jesse Jackson), affirmative action is ""leveling the playing field"" because of institutionalized racism preventing blacks and Hispanics from competing fairly. They think it is completely fair because they think it puts them on equal footing.  As for financial aid, I actually happen to support giving ""extra tuition money"" to the poor, because the opportunity to attend a college should be based on academic merit, and not the wealth of your parents.  So, you are right in saying that we SHOULD treat people differently, but how do we determine when to and when not to? That is the debate for the ages, and I think both of us would draw the line at equality of opportunity, but might disagree as to what constitutes equality of opportunity. It'll be one of those age-old debates that will never die, so long as humans are not born equal, which they never are."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,hfwang18,2,Mon Jun 1 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"But the sjws beliefs do not match my definition. Yours however does. Giving them something others have that they don't: the poor don't have money by definition. Black people and other minorities have a wide variety of incomes. Black people don't need extra tuition, poor people do. My previous mentions were in reference to affirmative action. A better way to ""level the playing field"" would be to lobby for more laws against racist opinions in the work place, or get more minorities is positions of power. Don't give them money or favours just for their skin colour, that's ridiculous.   I've already mentioned how I think we can start with equal opportunity. Giving them something that they don't have access to that others do. Poor people don't have access to money because they have bad paying jobs. They can't get better jobs because they cant afford schooling, etc etc. Giving them tuition assistance gives them access education and thus to better jobs, which previously only richer people had. That money doesn't give them an unfair advantage. No one would think that it did. Just like how making balls for smaller people doesn't give them an advantage over bigger people with bigger balls. Giving black people money just because they're black gives them an advantage over white people, reguardless of perceived grievances in the past. But this is just my opinion. You're right that everyone might think differently about it."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,Ppleater,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"or get more minorities is positions of power   ...doing that intentionally is the basis of affirmative action. The whole point of it is to get more minorities in power for the ""role model"" effect and to ""redress grievances"". They would undermine meritocracy to correct a perceived inequality of opportunity.  I agree with the rest of your post."

TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,Ppleater,2,Mon Jun 1 16:23:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is not so much ""equality of opportunity"" but the much more awful ""equality of outcome"" that SJWs -really- love.  They seems to confuse both at times. They often confuses that giving women the ability to enroll in STEM fields means it should now constitute of 50% women / 50% men. Which leads to stem hiring managers giving priority to women 2 to 1 so that the long-term outcome is an equal ratio.   It would be akin to a teacher giving an different exam with easier questions to their struggling students so they have equally good test results compared to their smarter peers."
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,Chaoslux,1 point,Sun May 31 21:11:35 2015 UTC,only an EQUAL ratio? sounds misogynistic
TumblrAtRest,37uxbg,ihatenamesfff,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"Their reasoning is that the only possible explanation for it NOT being 50-50 is discrimination/sexism. That's why they're pushing the equality of outcome- because they think that the only explanation for that is inequality of opportunity, which absolutely should be eradicated.   Personally, I think it is a lack of interest that is the predominating factor, with discrimination being a smaller but also statistically significant factor (empirical studies, which I will cite on demand, support this). The lack of interest may come from many sources, including a lack of role models (the ""role models"" argument, however, has been used as justification for affirmative action), discouragement from peers, and stereotype threat leading them to do worse on exams than if they are not reminded of their gender.   But this in no way means that we should ever lower standards for females entering any male-dominated field. There will always be women who make it as long as they are allowed to, and these women will have to serve as role models. They will have to get their fellow females interested in STEM, showing them that it is not just men who can succeed. The girls in school currently will also have to take heed of this message and recognize that STEM jobs are in high demand, and entering those fields if they are interested will pay off for them, and not pay attention to those that would put them down."

This was well put together, and they have two specific writers on the site that do make sense. They, unfortunately, just aren't the loud ones. This wasn't clickbait, this was important information that they needed to hear.   Sometimes you just gotta applaud when your opponents do something good. Hating everything they say just because of 'who' said it just isn't healthy. It's very, very similar to those very same people that we're very much against, actually."

TumblrAtRest,37su2t,shrekter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:30:09 2015 UTC,"No, I fully understand you. Tumblr in Action has a weakness of ad-hominem-ing the CRAP out of everything they say. Sure, 90% of what they speak is just complete idiocy, but that idiocy did initially come from a good place. Their ideals are in the right place, but they overshoot. Never be afraid to take a lesson from them during a moment of clarity.   It's because of this Tumblr stupidity that I learned of 'checking your privilege."" Not in the sense that you use it to attack somebody, but when someone truly lacks the ability to understand, you teach them why they don't understand it. Y'know? There's a grain of truth in their craziness, you just have to keep your own mind grounded to see the things that they cannot.  Don't view it as a war. View it as a wave. It'll come. It'll cause some destruction...but every wave subsides. Some come out from it stronger, some are destroyed, and some that are, rebuild to make something better."
