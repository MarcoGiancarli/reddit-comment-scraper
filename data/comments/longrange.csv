It also depends a bit on what you are hunting and where you are hunting it though.

Then do it 200 times. Do it until that washer or dime never falls off. Then go shoot, and force yourself to pull the trigger the same way. You have to build the muscle memory to do it right.

longrange,3dzlca,boltgunner,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:56 2015 UTC,With Remington you will probably want to get it trued/blueprinted. If you want to build a rifle savage builds are very easy and affordable. You can change calibers by switching barrels pretty easy so if you decide to go with another caliber other than 308 you just need a barrel and maybe bolt head. Head over to /r/savageshooters for more details.
longrange,3dzlca,blasted123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:35 2015 UTC,would a good savage build compare in the end to a blueprinted and trued Remington? I am willing to put up with the added cost and difficulty if it gave better performance in the end.
longrange,3dzlca,lichlord,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"A good Savage and good Remington will shoot just as well as each other. There are two main differences: it's easier/cheaper to build a good Savage, and the Savage will usually have a stiffer bolt lift.  There are gunsmiths that will install a floating bolt head (like the Savage) on your 700, and barrel manufacturers who advertise a ""Rem-nut"" system for easy barrel changes on the 700 too.  I personally don't think a slow build makes much sense on the 700. Don't build and just save your money and then buy full-out what you want (chassis, custom action, barrel), or buy a pawn shop Savage in an acceptable caliber and slowly upgrade it while you shoot and feel things are lacking (probably stock and trigger early on this path)."
longrange,3dzlca,SDKMMC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:44 2015 UTC,"The difference is a Savage is a do-it-yourself whereas a Remington has to be done by a gunsmith. If you're OK with expense, you're better off starting with a nice action like a Surgeon or something along that line. Be warned, things get really expensive really quickly. For me, the Savage is enough until I get better and then I can upgrade the barrel myself, and then change the stock, and then the glass, etc."
longrange,3dzlca,Medic7816,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:58 2015 UTC,"I would say buy off the rack, shoot it while you save money, then modify it as your budget allows.

longrange,3dt7wi,lichlord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:14 2015 UTC,That number is enormous. What do you base it on?  Service rifle shooters often rebarrel their mouse guns before 5k and even they don't really look for better than MOA accuracy.

longrange,3dt7wi,lichlord,2,Sun Jul 19 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"Your linked-to mil spec specifies no more than 20% of bullets tumbling after 7500 rounds and gives numbers for the chrome-lined bore of a Sig 550/551. The initial accuracy standard is 1.5moa which they permit to open up to 3moa after 7.5k rounds.  This is just my opinion, but I don't think the mil-spec of a semi-auto military rilfe is a good measure of accuracy for a bolt gun in a long-range forum. Maybe if we were in /r/ar15 it'd be relevant."
longrange,3dt7wi,helix6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:09:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you are getting down-voted. A mil-spec test with criteria based on key-holes at 5 yards really doesn't have much to do with what we are talking on this sub.  I have an .xls barrel life calculator I downloaded at some point that indicates about 3080 shots before the barrel in a .223 starts to degrade (assuming 26 gr. of H4895). Chrome lined will probably be better, but most guys shooting long-range are probably not running chrome-lined barrels, and I'm sure the X-Bolt in question is not lined.  The numbers coming out of my calculator for .308 are very similar to the .223 numbers, so I would assume that the 5-10K estimates you hear for that cartridge are probably similar for a steel .223 barrel."
longrange,3dt7wi,lichlord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"That sounds right in line with the rule of thumb I've come across.  3000 shots as a base number when cross sectional area of the bullet in mm2 is equal to the number of grains. Thus 0.224 inches in diameter = 25.5mm2, which means 3000 rounds at 25.5gr of powder pushing the pill.  I think the down votes were because I asked /u/bwukki to edit his comment to maintain the quality of this sub but he was unwilling."

Not to mention you guys didn't bother reading the tests or are too stupid to understand it. That keyhole test was after firing 7500 without pause. Don't think OP is going to do that with his bolt action rifle.  Do you really think the military would consider something still usable that keyholed at 5 yards halfway through the minimum required lifespan? You're the rare kind of retard who thinks he knows it all while not understanding any of the bullshit he's spouting.

longrange,3dt7wi,helix6,4,Mon Jul 20 03:14:05 2015 UTC,"Dude, sorry, but you are the one coming off as an ""insufferable asshole."" This is just from reading your back and forth for about 15 seconds.  Obviously you are the one who didn't read the test as it calls for cooling the weapon after every 100 shot string, and cleanings at 1,000 and 7,500 rounds (a far cry from 7,500 rounds ""without pause"" as you claim). The key-hole test is done after 7,500 rounds, at 5 meters with a hot barrel and out of 20 shots no more than 5 can key-hole.  The test then continues to 15,000 rounds with other diminished criteria for accuracy. Obviously anyone here can read it for themselves.  The point /u/lichlord was making (that I agree with) was that you submitted a very vaguely related specification for a completely different type of firearm and presented it as gospel. A Sig 550 is not a Browning X-Bolt and the data you presented wasn't really relevant to long-range shooting out of a non-lined steel barrel. You're citing barrel accuracy numbers that are only required to meet ~3 MOA. I guarantee that OP is not going to be happy with that level of accuracy with his gun - it's shot out at that point.  I'm not sure where you get off saying people should be banned and calling someone a ""dumb motherfucker"" or ""rare kind of retard"" for politely disagreeing with you and pointing out the issues with the information you submit (again, the posts are there for everyone to see). Your attitude, frankly, is much more fitting in /r/guns than this sub and you sound a lot like the kind of person you are describing ""who thinks he knows it all while not understanding any of the bullshit he's spouting.""  Admitting you're too lazy to actually verify the information you submit to another user asking for some help is antithetical to the mindset I'm used to seeing on here. Go check out /u/PrecisionRifleBlog posts to see an example of the kind of quality of information and interaction that I expect from this sub.

Here's a torture test using steelcase vs brass: http://www.luckygunner.com/labs/brass-vs-steel-cased-ammo/#accuracy  It should be noted that the differences in barrel wear between the (copper-jacketed) Federal, and the (Bi-metal jacketed) russian ammo are due to the different metallurgy, not the cases themselves.   Furthermore, re-barreling a browning is frowned upon by browning. Hence why they use loc-tite on their barrels. You can do it, but you have to heat the shit out of it. However plenty of people have ripped the threads out of the receiver trying it. Red Loctite needs to see 550 degrees before it'll come free."
longrange,3dt7wi,lichlord,0,Sun Jul 19 11:19:02 2015 UTC,What type of metal the case is made of shouldn't have an impact on the barrel wear.  But if you're shooting brown bear and wolf you probably don't care much to begin with.

Less if you shoot more than 1 round per minute and less if you have an over bore cartridge. The biggest variable is your standard for accuracy which you didn't specify.

It has everything you could dream of in a wonderful looking package. I myself will be sticking to .308. The likely hood that I would ever get out to past 1k yards is very dismal at best. So a .308 would continue to serve you very well out to your 600 yard range.   As for the scope goes. I have a SWFA 12x on my .22 trainer and it is great for seeing .22 holes out to 100 yards, it also spots hits on dirt at 200. I did a lot of research and went with the 12 over the 16 because some say the 16's glass isnt as clear. If you were to ever try to take it out hunting tho a fixed power would be a problem. I would personally looking into there 5-20. It would give you the best of everything you would be looking for, at a great price."

longrange,3dt9hk,pewpevv,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"I have read a lot about the 6.5 creedmoor. I know its more efficient and shoots flatter. The cost is a tad more than .308, but it is not easy to find here.   If you're not reloading, you have no need for 6.5 CM. Therefore ammo price isn't really a factor."
longrange,3dt9hk,dieselgeek,3,Sun Jul 19 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"The advantage of the creedmoor is for guys that don't reload.   grrat factory match ammo is available for a good price, about $1  Eta: and if he does go creed moor he can save his brass for when he gets the reloading equipment"
longrange,3dt9hk,dieselgeek,0,Sun Jul 19 15:52:27 2015 UTC,"No, the ammo is about the same price, maybe ~.10 cent difference per round. Weighing against any savings is a shorter barrel life.   The ballistic advantage is small but clear, but if you need that advantage you should already be reloading as it would be a larger factor.   I very recently chose between the two for a new rifle, so I'm quite familiar."
longrange,3dt9hk,pewpevv,4,Sun Jul 19 16:02:47 2015 UTC,Small?  It's over 30% better.  Thats HUGE.

longrange,3dt9hk,pewpevv,0,Sun Jul 19 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"No, I'm 100% correct even using your own link. Literally .10 cent cheaper, exactly as I said.

And it's a moot point anyway as if you wanted to switch to it for performance, you should be reloading anyway as there is more gain to be made there first."
longrange,3dt9hk,dieselgeek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:36 2015 UTC,"By the time you shoot out a .308 barrel you would have learned that 6.5 is that much better and moved on.    How many barrels have you burned out?  I normally burn though 1 a year, and I'd say I shoot quiet a bit. Last year I shot about 12 precision matches, and practiced, and did load dev.  On top of that, I rebarrel sooner than most people would.   What you just linked was .308 ( 168s even gross) being MORE expensive than creedmoor.   I'd rather rebarrel sooner and keep hitting things with such an advantage over the .308 than miss more."

I've seen plenty of matches won with factory 140 amax. I shot it for the first couple of years of shooting precision rifle matches.    You can get it for the same price if not sometimes CHEAPER than factory 175gr federal gmm. I could not give one shit about whats on the shelf. I order all of my ammo online as it's cheaper that way.

It does the job out to 300 yards or so. Its clear enough, the reticule is nice but thick at high magnification. Its eye relief does suffer towards the upper magnification spectrum, but its not to bad.   The SWFA was purchased for my .22 trainer. I went with the 12x because a RSO at my range made a valid point. 10-12x isnt that much of a difference, but the 12x will show a .22 hole at 100 yards very well. It is a superior scope in comparison to the PA for build quality, glass, reticule, and feel.   These scopes serve 2 different purposes however. The PA would be great if youll be using the rifle more for hunting. The SWFA would be better for target shooting and long range drills. Thats due to the fact that it has better glass, a more usable reticule, much better turrets with detents that snap into place with a loud, crisp, authoritative feel. The SWFA's are also rated for a .50 and should outlast you if not dropped off of a building several times and shot at."

That $150 scope has increased my love for that rifle 10 fold.   On my Savage Model 10, I have the 4-14 ACSS. The scope itself is great, I am NOT fan of the ACSS though. It works fine, and I gave it a fair shot, Im just not a fan of it. The scope however has been awesome other than that. The controls are precise, it holds zero without issue, and is super clear. I am doubly impressed considering it was one of their cheaper ""blemished"" models (the blemish was that you can see a tad bit of glow around the edges when you turn the illumination on high, I never use illumination, so it was fine to me. Other than that, it is flawless, and works perfect).   That being said, I am currently selling my Savage and 4-14 scope to fund the Ruger Precision rifle that just came out. I will be trying the SWFA scope on it. If I end up not liking it, I know I can sell it and I would then go with the PA.

I give it 3-6 months before we start to see custom barrels as one offs, then if it becomes popular a year and we will see someone like criterion start to offer barrels.   Yeah you can't change it out as quickly as an AR with the extension, but I'm OK with that on a precision rifle. But with this you don't have to worry about timing the barrel with a gas port, so threaded should work fine.   But... Looking at the 556 takedown they also announced, it wouldn't surprise me if that takedown mech either came from this project or they are intending to offer a takedown version of this using the same extension if they can get the same accuracy.

One is not better than the other. I don't care who you talk to, they are exactly the same thing (unit of angled measurement). If you're in the USA and think in yards MOA will come easier. True MOA is just tad larger than 1"" at 100 yards. You will find scopes that are MOA or based on ""shooter MOA/IPHY/inch per hundred yards/1 click = 1/4"" "" they are not the same adjustments but are very close. It's just when you get into long range shots you'll have to take in to account for the differences.   If you live anywhere else and use the metric system, MRADs will come more naturally to you. It is like you said but 1000 not 10 - 1cm at 100 meters is 1 mil, 1 yard at 1000 yards is 1 mil. AFAIK, most PRS shooters are using mils but not all. It's a personal preference and ease when everyone is talking the same language when spotting shots."

I was planning on an MOA/MOA scope and may stay with that plan since I think distance in yards. Probably be easier for me. But who knows, maybe when I get much better and  regularly shooting at 800+ I'll decide I want to give mils a go.    you might as well beat your head against a wall at least then you'll have a good excuse for the headache that will come.

Both will get you the best return on your money in terms of quality and accuracy. Remington 700's have fallen out of favor since Freedom Group took over and quality control is null. As for scopes, the Primary Arms 4-14x44 is generally regarded as the lowest cost acceptable option. After that, Vortex is highly regarded for their quality and outstanding warranty and customer service.   The next question is caliber. If you are just going to be punching paper, look at a 6.5mm round. These offer an excellent mix of high bc, high velocity, low recoil and lower cost. .260 Remington and 6.5 Creedmoore are both good choices. If you are going to be hunting at longer ranges, you might want to look at a magnum caliber to put more energy on target. 7mm Remington Mag is a very flat shooting cartridge and good for longer range hunting, but suffers from a lack of factory match grade options if you don't reload. Another option in that class is the .300 Win Mag. Plenty of power for long range hunting, and more match grade factory ammo available. Your going to pay for it though, in both recoil and cost of ammunition."

I apologize for the phone pics, and I'm a n00b at ontarget so it's a bit messy.  This was my last group of the day.  Five rounds of 7mm-08 140gr PPU PSP-BT fired from my Marlin XS7 SS, using a Nikon Prostaff 1-9x40 and an old backpack as a rest in prone.  Range is 130yards, which I am well aware is NOT long range, but I will start to stretch it's legs now that I have the rifle behaving as I expected it too.  It is not free floated so body position seems to matter quite a bit.  I would say it is a solid MOA rifle (at least too 130yard so far) if you can take your time.  Not bad for a setup that cost me ~$400 total!   These were rounds 115-120 through the rifle, and my groups had been tightening all day.  As these were the last bit of ammo I had on me, I really took my time, focused on my breathing and body position (and not flinching) and let one fly about once every 2-3min.  I was very excited when I looked through the spotting scope, and see this group. My first hole-in-hole ever, and the first time I'd been really mad at a ""flyer"" in a long time haha.

They are not great for customization (although a few stocks do fit) and you are better off just spending the money elsewhere if you plan to get a supper LR setup.   However it is about the nicest $250 rifle I've ever seen hands down, and I cannot argue with <MOA at that price!  Beats out the Savage AXIS II's and Ruger American Rifles I've felt (which are also both pricier).   If I had a bit more cash when I'd bought it, I might have gone with the HOWA 1500 or it's twin the Weatherby, but those were both at least twice the cost."

Edit: Misread that is wasnt the swivel version. Did you try putting it on another gun to see if maybe the stock stud was off and not the bipod? Just something to check.

longrange,3cxzjt,tfunkyfresh85,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:15:24 2015 UTC,You could carbon wrap the .243 barrel. Or go with the rem-age build. 6.5s are really hot right now or an easy 7 wouldn't be bad.

longrange,3cvnwq,jimmy_jam_,8,Sat Jul 11 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"The short answer is ballistics. You're shooting a lighter round at higher velocities. Less recoil. Flatter shooting round. Better ability to ""buck"" the wind. Shoots further. Higher BC for most common available rounds (.585 for the 140 AMAX, .505 for the 175 SMK), even higher when you're looking at the scenar/VLDs.   With all that said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the 308. I probably send 5x as many 168 or 175 SMKs downrange as I do my 6.5 Creedmoor. The best part about the 6.5 is that it's just a simple rebarrel on a 308 platform, but the tradeoff is barrel life. If you're shooting just fine with a 308, there's no real reason to switch, unless you are shooting at ranges greater than 1k but not in the ELR/1 mile range."
longrange,3cvnwq,MoreThanBadKarma,3,Sat Jul 11 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"The best part about the 6.5 is that it's just a simple rebarrel on a 308 platform   Had no idea they used the same bolt face until you said that and I looked into it, good to know!"
longrange,3cvnwq,jayemo,3,Sat Jul 11 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to jump on the 6.5 mm train but are worried about ammo availability, you can also shoot the .260 Remington.  It's just a necked down .308 Winchester, so there will always been brass available.  That being said, I don't think ammo availability will be an issue for 6.5 Creedmoor in the foreseeable future.    The 6.5 Creedmoor is a little shorter, fatter case, so you can use a little longer bullet and still get the same amount of powder behind it vs the .260 Remington, but otherwise they are very similar in performance."
longrange,3cvnwq,Ivan_Whackinov,3,Sat Jul 11 05:20:59 2015 UTC,"6.5 creedmoor has the ballistics like everyone else has says but what sets its apart from other 6-7mm bullets is the ammo if you don't reload. The ammo is reasonably priced, moa capable or better, and available. If you reload, I would look into some other cartridges maybe, although 6.5 creedmoor is great. It really depends on your range and use  308 is good too. Long shots are harder, ammo will always be there, and teaches wind reading better."
longrange,3cvnwq,jalepeno,3,Sat Jul 11 05:41:07 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the purpose of the rifle. If you're hunting and want to grab ammo off the shelf, .308 is the better choice. The average hunter isn't going to be taking out a deer over 500yd/m.   When you're target shooting over 1000yd/m, the 6.5 shines. Less affected by the wind with less bullet drop. As always, pick the platform/caliber that best suits what you're intending to do.  I'm just now starting to reload. I'm waiting on powder and primers to come in. I ended up buying the Berger 168 Hybrids Targets. I'm interested in seeing how they perform once I get my ladder test done and I can get to the 1000yd range. If they perform well, I'll save money buying these rather than buying a new 6.5 platform."
longrange,3cvnwq,uponone,6,Sat Jul 11 17:25:24 2015 UTC,"6.5 Creedmor has the advantage of high ballistic coefficient and high speed, all in one round.  The short length of the 6.5 lets you easily chamber it in ARs and short action rifles."

longrange,3cvnwq,Thats_my_cornbread,6,Sat Jul 11 09:21:25 2015 UTC,And a 308 fits in the same (-10 but not a -15) so this really isn't a valid point. A 260 won't fit anywhere a 308 won't to the best of my knowledge.
longrange,3cvnwq,Thats_my_cornbread,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:23:28 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about future availability, go .260 instead. As long as .308 brass and 6.5mm projectiles are available, you can make .260.  Also, even if you make a choice which starts going extinct, big deal, get a new barrel—a relatively small replacement cost in the grand scheme of long-range precision."
longrange,3cvnwq,cosmicosmo4,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:29:39 2015 UTC,any of the 6.5/.270 cartridges will tend to have available higher BC bullets. so they tend to be flatter shooting more accurate rounds.
