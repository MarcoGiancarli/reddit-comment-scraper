NASLSoccer,3e6zxb,gusjohnsonforever,4,Wed Jul 22 13:08:05 2015 UTC,"There are about 60-80 markets in the US and Canada for D2 or D1 teams (population over 450,000) - some of those markets could have 2-5 teams (example New York, Chicago, LA).  About an additional 40-60 markets for D3 teams, 200,000 population areas.  There is still a lot of room for growth in that sense.  But this issue is finding owners.  Required net worth to be a D3 owner is only 10 million, a D2 owner must have net worth of 20 million, and D1 owner must have net worth of 40 million.  Those are minimums, set by the USSF.  The leagues themselves have other requirments.  Realistically a D2 owner should have net worth of $100 million and a D1 a net worth of $500 million.  So there are only estimated to be 5000 families with net worth over $100 million.  If 30% decide to be a sports team owner that limits total pool of owners to 150.  Then they would have to decide to be soccer team owners.  So my point is the growth is pretty unlimited, but finding owners to make that growth happen is the hard part."
NASLSoccer,3e6zxb,CampaignExpert,4,Wed Jul 22 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"You have to give it time.  Understanding that NASL is only in it's 5th year and the improvements that have already been made on the field along with the level of new ownership groups......things are trending up.    The reason you can't ask this to MLS guys is because most of them are League 1st Fans.  They've completely taken the bait that Don Garbers way is the only way and anybody that questions it or publicly shows support for another way is instantly ""Tinfoil Ted"".    Nothing will happen over night, so just sit back and enjoy the steady growth."
NASLSoccer,3e6zxb,FutbolFeller,2,Wed Jul 22 13:44:08 2015 UTC,"Another factor to consider, at least as far as expansion in Canada goes, is the Canadian dollar being worth something like 75 cents American right now. If players are payed in US dollars this hurts Canadian teams who earn revenue in Canadian dollars especially when talking about thousands of dollars. There are strategies around this of course but, it would be something that owners in Canada have to take into consideration. All this to say, that expansion into Hamilton and other Canadian cities could take a while longer, just my speculation though.  Edit: spelling and grammar"
NASLSoccer,3e2sf5,yahhhsteve,14,Tue Jul 21 14:54:04 2015 UTC,For a league that is shutting down...it certainly has a lot of TV Deals happening.  Am I right?  (Obviously I'm not being serious...just a little jab at the gloom and doomers)
NASLSoccer,3e2sf5,FutbolFeller,9,Tue Jul 21 15:42:00 2015 UTC,This is such a huge deal. No amount of grassroots or other marketing can add as much legitimacy to a team as getting games on TV can.    Really nice to get the jump on Miami FC(s) too.

Canada really needs to stop depending on the united States for player development. I'm sorry but I feel like maybe the Canadians feel like they can't do it themselves and I feel like they sure can! Even if they start off small, their pride and country for a domestic league would do far more positivity than negativity. Each country is proud of having their own league and their own way of developing their own players. The USA really needs to stop using northern markets for their profit. Ive always hoped that Toronto FC, Montreal impact, VC whitecaps, as well as Edmonton and Fury. They would boist the Canadian league so much! But I know that's just a pipe dream."

It was a 'new' record for Minnesota.  One note, the game was the first 'official' day of the USA CUP, The event showcases more than 1,070 teams and 15,000 soccer players from over 18 states and 17 countries, and that tournament is held at the same complex as Minnesota United's home.

By looking at this crowd that attended the match between Newcastle United and Club Atlas at Miller Park, it shows that Milwaukee is ready for pro-soccer. On another note, the Milwaukee Barons did organized a march during this game that attracted significant amount of supporters. The purpose of this march was to prove to investors that Wisconsin can support a high-level professional outdoor soccer team. Furthermore, I got a real gut feeling that this team will end up playing in the NASL. Why? Because James Moran of the Milwaukee Barons has been speaking with Peter Wilt, president and GM of Indy Eleven, on major business issues on pro-soccer. Milwaukee will build an amazing derby rivalry together with the Chicago Sting and Indy Eleven."

A world class keeper would have been on his toes and may have saved it, but often headers freeze keepers because you don't have the players body position to go off in terms of knowing where the ball is likely to go."

NASLSoccer,3dwd0v,DrewOJensen,3,Mon Jul 20 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"On the first goal he was slightly out of position and moving backwards into his net to correct. When the header was struck he was flatfooted. He stood no chance on the second. On the third his defenders were beat on the through ball and he needed to step out, cut down the angle, and get set. Instead he was backing up and when the shot was hit (tickled? gently caressed into the corner?) both his feet were off the ground. On the fourth, he was cheating to the far post behind his wall. Trust your wall.   He's somewhat responsible for 3/4."

After scoring twice in two games and being named to the team-of-the-week? I mean, that seems soft as hell, moving him back there to make room for Richards (who, for the record, was invisible).

NASLSoccer,3dudsk,Steasy66,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:16:21 2015 UTC,"Deserving a team is a meaningless concept.  All that matters to the league is if there is an ownership group with enough money and a suitable venue, the second one is flexible."
NASLSoccer,3dudsk,Warningsharp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:02:18 2015 UTC,"If all that matters to the league then lets take some teams to silicon valley, to hollywood, to all the areas where cities are financially amazing and carry rich owners but for gods sake let's not even give two dumps about the fans and the population within the city which is able to support a professional team. Whatever happened to fans owning the clubs?"
NASLSoccer,3dudsk,Steasy66,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:52:59 2015 UTC,"Fans owning teams was made impossible by the USSF Division 2 standards put in place after the 2010 season.  I'm not telling you how it should be, just how it is.  People ask 'why does the NASL keep putting teams in Florida?'.  The NASL isn't putting teams anywhere, they are awarding a franchise to any willing ownership group with enough money."
NASLSoccer,3dudsk,Warningsharp,0,Mon Jul 20 13:31:23 2015 UTC,Yea I understand. Just stating the facts. Well then let me just say that the USSF needs to get rebuilt!
NASLSoccer,3dudsk,Steasy66,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:16 2015 UTC,The regulations are restrictive but to some extent necessary.  We have only seen one Div 2 team fold since they were put in place (Puerto Rico) as opposed to 4 in the 2010 season.  Without the high bar of entry you got debacles like AC St Louis who employed Nikolas Anelka's brother as coach because he paid them to do so and started selling off their roster mid season as they began folding halfway through their first season.

The cities you mentioned would be great for NASL or USL teams, but fans need to show their support and an owner needs to put up the cash. This may start from NPSL or PDL teams growing a fan base that gets the attention of investors, but you cant just magically give a team to a city without fan support and financial backing. You mention the ""fan's"" in the cities, but where are they coming from? Who says people in Reno or San Diego are pushing for a soccer team?"
NASLSoccer,3dudsk,Warningsharp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"I do agree there has to be a median of fans support and financial backing. U am actually from San Diego and have been pushing for a soccer team to be brought to SD. City meetings and interviews, communities coming together all has been attemtped.

No, you squad is unprofessional and selfdestructive and if they get ahead they will play fine, but if they get behind, the quickly devolve into a U12 side that just bickers and complains and pushes and shoves each other and in their case the referees as well.  There were at least 3 players that could have been sent off for confronting the referee."
NASLSoccer,3dszka,theasfldotcom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"It's completely appropriate that the highlights pick up in the second half, the first half probably shouldn't have existed...    I personally think the call on the disallowed goal that would have won it was weak based on what I saw live (from behind the goal we were attacking) and this replay, neither of which was the best angle possible. Angulo certainly had his hands on the defender, but in the typical manner that wouldn't elicit a push. That being said, I don't deny my bias, though I would certainly admit if the Strikers were gifted something or fucked up in some fashion. Did a neutral see the call on the game feed?"
NASLSoccer,3dszka,HailAnts,2,Sun Jul 19 04:07:56 2015 UTC,"Agree, really soft call on the disallowed goal. Guy barely even stumbled, Angulo was just keeping his balance, if anything to not go up recklessly for it. Really disappointing.    Great work by Walter to earn the PK though and save a point."
NASLSoccer,3dszka,alxhooter,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"Neutral here. In live action, it looked like it might be a foul the way the Atlanta defender went flying, but it was hard to tell because of the mid-cross change in camera angles (note to NASL producers: Don't do that.) Then they showed a replay, then another, and it was pretty obvious it was a bad call.  Welp. At least defenders get the call on game-changing dives sometimes, too."

Here's a thought: American Football games have inflated scores that are meaningless.  Let's get rid of all this 6 points stuff and just make a touchdown two points.  A field goal can be one.  While we're at it, extra points are boring and dumb.  Make everyone try to run it in for their extra point.  And no more punting.  Punts are boring.  Make em go for it every time.

NASLSoccer,3dnov4,NC_boi,6,Fri Jul 17 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"I had done an internship with the Scorpions last year and had no complaints. Granted, I was working in the communications area and always had some task set by my supervisor, whether it was writing an article, doing research, or just trying to find articles to post on social media that the fans might be interested in. There was one time where my supervisors had nothing for me to do except pump up some soccer balls, so I did that with the full knowledge that being an intern sometimes means doing the simple, boring things. I think the main issue with your experience is that, as you said, you don't have a supervisor, so there's no real direction for you. Be patient and always ready to help with whatever you can. If you prove that you're willing to do the simple things, perhaps they'll start giving you new, more advanced tasks that will give you a more complete experience. If you have nothing to do, then FIND something to do; being proactive is always a positive when interning."

The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern.  The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff.  The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.  The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship."

Let me put it to you this way - internships really have nothing to do with the work you're putting in, but rather the people you are meeting.  All of these people, if they're staying in the industry, will be your contacts when they move up.  You may follow some of them.  Some of them may follow you.  The point is to network as much as possible.  Stay active on social media.  Get to know people from both the league and opposing teams.  They will be the harbingers of opportunity for you in the future.  Yeah, it sucks right now, because you're basically bitch boy at this point.  That's kinda the deal though.  They're using you.  So take advantage of what they can offer you - exposure and networking.  If you don't have business cards - spend $40 and get your own made.  Then, get a business card portfolio - and collect them from the people you meet in the industry.  Media people especially.  Stay in contact with them.  Start a blog / twitter profile focused on the team / the league / the sport.  BE ACTIVE.  This is the only way you will succeed - unless your goal is to be the coffee guy for the rest of your life.  Think of this as an opportunity, not a chore.  You have the inside track on a shitload of contacts - stuff that most people never will be able to see.  Take advantage of it, bro."
NASLSoccer,3dnov4,tjgulen,3,Fri Jul 17 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"Intern turned into full-time employee here. The key to getting the experience that you want is to ask for it and work hard. You wanna learn about ticket sales? Ask the sales manager about what they do and see if you can give it a shot. Want to work on the team ops side? Talk to the Operations manager or the kit person if you want to get in on the day to day team stuff. Most people are willing to at least give you an informational interview so you can learn about the position and get your foot in the door with the team. Also, always be looking for an opportunity to help the team get better and make yourself a valuable. Making yourself valuable to the team is a great way to turn an internship into a full time gig.

(So yes, internships can help you find work in the sports industry. My summer internship for the Kansas City Wizards in 2008 played a huge role in getting a job in Minnesota in 2010.)  Understand that teams in this league (and really minor league sports teams in general) are understaffed, and this will be particularly true for the league-owned, shoestring-budget RailHawks. You're seeing the downside of this on gamedays, where everyone's focused on getting what needs done done, where the workload is pretty rhythmic, and where the to-do list is a mile long. Unfortunately for you, helping you gain professional experience and skills is not on that list; getting Gatorade to the benches and T-shirts to the merch tent are.   My advice to you would be to seek out at least a day or two each week in the front office and find a staff member or two whose workload mirrors what you're hoping to get out of the internship, sit down with them for a few minutes to identify tasks that you can do, and take responsibility for them. Ideally, these things will be repeated tasks that you already have the skills to do but which you can help the team improve on by giving them more attention than they normally get."

NASLSoccer,3djul1,carrasp,12,Thu Jul 16 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"I don't personally ascribe to the doomsday scenarios that are always thrown out there in regards to the NASL.  There are several owners in this league that are worth BILLIONS of dollars.  In fact, aside from the #2 teams from MLS, the entire net worth of USL owners wouldn't even equal one of our owners.  Facing that, our league, even with only 11 teams (soon to be 13) is well more financed than all of USL, and a lot more stable.  So we're regional.  We're also in year 5 of existence, and doing pretty damn well.  USL has lost just as many teams as they've added, and a majority of them are propped by MLS owners.  They're far from stable, and far from profitable if at all.  They have their outliers like Sacramento, but they're in no way a threat to overtake NASL - that's just paranoia speaking.  The NASL will continue to grow, and while they won't be threatening MLS, they'll eventually get to the point where we will compete for their fans, their viewers, and their sponsors.  That's a good thing.  We're not there yet, but it's far from the doom and gloom outlook of writers who need clickbait to sell stories."
NASLSoccer,3djul1,EquinsuOcha,5,Fri Jul 17 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's also a key point in the ""NASL will be forced to D3 because it's not got a Pacific timeline team"" debate. The USSF are never going to drop the league down on that stipulation when they're growing, expansion is happening, deals are being signed with sponsors and broadcasters.  In its existence as a standalone league (following the D2 Pro League) NASL has just lost the PR Islanders which has been replaced and Montreal which moved up a division.  The doom and gloom scenario just doesn't take in logic."

NASLSoccer,3djul1,MrEddy2015,6,Fri Jul 17 22:29:43 2015 UTC,The MLSs approach to have a minor league like baseball and have no pro/rel for the future will really affavt the USL. If the NASL can get teams out in the west they'll stay in the no2 spot and keep the heat on the MLS. If MLS stops at 30 teams it will tell all the independent teams in the USL that it has no chance of going to MLS. The NASL should then take the opportunity to take USL teams into its wing to try and force pro/rel into the MLS. Best approach in I can think of. The teams that are taken by NASL from the USL should leave behind a reserve team in the USL. This would keep USL as reserve league and NASL still pressuring the MLS.
NASLSoccer,3djul1,Warningsharp,2,Thu Jul 16 22:00:25 2015 UTC,Pro/Reg is a long time away but if MLS doesn't take Sacramento soon they will jump to NASL then that will lead to more independent USL teams that will want to jump to NASL.   As far a west coast and Mid West expansion the right teams will come eventually. Like I said above if MLS doesn't bring up Sacramento they will eventually jump to NASL.
NASLSoccer,3djul1,Free255,2,Fri Jul 17 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"Well I do agree pro/rel is a long way ahead. But promising and being open to the possibility for the future if and if only MLS would want to, they will attract teams away from USL to NASL. The MLS and USL partnership is basically putting the independent clubs at a stagnant state in the USL. Letting them know that if they don't reach 100+ million value status to buy themselves into the MLS then they will not make it in time into the MLS before it hits 30 teams. NASL taking over the rest of the leagues and leaving MLS alone will really put pressure on the MLS. USL has potential to be the reserve league."
NASLSoccer,3djul1,Warningsharp,2,Fri Jul 17 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely curious if anyone has any info on whether or not Sacramento has been approached about joining NASL. They would be a huge addition, they would immediately be competitive, and you already have a large fan base behind the team. It seems like a dream scenario for NASL, but who know if Sacramento is feeling the same way, or if they are to content to stay in USL if the MLS bid doesn't happen."
NASLSoccer,3djul1,BJ_Fantasy_Podcast,2,Fri Jul 17 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"I would think they have had a small discussion about their future plans if its in MLS, NASL or USL. The organization is getting too big to be in the third division IMO."

NASLSoccer,3djul1,WorldAbandoned,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"Pro/Rel is a pipe dream. No owner is going to invest hundreds of millions into a team only to have it kicked out. It would also be disastrous for MLS' TV deal negotiations if it was possible that LA and NY could be left without teams and Rochester and Charleston are the replacement markets.  The closest thing we can get is a minor league system, which I often describe as a pro/rel system for players, not whole teams. IMO, it's a much more efficient way of player development and allowing the best players to rise to the top and the struggling players to sink to somewhere where they're most comfortable."
NASLSoccer,3djul1,SCarolinaSoccerNut,5,Thu Jul 16 23:06:38 2015 UTC,Unless the lower league was in some way reasonably close to the quality and popularity of the upper league or when teams have been around long enough to get loyal supporters who wont stray even during relegation.
NASLSoccer,3djul1,spqr-king,3,Fri Jul 17 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that pro/rel is a pipe dream in the US, but I don't agree with your conclusions as far as the minor league system.  A minor league system is important, yes, but the best thing for player development is always going to be competition.  Yes, having a robust minor league system like MLB and the NHL is necessary for the future of MLS, as it will create competition vertically within each club's structure, but that doesn't necessarily mean that what we need is simply more vertical integration into a monopolistic system (like MLB and NHL have, and like MLS seems to envision with MLS II teams) if we want to increase the level of play in the US as a whole.  What would be better is to have a strong, vertically integrated MLS structure and a strong, stable, though secondary structure something like NASL -- which will be able to develop their own players in markets MLS can't have access to, which will be able to bring in different sorts of foreign talent (by virtue of the level of play and of the league's contract structure), and which will be able to help identify those players who fall through the MLS cracks (e.g. Christian Ramirez, Miguel Ibarra, Fafà Picault, etc).  Fans of MLS need to realize that the league holding a monopoly on the sport in the US is not what's best for the development of the game."
NASLSoccer,3djul1,bullsear,2,Fri Jul 17 08:49:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, the American style affiliated Minor League System is good for player development (which should be a priority for MLS and U.S. Soccer in general), but I don't think it's good for the business of soccer in America.  I know MLS wanted reserves to see the field against quality sides which spawned this generation of the USL, but it's the independent teams in Louisville, Sacramento, OKC, etc. that are performing well as businesses.  Plus it will be interesting to see if more teams chop off their affiliation (as Orlando City just did with Louisville) to field their own sides in USL, which will leave what?  A 40 team league?  I'm going to guess something is going to change and converge at some point..."

Anyway, he mentions that he was involved with Rowdies early on in 2010, when they first came into the league as FC Tampa Bay.  So the team traveled down to Miami FC to play (what would later become the Strikers in Ft. Lauderdale).  Rodney was asked to come and observe as a consultant, and see what would recommend as far as technique and player movement was concerned.  But the team only brought 12 players.  One of them was already nicked up, and the other was  a reserve goalie.  Halfway through the match, one of the midfielders goes down with an injury, and he won't be continuing the match.  That leaves them without another player.  So the goalkeeper coach comes in as the 11th player, and ends up working on the wing.  The terrible part of the story is, FC Tampa Bay ends up drawing because neither team was good enough to put one home.  After that, Rodney walked because this was nowhere near the level of professional soccer.  That was just 5 years ago.  Now, the Rowdies have their name, have a multimillion dollar stadium with a beautiful pitch, full facilities, and are averaging well over 6000 people a match.  That's just one team.  The entire league has evolved in such a way that the level of professionalism is increased dramatically.  Granted, there are still the outliers like the Strikers front office, or the Railhawks internships, but for the most part, it's now taken off in a VERY short period of time.  MLS five years ago is pretty much where it is now, with some minor improvements to exposure and broadcasting.  The evolution of the NASL is staggering in comparison."

NASLSoccer,3djul1,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:18:45 2015 UTC,Rivalries are not aobut championships being at stake but rather bragging rights between two groups of fans that interact very frequently.

By definition that is fully professional. Many of those salaries are low, similar to the NASL paying majority of its players less than $40K, but they're still paid."
NASLSoccer,3djul1,SCarolinaSoccerNut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"""7-0 buddy""  Great.  Remember last years 4th round results (NASL vs. MLS)? You also probably know that in the US Open Cup, the MLS has only beaten an NASL a handful of times more than an NASL team has beaten their MLS opponents, right?  That means nothing more than on any given night...anybody can win a one off.   No need to bother....put your best USL players on one team and come up to New York and play the Cosmos NPSL team.  Lets see how it goes and I'll even give you a 7 game series. :)"
NASLSoccer,3djul1,FutbolFeller,0,Fri Jul 17 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"The NASL is the only league to have losing records to both of the other professional leagues. This might be hard for you as a Cosmos fan to believe, but there are actually NASL teams other than the New York Cosmos out there, teams that aren't as well financed and in smaller markets, teams that are only just getting by and don't have the luxury of having $60-100K salaried players. The majority of NASL teams are more similar to the USL in financial strength and player quality than MLS.  Also MLS makes no secret of the fact that they don't take the USOC seriously. They only really try to win the tourney if their B team manages to get them into the later rounds and thus they have a shot at a CCL spot. Therefore MLS losses in the USOC, particularly the early rounds, have to be taken with a grain of salt. The NASL, on the other hand, brags about how seriously they take the tournament. So when they lose, they have to take all the heat that comes with that loss, especially if its against supposedly lower division opponents."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,SCarolinaSoccerNut,9,Fri Jul 17 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"Fun Fact:  Under the terms of this contract, Freddy Adu, our most recent signee - despite having NINE YEARS MLS experience - is not eligible to be a free agent, because he is not yet 28 years old.  If he chose to return to MLS - he would either go into the re-entry draft, or would have to return to the Philadelphia Union.  He would be unable to negotiate his own salary, despite having made over $200k at his last MLS stint, and would only be eligible for a 15% increase in his pay.  Despite being a naturalized American citizen, he would most like require a Designated Player slot, in order to justify his salary, should he return to MLS.  So the question is... how does this affect the NASL?  On the surface, it doesn't.  NASL teams (for the most part) do not have the financial strength to compete with a DP slot, let alone with European salaries.  However it does benefit homegrown players looking to play at a higher level of competition (and compensation) than USL, and with more roster stability than MLS.  So as much as this sounds like a good deal for MLS players, it is, but it's still terrible - because once a player is offered a contract, no matter how ridiculous, by an MLS team, they essentially ""own the rights"" to all their future playing time.  It means that superstars in the NASL are less likely to leave for MLS if they've been there before, or if they're going there for the first time.  As in the case of Miguel Ibarra, the better pay and first division status of playing in La Liga or Liga MX is a LOT more alluring.  Basically, this is MLS being who they are, and not quite ""getting it"" - which is fine.  It doesn't hurt NASL, but it only helps them tangentially.  It does, however, hurt soccer development in the US greatly, because it puts all the power of determination in the hands of MLS owners, and that's simply not acceptable."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"What players care more about than freedom is compensation. This is basic human psychology: we prefer security over freedom. Players are fine with lack of control over movement so long as they get paid. Many MLS players during negotiations said they preferred not getting free agency if it meant a real increase in the cap. Freedom of movement only really helps the star non-DP players, not the average joe in MLS. The NASL can throw around ""freedom of movement"" all it wants, but if the money's not there then 95/100 players will walk away from that for the bigger bucks in MLS.  The new CBA does increase minimum salary for MLS players quite significantly, and that's where I think the CBA might be a bit of a wrench for the NASL. Before there were significant numbers of MLS players making less than $40K that the NASL could poach as that's a typical NASL salary. The new minimum prices out all but the wealthiest of NASL clubs from making those kind of signings.  As far as Adu, he would only go back to Philly if they retained right of first refusal. If they didn't, he would go through the allocation order as a returning former MLS player. Also his salary would almost certainly not be a DP one. He's coming in from the Finnish 4th division. If his name wasn't Freddy Adu no one would be paying any attention to his signing with TB, his salary at which is actually well below the new MLS minimum."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  It's still criminal that the salary floor for 1st division is $60k, regardless of whether it's an increase above $40k - it only took 5 years to get that $20k increase.  If you don't think that in 5 years NASL will be able to bridge that gap to be competitive, you're crazy.  But I do agree that money is important, and probably the primary motivating factor.  Which is why NASL would be wise to invest in developing talent, not looking to poach the lower echelons of MLS players.  Let MLS do what it does, and have the players it is.  But NASL shouldn't be shopping in their (MLS) garbage looking for treasure.  What I meant by a DP, is that Freddy would have to be a DP to get the kind of salary he had ($500k) previously - because the salary cap only went up to $3.4m."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,BJ_Fantasy_Podcast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. I hate to say it, but I think this new deal really hurts NASL. If the leaks about Adu's contract being ~$40k for this year are true, and you yourself even mentioned most players have similar contracts, then NASL slowly is going to fall behind even more. The MLS cap is going to go up closer to $4.5 mil in five years, just in time for a new cba, and they've now added a fourth DP to that, meaning the salary cap isn't the final line teams are up against, and these big spenders like Toronto, LA, and Seattle are probably close to having a yearly roster salary of closer to $10-$20 mil (even though a huge chunk of that is only spent on those four players). Say what you will about single entity, but the Cosmos seem to be the only team pushing the $3.4 mil salary cap, and with the DP setup they would probably be average spenders compared to other MLS teams. Until these NASL team really open up and and start outspending MLS on talent, then they can't expect to win talent over from over leagues. Just look at this window so far, Pirlo, Lampard, Dos Santos, and Gerrard have all come to play in MLS, and the only big moves NASL has made were bringing back Freddy Adu from the Finnish fourth division, Indy being loaned an old Red Bulls legend, and Minnesota receiving a young brazilian on loan.  I want NASL to push MLS for all that's it's worth, making them drop the single entity model and all the weird rules to become like other leagues around the world, and enabling the pyramid to start working together for some potential pro/rel setups, but until NASL starts outspending MLS on players and forcing the issue, the better question is what do the current USL rules and signings mean for NASL."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,EquinsuOcha,2,Fri Jul 17 06:46:29 2015 UTC,"That's true.  If it's an arms race, MLS has a 15 year head start, and a lot deeper pockets.  With that being said, NASL is being somewhat cognizant of the mistakes that MLS has made, and they're able to avoid them.  Being first isn't always the best.  The biggest issue, for me at least, is that the NASL doesn't have owners who know soccer very well.  Some of them have good people in place, but the well heeled bankrollers, are looking at the league from a business perspective, not from a historical or even real world perspective in regards to other leagues.  So they will make smart business moves, but not necessarily smart soccer moves, if that makes sense."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,FutbolFeller,2,Fri Jul 17 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"That's because the culture of sports ownership is different in the US than in the rest of the world. In the rest of the world, owning a sports team is like owning a Lamborghini. It's a status symbol, a trophy to show off your wealth. In America owners tend to see sports teams as no different from owning a restaurant chain, department store, or car manufacturer: it's a business and the purpose of the business is to make a profit.  I honestly believe the American attitude is the healthier one. The other attitude leads to owners way over spending on their teams roster, using their own personal dollars to bankroll a team that can't afford all these new contracts then selling them and leaving the team with all obligations. See Rangers, Portsmouth, and Leeds United to get a preview of what happens if that team can't find a new sugar daddy."
NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,FutbolFeller,2,Fri Jul 17 13:09:59 2015 UTC,"""See Rangers, Portsmouth and Leeds"" - Right, but those teams still exist and play games unlike Tampa Bay Mutiny, Chivas USA and Miami Fusion (amongst others).

That team was dissolved and the logo and colors were bought by another group of investors who started a new club with the same logo, name, and colors. Portsmouth and Leeds basically had to sell everything they had to stay alive and now languish in the lower divisions, almost assured to never be seen in the Premier League again. Also Chivas USA still exists, it's just been put on hiatus and sold to new owners to relaunch in 2018.  I would say the system utilized by the NFL, NBA, and NHL are far more stable and profitable than the European system, where many teams struggle to even pay their players and the EPL went 16 years without turning a profit."

NASLSoccer,3dkf6o,moxthebox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:29:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that the NASL simply does not make a lot of money. MLS has multimillion dollar national and international TV deals, huge sponsorship packages, much higher attendance, much larger fanbases, and is overall much closer to being a legitimate major league in the US than the NASL. That kind of money and prestige allows the league to make big signings. Like you said yourself, the only team in the NASL that seems to be willing to make those kind of moves is the Cosmos. The biggest reason for that seems to be that they're the only ones who can afford it, and even then I wonder if they can keep it up long term considering that their attendance leaves a lot to be desired.  To me it seems like Tampa Bay and the Cosmos are the only teams that seem serious about wanting the NASL to match MLS. The other teams are either content with being a permanent D2 team or are looking to join MLS. That's the biggest obstacle to the Cosmos and Rowdies goal of taking on MLS.  Pro/rel will never happen in the United States, and the single-entity system is going to stay. MLS is not the only league using that system. The NFL is a de facto single entity system with limited salaries, restricted free agency, and complete* revenue sharing. There's no reason to think that the system is in anyway holding back MLS.  *the one exception to this is that the Dallas Cowboys have a special agreement allowing them to keep their merchandise revenue while not getting a share of anyone elses. All other revenue is shared equally among all 32 teams."

Clark double backed and burned bridges with NASL by, among other things, hurting the sanctioning effort for 2010. Kartik's right: the Rhinos probably don't want NASL, and NASL probably doesn't want the Rhinos."

NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,SCarolinaSoccerNut,2,Fri Jul 17 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"This really is a sad article. Unfortunately starting up an MLS team requires a large amount of capital, capital that the owners just didn't have. The stadium is in a rundown location and the team just doesn't have the same appeal that it once did.  Part of the appeal was the MLS potential during the early 2000's when the team owners were thinking about moving up and the Kansas City Wizards were mulling a potential move to the city. Now that that's gone the attendance for the team is dropping down to normal levels for a sub-MLS team but it looks really bad in a stadium that is now far too big.  I should also note that the odds of a USL to NASL move is almost zero. USL owners consider the MLS relationship incredibly valuable. The NASL would have to show that teams could earn a lot more money and field much more competitive teams as NASL sides. There's no evidence that an NASL team makes more than a USL team in an equivalent sized markets. The recent USOC results suggest that the NASL isn't any better than the USL on the field either. The NASL for its expansion needs to look at untaken markets like Cleveland, Detroit, Memphis, New Orleans, etc."
NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:10 2015 UTC,"The difference on the field is negligible. I agree with that. No difference in quality between the leagues. Where their might be a difference is whether or not independent clubs want to have market half the home games a year which are against reserve teams many with ""II"" in the team name. That's one major advantage NASL might have."
NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,phat7deuce,2,Thu Jul 16 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think the USOC results solely can be used to gauge quality of the leagues (I know you didn't say that...the other guy did).  I don't watch a lot of USL games, but I would venture a guess that there is a bigger variation in play (from a look at the standings) between the independents and the reserves than there is from top to bottom in the NASL standings.  I think things are changing in the US Soccer landscape to the point that what holds true 6 months ago is already different now.  I also think the NASL is building more substantial advantages and is trending quite well:   Moving away from dependence on Traffic (the more owners buy in, as I understand it, the less beholden we are to them) - the FIFA Crisis might be one of the best things that could happen to us in the long run) Notoriety - Raul, Adu, Carmelo, Maldini.  Say what you want on quality of play, but I'm going to guess more people clicked on articles about the four of them and the NASL than likely watched any USOC third round games (This is purely a hunch on my part) Attendance -  It's growing and looking really solid - substantially better than the USL especially when you pull out the independents.  We do have some road draws, as well (Man I hate to say this) The Cosmos Brand (I feel gross now) - It's arguably the biggest brand in US Soccer (perhaps the Galaxy and maybe now the Sounders give them a run).  I think the Rowdies Brand is fairly strong, as well.  The USL offers a soccer alternative - but not ""brands"", though there are some strong regional brands in both leagues TV Deal - ESPN3 and OWS.  They're not paid deals, but we're on the map and the OWS Coverage with JP Dellacamera is good.  Plus the new Miami FC owner Riccardo Silva is a media mogul.  Things are looking up in that regard for sure MLS Threshold and Impatience - Somebody with MLS aspirations is going to get spurned.  There are going to be more Rochesters than there are Orlando Citys UNLESS we see a merger that spawns an MLS/MLS2 structure.  How many times are teams like Sacramento going to get passed over before they don't see a lot of value in the USL/MLS relationship anymore?"
NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,HailAnts,6,Thu Jul 16 14:23:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MLS is going to stop expanding eventually, and the carrot of ""we could go to MLS!!1!"" will no longer be there to prop up marketing/interest in some of these places.    This move to a baseball-style minor league for USL (literally saw a graphic posted by the new RGVFC 2016 team yesterday that labeled USL as the ""official minor league of MLS"") I fear could stifle a lot of the organic support and excitement for these clubs.     Other minor league sports in North America do well and a lot of teams are very popular in their markets, but I don't think any comes close at all to the passion you see from supporters of lower level soccer (in NASL, USL, PDL and NPSL). When have you ever heard of fans of AHL teams traveling hundreds of miles for away games? MiLB fans protesting the front office about coaches or on-field performance? If everyone ends up just an affiliate of an MLS team, I think you could see the level of true support and interest go down.    Being the only sport with legitimate inter-league play (USOC), I think it's a big advantage for NASL to be an independent league."

NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,SCarolinaSoccerNut,0,Thu Jul 16 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"My experience is that, while the hardcores grumble a little, the vast majority of fans attending USL games are fine with the MLS-2 teams. In fact for many teams the games against MLS-2 teams are some of the highest attended games. While they know it's a reserve team, the brand of those MLS teams coming to local towns is still attractive to casual match-goers."
NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,phat7deuce,4,Thu Jul 16 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"In fact for many teams the games against MLS-2 teams are some of the highest attended games.   That's not true.  Statistically, although not significant, the MLS Reserve teams draw worse on the road than the Independent USL teams.  I just did the math using the stats from the USL site compared to the average home draws from their exact opponents.  (The USL numbers have some issues, since their road and home numbers don't exactly match, however from their own numbers it appears as if there is a -1.0% impact when a Reserve Team is in play.  Again not statistically significant, but it suggests that there is little to negative impact when an MLS II team comes to town.)  I'm not trying to be a jerk here and I'm fairly new to this community, but you seem to continually state your opinion and speculation as fact.  I don't mind if you have a differing opinion from the majority of people here...it makes for interesting dialogue.  Your phrasing might be what gets people worked up and gets you downvoted.  If you said things like ""I think"", ""My opinion"", ""I believe"" then I know, at least for myself, I wouldn't have a problem with your critical takes on the NASL.  But on many occasions you write things in authoritative way as if they are cited fact, when they are clearly not.  Again not trying to be a jerk.  You're obviously free to do what you want with it - I won't bring it up again.  I hope you stay part of the community, your takes make things interesting, but I also hope you're more thoughtful in what you state factually."
NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,SCarolinaSoccerNut,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for cranking through the numbers! Have an upvote.Not being a sarcastic ass, I really mean that.  I said many teams, not all. Obviously many factors go into attendance figures other than simply the opponent. My overall point is that there's no evidence that fans don't like their teams playing MLS-2 teams, which is what people who want USL teams to jump ship are banking on."
NASLSoccer,3dg3hm,phat7deuce,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"there's no evidence that fans don't like their teams playing MLS-2 teams   That's definitely a more factual statement.  And it's early returns so far, as well – we're only half a season into this format.  I mentioned it in an earlier comment, what both NASL and USL look like today is dramatically different from 1-2 years ago and will likely be dramatically different in 1-2 years.  So much is experimental and new that it's hard to know how American Soccer will be organized in the next 5 years or so (other than it will likely be bigger and better quality and that's good for all of us.)"

NASLSoccer,3dc0jf,brianewart,0,Wed Jul 15 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"If you want a new stadium that large and that expensive, you're going to have to boost your attendance figures. The Cosmos had a strong home opener of over 12K but have averaged less than 5K since then. Their last game got only 3,647. I know the location is less than ideal, but soccer teams in America with worse locations draw much better than that. If you're a bank making a loan to a team to build a half-billion dollar stadium, or a government considering granting land to build that stadium, you want to be damn sure you're going to get your return on investment. With how poor the draw is for Cosmos games, an investor would worry if there is enough demand to justify such a huge cost. This concern is particularly big when you consider there's another soccer team in NY that is much better financed and draws much bigger crowds (even when eliminating the two 40K+ games for NYCFC, they still average over 24K) that is also looking for a stadium site.  I'm sorry, I know Cosmos fans don't want to hear this, but with the attendance being so low and two other soccer teams in the NY metropolitan area getting way more attention, fans, and money, the Cosmos are in no position to build a stadium like the one they're planning. I would aim for something a bit more realistic, maybe a 10K seat stadium for $50M or less."

A few issues that will trip up the Cosmos: • Any site they have their eyes on, NYCFC (and the lobbying power of MLS, if you buy into that theory), will try to muscle their way into. • Any site that NYCFC doesn't try to muscle their way into is already being ogled by developers who are still running rampant throughout the city. • I keep hearing Coney Island mentioned as a stadium site. I don't see where you'd put them. The vacant land by MCU park is slated for mixed-use development and not entertainment, such as a stadium. • Icahn Stadium at Randall's Island would be perfect, if it wasn't permanently tied into US Track & Field, and supposedly the estate of Carl Icahn."

The scuttlebutt on this sub says those expansions will probably be Hartford and a yet unnamed Midwest team, likely Chicago or Milwaukee with Detroit further down the road.  It all depends on ownership, and no one I know of has heard about prospective owners on the West Coast, or if they do, they aren't saying anything.  Keep checking this sub and other NASL blogs like Reckless Challenge or Midfield Press for news. It will come. All I can tell you is to be patient."
NASLSoccer,3dboco,dahackne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:25:14 2015 UTC,It's unlikely that Milwaukee or Chicago would be announced soon. They seem to be very much at the beginning of their process. The rumor coming out of the BOG meetings was that 5 teams would likely be announced in 2015. That would be Miami and PR which have already been announced and likely Hartford and Hamilton. The 5th team could be to do with the talk that Oklahoma is very much still coming and has a major partner.

But for someone who likes to troll bait with ""by definitions"" you should know that ""minor league"" denotes affiliate or farm teams of a parent organization.  This is essentially what MLS teams are developing with their ""2"" teams and nearby farms like the recently announced Rio Grande Valley.  There are no farm teams in NASL so just stop...  We all understand you're embarrassed about your Charelston Battery.  But in the race of sorts for soccer development in the US, they are being left behind.  Locked into a league where you have to affiliate or die.  No more controlling your destiny, and hello dizzy bat races!   If you dont like the reality of whats emerging, then encourage your club to find some quality investors and step up awwto the NASL, where we can afford travel costs.... Besides, lets face it, the MLS isn't interested in your market or your team, just controlling the major ones and maximizing that fat cash! So stop glad-handing them all of the time."

At that time I wasn’t sure if [the ownership group] really wanted me. They had in their mind to bring in people from Brazil. They didn’t know me at all. It was a mistake in their decision.”    Kronsteiner was candid in discussing how, during his previous contract negotiations, he and the Strikers’ management couldn’t agree on certain terms.    “The new owners had different opinions about how things should be handled,” Kronsteiner said. “We couldn’t find a way to agree.”     ...     “I took a look at the standings,” Kronsteiner said. “They were three points from last place and I believe that’s why the Strikers called me.    “I’m convinced things could have been handled in a different way. Everything was broken. It takes time to correct this. I have to have the time to work with the players.”     ...     “Right now I’m not satisfied with the team,” said Kronsteiner. “We have to turn this team around quick. We have so many things that don’t work a hundred percent.”    The Strikers coach was blunt on what he has to work with. Kronsteiner said he has noted he has certain players that can play only one position and that there are adjustments to be made and holes to fill. He also says the team has the slowest defensive line in the league.    He has reached out to management.    “We have to change some of players,” Kronsteiner said. “We need to spend some money to get players we need, but I’m not sure if the owners are willing to spend money for players.”     ...     Said Kronsteiner, “I’m going to be honest. I’m earning less money than last time I was here. I want to make the playoffs. This is my goal. If any player is not working to make playoffs, then we need to make a change.”     Boy did we miss him..."

A lot of people I know were taking advantage of the long weekend to go to the mountains or the beach. The stadium location of Cary does no favors to those who were staying in town. Most of the major Independence Day activities in the Triangle were in Raleigh or Durham.

They have had soundless highlights, as well as one that was just 100 replays of one goal.  Definite improvement.  Although, ideally, I'd love to see more dangerous non-goal plays included.  The rowdies had many close ones."

It really looks quite nice, I must say. Think there's room to expand the south bleachers and perhaps continue to build more on the west side bleachers, if attendance keeps demanding it.

NASLSoccer,3d0rc2,zoob32,3,Sun Jul 12 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"Well, the AR blew it once, and the referee overlooked what seemed a clear penalty, but that's not in the highlights. The PK he gave to Ottawa was legit, but pretty unfortunate for us, Ramirez obviously never saw Oliver.  But something that isn't in the highlights is that this referee was one of the most inconsistent officials I've ever seen. Players on both teams were just confused the whole game because some periods he was calling every bit of contact as a foul, and some periods he was letting everything go.   It's hard to really get mad about the big calls when we don't have great replays on the Mendes offside call and the Kallman no foul call. But I think fans of both teams can admit that this referee really just could not figure out how to call this game consistently.  He wasn't as bad as the referee in the San Antonio game though."

NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,rhayward,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:12:23 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like Adu alone is enough of a box office draw, but I do think there is a nice convergence of factors and timing that could work out well:   the Rowdies success on the field (hopefully a playoff push), more robust marketing and local media attention which have led to a nice increase of support over the last 12 months the attention on the game due to the USWNT (and even more attention on the Gold Cup if you look at the ratings) then you add Freddy Adu who is a known brand to the mainstream sports fan, plus the national attention that will surround it (SI picked up the ""reports of a signing"" story.  The Rowdies weren't getting a lot of national love prior to that.)   So, I generally agree on Adu alone, but I think there is a nice perfect storm brewing and the Rowdies have been savvy local marketers this season.  I think this could help us more at the gates and in the local headlines than we might imagine on the surface."

Im not a big fan of his and I believe that his many moves indicate some type of attitude or commitment problem. BUT. even though im pesimistic, I still see a bright side. This is a move that will raise eyebrows and publicity on (perhaps) a national stage. sure it might bump up the crowd numbers, but i think this is a move which increases the visibility of the Rowdies brand and thus pleases and attracts sponsors. and that ultimately is an important aspect of the rowdies 2.0: financial success and brand expansion."
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,arm0redturkey,2,Sat Jul 11 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"I am excited because this might reboot his career. But I want to stress that NASL is not a playground. The level of play is higher than many think. It's tactically a more advanced league than MLS though from a technical perspective it is not and obviously the businesses are night and day. This league is not a picnic, a cake walk. Given his attitude issues in other places he better come to play or will get eaten alive. Still Freddy is a rare talent, the likes we have hardly ever seen on our shores as an American international, so if he comes good, it's a win-win. Win for NASL and eventually a win for the USMNT."

Rongen is tough on Freddy and realistic about his prospects, as seen in his interview with GrantLand this March , but he has a way of bringing out the best in him as well.

NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,PerfectNothing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for Rowdies fans if this is true. When Adu came to Philly I had high hopes he could turn his career around finally, but that only lead to disappointment and depression. I don't wish that on anyone."
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,DarkwingMcQuack,5,Sat Jul 11 02:32:58 2015 UTC,"The problem was that you guys needed him to be the everything - the superstar - the hero - and he was just too young and wasn't ready.  The press got to his head.  Then he wasn't able to live up to the hype, and everyone turned on him.  I'm not making excuses for him, but Freddy has been playing on a national team level since he was 14 years old.  He was anointed, and probably wrongly, as the next Pele - which is an incredibly unfair burden to put on a kid.  He didn't meet expectations, which is his biggest crime.  Along the way, he picked up some bad practice habits, a poor work ethic, and a lot of people trying to use him to fill seats.  He failed.  A lot.  And everyone blamed him for not living up to the hype that they put on him.  Ideally, Freddy comes here, and learns how to be a professional footballer.  He listens to coach Rongen, who he already trusts, and learns humility.  Team play.  Discipline.  Desire to not just win on a personal level, but as a member of a talented group.  If he does that, then he'll be ready to live up to the hype.  If he doesn't then the risk was only in giving him a chance, because honestly, we don't need him to save us."
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,EquinsuOcha,0,Sat Jul 11 03:58:39 2015 UTC,He really wasn't supposed to be our superstar though. Nowak and Ruiz weren't seeing eye to eye so he dumped him and picked up a forward that he knew would listen to him. Our FO tried hyping the move but no one bought into the hype. They did however think head be a better option up front at first. That mood changed rather quick. Like Seitz and Ruiz before him he eventual became the scapegoat player.
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,DarkwingMcQuack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think with proper coaching and a solid support structure, things would have worked out a lot better.  I've always felt that he was the product of some really poor FO moves and unrealistic expectations."
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:17:04 2015 UTC,Also had he waited 2-3 to go pro head may have been better off too.
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,DarkwingMcQuack,2,Sat Jul 11 04:21:13 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  So many people were pushing for him to come out and play pro because the league was in dire need of a feel good story. I remember when he joined DC United and everyone freaked out because he was supposed to be a prodigy.  When he didn't live up to the hype, they attacked MLS, attacked soccer, and obviously threw him under the bus.  I mean, the guy is only 26.  That's most players prime years.  The fact that we are even talking about a player of that stature in the NASL is mind boggling.  If he turns things around, the entire league will blow up in a good way.    No pressure though, right?"
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,EquinsuOcha,2,Sat Jul 11 04:28:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, now hopefully the Rowdies got him at the right price. He was making over 400k in Finland and we all know how he likes to ask for a lot more then he's worth."
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,DarkwingMcQuack,3,Sat Jul 11 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"It's not like the owner can't afford it.  We've been paying Pickens 250k a year, and while that seemed like a lot before, he's proven this year that he's worth it.  So even if he's paying him 300k, I'm fine with it - as long as it means we'll see an increase in attendance and we keep winning games."
NASLSoccer,3cuyqu,EquinsuOcha,5,Sat Jul 11 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad for us.  Speaking for myself (and I think others), I'm not looking for a savior.  My expectations aren't high.  I think this is a good environment and the right coaching situation to best help him.  If he gets out there and contributes, awesome.  If he can't, he'll at least draw some attention we otherwise might not have had.  It's all about resetting expectations versus being disappointed by past hype."

NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,SCarolinaSoccerNut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"The NASL needs to cut its losses with OKC. The market's owned by the Energy now, trying to push it when they have the stadium lease and have the head-start on a fanbase is really stupid.  There are plenty of markets completely open to expansion, El Paso, Omaha, Albuquerque, Tuscon, Boise. I have no idea why the NASL continues to focus on markets where teams already exist, be it MLS or the USL."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,EquinsuOcha,5,Fri Jul 10 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"Oklahoma Energy FC's average attendance was 3,700 last year, and that's less than half the capacity.  Their highest attendance was 4200.  They've never sold out a game.  I would say that the market is wide open, and is not owned by the Energy at all.  While there are plenty of other markets available, that doesn't preclude this one from becoming successful for the NASL."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,randymeeker,3,Fri Jul 10 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that if there's already a pro soccer team drawing 4,300 per game, the market is not, in fact, ""wide open"". If that's the case, then I guess Atlanta is a wide open market for MLS, as are Ottawa and Edmonton. I'm not saying the Energy own that market, but they definitely will have the advantage of being the only pro team in that market for at least 3 seasons before any NASL team begins playing in that market.  OKC Energy also has one thing an OKC NASL club won't have, a natural local rival. I think the Roughnecks (averaging 5k, by the way) joining USL has actually helped the Energy quite a bit. In 2014, OKC's lowest attendance was 2,813 and its highest attendance was 4,722. Those numbers have risen to 3,133 and 6,797 respectively this season, although the attendance average is somewhat skewed by the season opener and may fall to around 4,000 by the end of the season (though the playoff race could change that).  While those numbers would be toward the bottom of the NASL right now, we have to bear in mind that we're talking about a second-year team. OKC's attendance numbers actually compare favorably to the second-year numbers of the majority of current NASL teams.   If Okahoma City gets an NASL team, it's going to have to come up with a compelling reason for fans to start coming out to its games instead of Energy FC games. It will additionally have to win over Energy fans, many of whom are already invested in the rivalry with Tulsa. Any NASL team in OKC is going to have to come up with something more for fans than NASL being second division rather than third division. I'm not sure what would convince fans to support a new team over the existing one, so perhaps a better strategy would be for NASL to try to woo the Roughnecks and the Energy instead of having to build something from the ground up."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,EquinsuOcha,3,Sat Jul 11 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's going to be quality of play, and star power.  If Raul comes to OKC, people will show up.  If OKC lands some big name talent, people will show up.  The problem with USL teams is that they will not have the budget or the ability to get even an aging superstar from Europe.  It'll just be kids and 3rd division stalwarts - which is absolutely fine for what they do.  But anyone great is going to get called up to MLS, and anyone famous, is never going to come to play there.  More importantly though, winning fixes everything.  So only time will tell at this point."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,randymeeker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:33:32 2015 UTC,"If Raul comes to OKC, that's great and I'm sure it will draw a crowd, but will those people come back the next week to see the home team play? Probably the more important question is will OKC sign a name that soccer fans in that market are familiar with that isn't just a former MLS player that can no longer find a team in MLS.   I think that will probably wind up being the most critical piece in determining whether an NASL team in OKC will be successful. As a fan, I'm more interested in seeing my team do well than I am in who is playing for the opposing team. Any ownership group there is going to have to spend big and take risks in a market that already has a pro soccer team with a decent following."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  Raul doesn't seem to be even helping attendance at Hofstra, so the wow factor is only worth a few games at the most.  But a local team that has star power - that will bring people - as long as they win.  I'm personally hoping that the OKC Thunder get involved to bankroll some of it (even though I hate them since I was a Sonics fan)."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,SCarolinaSoccerNut,3,Sat Jul 11 05:11:50 2015 UTC,"It's that level because it's minor league soccer for a team with no MLS ambitions. That's good attendance for such a team. Are you saying Charleston is an open market as well?  One thing I've noticed is that teams like Orlando USL, Sacramento, Minnesota, San Antonio, Indianapolis, etc. have spoiled us and have resulted in a skewed perspective of success at the sub-MLS level. The teams of the lower levels that get monster attendance (by sub-MLS standards) are the ones with MLS ambitions. The market gets excited for the possibility of MLS and come out in droves to support that. Teams with no MLS plans typically hope for 3.5K-4.5K attendance as a good result. Teams with MLS ambitions aim for atleast 6-8K. That's how lower division soccer works."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,EquinsuOcha,4,Sat Jul 11 00:21:56 2015 UTC,"See I disagree.  That's how lower division soccer is... right now.  MLS ambitions are great.  I honestly don't care about that though.  I want a franchise with NASL ambitions, and those should be just as high as the ones for MLS.  Everyone assumes that Don Garber comes in with a magic wand, and poof - everyone who comes into MLS is instantaneously made into contenders and popular kids - and I think that's a terrible misconception.  I also think it's a terrible way to look at soccer.  Look at Jacksonville.  They currently hold the highest attendance record with 16,164.  They don't have their own stadium (yet).  They have never stated a single ambition for MLS - yet they continue to be successful.    Look at Indianapolis.  Almost 10k every game.  No stadium.  The only people who are talking about them going MLS are random fans.  Despite their record, they're ambitious as an NASL team and they want to win.  Look at Minnesota.  With the MLS bump, their attendance has skyrocketed to max capacity, but they never had MLS ambitions until the Wilf's came around, threatening to box them out of the market.  They were forced into it.  Their goal, was to be the best NASL team out there, and last year they came very close.  Had Don Garber not come calling, they would be one of the model franchises.  The list goes on.  Cosmos (fuck them), never going MLS.  Carolina. Operating on a shoe string budget in the middle of nowhere, but still one of the best damn teams in the league.  Ottawa.  Hit and miss on attendance as well as in the standings, but great support.  The only team that meets your criteria are San Antonio in the NASL, and Sacramento in USL.  Orlando City is an outlier because Rawlins bought them with the sole intention of getting to MLS, but lied his way out of Austin, and into a favorable situation in Orlando, who was desperate to have a sports team to call their own (besides the Magic - who haven't been relevant since Shaq played there).  So again, I disagree with you.  Attendance doesn't mean the team wants MLS, it means that people care about the franchise.  MLS is currently top tier, and will probably be that way for a while - but the league is not the ambition - the respect and recognition is.  All that is capable of happening in the NASL, with the right owners."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,TheBored23,2,Sat Jul 11 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"Look at Minnesota. With the MLS bump, their attendance has skyrocketed to max capacity, but they never had MLS ambitions until the Wilf's came around, threatening to box them out of the market. They were forced into it. Their goal, was to be the best NASL team out there, and last year they came very close. Had Don Garber not come calling, they would be one of the model franchises.   To play devil's advocate, their sudden MLS ambitions correspond with a rapid rise in attendance. They averaged < 3k just three years ago."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,EquinsuOcha,2,Sat Jul 11 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely fair.  But three year ago it was the team that nobody wanted.  Since McGuire bought them and invested in the rebranding and marketing, they've increased to almost 5k a game, despite the atrocious weather that they sometimes get.  The MLS bump is real though."
NASLSoccer,3cu9vt,phat7deuce,4,Sat Jul 11 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think he's not saying they aren't successful, but if you're going to make authoritative statements, like ""the market is owned"" (not yet proven, it's only 2 years in) or ""NASL continues to focus on markets where teams already exist"" (so, Miami and...?) then you're going to get some backlash."

NASLSoccer,3csdnm,phat7deuce,10,Fri Jul 10 11:35:04 2015 UTC,Don Garber is speaking to the crowd at City Hall today.  Explain that one.
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,FutbolFeller,2,Fri Jul 10 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"That's gross...It seems like what the MLS teams are doing is appropriate, from what I've read they seem to want to make sure they don't take away from the USWNT achievement, I wouldn't have held it against the Cosmos if they had jumped on board.  I get trying to capitalize on this to grow interest in the game as a whole.  I saw Abby Wambach on Colin Cowherd yesterday and she expressed the hope for this to raise the level of the game for women and men in the US.  Garber carving out his own spotlight, though?  It will be interesting to see what he does with it..."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,DABOSSROSS9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really depends on what he says? If he uses it as a soap box for MLS then shame on him, but if he talks about the tremendous growth of the girls game and the importance of the NWSL , there is no harm done."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,TheBored23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"Totally agree...I'm fine with teams getting involved in this, showing support.  In any kind of sporting ceremony they give sponsors airtime (a rep from Allstate presenting a trophy at the Sugar Bowl, Chevy exec gives World Series MVP the keys to a new truck, etc.)  On the surface it seems kind of transparent and yucky, hopefully he does something good with the platform."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,HailAnts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"In his speech, the only pro league he mentioned was the NWSL, and the only team he mentioned was Sky Blue FC, telling people to go out and see their games. I was fine with his remarks."

NASLSoccer,3csdnm,FutbolFeller,8,Fri Jul 10 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"This is bullshit, no one else should be in the parade other than the USWNT and their staff. This is a celebration of their accomplishment not soccer as a whole."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,xspixels,3,Fri Jul 10 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"That's sort of the issue.  It's not ""soccer as a whole"" it's one league/group being shown preferential treatment once more as they ""Grow the Game"". You either include everybody...or nobody."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,FutbolFeller,3,Fri Jul 10 14:32:55 2015 UTC,"honestly, I dont have a problem if they want to have the NWSL included, since a lot of the womens team ply their trade there. But MLS is trying to co-opt the accomplishment of the women for their own benefit. At least the Cosmos had enough class to turn down the invite."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,EquinsuOcha,4,Fri Jul 10 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"NWSL should be the only other soccer related group involved, agreed."

Or, they could have had all the girls on their own float, which would have been nice as well."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,TheBored23,5,Fri Jul 10 21:10:04 2015 UTC,The only reason any team's colors float down the Canyon of Heroes is when they won something.

City have given a couple of their fans a chance to join in the parade, RBNY will have girls and coaches from their youth academies. I think all three teams have gone down respectable routes with this."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,TheBored23,3,Fri Jul 10 12:23:11 2015 UTC,"The ""most recent news"" is nothing more than damage control."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,FutbolFeller,3,Fri Jul 10 13:59:52 2015 UTC,There was never any sign that the teams planned on having their players in the parade.

He promoted the NWSL and Sky Blue FC though which was awesome.

NASLSoccer,3csdnm,moxthebox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"The city of New York and the USSF were going to pay for it, until MLS stepped in and offered to pick up the bill.  The bad thing is the worry that the WMNT will be seen as second fiddle to their own parade, because the ""sponsors"" wanted the spotlight."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,EquinsuOcha,2,Fri Jul 10 16:05:09 2015 UTC,Did you actually watch the parade? That was definitely never an issue. And frankly that worry was just people always looking for the bad side of MLS.
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,moxthebox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:03:48 2015 UTC,You don't have to look very hard.  Go back and watch the press conference in Minnesota when MNUFC was announced.  MLS has a history of making other people's things all about them.
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,EquinsuOcha,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"You don't have to look very hard   You're right, I turned on the TV this morning and it clearly was not all about MLS.    Go back and watch the press conference in Minnesota when MNUFC was announced.    Oh my god, MLS? At an announcement about a new MLS team!!?? Scandalous?   You're really really reaching here."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,HailAnts,2,Fri Jul 10 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"Don Garber spoke at their parade, right before the team received the keys to the city.    MLS took out a full page ad promoting the parade, and plastered their logo right next to the NWSL one - but no where is the USWNT logo.  You know, the people who actually won the World Cup.  As for the MNUFC conference, I apparently need to remind you that  MLS made it all about them, and not the fact that MNUFC was selected to join, or that they had been extremely successful in NASL.  The team got almost no mention.  It was masturbatory and classless."
NASLSoccer,3csdnm,DarkwingMcQuack,2,Fri Jul 10 23:37:33 2015 UTC,This whole situation just seems weird to me. Were the Mets and Yankees on hand when the crew of Apollo XI got a parade? Or when the Giants won the Super Bowl?

NASLSoccer,3coxp9,Doge_9o4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"My only suggestions for TBR is to add some depth in the midfield.  Losing Portillos as an attacking mid hurt, but Guerra has done a fine job filling in as a role player.  However to make that position more dynamic, and maybe freeing up Georgi Hristov a bit more, would be to find someone who can do more than just serve up shots.    The same can be said for our holding midfielder - Keith Savage, also lost to injury for the year.  He was the Kyle Beckerman for our team, and it obviously did a lot of damage to the attack and control of possession.  Again, replacements have been adequate, but nothing as a game changer.  Maicon Santos, when available, has been a good pickup, but between his hamstring injury and his red cards, he has kept himself out the lineup far too frequently.  I wouldn't suggest getting rid of him, but with Martin Nunez, Corey Hertzog and Darwin Espinal playing as well as they have, I don't see him breaking the lineup again, AND he's not a true sub.  He adds physicality, but lacks the speed and endurance of his compatriots.  All in all, I'm happy with the lineup, but then again, I'm one of the people who thinks Freddy Adu would be an awesome acquisition.  So what do I know?  EDIT:  Jake is correct - Portillos is not an attacking mid."
NASLSoccer,3coxp9,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:18:35 2015 UTC,I think you got mixed up somehow. Portillos is a left back who was replaced by Ben Sweat & Juan Guerra is a box-to-box midfielder who leans more defensively that replaced Saragosa. Neither are attacking midfielders.
NASLSoccer,3coxp9,jmnutt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:21:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I meant was the holes in the midfield required some shuffling and moving players around into roles they're not natural fits with.

NASLSoccer,3co6ek,enm007,7,Thu Jul 9 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"“We have a limited budget again,” Kronsteiner said. “I thought at first the new owners are the rich ones. I come [back] here and I discover that the player payroll is exactly the same as it was before. None of the players makes serious money. We didn’t even have a goalkeeping coach. I brought back my crew that I had before, and I had to fight with the owners about this. They said, ‘Why do you need a goalkeeping coach?’ I’m sorry, when you play professional and I have to explain why I need a goalkeeping coach, that’s a shaky situation. But they ended up agreeing, and now I have my crew again.”   [Emphasis mine]  Holy crap. This is embarrassing. The payroll thing, ok, not everyone wants to create an expensive team. There's something to be said about squeezing value for money in a league that still doesn't see many long term contracts. But squeezing money by cutting coaching positions? That affects the professionalism of your squad."

For instance no way MLS deal w/ FOX & ESPN is capped at $90 mil per from year 1 - 10.  I'd have to assume MLS has certain risers in that deal that can bring them more money should they reach certain rating numbers. As well as there may be opportunities were both networks can revisit the deal w/ MLS. Options, buyouts!"

Never mind that most cable providers don't carry one world sports, so even if i was willing to buy a cable package i would then have to petition them to carry the channel with no guarantee they would.

For example, the Rowdies play at Indy coming up and One World Sports will stream the game for free online to fans in the Tampa Bay market.  When a team's local broadcast is available, they won't offer free streaming.  It really only hurts the ability to watch out-of-market Wednesday games (which is a big deal for those fans who wish to do so, but still probably good in the grand scheme of growing the league)."

But when you get interviews with the coach or the GM (like the Unused Subs have) or video interviews like Two United Fans, that's unique content. Reposting an article from the Tampa Bay Times is good, but it's not unique. It's been sanitized by all the PR people, and won't be anything we haven't heard before.   I encourage people to look into covering the team independently. Build a site. Get media access. Write from the fans perspective. It's something the intimacy of the NASL will allow and help grow.

He's obviously a proven coach/soccer director, but I don't like that Amaury Nunes was just cast aside after doing, IMO, a pretty good job for his first crack at a GM role. Nunes was a longtime lower division player in the US and Brazil and related well to the young, aspiring professional's mentality. I also think he would have been more receptive to Gunter's suggestions. Why allow someone to build up connections on behalf of your team just to send him on his way after a few months which he helped assemble a competitive team in a very short time span (given the team ops weren't officially handed over until after last year's Soccer Bowl)?  I'm hoping this new guy has somewhat of a grasp on the domestic talent. I know the international spots play a huge part but a majority of the players he'll be scouting need to come from here in the US. Can't rely solely on tryouts, even if he has a great eye for assessing talent.  ::HARUMPH::"

But thinking about what the league stands to gain by doing the OWS deal after the ESPN deal was in place, I don't see any other logical explanation than a strong revenue-driven outcome.  OWS does not have wider reach or stronger appeal than ESPN streaming, so those aren't the primary benefits.  I also think about ESPN being an established, in-demand platform that would hold all the leverage if NASL wanted to broadcast, whereas OWS is in the same place NASL is: trying to expand its brand, deepen its content, etc.  In other words, OWS is in a position to want to pay (front or back end) to deal with NASL, whereas NASL having to go and ask is more likely with the ESPN side.  Bottom line, I think the OWS deal was probably a financial benefit for the league though it is a net loss for accessibility.  The price of growing the league."

Honestly, I think it's the threat of disbanding or relocating that has affected them the most. We not know their future until after the season ends - they'll either relocate or they'll find a local owner. The latter is unlikely. I personally think they'll stay league owned, and move to a west coast market, while fishing for ownership groups."
NASLSoccer,3ce152,EquinsuOcha,2,Tue Jul 7 05:52:50 2015 UTC,That makes the most sense. I imagine any new team that's announced between now and the end of the year will be spun as a relocation of Atlanta.

Whereas in the NASL, Canadians count as domestics on NASL teams.  Steve Sandor has a weekly Canadian power ranking looking at the minutes given to Canadians in NASL vs MLS. NASL teams give more minutes to Canadian players by far. For example, per game Edmonton gives more than twice as many minutes to Canadians compared to the MLS team with the most Canadian minutes.   We don't need a Canadian league; we need more Canadian NASL teams. If the NASL would also allow Canadians to be domestics in the US that would be awesome, but I think there are USSF rules that would make it difficult.

NASLSoccer,3cdow1,meganeuramonyi,6,Tue Jul 7 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"As previously reported there will be significant CFL involvement in the league. At least one team will have owners that have at least a minority stake in the NHL. The league will operate under a single entity structure, and it's likely that each team will be required to work with a salary cap around $1-million to $1.5-million to start. It’s expected that the league will launch with eight teams. There will be a 70% domestic quota. In my opinion, here's the BIG reason why this league will fail: investors feel it’s important to launch with teams in the three biggest markets (Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal). There's NO way in hell that the 3 MLS markets will join this new Canadian league. Therefore, the league is already DEAD even before it starts, unless the 3 MLS markets put their USL development teams in this Canadian league instead. WAKE UP Canadians!!!!!!!!!!! Use the money to join the NASL. Love to see further markets in Hamilton, Winnipeg, Calgary Regina and Quebec City. This is a huge mistake."
NASLSoccer,3cdow1,oneeyedfool,3,Tue Jul 7 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"Based on the payroll, you are looking at a USL quality league.  So I wouldn't be surprised if the 3 teams are Toronto II, Vancouver II and FC Montreal - the CSA originally blocked Toronto from creating a B team in USL, so I imagine they will claw those three back into their own league.  Certainly this is far more likely than the MLS teams themselves.  Then round it out with Hamilton going to this league instead of NASL, Ottawa potentially defecting from NASL, a team in Calgary, Quebec City and Winnipeg and you are at eight teams.  FC Edmonton likely stays in NASL due to its level of ownership in the league, unless it sells its shares off to join the Canadian league."

At the risk of doing exactly what you didn't want to do (and we can take this to /r/NYCosmos if you think that's a better place to continue the discussion), the issues with Hofstra security aren't going to go away, but they really need to be more consistent, or at least the lines of communication between Hofstra, the team and the fans need to improve drastically. At the home opener this year I bought my nephew a flag, and he loves bringing it to games (mostly because he gets to wave it around like he's in the 5 Points). Sunday security all of a sudden decided that sticks were forbidden. Meanwhile, there were still a few souvenir flags in the stands.

NASLSoccer,3cc2wx,oneeyedfool,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"Kezar is pretty much the only option as a place to start off, but with the right financial backing and plan, I think a group could start there and grow into their own stadium in a better location.  It would need to be a group similar to One World Sports and the Cosmos, with both short term ability to sustain losses and a long term investment plan to build their own stadium. There really aren't other good options in SF, Kezar is the Hofstra of SF.

Their marketing is really poor, and their games aren't that well-attended. Their name is confusing, I'd rather see a revived California Surf. And, they don't have the money to rent or renovate one the stadiums I'll mention below (they left Titan Stadium at CSU Fullerton, not sure why, I guess $$$).

With the intra-city movement established as it is that area feels like it may end up as LAFC territory.  Orange County is likely to become/remain Galaxy territory.  East L.A., Inland Empire, north in to San Fernando, or northwest West Covina, Pomona, or even as far out as San Bernadino could all likely support a club without too much regional overlap.  This all assumes that regional overlap with a MLS club is a big concern."
NASLSoccer,3cc2wx,oneeyedfool,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"Im gonna have to disagree with you on some points. If your argument to throw off the west LA possibility is because of the new expansion if the rail lines then he suggestion of east LA or even further east as west covina La puente and pomona would be pointless because they are connected as well through the rail lines. West LA is far more suitable to sustain a pro soccer team. I've lived in many areas of LA and to be honest with you, residents from hollywood, Beverly hills and Santa Monica don't see themselves connected to downtown. The western cities even have large downtown areas something that the farther eatern cities lack of. And to let you know San Bernardino is part of the ""Inland Empire"". I do think a team in the Inland Empire would be very beneficial. And yes overlapping with MLS clubs is a big enough concern especially when splitting fans would cause harm to both set of owners. NASL should be targeting markets where MLS isn't at, with a country as big as ours the is alot to choose from!"
NASLSoccer,3cc2wx,oneeyedfool,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:02:24 2015 UTC,"I mostly meant to suggest that it would be much quicker to get from Santa Monica to downtown via train or surface streets than it would be from Pomona.  I will confess that I've never really used the first phase of the Santa Monica rail spur or whatever it's called, so I don't know for sure how quick it is.  I'm realizing that my ties to, and knowledge of, the city is mostly dated to before the days that anybody ever went to downtown for anything, so I'm likely speaking a bit out of turn here.  You make a good point about the downtown areas of the western part of the city.  You could almost put (or find) a stadium in one of the city center areas out west and create a distinct soccer geographic area, though I think the existing density might make it a problem in most places.  I imagine that the rich jerks that live around campus would somehow exercise their rich people veto and stop anyone from using Drake Stadium for a team.  Otherwise, it might be a nice central location for folks from Santa Monica, up Santa Monica blvd up to Hollywood.  Are there other existing stadiums in the northwest part of the city where a team could play?  I am fairly convinced that San Bernardino could/would support a team of their own, but that's not based on specific knowledge other than knowing a few people that live out there that constantly lament having to go in to the city for stuff."
NASLSoccer,3cc2wx,niton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"Ur right, how dense the western LA area is would cause a problem to build a stadium. I'm hoping those rich people don't do that as I feel that would be the best location for the stadium.and to be honest I wouldn't know of any other candidate for that location. So if not Drake stadium building a stadium would have to do it. And of course San Bernardino would be able to support a team on their own. But I have family living in Riverside and San Bernardino and they don't see each county as too much of difference. They mention to everyone outside the area that they live in the Inland Empire. Both cultures are mostly known as ""suburbs"". I honestly think they both would benefit from a team representing both counties naked after the Inland Empire."

NASLSoccer,3cb9cu,Nickp1991,3,Tue Jul 7 13:39:02 2015 UTC,if this is why they had a Wednesday night game every week i think its a bad idea Why force teams already struggling at the gate to play an unfavorable midweek game
NASLSoccer,3cb9cu,alxhooter,2,Mon Jul 6 21:48:21 2015 UTC,"While I agree the midweek games are going to present a problem for most teams, they weren't arranged for some hypothetical (at the time of scheduling) TV deal, but to keep the league's calendar as condensed as possible. Frankly, I think we're lucky that there aren't more of them."

NASLSoccer,3cc3rw,carrasp,5,Mon Jul 6 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"$$$. You get less money for back of the jersey sponsorship. In a world where the Cosmos get $1 million from an airline, maximizing sponsorship money is an absolute necessity to keep up. If they want, fans can choose from a bunch of shirts that display the Rowdies name instead of the sponsor in the brand new team store. Hell, they can even buy a retro jersey from some shady online retailers."
NASLSoccer,3cc3rw,jmnutt,2,Mon Jul 6 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the solitary wordmark logo will probably never be on the front of jerseys again. Now that they've got a solid relationship with Hard Rock Casino, they'll continue making a profit with them as a center of kit sponsor. I personally prefer the clean retro look, so like Jake said, I'll most likely purchase a replica from England / China rather than the current offerings."
NASLSoccer,3cc3rw,EquinsuOcha,4,Mon Jul 6 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"They don't necessarily need to put the ""Rowdies"" back on the front, but they do need to have the traditional hoops-only-on-the-sleeves look. If I was a Rowdies fan I'd be very disappointed with this year's kits. If they would work that classic logo into a new crest, that would fit great with the shirt sponsor."
NASLSoccer,3cc3rw,HailAnts,7,Mon Jul 6 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"Hoops on the sleeves were an impossibility in the first year with Nike. If they move some merchandise, then that can change as they gain more influence. Personally, I like the home shirt a lot. It doesn't have to be the same thing every year."
NASLSoccer,3cc3rw,jmnutt,4,Mon Jul 6 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"My only problem with the home shirt is that the numbers and names on them is almost impossible to read. Wish they had picked some numbers and letters with outlines, or not done the hoops on the back and dark letters/numbers."

NASLSoccer,3cc3rw,dietrich14,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:26:06 2015 UTC,No....... the Strikers currently lack a shirt sponsor.  They only just recently signed Azul Airlines as their back of shirt sponsor; leaving the front of their kit still available rather than an open design option.

For fans concerned that their local cable systems do not offer OWS, keep in mind that nine of the league’s 11 clubs have their own local TV deals that will make games available in local markets. (The games will not be streamed on the ONE World website.)  AT&T is also buying Directv, stand to reason they pick up OWS since uverse Carries station."

A great TV deal and the first highlights package we've had as a league since the GOLTV deal in 2011 which helped us a great deal gain visibility (BeIN did not exist then and GOL TV was in about 35 million homes then). OWS hopefully will further increase that visibility!

The couple FTCosmos games and highlights I've seen from ONE World are a definite improvement from anyone's local broadcast, so from a quality product perspective...they should make us look good.  Unfortunately for now they aren't on the biggest cable providers - Comcast, TimeWarner, DirecTV (although Charter, which does carry ONE World, has recently agreed to purchase Time Warner and Brighthouse Networks pending FCC Approval).  Until that time, I won't have it as part of my package, but I can give up two games (and really just the one away game) - it won't kill me.  I think this has the potential to be good-ish...it's not huge and transformational AND it's not going to ruin the world for fans (we might miss one or two games).  It's a nice step forward."

NASLSoccer,3cax7g,DrewOJensen,0,Mon Jul 6 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"That's the rub. What is the current contract for the ESPN3 deal? Do they pay NASL, does NASL pay ESPN3 or is it a ""we'll just carry it because you asked nicely"".  I have to assume it's the 2nd. But man does it suck going from  NASL: Hey everyone, we paid ESPN3 to carry a live stream so you can watch it with your paid cable internet/tv service  US: YEAH!  NASL Now: Hey everyone, we're removing some free games that we actually paid to stream, but now we're getting paid but we need to take it away... but only for a few games.  US: That was quick.  Yeah this is frustrating. You're moving from a huge audience to a small one. I just wish NASL would get their TV crap togther. They offered free internet streaming, then they made you paid for a crap version that didn't work, then they offered free through ESPN3, now they're restricting it... oh and on top of it, if you want it broadcast locally, your club needs to deal with that.   It seems like a try something new at least once a year in regards to broadcast. Also is OWS owned by Cosmos ownership group? I have yet to find out. If so, I can't wrap my head around it... did Traffic teach them nothing?"
NASLSoccer,3cax7g,jspech,-5,Mon Jul 6 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"As I have stated before Cosmos & OWS I believe are sister companys. This is not a surprise. Very few heard of OWS prior to Cosmos revival. I strongly doubt this contract would be a reality w/o Sela seeing incremental growth in the league. Although ESPN & FOX are in 4x as many homes as OWS I would love to see ratings numbers compare to what MLS gets on FOX & ESPN, at the end of the season.  Truth is with the meager ratings MLS is currently getting; still below WNBA btw, nothing is settled.  One can bet FOX & ESPN are behind this new CP Or CD (not sure of name)player rule MLS has implemented. Notice It's a desire to capture some of those ratings the Spanish networks get weekly.  Remember my friends, the free market determines winners & losers.   The market has spoken in regards to USNTs, & LigaMX, ie. ratings.  Everything else is TBD."

Why cant we just be happy NASL is taking the next step to further stabilize the league and help grow soccer in the U.S.  I am a big fan of MLS, and for awhile disliked NASL because of the retoric of taking down MLS. I know have realized I was being immature and most fans are rooting for their home team, which is awesome. I want NASL to continue to grow and succeed, but I would truly hate for MLS to falter because that would be bad for soccer as a whole in the U.S."

Furthermore, I have a special dislike for any Corporation that does not operate w/ free market principles, in a free/open society.  It's baffling that a business who sells competition, ie teams v. teams weekly, would implement rules mid season that directly affects on field competition. And no one bats an eye. This will never happened in MLB, NFL, NBA or NHL. imagine the NHL implementing their new OT rules mid season.  Additionally, I love the fact that soccer players can get jobs in a country that already offer so much.   I do not wish for MLS demise, I wish for structural changes, that brings it closer to the other sports leagues.

I don't think you want that, especially judging by your reaction, so I helpfully clarified that I think what you want is means that will create stronger competition.

NASLSoccer,3c9a7k,theasfldotcom,2,Mon Jul 6 02:22:40 2015 UTC,how are you looking for offside on that first one? it's you (the goalie) and then two defenders on the goal line... that's not even close.

Run tailgates do stuff outside the matches with/for Scorpions, but I now feel like I am 100 times more committed to the club and winning than the players are lol.  Am I bitching right now?  Yes.  Do I have a reason to be disappointed?  Yes.  Does something need to change or it's going to be a very long fall?  Yes."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,cathar_here,6,Mon Jul 6 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"How that club went from Soccer Bowl Champs to absolutely dumpster fire is pretty incredible.   Also, Lance Laing is very good at this soccer thing."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,Inclined2Glory,4,Sun Jul 5 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"It was 1-0 at the 70th with the scorpions dominating, and that one goal came from a pk.  How is that a dumpster fire?  The one concern for me was the lack of finishing.  Had we been better we never would have been in that position."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,choch2727,2,Sun Jul 5 21:57:32 2015 UTC,The one concern for me was the lack of finishing.   Really? You're not concerned about two completely avoidable red cards?
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,meganeuramonyi,0,Sun Jul 5 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"That was uncharacteristic of sattler, and given the situation, I want to give him the benefit of the doubt.  However, Attakora keeps making boneheaded mistakes like this.  There was a few that he may have earned red (from previous games), but only gotten yellows.  I wouldn't mind seeing less of him.  He isn't our starter so at least that's good news.  He was the one that got that initial red."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,choch2727,3,Sun Jul 5 22:33:02 2015 UTC,Attakora has been a dumpster fire for a long time. How he's been on the Canadian national team is beyond me

NASLSoccer,3c8fki,madman1101,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:51:07 2015 UTC,"With the way Canadians support local soccer it's not really much of a surprise they are so lacking, IMO.  To be fair Attakora is really in the second group of backline options with Mallan Roberts, Manjrekar James, Luca Gasparotto and Wandrille Lefevre (if Lefevre wants to that is). He's behind David Edgar, Doneil Henry, Adam Straith, Dejan Jakovic and Andre Hainault at CB for sure, maybe even Karl Ouimette."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,footsoldiers_sg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:42:20 2015 UTC,It's because of the absolute lack of options at RB which Attakora can somewhat play
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,HoneyBadgerCat,2,Mon Jul 6 14:17:21 2015 UTC,Scorpions dominating? Did we watch the same game? You had a few more chances but van Oekel stood on his head. Game seemed pretty even to me.
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,ProfessorScribbles,2,Mon Jul 6 17:20:34 2015 UTC,Dominating is a bit generous. It was a fairly evenly matched game up until that point.
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,choch2727,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:40:23 2015 UTC,I disagree.
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,Inclined2Glory,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:54:24 2015 UTC,"Dumpster fire may have been a bit harsh, but it seems almost every decision the club has made since they lifted the cup has been detrimental for both the short and long term; the results on the field have only reflected that.   It's certainly possible to turn things around, but the falloff from champion to potential basement dweller happened a lot quicker than it should've."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,rhayward,2,Sun Jul 5 22:10:15 2015 UTC,They always have a bad start to the season. Lets see how they fair later on in the season before we make a call.

NASLSoccer,3c8fki,DariusBieber,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"It's not that incredible honestly. Look at last season: The Scorpions had two starting MLS Goalkeepers through the season. Bingham (now with the Earthquakes) and Saunders (now with NYCFC). Their defense last season was pretty solid. They lost Borrajo who, in my opinion, was outstanding in the back line. Cann has been very shaky to say the least, since coming back from injury.     The Scorpions' midfield is really bad nowadays. Last season, they had Restrepo controlling the midfield somewhat. He's gone too. Menjivar is gone as well. The lack of team chemistry is what is clearly seen. 75% of the starting lineup is different from last season. Only remains Castillo, Cann, James.. Other than that, the starting line up has changed completely."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,DariusBieber,-10,Mon Jul 6 04:38:53 2015 UTC,Head coach Marcina should be gone soon. Scorpions will be last place this fall.

NASLSoccer,3c8fki,choch2727,4,Sun Jul 5 22:54:26 2015 UTC,He actually had scorpions flair once upon a time.  However he eventually started getting a hard-on shitting on the scorpions so he changed it lest he look like an idiot.  I think he is actually a scorpions fan in a Helga from Hey Arnold kind-of-way.  I saw a tiny semblance of that in a post to the scorpions FB page he made.
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,quiethere,3,Mon Jul 6 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"That's a good comparison haha. With how much he follows the Scorpions I think everyone knows he's a fan. I guess it's just easier to antagonize than to actually commit to a team (he does this for the Spurs as well).   Anyway, he's got nothing to lose, but still no reply. Guess he has some hope for the Scorpions."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,rhayward,3,Mon Jul 6 13:06:17 2015 UTC,I want this to happen so badly
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,cathar_here,3,Mon Jul 6 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"Lets call this what it is.  The Scorpions as an organization are imploding.  Their president is a hockey guy that is trying to run a Soccer club.  The ownership is dying to try and find a buyer and I'm guessing it's because he's spending money like mad and isn't really happy about it.  We spent some time and money last year and grabbed some great players in between the spring and fall, and had an assistant manager step up and do wonders with a fantastic group of guys and we won a championship.  Everything about that campaign is gone.  Anyone that says the Scorpions dominated most of that match yesterday is well slightly leaning towards the Scorps.  It looked like most of the match that the guys don't ever practice together.  They are almost never on the same page and the only person with any ability to get the ball through the midfield is Castillo.  And, no dumpster fire is not really an exaggeration.  I am not saying it has to stay that way, but the guys on the pitch now just don't have enough to win much.  They need additional help.  The frustration is growing every week.  The players are yelling at each other.  The players are yelling at the officials.  Julius James the guy with the most red cards in club history is actually the voice of reason right now.  He's trying to calm players down and keep them from getting red cards.  It truly is like a Twilight Zone episode lol."
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,DeltaReaper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:57:33 2015 UTC,Missed the match. How did Attakora and Sattler get their reds?
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,angeloram,2,Mon Jul 6 17:12:43 2015 UTC,Attakora pulled down a player from behind right out side the box. Sattler kick the ball at a group of Edmonton players after the PK from the Attakora red card.    Edit: In my opinion it looked like Sattler was responding to the Edmonton play re-kicking the ball back into the goal after the play was over.
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,DeltaReaper,2,Mon Jul 6 17:31:47 2015 UTC,Thanks!
NASLSoccer,3c8fki,freddymurk124,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:46:42 2015 UTC,a second player or the player who scored kicking the soccer ball into the net again happens often in soccer.
NASLSoccer,3c815u,footsoldiers_sg,3,Sun Jul 5 19:38:42 2015 UTC,2 penalties awarded to the Eddies that weren't penalties. 2 red cards to the Scorpions as well. Just a shit show...
NASLSoccer,3c815u,crasher_of_bikes,2,Sun Jul 5 21:30:38 2015 UTC,actually 3 penalties that were right. third on boakai wasn't called because he scored before the whistle. sas could have won if they didnt turn their aggression into bitch play
NASLSoccer,3c815u,DariusBieber,-1,Mon Jul 6 04:57:24 2015 UTC,Juste usual lack of professionalism by the Scorpions. They'll be last place this Fall by a mile.

NASLSoccer,3c815u,angeloram,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"The sideline referee must have called that ball out of bounds. That's the only logical explanation. Castillo kicked it, the ball swayed in and out of play... There's no other call it could have been......"
NASLSoccer,3c815u,DariusBieber,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:04:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe that was the call then, but I thought the Edmonton commentators said they got confirmation that the call was offside."
NASLSoccer,3c815u,GarMc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:16:28 2015 UTC,The Scorpions players were way too calm after the whistle. It's no way the call was offside... Offside on a corner kick is pretty much impossible.
NASLSoccer,3c815u,angeloram,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:27:27 2015 UTC,It is impossible. All passes are backwards passes from corner kicks. You can't be offside from a backwards pass.
NASLSoccer,3c815u,GarMc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"I re-watched the sequence, side judge clearly signals offside, and the commentators who were speculating that maybe it was a foul got confirmation that the call was offside."

NASLSoccer,3c56zl,bostonfan148,4,Sat Jul 4 22:14:26 2015 UTC,ok let's logic this shit...  does it seem like anyone is leaving for a canadian league? if no one has said anything so far then no.  is it likely that the canadian league will be a development league for existing div 1 and 2 leagues much like the usl? yep. small and simple.  since mls and nasl exist in major markets what would the league look like? probably like  the chl. full of secondary markets with some teams being the lower ranks of major market teams.  i don't know anything but i'd put a dollar on all this.
NASLSoccer,3c56zl,crasher_of_bikes,3,Sun Jul 5 05:53:42 2015 UTC,"With the PanAm games about to start in Hamilton, I suspect any announcements will occur after those are done."
NASLSoccer,3c56zl,fury_screamer,3,Sat Jul 4 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"There is no Canadian league. All speculation about it comes from Duane Rollins who seems to make things up quite a bit. Show me a source other than that about this Canadian league.  The talk of Hamilton has suggested the announcement will come following the PanAm games.   Hartford have announced they'll play in MASL in the winter and start outdoor in NASL in 2017. They haven't got everything finalised yet so that's not officially announced.  There was talk that 5 teams were likely to be announced this year following the BOG meeting so with Miami and PR announced, that leaves one further one. People who went on the Cosmos trip to come say Oklahoma is very much still on so could be them. Not sure if that would pan out."
NASLSoccer,3c56zl,WorldAbandoned,3,Sat Jul 4 23:02:28 2015 UTC,"I'm the one who was on the Cuba trip who mentioned that a reporter told me that OKC is alive and closer than people think.  This was of course before the lawsuit settlement between NASL and Tim McLaughlin, so who knows how that impacts OKC in NASL, good or bad.  I asked Peterson about California expansion and he said that he was working on it so I would not be surprised if he manages a California team announcement for 2017 by the end of the year.  I think it a fifth team could just as easily be the much coveted west coast team."
NASLSoccer,3c56zl,oneeyedfool,2,Sat Jul 4 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly the NASL should cut its losses with OKC. USL won that round, no need trying to dig even deeper. Better idea would be to find other cities in the Great Plains like Omaha or El Paso."
NASLSoccer,3c56zl,SCarolinaSoccerNut,2,Sat Jul 4 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"NASL would need to get a waiver from the USSF for Hamilton, unless the league has 16 teams...then Hamilton could be the 4th guest team and be fine under the 75-25 rule."
NASLSoccer,3c56zl,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,3,Sun Jul 5 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"http://www.canadiansoccernews.com/index.php?/page/articles.html/_/24th-minute/league-is-coming-r5279  If that's true, it's likely NASL loses Hamilton, with their CFL owner, to this league.  Ottawa would also be a potential loss, as they are also tied in with the CFL.  Since Edmonton are tied in financially with the NASL they seem more secure.  The MLS B sides for the Canadian teams would be likely to join this league too.  Hamilton Ottawa Toronto FC II FC Montreal Vancouver Whitecaps II  Is a nice core to start from and then you could add Quebec City, a team from Saskatchewan or another Ontario based team."

NASLSoccer,3c3zmn,Zackquerru,8,Sat Jul 4 15:33:53 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with everything said here. The fact that MLS doesn't seem to hold MNUFC to the same standards it sets forth for LAFC (construction / demo still pending) and NYCFC (nothing planned at all) seems to lean towards the notion that these guys haven't a clue what they're doing.
NASLSoccer,3c3zmn,EquinsuOcha,3,Sat Jul 4 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"Why would they hold them to the same standards? They've made it painfully obvious (even openly stating) that they have no intention of ever doing so. Certain markets are always going to preferential treatment.   It's unfortunate for the fans, but this is what happens when you're ""the boss"", and your own incompetence is dwarfed by gale-force winds at your back.  Maybe one day we'll have a strong enough federation that decisions are made solely on what's best for the sport, not the pockets of a few owners. I'm not holding my breath, though."
NASLSoccer,3c3zmn,Inclined2Glory,5,Sat Jul 4 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"Minnesota United is welcome to stay in NASL, if it comes to that, I am sure.  Minnesota United based out of St. Paul vs Minnesota Vikings FC based out of Minneapolis would make a nice Open Cup derby.  I don't buy that a Vikings MLS team = the death of United.  You have a billionaire owner, if he has the passion for the fight you could survive and thrive."
NASLSoccer,3c3zmn,oneeyedfool,2,Sat Jul 4 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Because the one thing the Warios have in their favor, is the stadium. Once that's built, they'll use their connections to stonewall / hinder any chances of MNUFC from building anything in the metro area. Without a stadium of their own, United is unsustainable in their current model. The argument then becomes ""why go all the way up to Blaine / St Paul, when there's a top tier soccer team in the heart of downtown MPLS, that plays in a brand new stadium.

NASLSoccer,3c3zmn,gotroot801,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"What if MLS set the deadline on United intentionally knowing it was slim to none that they would get a deal struck. Ultimately, Garber wanted to work with a Viking led group, but thought ""hey, I'll pretend to be into this grassroots thing and if I can get a sparkling new stadium somehow then even better!""   Ultimately, Minnesota United fails to get a new stadium and Garber can say ""well, I know we gave you the deadline and it wasn't met. Fortunately, for the people of Minnesota a Wilf led initiative has stepped forward to save top flight soccer in the twin cities.""  Effectively, Garber would get the ownership he was rumored to want from the beginning and he kills off a NASL franchise in the process without looking like a villain.

NASLSoccer,3c0smf,enm007,6,Fri Jul 3 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"We assume they are being paid. Keep in mind MLS didn't earn TV rights until 2006, and that was due to some hanky panky after Chuck Blazer intervened with FIFA to keep the FIFA rights away from NBC and then Garber made a deal with ESPN. Still this is big news whether they generate revenue or not. This is a better timeslot arguably than what MLS has on national TV. MLS' ratings haven't spiked up the way many had hoped with the dedicated 5pm and 7pm timeslots on Sunday. Wednesday night might actually be a better timeslot."
NASLSoccer,3c0smf,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,5,Fri Jul 3 22:57:01 2015 UTC,Just as a point of reference a Stoke-Swansea game late in the season on NBCSN generated more viewers than the NYC derby on ESPN at 5pm on a Sunday last week. That should put into perspective how poor MLS' TV ratings are.
NASLSoccer,3c0smf,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,6,Fri Jul 3 22:58:20 2015 UTC,Good news! They actually have a pretty impressive foot print already for only being on the air for three years.   https://www.oneworldsports.com/about

The arrangement might be similar to the league's deal with ESPN3, which is an ad space/time split between the network and the home team broadcasting the match. But again, we'll have to see how this plays out, esp. whether OWS will be taking clean feeds from game sites and overlaying their own announcers and ad packages."
NASLSoccer,3c0smf,jmnutt,2,Sat Jul 4 03:41:50 2015 UTC,"That was my assumption, as well. It seemed presumptive that people on this thread were already saying this would bring in revenue."
NASLSoccer,3c0smf,SCarolinaSoccerNut,5,Sat Jul 4 05:32:48 2015 UTC,Certainly an improvement over the ESPN3 deal. This deal will earn the league revenue and actually put them on TV. Step in the right direction.

Unfortunately ONE World Sports is carried in a total of 3 homes (minor exaggeration) and mine is not one of them.

NASLSoccer,3c0smf,oneeyedfool,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"This can be a nice resume builder and stepping stone for the league in terms of TV contracts.  They can now say they are featured on two networks while trying to sell a game of the week to another one.  For OWS's part, they need more programming that will appeal to an American audience if they want to go beyond being a niche place for those who want to watch Japanese baseball, Cricket or Asian soccer tournaments.  If they want a strong U.S. following they will probably need to break the current programming out into a separate channel one day.  This is an incremental step to help get them there."
NASLSoccer,3c0smf,FutbolFeller,2,Sat Jul 4 12:34:23 2015 UTC,"That is sort of the point of One World Sports.  It's showing content that has a following and isn't the same thing you can get on 37 other sports channels.  So, while you might not care about Japanese Baseball or England National Team Cricket there are millions of people living in the United States that do have an interest in those things.  I hope that makes sense?"
NASLSoccer,3c0smf,oneeyedfool,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"If that is the limit of their ambitions, why purchase (with investors) and operate a D2 US soccer team?  My guess is they want to get bigger and not just fill a niche.  You can do both with multiple channels."

Both organizations have lots in common. They are based on the same concept of fans building from the grass-roots. From there, the fan base of both organizations will grow in huge numbers.

NASLSoccer,3bt9hk,misanthropester,8,Wed Jul 1 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"This is a failure on MLS's part.  They have consistently shown that despite being the major league counterpart of soccer, they have absolutely ZERO pull / impact / lobbying power when it comes to downtown stadiums - yet that is exactly that they're demanding.  I'm sorry, but you cannot ask for a $100 million dollar buy in, and then expect the guys stroking the check, to do all the political heavy lifting.  What they're paying for, is your clout and savvy, and if you don't have that - then what the fuck good are you?  The Chicago Fire have a gorgeous place that is so far removed from the city, that they've relegated themselves into a second class status - to the point that an NASL franchise is threatening to open up shop in the vacuum that their failures have created.  MLS has decided the best bet to go with is to repeat the failures of the past, and piggy back with NFL franchises, to share their facilities, which time and time again, has proven to be a disaster.  Time will tell what The Atlanta United mess will be, but early indications are mixed.  Lastly, the Purple Headed Knobs, or Orlando City if you're not a Rowdies fan, had an epic failure that cost them $30 million of their own funds.  Despite having great attendance, and a strong product on the field, they - and MLS - failed to grease the right pockets and make sure the funding was still set, and as a result, Rick Scott and the legislature made them pay.  I guarantee you they wouldn't have spent $30 million in lobbyist fees had they done their homework and due diligence.  My point being, you cannot expect a single ownership group to pay out of pocket for everything, with absolutely no help from MLS.  I'm talking more than flying Taylor Twellman and Rob Stone (my homie!) out to do an announcement, and then leave an information  desert in their wake.  Look at how well NFL hammers state, local and county politicians.  They squeeze every dime they can out of the tax base, and like it or not, it's extremely effective.  MLS needs to learn that lesson and plant some full time lobbyists in the market.  I mention all these things, because these are the problems that future NASL expansions are going to face.  We have a weakened central organization, and MLS has an ineffective one.  We will see the same kinds of pushbacks should there be a Chicago Sting, or an LA Aztecs looking for a home.  Markets like San Diego, San Francisco, or even Las Vegas are our battle grounds, and if we're not watching how the competition keeps fucking up, we're going to make the same kinds of missteps - and the NASL cannot afford any more failures."

Even in Pittsburgh, which is football crazy, there is hurt feelings over the fact that the state and city covered the majority of the bill for Heinz field, and at the same time had to close schools due to budgetary issues.  Likewise, a lot of the legislature difficulties come from the public-funding stadium building backlash that resulted.   I'm not saying the MLS couldn't do better, it's garbage how far-flung some of their stadiums are from the cities they call home (the union have an entire county between them and Philly), but it's not a problem they caused, and stems from the the exact activities you say the MLS should do."

July 1st was always a ludicrous deadline.  I don't know how they arrived at that date, whether MLS just firmly set it or it was negotiated between the two groups.  United came in probably a bit naïve about how simply they could get this done with local governments, and MLS were probably equally naïve in the same regard.  If MLS were to pull the expansion away from United for this deadline, then I'll expect them to do so from Miami in the same breath."

She's taken this as a campaign issue, and now she won't back down for fear of losing face.  The legislature is just as confounding, so I wouldn't expect a great deal of help from them either.  The biggest question is this - if MLS is not using their lobbyists, or their influence to get the stadium built - then what's the point of going to MLS?  If an NASL team can build a downtown stadium on their own, why pay an extra $100 million to join a league that isn't willing to fight for your interests?"
NASLSoccer,3brci6,offensive_loons_fan,8,Wed Jul 1 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"The problem was previously that the Wilfs would get an MLS franchise and United's NASL team wouldn't be able to thrive alongside it.  So United's hand was forced in going for MLS.  If that scenario hadn't existed, I'd agree with you; just stick it out in NASL.    Interesting question of whether MLS would go back to the Wilfs if United fell through, which would put United in the same precarious situation, but I think that's unlikely.  If they don't go back to the Wilf's, and it looks like NASL could be the only gig in town, then I'd say fine, wasn't dying for MLS anyway."

Let's hope that's the case, that maybe after the expansion bidding process they felt put off and decided they didn't want to do business with the league (no reason to think that's the case, just praying).  Then United could continue to exist in NASL as it had.  No new stadium even needed, necessarily, though it would still be delightful."

NASLSoccer,3bpj1u,brianewart,-1,Wed Jul 1 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe physically they cannot hang, but from a technical standpoint most USWNT players are better than anyone in the NASL that is American. Tactically probably smarter also than most NASL players who are American. Carli Lloyd is better with the ball at her feet and in understanding how to time runs than any midfielder in NASL. That's a reality. Maybe it's physical issues why y'all don't think the women can compete and that's fair, but honestly I think many of them are better players than what we have in NASL or MLS."
NASLSoccer,3bpj1u,nate11a,3,Wed Jul 1 06:35:36 2015 UTC,It's going to be harder to time those runs and make those plays when facing a team physically more dominant than anyone they've ever played competitively. Physical attributes are still important to even the most technically sound players.
NASLSoccer,3bpj1u,brianewart,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe physically they cannot hang,   The physical differences between men and women would be a much bigger mountain to climb than you seem to be implying.  That's not to say that a woman couldn't contribute, but I don't believe she could be a ""first name on the team sheet"" kind of impact player. Example: You give in-her-prime Abby Wambach an open header six yards out, and she's entirely capable of putting it out of reach of any goalkeeper. But at 6-foot and 175 lbs., she's much, much closer to her average opponent physically, and it'll be a lot harder to muscle past a marker to get in position for an open header."

NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:17:42 2015 UTC,Who are the key players?
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,madman1101,3,Tue Jun 30 22:38:31 2015 UTC,"The team is built around the defensive spine - Tamika Mkandawire, Stefan Antonijevic, Darnell King / Rich Balchan / Ben Sweat (he makes the ladies... moist), and of course the keeper, Matt Pickens.  Midfield has had a lot of injuries, so our #10 of Georgi Hristov is the lynchpin, however Brian Shriver has stepped in very well."
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,TheChosenJuan99,3,Tue Jun 30 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"Indy runs a 4-5-1/4-4-2, key players include the super sub Don Smart, keeper Kristian Nicht, and new kid Duke Lacroix"
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,benjistakes,3,Tue Jun 30 22:47:20 2015 UTC,"Since Juergen Sommer was fired and Tim Regan took over as coach, the Eleven have run exclusively with a fairly fluid 4-4-2.   The central duo in the midfield has tended to be composed of Dylan Mares, who naturally drifts higher up the pitch but isn't afraid to track back, and Brad Ring, a defensive midfielder voted Spring Season MVP over on /r/IndyEleven. As far as the flanks, Victor Pineda has emerged on the left after a brace in Fort Lauderdale, and I'm partial to Dragan Stojkov on the right, although speedy Jamaican Don Smart usually relieves whoever starts on the right wing as our designated super sub.  Honduran international Erick Norales is the anchor of the back four, and he's usually paired with veteran and on-again, off-again captain Greg Janicki or the always solid Cory Miller at centerback. Chicago Fire product Marco Franco is the secure right back, and Jaime Frias splits time with Kyle Hyland on the left side. Of course, fan favorite Kristian Nicht is the keeper. Personally, I'd call the defense the strongest part of the Eleven's roster.  The front two has been composed of LA Galaxy loanee Charlie Rugg and former Red Stripe Premier League golden boot winner Brian Brown as of late. Rugg tends to be more of a hold-up type of player to Brown's defense-stretching paciness, and traditional target forward Wojciech Wojcik was the only other forward on the roster for most of the Spring. Late on, preseason trialist Duke LaCroix was signed, and he's been a revelation as an energetic late-match substitute. Admittedly, the attack started slow, but five goals in the last two matches of the Spring are a good sign for the Boys in Blue.  Overall, I'd say that our key players have been Norales at centerback, Ring as a center midfielder, and probably Nicht in goal. As I mentioned, the key substitutes are Smart and LaCroix."
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,niton,2,Wed Jul 1 02:42:04 2015 UTC,For the Cosmos They usually run a 4-2-3-1  Key Players Jimmy Maurer GK Roversio CB Walter Restrepo RM Leo Fernandes LM Marcos Senna CM Lucky Mkosana ST  And oh yeah some guy named Raul
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,offensive_loons_fan,2,Wed Jul 1 04:59:56 2015 UTC,Minnesota has used the same formation so many times it's probably seared into the mind of every NASL coach:  4-2-3-1   2 Fullbacks run up the wings. 2 Outside Mids make overlapping runs. One or the other makes a cross while the other runs into support closer to the box. 1 central Attacking Mid and 1 Striker head the attack into the box. 2 Centerbacks stay in defense. 2 Holding Mids - 1 falls back into defensive line if a fullback moves forward. The other stays more central.
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,ProfessorScribbles,2,Wed Jul 1 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"Nach nailed it here, though I think on the two holding mids bit I think they push those mids forward too much and at the wrong times.  In theory, they fall back if a fullback moves forward.  In practice, when I see a counter coming, Pitchkolan or Vicentini (or whoever) are screaming back to play catch up.  That is something I want to see improved for the fall - Pitchkolan sitting in a more permanent DM role regardless of other player movement."
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,offensive_loons_fan,2,Wed Jul 1 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"Miller seems to want to run this year with a 4-5-1 with both wingbacks and wingers, diamond midfield and a lone striker either playing as a big physical target man (this has never worked once for us) or just a poacher.   Last year we had a thing going where we had Fordyce as a False Nine trying to draw attention to his position while the GOAT himself Boakai would set up a play. Worked really well for us last year, but Miller put Boakai in the doghouse and we haven't really seen any offense generated since, outside of our one-trick-pony 'give the ball to Nyassi or Laing, run up the flanks and cross it to Ameobi' tactic which it seems several teams have the answer to now."
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,ProfessorScribbles,2,Wed Jul 1 06:50:55 2015 UTC,"Can you talk more about why Boakai has spent so much time on the bench this year?  There has to be a way to get this kid on the pitch alongside Nyassi, Laing, etc., on a consistent basis.  Who has to make way to get that done?"
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,cathar_here,3,Wed Jul 1 15:37:41 2015 UTC,Rumor out of the Eddies camp and the bloggers close to the organization say Boakai had an attitude issue.  Him and Jalali let their success get to their young heads and they both started the season from the bench.   Jalali fixed himself pretty quickly but Boakai was basically a sub all spring season.  He's been getting chances towards the end of it but I don't know if he's fixed his mental problems or if Miller is just desperate for some offense.
NASLSoccer,3bo9l5,Hygienicnerd,2,Wed Jul 1 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"Well as a Scorpions fan this season, it's been very very frustrating.  I would say the formation is either a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3 or maybe a 4-1-3-1-1 or even a 3-5-2 or hell I have no idea.  It's impossible to tell.  The one constant is whether a 4 man back line or a 3 man back line, there have been huge gaping holes due to no one marking people when it's been necessary.  Now, who fits best in to the above formations, well the whole fecking club man.  There are two bright spots on this roster for me this season and that's been Omar Cummings and Rafa Castillo.   Everything else has been a disaster.  Now with that said, we'll still probably win the Fall, but that's because we're champions and we'll be back :-).  But, yeah nothing to get excited about in the Spring at all.  But, its been heard by players and coaches both that the Spring is San Antonio's preseason, the reason season is the fall.  that's a horrid approach, but let's see if it works again."

The winner of the spring and the winner of the fall automatically qualify for the playoffs (sorry Commish, THE CHAMPIONSHIP) along with the two teams with the highest combined points total between the spring and fall seasons. The NY Cosmos won the Spring, with my Tampa Bay Rowdies 1 point behind, and Carolina and Minnesota 5 points back of the Rowdies. To watch games, you only need to subscribe to a cable provider that has access to ESPN 3, all matches air there. The teams are set for this season, but Miami FC and Puerto Rico FC are joining at some point next season. Minnesota is off to MLS at some vague fuzzy time in the future. I won't try to do a synopsis of every other club, but I'll try to do a quick low-down of the Rowdies:  After winning the league in 2012, the Rowdies suffered through 2 underperforming season. The team changed ownership to a local businessman who has spent millions renovating the former minor league baseball stadium the team calls home into a soccer-centric venue. Sweeping personnel changes in the offseason saw a new team President (Farrukh Quraishi, the original Rowdies' first draft pick) and Head Coach (Thomas Rongen - who was the first head coach of the Tampa Bay Mutiny and also coached in DC, LA, and the American Samoan national team) and 20 new players join the roster, a mix of MLS veterans, some with local ties, and young/promising players, primarily from South America. In the midseason break, the Rowdies signed a partnership deal with Sao Paulo FC, Brazil's most successful club, that will include friendly matches, coach & technical staff exchanges, players on loan to the Rowdies while some of the Rowdies youngest players train with SPFC."
NASLSoccer,3bloaq,jmcox,3,Tue Jun 30 06:22:07 2015 UTC,"Sweet, looks like I'll be able to watch the games! And thanks for the detailed response! The way you guys do your season is really interesting to me, I like it."
NASLSoccer,3bloaq,EquinsuOcha,3,Tue Jun 30 06:41:42 2015 UTC,"I really hated the idea of the split season when it was first implemented (which we all secretly believe was designed to allow the Cosmos a late start), but now that I've seen in action for two seasons in a row, I'm a big fan of it.  It takes away the duldrums of just another long ass season, where games stop mattering.  Spring matters, even if it's a short season, and obviously Fall is where you get the majority of your points.  The league itself is still in its infancy, but man has it grown both in quality and in size.  Teams like my Rowdies (who came into the league as FC Tampa Bay) were an absolute joke when they first came on, barely with enough roster spots to host a full squad.  Now, we're looking at professional clubs like Minnesota United, Indy 11, and even the most middle of the table franchises can compete week in and week out.  Parity is always talked about in MLS, but NASL is more like an arms race - while it's awesome to stock up on talent, you still have to play the game, and the Cosmos barely pulled off the spring season.  Coaching matters a lot here, so teams that can't get their technical staff in order, are doomed to fail.  Still, no matter how much money is spent, every now and then, your superpower team lays a complete egg, and your underachieving underdogs pull off an upset.  It keeps things pretty exciting, because you never know what's going to happen.  There's no DP's, there's no drafts, no player allocation, and no salary restrictions - it's pretty much anything goes.  If a team wants to wine and dine their players - they do.  If a team wants to nickel and dime them - they do.    The refereeing sucks, no matter what.  You'll learn to both love and hate this.  Not every team plays in soccer specific stadia.  In fact, Ft. Lauderdale, San Antonio, Carolina, and Minnesota are the only ones that do - the rest are living out of converted baseball or football stadiums.  Attendance isn't that great, but as a Fire fan, you'll see similar numbers.  Indy 11 is a great up and coming team, with a fantastic fan base.  You're going to like them.  The biggest thing is, come to one of the matches.  I know it's a haul for you, but one of the things you'll find is how intimate the teams relationships are with the fans - many of us are friends with the players (and even some of the coaches) on Facebook.  You can literally hang out with them, depending on the team and the circumstances.  Follow them on Twitter.  They're allowed to be themselves without having ""the league"" stifle them, and it ends up being a really cool environment.  Tailgates, pre-game parties, and all the social stuff is really what sets the NASL apart.  Welcome to the league!"
NASLSoccer,3bloaq,rhayward,2,Tue Jun 30 08:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I liked the idea of an American League with a ""European"" type setup. That's really awesome how accessible the teams are to the fans though."

I lived there when I was barely getting started following US domestic soccer. Attending Fire games was my introduction to the domestic leagues. So I've always been really intrigued by the idea of a second team based on the North Side. If it launches, I'm going to have a very hard time not rooting for them in the back of my mind."
NASLSoccer,3bintk,augspreadhead,4,Mon Jun 29 15:23:19 2015 UTC,"Love everything about this, especially because I live on the Northside. A team up here would be awesome and I would immediately buy season tickets."

I'm in favour of playing at Hanson Park Stadium. It is a 16,000 seat facility, which it's certainly great for an NASL franchise. Here's another one, what about Joliet Memorial Stadium??? It holds roughly a 10,000 seat capacity."
NASLSoccer,3bintk,Spongie555,4,Mon Jun 29 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"Lane Stadium at Lane Tech HS is a 5,000 seat capacity and it is close to Wrigley might be a good starting temp stadium. 16,000 seems a little to big to begin with, maybe play at Lane for a season or two to gauge support and move to Hanson"

NASLSoccer,3bk1vs,cathar_here,2,Tue Jun 30 03:45:45 2015 UTC,I assume that the league would disclose some amount of financials to a potential investor/owner as part of the due diligence process. You'll probably have to get an NDA in place first thought. Contact the league's general counsel.
NASLSoccer,3biua9,niton,5,Mon Jun 29 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"I have several takes here.   Although I just bought a Strikers jersey (I live in Boca, so support local) seeing the Coastal Cup in those colors hurt my soul. An all Florida pre-season tournament will be FREAKING AWESOME. The desire to beat the other in-state clubs will make the fans demand the clubs to put out their starting squads. Inviting OCSC and a future Miami Becks United will only make the tournament more special. The article stating that they'd welcome Miami Becks United for these matches comforts me to Miami FC's dedication level to the league and most importantly, their fans and the area."
NASLSoccer,3biua9,Jwhidde4,2,Mon Jun 29 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just a little worried we might run into similar issues between OCSC and Rowdies fans. I really wish this could happen but I could see some potential problems.  Also, yes, that Coastal cup should be yellow and green."
NASLSoccer,3biua9,rhayward,2,Tue Jun 30 00:10:01 2015 UTC,The OCSC-TBR fan thing has turned beyond unhealthy. Just my opinion as I have friends on both sides and go to every OCSC game these days. Both sets of fans need to show some more maturity before we can have any sort of tournament with both teams in it IMO.

NASLSoccer,3bhxb2,Vesty,3,Mon Jun 29 13:07:12 2015 UTC,Because they never should have filed in the first place.

NASLSoccer,3bcc2h,howdjadoo,2,Sat Jun 27 23:40:39 2015 UTC,"To me 4 games isn't too small a sample size particularly when you consider that he faced SAS, MNU, NYC and JAX. It's a nice mix of teams both in terms of standings and attacking style."

It seems silly to say Tampa Bay would have conceded 13 more goals with Kamil Contofalsky in goal. For that to be the case he would have to be a serious liability in net, which he was far from being based on actually watching the matches.

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,2,Mon Jun 29 20:32:53 2015 UTC,Exactly right! If a citizen of San Diego wants a taste of the Xolos experience they are going to go watch the Xolos not the knock off version just so they don't have to cross the border.
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think Chivas is different because that was distinctly Mexican entity. Xolos have fielded a lot of American players AND have lots of ""gringo"" fans which Chivas didn't. So those you would typically target to go to an American MLS or lower division match are already supporting Xolos in San Diego. Comparing it to Chivas USA is a simple, knee-jerk reaction. NYCFC seems to be working okay thus far though we don't know long term and that entity seems even less distinct from MCFC than Chivas USA did from Chivas Guadalajara."
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,Spongie555,3,Sat Jun 27 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know about a lot of ""gingo"" fans for the Xolos. South Bay really has been the primary area of Xolos support in San Diego(they even have a team store there). I noticed most white fans really were fans of Joe Corona but he is no longer is on the team which has kinda killed non-hispanic interest(news and radio have been reporting on the xolos less). The few times you will see ""gringo"" support is when the Xolos make it really far into Mexican league"
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"Comparing it to Chivas USA is a knee jerk reaction, but this is much more like the MLS 2 team set up.

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,RealSoccerDon,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:53:22 2015 UTC,Why is it dumb? Getting Xolos into NASL would be a coup of sorts. That club is arguably more popular than any American club in Southern California including the Galaxy. That's why I posted the article. It's a really creative idea that will make NASL matter in that part of the country.

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,brianewart,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:37:32 2015 UTC,Big difference between Cosmos/Rowdies/Sting NASL 1 success and Aztex/Surf/Express etc. Some names have market equity and some just appear to revive failure. NASL must be selective in which brands they revive and which they discard.
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,RealSoccerDon,0,Sat Jun 27 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And the NASL is reusing / re establishing first use in commerce with the Aztecs and the Surf.  EDIT: I'd also add that the collapse of the first NASL was a domino effect. They should've been more frugal by not going after the biggest venues (Anaheim Stadium, LA Coliseum etc) not sell them out, and give the impression of failure for not selling enough tix.   It didn't help NASL 1 that the NFL pulled it's money out either, correct?  That's covered in NASL vs NFL from the early 80s."
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,2,Sat Jun 27 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Aztecs, is that the NASL should be looking at the Austin Aztex as an option..."

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,FutbolFeller,2,Fri Jun 26 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For Xolos to be interested it would have to be a brand extension, which is going to make it feel extremely minor league. A team like this is going to be much more like the MLS 2 sides we are currently seeing than anything else. At least Chivas USA played in an entirely separate market than their parent club."

Bringing in Xolos would be a coup. Again I really believe they are as popular if not more so than the Galaxy. Many of their players are Americans - USMNT players! Having a US affiliate with potential national team players in NASL would be tremendous and it is a market that is blocked off then from MLS. I really like the idea which I why I posted it."

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dietrich14,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:52:07 2015 UTC,But why would the Xolos want anything besides a farm system set up?
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"I woupd surmise for much the same reason that Sao Paulo cbose to renew their partnership with Tampa Bay, and ManU helped NYCFC.....  They may be nearby, but if the majority of us fans are from the south bay, then they can expand their brand with regular exchanges, friendlies, and technical support, and reach the northern SD residents and an entirely different league."
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:21:30 2015 UTC,There is a huge difference between this and a Man City - NYCFC/Sao Paulo - Tampa Bay set up. The fact that the Xolos and a San Diego extension would share the market would result in cannibalization.
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,the_toe_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:35:01 2015 UTC,"By your estimation then, nycfc is merely a farm team for ManCity, or atleast a pasture for aging stars with extended contracts. Tb/Sp on the otherhand is an extensive cooperatve argeement.  This set-up would benefit the xolos long term with a regional partner in a different league.  Of course this doesnt work in an MLS mindset because youre looking at market share and monopolies.  From what I understand most us fans come from the south side of of SD and the National city area.  This is well enough away from downtown and Mission valley that another club could potentially thrive, and draw in supporters umable or unwilling to make the drive, and the hassle of crossing the border.  Cross promotion, matches held on different nights, and a regular friendly derby would benefit both clubs.    Could the Xolos ignore it all.... yes.  But there is a tantalizng upside, and they might not have anything to lose here ether...."
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dannon20,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"No that is not my estimation. New York City is an entirely different market than Manchester, England. In no way is any soccer fan in New York City going to go to less Manchester City games, as a result of New York City FC entering the market. The same cannot be said for the San Diego market should the Xolos set up another team north of the border.   It is an interesting idea. I can see an argument why this could make sense for the Xolos. However, I see major limitations on this truly being equally beneficial to both the NASL and Xolos."
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,JBerger33,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:14 2015 UTC,Why would the Xolos treat a NASL version as anything more than a farm team? This makes no sense.
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,dietrich14,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:58:55 2015 UTC,Playing in Liga MX is one of the things that give Xolos cred.  No way an NASL Xolos has anywhere near the same popularity.
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,gordieloewen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As a result, the NASL version would simply become Xolos II. Which then means they always would play second fiddle to their parent club south of the border in the San Diego market."
NASLSoccer,3b81cn,brianewart,3,Mon Jun 29 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"First time I've heard this idea but I like it! It seems like no one ever talks about Las Vegas! It's in the Pacific time zone, it's metro area has over 2 million, they had the Quicksilvers who averaged 7,000(I think) over a few years in the old NASL! I know there's a lot more than that, but I'm not a commissioner who knows how it'd go now"

Then ok, but short of that im not sure where youre pulling this from. Yes, people have talked about LV!  They tried to position themselves as a candidate for MLS just a few months ago......

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,WorldAbandoned,2,Sat Jun 27 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"Phoenix has a USL team.  Probably not worth launching Valley of the Sun specific #SoccerWarz.  Now, luring them away from USL is a different story.  I'm a little bit of two minds on this, but generally I sort of hope that the pyramid here sorts itself out somewhat organically.  With the top 24-28 markets in D1, the next 20-24 markets D2, the next 20-24 D3, etc.  Of course, you can't measure ""top markets"" just based on metropolitan statistic areas because some are more willing/able to support soccer and MLS already includes as low as the 48th largest metro (Salt Lake City).  But Phoenix is the 12th largest metro area and 6th largest city, and there's no reason to believe that they wouldn't support a team at least as well as, say, Houston.  So hopefully, we see that club higher than 3rd division at some point."

NASLSoccer,3b81cn,JBerger33,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:45:50 2015 UTC,"IMO, NASL should waive expansion fees for any USL club that wants to jump to NASL that meets D2 requirements. That could entice several to move up a level. Of course, any non-compete clauses would need to be worked through."

The fact that there is already so many thriving teams, and new teams with excellent promise, in all three of the pro leagues makes me think that pro/rel would do just fine, regardless of what team ended where. Personally, I think it is going to happen through USL and MLS, where the independent USL teams start out in MLS2 with new MLS expansion teams, while all of the MLS reserves play in MLS3 with no chance of moving up. The hard part of all this is finding out where NASL fits in. In a perfect world everyone would play in the same pyramid and teams like the Rowdies and Cosmos could spend however they want and compete against the top MLS teams, but until NASL joins the single-entity or MLS drops it, I just don't see anyway the two leagues could join together."
NASLSoccer,3b154u,BJ_Fantasy_Podcast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:50:15 2015 UTC,"There is more to this as well, which make the politics more interesting. The MLS and NASL both has Canadian teams. This means that Soccer Canada would probably want to have a say on what happens as they recognize that decisions regarding these two (three if yo count USL) leagues will affect the Canadian soccer pyramid also.   On a separate note, and as a new soccer fan, I think that I rather see an NHL-AHL dynamic for soccer in North American. That is, the Scottish guy is right, it is not part of the sporting culture here (Canada-US) to have pro/reg. Most fans I know MLS is there and also hear names like Beckham and Gerard and then think the league is legit or getting there. In contrast, they know Ottawa has a team and it is cheap to go watch."

If the NASl can get one or two clubs to break through and rival MLS franchises in quality (I'm talking about off the pitch), then this league could begin to improve very quickly.

NASLSoccer,3awm3f,dannon20,5,Wed Jun 24 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"Seems like the Cosmos, Rowdies, Scorpions, and Eleven are the league's best bet to accomplish this feat.

I don't think a soccer complex in Jacksonville is the best decision without a MLS team and with no professional league team lasting a significant amount of time. It's a waste of money at this point and not in the budget. I hope Jacksonville proves that the complex would be profitable though. Jacksonville just hasn't yet proven to have shown a true lasting love for soccer. Give it time, and it'll eventually be economically good for Florida, it's just not at that point yet."

If it were an MLS team, guess how many it would use?  Two.  As for being a ""waste of money"", the entire project costs about $30 million, half of which is coming from private investors, with roughly $5 million coming from the city, and $5 coming from the county.  They would be the primary tenants.  The state would have only contributed $5 million towards this.  Face it - this governor fucking sucks - and he cost the state BILLIONS by turning down the high speed rail money, not to mention setting back actual traffic congestion relief back about 20 years (without an artery, local municipalities won't build light rail).  It would have cost the state absolutely nothing - but he shot it down because, as I previously mentioned, he fucking sucks.

There's a difference between being ruthless and heartless and incompetent. He was elected because FL was in an economic shit storm, with an economy well below the national average thanks to Charlie. Now our economy is well above average, by looking at the employment rate as is a normal factor. The governor elections were in 2002, 2006, 2010, & 2014, from 2008 until 2012, FL was below average."

In fact, Phase 1 would have been completed as of last year, and the rest of the phases would have been well underway.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_High_Speed_Corridor  And your narrative about FL being in an economic shit storm is silly - because the entire country was in a shit storm.  Scott just exploited the fears of every redneck in the state, blamed Obama for EVERYTHING, and ran against a pathetic campaign of Alex Sink.  The fact that you blamed the economy on Charlie Crist is just sad.  In fact, it's scary stupid.  He was only governor for 4 years, but you neglected to mention that current Republican Presidential Candidate Jeb Bush ran the fucking state into the ground for 8 years.  Economic recovery in Florida is well behind the national average, and the fact that the majority of jobs are in hospitality or seasonal reflects this.  Taking credit for the entire national economy recovering (thanks Obama!) is bullshit - because nothing Scott has done spurred any of that recovery.  I will freely admit that I loathe Rick Scott with every fiber of my bleeding liberal heart.  He's a regressive Tea Party asshat who spent his way into the job, and ran against TERRIBLE Democratic opposition (I blame them just as much)."

And I was citing the percent of work force employed.   You really need to stop drinking the koolaid. Jeb wasn't perfect, but he's better than Charlie. Charlie couldn't keep Florida above the the national average in any positive statistic, yet Scott has been working to bring FL back.

NASLSoccer,3atsn1,SCarolinaSoccerNut,4,Tue Jun 23 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"Traffic is the biggest financial backer of the NASL. They propped up the league in its early days and bribed CONCACAF for rights to certain events for the indirect benefit of the NASL by challenging SUM. The NASL is tied into the Traffic scandal and is a big reason for the league trying to distance itself from them. But as we've found out, Traffic exercises a lot more control over the NASL than we previously believed. Getting rid of them is going to require a full-blown buyout, requiring even more financial commitment from teams that, outside of the Cosmos and Rowdies, are not exactly swimming in cash.   The Traffic situation is a serious problem for the NASL. You can try to minimize it all you want, but eventually reality ensues."
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,foxhunter,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:25:30 2015 UTC,But who makes a buyout?  I really can only see one potential buyer for NASL unless the teams come up with the cash on their own that Traffic will take.

NASLSoccer,3atsn1,SCarolinaSoccerNut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:10:17 2015 UTC,"They have little control over North American Soccer League, LLC. as their share in that business has been diluted for every new expansion, but they still own the supermajority of shares in NASL Holdings, LLC. That gives them the right to take the majority of the expansion fee for themselves and holds veto power over the other owners on several key league decisions, including league budget."
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,DarkwingMcQuack,2,Wed Jun 24 11:48:23 2015 UTC,Just go away already.
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,rhayward,0,Tue Jun 23 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but given how Traffic has slowly pulled out of team ownership/involvement, I'm worried that the only reason we are seeing expansion is because Traffic allegedly gets a piece of the pie every time there's a new expansion, and Traffic is putting pressure on the NASL to expand quickly in markets that may not be sustainable, rather than focus on long-term growth. I'm worried that Traffic is just doing this to make a quick buck, and that they have no interest in the league being sustainable. If we are right in saying that the NASL is slowly getting rid of Traffic, then it also stands that there is a possibility that Traffic is just trying to squeeze as much money as possible before their plug gets pulled. I think that even if Traffic pulls completely out, we may not be out of the woods just yet."
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,carrasp,3,Tue Jun 23 14:22:15 2015 UTC,I think that this is more of a wait and see situation...The reason why I'm saying this is because NASL commissioner Bill Peterson has said repeatedly about a month ago that the NASL has now reached a major milestone and that the league will eventually be bringing in high quality investors from both the U.S. and abroad.
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,rhayward,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:49:14 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much my attitude about it. We know nothing of the league's current financial status, and the only thing we can do is speculate, and unfortunately, a lot of the speculation has been negative lately, despite all the cool new stuff we've gotten this year, and 2 new possible expansions (I'm just going to keep saying possible expansions until both teams are actually on the pitch, no need for another OKC or Virginia)."

NASLSoccer,3atsn1,rhayward,-1,Tue Jun 23 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Great, so he has money, doesn't mean he's willing to spend it all on a team in Miami. Not sure what your point is.  If we're going to talk about possible successes, we should also acknowledge our league's failures, especially when it comes to teams that haven't yet played a game on an actual field (Ahem, OKC and Virginia anyone?). We were full throttle on expansions back then and look what happened.  Does it mean that Miami and Puerto Rico will fail? No, not necessarily, but that's exactly the point I was trying to make. For the large majority of the NASL, with very few exceptions, No one but the owners and NASL know how much is being invested in the team, and into the league. We can ballpark it, we can say, based on this article, so and so spent X million, but we don't have concrete numbers, and until Miami and Puerto Rico have a team, stadium and begin playing, I don't think anyone but the NASL or the owners can accurately speculate the health of the teams or the league, and of course, neither of them will say anything bad about their team or league. That's why I say, we don't know if these markets will be sustainable or not, no matter who the owners are, because we don't know how much they are willing to invest, or if they are really that committed. We do know that T All we can do is badly speculate.  The long silence followed by 2 announcements within the space of a month and rumored announcements in Hamilton, Hartford, Chicago and Milwaukee, with LA seemingly DOA, and Bill Peterson's announcement that there would be more expansion announcements this year has me worried that Traffic has a hand in all of this. It all seems very desperate. Again, purely speculation. That's all I was saying."
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,CampaignExpert,-2,Tue Jun 23 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"My point was -    long silence followed by 2 announcements within the space of a month   long silence is great, means they are moving cautiously after moving to fast with VA and OKC.   and rumored announcements in Hamilton, Hartford, Chicago and Milwaukee, with LA seemingly DOA   So in the same sentence you think long silence is bad, then ride the NASL for rumors that have not come to pass.  OK"

NASLSoccer,3atsn1,CampaignExpert,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't write a dissertation on the subject.  But maybe now I will.  I asked if you thought Jacksonville and Indy where bad expansion franchises.  The other 3 are Ottawa, San Antonio and Cosmos.  We have lost only one team as of today, PR Islanders, because they lost the funding that the government was giving them.  It is True that VA and OKC where announced as expansion franchises, they never took that field.  Traffic gave the NASL 4.5 million loan and get 450,000 back for each expansion franchise for first 10 (a zero percent loan).  So as of this point they have gotten back 1/2 of the 4.5 million.  Why wouldn't they push the NASL to get back the money they invested?  Failed league doesn't do them any good they still need to sell one team, RailHawks, and get back the other 1/2 of their loan.  Maybe OKC and VA have paid the fee and they only have 3 left instead of 5, either way they still are owed a lot of money, plus have invested millions into Railhawks.  My point was I wasn't over analyzing your posts, I was saying your posts were stupid and not thought out."
NASLSoccer,3atsn1,rhayward,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"Then say that out right instead of playing games.   Traffic gave the NASL 4.5 million loan and get 450,000 back for each expansion franchise for first 10 (a zero percent loan). So as of this point they have gotten back 1/2 of the 4.5 million.   Let's do the math. 2 Announced+4 rumored = 6 possible new teams. That's one more than Traffic needs to recoup on their investment. Sell the Railhawks, and bam, all that loan money is back in their hands, and it's like nothing happened.  NASL won't fail overnight, nor will the NASL necessarily fail, nor will Traffic sports disappear overnight. I do think we need to stop pretending like everything is fine and dandy and nothing could go wrong.   I was saying your posts where stupid    No, your posts WHERE stupid. Learn to grammar."

I think Peterson has addressed this as seriously as he was able.  The league might not have the cash to force the sale of Traffic's NASL LLC shares, and if it's true that Traffic continues to get a cut of NASL expansion fees, it might not want to sell anyway right now. The league's other owners don't seem to have jumped at the chance to pool their money and buy Traffic's shares, either. There might be a morality clause the league could use to force a sale of either shares or the RailHawks, but Davidson hasn't actually been convicted of anything, so the league could be stuck for years waiting for FIFA legal pieces to fall into place. (And as far as clauses or contract options for the league to end its relationship with Traffic, remember those contracts were likely written by Traffic's lawyers during the creation of the league and NASL LLC.)"

NASLSoccer,3ao3ba,madman1101,11,Mon Jun 22 16:53:09 2015 UTC,NASL is a young league so it bears watching how things go over the next five years.  MLS is an American style sports league with competitive balance.  NASL can offer a European style alternative.    This means incorporating elements that MLS won't like promotion and relegation between a NASL Premier League and a NASL2 when the league gets big enough.    NASL will need to get into more big TV markets to get TV money from whichever sports network isn't aligned with MLS.  It will be fun to see what happens but the competition is likely to make US club soccer better.
NASLSoccer,3ao3ba,oneeyedfool,4,Mon Jun 22 03:45:21 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting time in US history for soccer.  The MLS model, by design, has created a stable foundation for American soccer and kudos to them for landing a good TV deal and continuing to evolve.  The NASL seems to be building steam (as is expansion in the USL).  I dig the idea of NASL experimenting with promotion and relegation within it's own structure and feeding the hunger for it that way (I hadn't thought of that possibility).  It will be interesting to see how the two leagues collide at some point (and momentum seems to be growing exponentially - which could go nuclear over the next few years with Copa America, more premier SSSs being built).  American sports history (NFL-AFL, NHL-WHA, NBA-ABA, NL-AL) would indicate a merger of some type at some point where certain elements and franchises get incorporated into the ""more dominant"" one.  Just speculating, of course, but I think this likely to get more interesting..."

NASLSoccer,3alvne,jmnutt,7,Sun Jun 21 19:54:51 2015 UTC,And completely renovated a recreational field with private money for the benefit of themselves and a local university. Not to mention the millions of private dollars from Bill Edwards invested into Al Lang. Give your club some credit. Every team is in a different situation in their own market.
NASLSoccer,3alvne,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Bill invested in his project, and that's great for a team that has desperately needed it, but do not get all misty eyed about how he's ""helping build soccer"" in St. Pete - he's all about his bottom line.  The money he spent on Al Lang, he expects to recoup at some point.  He runs a tight ship, makes a good profit - which is unheard of in the NASL - and he spends money.  One could argue that he wastes a lot too, and most of his projects are ego driven (like owning a soccer team).  Edwards got his money by being smart in business, if not completely ethical, and just because he bought a soccer team, he suddenly didn't change overnight and had his heart grow three sizes.  He's a businessman, and this is a business.  He's not a soccer fan, and he knows fuckall about the sport, the history of the team, the league, and the culture of soccer.  He knows this will make money, and that's the most important thing.   The bottom line is this:  Bill Edwards is not the Rowdies.  He's the current owner.  There have been many.  There will be more after he is gone.  And if the team doesn't do well, or if he starts to see it's losing money, or maybe he thinks that he can sell it for a significant profit - he will!  Don't give him more credit than he deserves.  Yes, he spent money, and we're thankful for that - but he's got one foot out of this relationship at all times, and he only values fans so much as the team is capable of either stroking his ego or making him money.  If those things stop, he's gone."
NASLSoccer,3alvne,jmnutt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. This sounds really personal from your end so I'm not sure how to respond. I really don't think I was making him out to be a saint at all. I only mentioned him by name because I thought it was important to note it was private money instead of public funds. That means something in this economic climate.   I hold no delusions about Edwards or his motivations. He's an owner, and like 99%of owners he'll look to maximize his investment. Every owner in this league is worthy of criticism, Edwards included. If his strategy helps the team, like I think it has for the most part, I'm happy. If he starts running the team into the ground then I'll have no problem criticizing him more heavily."
NASLSoccer,3alvne,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:35:02 2015 UTC,"There's nothing personal about it at all - it's just that we see a difference in ownership styles throughout the league.  It's one thing to be a business person - which I have absolutely no problem with at all.  It's another to be a micromanager who makes it impossible to coordinate with the team.  EVERYTHING goes through Edwards - from the drink specials at the Den to which merchandise is in the store.  He's on that level of involvement - but again, he knows absolutely nothing about soccer.  He employs very smart people who do, but he overrides them constantly.  So an agreement in principle is only as good as long as the mood suits him.  When I see things like what's happening in Jacksonville, I'm impressed.  It shows a long term commitment to the sport, not just  to the brand."
NASLSoccer,3alvne,jmnutt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"What Jacksonville is doing with this project is great. That's undeniable. They're in a different situation, though, and I think it's crazy to think they don't care about money and the brand first and foremost. Also, I'm not sure I agree that investing millions to renovate a decrepit stadium and secure a professional training field are about the brand.   Criticizing Edwards for micromanaging is totally fine by me. The Den obviously has problems. But for some reason you brought up all the extra stuff about his lack of knowledge on the team's history, that he'll cut & run at the first sign of trouble, or he'll sell if he thinks he can make a profit. On that last point; of course he would. What owner wouldn't?  I say it seems personal because this came out of nowhere after an innocuous comment about investing in infrastructure for the team. It seems like you were looking for a place to vent about Edwards. Maybe I'm naive, but I don't think I'm guilty of deifying the man. At least not anymore than the majority of fans or the Mob.  P.S. Will we be holding a public burning for the ""In Bill We Trust"" banner?"
NASLSoccer,3alvne,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:24:00 2015 UTC,"That's entirely possible.  Maybe it's the insider knowledge of the inner workings or, more appropriately, the lack of workings, that are jading my perception.  There's stories out there, obviously not verified publicly, of how Matt Pickens ended up on the team, what his salary was, how Yamada was treated on his way out, how Ricky Hill was told one thing two days before being a fired in a single sentence press release, and how other groups business dealings have gone with him in the past.  You're probably right that this is not the proper venue, and it may come off as ungrateful for an owner willing to spend the money that previous owners didn't have.  We as fans were absolutely stoked about the prospect of having a new ownership group come in, and save the team.  But the more you learn about this group, the less shiny it becomes.  In fact, some of it is downright dirty, and maybe that knowledge has skewed my opinion.  Do I wish the Rowdies still had Nestor at the helm?  No, absolutely not.  But much like the MNUFC arrangement with MLS, it's a deal with a devil, and my fear is that a few years from now, when this owner bails out (either after having gotten the stadium he wants, or being shut down on it - the more likely scenario) we'll be back where we started.  I think the In Bill We Trust banner was great for the message we were being sold at the time.  I'll hold off on the burning party just yet, but I'm not ruling it out."

Roster additions, organizational stability (people couldn't even get paychecks before him), investment in coaching depth and staff, pre-season trip to Portugal, talk of a joint development program as a pathway to Portugal, a new parking garage (with affordable parking).  And a bar...which extends the Rowdies brand in a growing downtown that he is passionate about and invests in heavily.  Plus we're second on the table.  It's hard to feel bad about that."
NASLSoccer,3alvne,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yup - all very good things - but things you would expect an owner to do.  In the meantime, he's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, ostracized and pissed off a lot of former players and people who were involved in the beginnings of the team, and the old team, and made quite a few enemies along the way.  Which is to be expected in business - and that's it - he's a business guy.  The bottom line is what matters to him, aside from his ego.  Believe me, from personal experience, he's a micromanager all the way down to the ticket booth - but since he knows fuckall about soccer, it's very frustrating to deal with.  He has some good people in place, but he doesn't listen to them - he does what he wants."
NASLSoccer,3alvne,phat7deuce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"He's no doubt a businessman and it's pretty widely reported he was really hands-on in the renovation.  I don't know how much I would criticize things before this season, there were a lot of organizational mechanics that needed triage.  Plus any owner/business leader that jumps into a situation like this wants to make a mark (many times out of ego), so I chalk that up as typical and instinctual.  We'll see down the line if ego or bottom-line gets in-the-way/conflicts with fan experience/results.  For right now, I'm more optimistic than pessimistic."

NASLSoccer,3ainex,madman1101,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"I think doing it small is the bigger issue.  Not to be a dick, but the Strikers limped into the league with a strong name, a weak roster, and a huge stadium that has yet to be filled.  They have no marketing.  They have very little recognition in their own market.  They don't even have a TV deal.  So if they want to live up to the name, they have to be bigger than life - and so would the Sting.  Anything less would be embarrassing.  To be completely honest - that's exactly what the Rowdies of the last 3 or 4 years have been.  The new owner is spending money, but he's got a LONG way to go before he comes close to the legacy that the team has."
NASLSoccer,3ainex,EquinsuOcha,3,Sun Jun 21 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure what your response has to do with my comment. You didn't really answer my question. Maybe I wasn't clear. The Rowdies, Cosmos, & (I guess) Strikers had recognition. People in the market had fondness for those brands. I'm questioning the nostalgia factor for the Sting in Chicago. I would not have even thought to call the name ""iconic."""
NASLSoccer,3ainex,jmnutt,0,Sun Jun 21 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"The Sting were around for 14 years and won two championships during the heyday of the NASL - including one of the most talked about ""shootouts"" ever.  They played at Soldier Field, Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park.  You cannot honestly believe that no one knows who or what they were, especially in soccer circles.  The Fire have obviously not even come close to supplanting them. I'd say iconic is the best way to describe them."
NASLSoccer,3ainex,EquinsuOcha,7,Sun Jun 21 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"I live in Chicago - and have all my life - and you're definitely vastly overestimating how much people care about the Sting, particularly in comparison to the Fire. The Fire look weak now, but they absolutely had their heyday and have maintained a better profile than the Sting managed to after their time in the sun. Playing at those places at some point 30 years ago means nothing - the Fire called Soldier Field their home just 10 years ago, and nobody cares about that; they certainly aren't concerned about where the Sting called home. People know who they were, so in that sense it's a better brand than starting from scratch, but there isn't a vast swarm of Sting fans waiting for their chance to reclaim the name's glory."

I realize those are hallowed venues, but that also makes me think they had trouble finding a home. No global stars that I'm aware of like the Cosmos to offset the transience.   Of course you'll find some people who knew about them. I just get the feeling that sometimes the NASL is leaning on false nostalgia. I'm fine with the Sting name and I think it'll likely be the one they go with, but I certainly don't think it's necessary.  I realize things have gone south for the Fire in the past decade, but they've had a damn good run otherwise. 1 MLS Cup, 1 Supporters Shield, & FOUR US Open Cups. Easily one of the most successful MLS Cups. The Sting and Fire are pretty even in my eyes."

In terms of attendance, Hofstra will hold them back as long as they are there. People from the city won't travel that far for entertainment.  People on Long Island just don't seem to care enough.  It's the best run soccer club in New York and they deserve better.  They aren't going to get it until they are in a stadium that is more convenient for city dwellers to get to."
NASLSoccer,3aii0l,oneeyedfool,3,Sat Jun 20 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the guy giving excuses sigh but we need a bigger sample size to get a real look at the attendance. There were 5 home games, 1st game was great, 2nd game was Coney Island which was a very cold day by the water. The 3rd game was mother's day at 2 pm, never going to be good attendance, and the 4th game was sat before memorial day. I know everyone in the league played, but memorial day weekend in NY everyone is getting over the bad winter and heading to the beach or out of town. The last home game was pretty good (not great) with nearly 8k. That was actually a game where I thought we had more than the announced attendance.  And I don't care if this is an excuse, last year every Sat game but 1 was incredibly shitty weather at game time or just prior and that killed attendance.   I also admit that it's always going to be hard to draw 10k+ on a consistent basis while at Hofstra. It's such a shitty location"

NASLSoccer,3ae79u,carrasp,5,Fri Jun 19 11:57:27 2015 UTC,The play for NASL to make would be to put a Chicago Sting team somewhere within the city limits. The Fire used to get great crowds at Soldier Field and have been somewhat marooned out in Bridgeview—easily the biggest mistake MLS ever made with the 2.0 Soccer specific stadiums.    I'm not a Chicago guy. Are there any real places for a Chicago team to play close to downtown? College or big HS fields?
NASLSoccer,3ae79u,ReeseCommaBill,3,Fri Jun 19 13:17:44 2015 UTC,Short list:   Soldier Field Wrigley Field Northwestern Rockne Stadium Hanson Stadium Stagg Field Concordia Wish Field Lane Tech Winnemac   Every single one is along an L line and within roughly 30 blocks of downtown.
NASLSoccer,3ae79u,EquinsuOcha,2,Fri Jun 19 13:53:01 2015 UTC,"Wish and Wrigley are both easily accessible by and L line. Almost all the rest are not. Ill use The Loop as the starting point as ""downtown"" in this. Wrigley would be great. I have a hard time believing an NASL team would play there for some reason. Wish Field is my favorite to go by on the train. Buildings all around and could be an awesome place to have games. The problem is that there is no room for much expansion. Its blocked in on 3 sides. If they could figure out how to expand it, they could do extremely well, but I find it unlikely. Close to downtown and an easy train ride. Hanson Stadium is not near an L Line train at all, near a Metra line but not near a stop. Concordia is ""near"" the L but still about 12 blocks away from one and a 50ish minute train ride from downtown. Rockne Stadium is near the blue line but a mile away from a train stop, not too bad but not the easiest walk in a rough area. You're never going to get your core demographic to take the L to Stagg Field during the day, let alone a night game. Its in the middle of the South Side, 60ish blocks from downtown. Lane Tech is also not anywhere near an L train. Its only one bus away so its not terrible, total commute is around 30 minutes. Winnemac is in the north burbs and is in the right demographics. Easy commute on the Brown L line but its a bit of a hike to the stadium, around 14 blocks away from the station. I don't think any of these are perfect, but I think Winnemac or Wish Field would be the best. The others I would think twice about before I went to a game there."
NASLSoccer,3ae79u,rsl20,2,Sat Jun 20 03:34:18 2015 UTC,"Hanson Stadium   This stadium seems as one of the best choice for the Sting. It has capacity of 16,000. This is a downtown stadium, correct?"

NASLSoccer,3ae79u,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"It is, and it's renowned for being one of the worst in the state.  The track is useless for anything but practice.  There is currently about $100k set aside for renovations, but it's not enough.  An investor would have to drop a couple million to get it up to spec - which in the grand scheme of things, isn't that hard.  It needs a field house / locker room as well.  Not the ideal situation.  Northwestern University is probably the best facility - but capacity is 40k.  That's going to be a hard sell."
NASLSoccer,3ae79u,niton,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"That is not a downtown stadium by any stretch of the imagination. It is way, way out west in terms of anyone living on the North Side (in terms of the City proper). It's way too far from any L trains (the line near it is the Metra Rail) which is the bare minimum for any successful smaller stadium in Chicago."
NASLSoccer,3ae79u,FutbolFeller,2,Fri Jun 19 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"The Fire at Soldier Field was a hot ticket item in Chicago when I was in college back in the early 00's.  It also helped that they had (what I still consider) to be the best team in MLS History while playing in Soldier Field.  Beasley and Bocanegra were in their prime....Jesse Marsch and Chris Armas were dominating the midfield....Zach Thorton, Justin Mapp, Ante Razov...etc, etc, etc.  That was an MLS team that I truly enjoyed watching.

It needs to have easy access to 18-35 year olds with disposable income living on the north side and a clear connection to the city itself (actually being in it is a good start). Being within 6-8 blocks of the L is also HUGELY important. The volume of traffic a stadium needs cannot be handled by buses alone and the Metra is more expensive. Parking in Chicago will never happen at any reasonable price. Realistically this means sharing a HS or College stadium but the massive amount of bars in any Chicago neighborhood means the lack of tailgating isn't a problem. The lack of concessions revenue will be.  Do all of these things coupled with strong branding + cheap (compared to the Fire) tickets and you will have a successful team."

MvO has made maybe 4 good stops all damn season, Smits comes in his first game and makes at least that many in one match.

I'm on record as saying that the Cosmos would wipe the table with New York City. I thought they'd win easily, 3-1. Instead, they got taken to the limit.   It was a win for the Cosmos. They gutted that sucker out. But they were lucky. New York City were schooling them from about the 24th minute to about the 70th. Gorskie and Mendes were having all kinds of difficulties handling Poku and Mullins down the middle.  Cosmos dodged a bullet there. And if I'm studying film, I know what their weakness is.   EDIT: downvote if you want, but even Shep himself was bemoaning the Cosmos' weakness in the midfield. It's a real thing. They're a better team with Marcos Senna in there. If Senna's playing, there's no way that Poku and Mullins find themselves with the amount of space they had.

I think those quotes are things he had to say.  The NASL is becoming a strong 2nd tier league but IMHO they won't be able to get to an equal level of MLS.   MLS has too much money and TV backing.  Yea, I totally get why him and the Miami guys don't want the MLS ownership structure, but if NASL was really a competitor then teams like Montreal and others wouldn't ""promote themselves"" to MLS.    The NASL needs to be a league of their own.  Like I said earlier in this thread, get 16 solid teams with ownership and have at it.  Look at college basketball.  Not every league has to be the ACC.  The Big East is still just as exciting and their fans are just as satisfied with the quality of the games.  The big thing NASL should try and push is for the US Open Cup to be more prestigious.  Maybe have a HUGE payday to the team that wins (20-30 million) so that is really what the teams shoot for."

Also you can say you don't see the NASL as the minor league, but the American soccer fandom almost unanimously considers the NASL to be this.

I'm not saying we'll be a better first division, or that we'll make it anytime soon, but you're counting out something that hasn't fully developed yet.

NASLSoccer,3a8mru,-kj,3,Thu Jun 18 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"When other lower division sides have moved to MLS, they have to dissolve their club and refound it as a new company in MLS, which tends to include a redesign of the crest and colors. Montreal and Minnesota are unique in that they were allowed to keep their original crest, though I'm not sure why. For example, the Seattle Sounders colors were blue and white (there was no green) in their NASL and USL days.  Even though the United and Impact brands will, or were, remain intact during the transition, I still think MLS has the rights to the actual brands. Unless MLS drastically rewrites how the brands of their teams are operated and maintained, I'm not sure if it's possible for the Cosmos ownership to maintain the amount control of the Cosmos brand they want while existing as a MLS franchise. It's very possible I'm wrong about this, but that's the impression I've gotten from reading about the Cosmos and MLS."

So, theoretically, the Cosmos could do the same, but they'd probably have to grant a unlimited license for the US Market (and maybe more?), which really defeats the purpose of retaining ownership.

In comparison to mls, the NASL has a very modest entrance fee, and a few structural requirements to avoid mismanagement.  You build it, you keep it. This is important for any team with global aspirations. Although rbny stadium is convienent for you, the bulls also settled for a lousy location by no fault of their own.  Building in NYC is difficult, but you are already seeing a huge draw towards the Nycfc by virtue of their location in NY proper.  But they too are having difficulties finding a new location within the city, and rumored to have tried to sabotage the Cosmos' plans to keep them from building first.  Point is, it just isnt where the Cosmos want to be.  They dont want to be in rbny's stadium, and they dont want to be in mls.  Thats ok.....  they have enough money to build the best sss in the country, theyve helped stabilize a second independent soccer league in the US, and they can still compete with mls teams.  This is fantastic!  Fantastic for the fans, and fantastic for USsoccer itself!"

Everything they've done points to them remaining and trying to dominate in the NASL."
NASLSoccer,3a8mru,dietrich14,-8,Thu Jun 18 03:55:22 2015 UTC,Cosmos win over NYCFC is the equivalent of Ohio St beating the Cleveland Browns
NASLSoccer,3a8mru,dietrich14,2,Thu Jun 18 03:31:13 2015 UTC,i wouldn't go that far. NYCFC and the Cosmos are both professional teams. Ohio State is an amateur team. A more appropriate examply would be say NIU beating Northwestern. Best of a low level conference beating the worst of the top level conference.
NASLSoccer,3a8su6,theasfldotcom,2,Thu Jun 18 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"The Cosmos have officially been paired with NYRB, Philadelphia & DC. The draw tomorrow is to determine who plays who from the round of 16 to the semifinals and where they play."
NASLSoccer,3a8su6,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:36:59 2015 UTC,The Cosmos will know their four geographic partners tonight before finding out their official Round of 16 matchup and the potential quarterfinal and semifinal matchups tomorrow. Home and away will also be determined tomorrow.    They're virtually guaranteed to be paired with NYRB and Philadelphia. I'd give DC a 90% chance of being that fourth team with Columbus getting 10%. Hopefully they get to play NYRB either in the Round of 16 or the Quarterfinals.

I'm hoping to finish up CFL Pickem in the same fashion as NASL Pickem, for those Ottawa and Edmonton fans out there, by the end of the weekend.    Three of the top five in the standings are regulars on the website with multiple seasons of Premier League Pickem experience under their belt. You should be quite proud of your sixth place finish for the Spring.    There's still two-thirds of the season left with the Fall remaining. Hopefully more join for that run. To anyone that was turned off before, I'm in the process of removing the ads from the game (and finding a better ad network, though at a reduced frequency)."

NASLSoccer,3a2c1k,Nole_Train,2,Tue Jun 16 18:24:14 2015 UTC,A large motivating factor in the new kits was Nike. At the time they introduced the first kits Nike was unable to fully customize them the way the team had originally wanted (what you see now). Add in the fact that the kits they wore in the spring are no longer even being manufactured they decided to go with this change now so they could continue offering them to fans.   Personally I like the new look and those with the spring kit can now say they have a collectors item or throwback haha.

I am not educated on how other country's cup competition is structured, but USOC setup seems anti- competitive.  There is something UnAmerican where yes you can startup a soccer team like any other small business, but your growth potential is artificially capped. Unless you have $100 mil to buy into a cartel.  Most U.S. Team v. An International team means $$$. I don't get how we must artificially limit this revenue potential to MLS teams. Communist much?"
NASLSoccer,3a2pnw,rhayward,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:18:39 2015 UTC,"I am not educated on how other country's cup competition is structured   Perhaps you might want to educate yourself on cup competitions. This is how most countries do their cups. They have tiers, if a team passes the tier they go on to play against bigger teams. The only difference in the US is that any amateur or professional team can sign up, whereas cups in other countries are typically tiered by division and capped off at Division 3.   U.S. Team v. An International team means $$$   I don't think it's as much money as you'd think. Most teams we would probably be playing would be in similar financial and attendance situations as NASL. Once in a while, you might get big teams from Argentina, Mexico or Brazil, but average attendance in those is similar to MLS(~21,321 - 21,233 - 16,931 respectively vs MLS 19,149 (Source )), so you're adding the financial burden of taking your whole team there for probably less money than an MLS game and more travel time, all for what?  When you have teams like Edmonton who are complaining about having to take 2 11-hour flights to Puerto Rico every year, do you really want to impose the same kinds of financial burdens, not to mention player fatigue on every team in the NASL?  Also, we can't even beat the teams that are reserve teams for the teams that are reaching the finals of the CCL once every 6-7 years and then end up getting their asses kicked, what does that tell you?"

Oh and Silva himself also says nothing about rivaling the CONCACAF CL or really provide any details at all except that he wants to put together a tournament with clubs from all across the Americas. The article itself only mentions the Copa Libertadores. This might just be another International Champions Cup type money grab tournament.  And finally: NASL has a path into the CONCACAF CL.

My two takeaways from this article: 1) Even though it's been a rocky month amidst Traffic and the FIFA scandal, owners with deep pockets are excited about the structure of our league.  He seemed to bat away the notion of the NASL as truck stop on the way to the NASL. 2) Even if Miami FC isn't hugely successful itself, these guys (through money or hubris, or both) look to be able and willing to build exposure for and market the shit out of the league - which could help us all"

NASLSoccer,3a1bas,Steasy66,3,Tue Jun 16 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know how the league got 18% for the increase in attendance from spring last year to this year.   This was my calculation:   spring 2014 = 237,010  spring 2015 = 358,291  From all the sources I found, this is the equation for % increase:  ((y2 - y1) / y1)*100 = your percentage change.  So...  ((358291-237010)/237010)*100 = 51.17% increase from spring '14 to spring '15..  Am I doing something wrong? Where did 18% come from?"
NASLSoccer,3a1bas,Kibbby,4,Tue Jun 16 13:28:20 2015 UTC,"51.17% is the total number.

NASLSoccer,3a1kb4,brianewart,0,Wed Jun 17 05:13:43 2015 UTC,"MLS can't kick out an ownership either willy nilly either. You'll remember they had to buy out Jorge Vergara for $75 million to take over Chivas USA. It's also very common in American business partnerships where an owner's stock may be taken from them if that owner misbehaves or the others simply want him out (look up stock dilution).  The MLS system isn't as different from the NASL setup as you think. The only difference is in the NASL the owners own the clubs which then own the league while in MLS the owners own the league which then owns the clubs. In the end the owners run the league and their clubs just as NASL owners do. The MLS setup simply makes it easier for owners to share revenues and costs so as to ensure that owners can still be profitable even if not all the teams are and keeps the teams on level footing. The NASL system makes it difficult to create any sharing of revenue and creates a two-tiered league in which the teams that are financially stable (Cosmos, Tampa Bay) run the show and the financially struggling teams (Atlanta, FTL) are left to basically fend for themselves. Long story short, MLS runs like the NFL, the NASL runs like an NCAA conference.  It's also worth noting that MLS doesn't have one ownership group that has veto power over the other owners and gets a special deal for the expansion fees. If the Traffic Sports situation has shown anything it's that the NASL is a lot closer to a single-entity than the league and its fans would like to admit. It's just that rather than ownership of the central league being shared equally by all the ownership groups like in MLS, the NASL is set up so that one ownership group has dominant control of the league."
NASLSoccer,3a1kb4,SCarolinaSoccerNut,0,Wed Jun 17 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"It's actually still pretty easy to share revenue in the NASL's system, which is like pretty much every major sporting league in American pro-sports (and college sports) except the MLS -- all of whom have some degree of revenue-sharing.  Traffic doesn't have veto power over the other owners absolutely. It's a very limited veto on certain matters -- and according to Kartik, their interest and power to do that is diluted everytime an expansion fee is paid in (which may be why we're expecting a few more teams in the near future)."

MLS will be in Minnesota within the next 2-4 years, and I'm not rooting for anything to keep United from moving up.    Their stadium and team plans are far better for the sport in the area than throwing them in the Wilfs' new stadium and that also makes their move up best for the sport in this country."

At this point, as long as MNUFC keeps playing soccer, I'm ok with just about anything that makes all this off the field crap go away."

NASLSoccer,39z9cs,phat7deuce,2,Tue Jun 16 03:40:31 2015 UTC,Funding is not the issue.  The team's ownership has already committed to build the stadium privately and the ownership group is more than capable of delivering.

It's because the Warios think that if MNUFC loses their bid, then their bid becomes the more viable one - and they get the expansion - effectively killing off the NASL team.  Then they play on astroturf in the Sandcrawler, and all it took is some obfuscating and backroom deals, and they're in.  Conversely, if MNUFC decides to push through, they'll just have to pay out the ass for the land / development, and it's a giant middle finger from the Warios for competing against them.  Fucking evil."

I don't know about that, United is very well supported for an NASL team and their ownership has the money to maintain a good team. Even if they lose half their attendance to Wilf FC they're still okay.

Attendance is up, for the US teams particularly – quality adds like Jacksonville have bolstered that.  The brand seems to be faring better – TV exposure with the ESPN3 deal is an improvement.  Better ownership (particularly it seems here in Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale) that are investing in teams and fan experience.  Plus don't underestimate the new ownership groups impact to the overall NASL brand.  It's good from an exposure perspective - I'd bet a lot more people googled NASL the last couple of weeks because they saw ""Carmelo Anthony"" and ""Paolo Maldini"" in the headlines.  Plus the other owner in Miami, Silva, is a media mogul in the sport - I wouldn't underestimate the prospect of negotiating some League TV rights deals in the coming year - even if just internationally.  I think we'd all like to see expansion westward, but I think these teams (with their ownership) plus some smart adds in markets where there is a better groundswell of support might be a good recipe for success in total..."

The type of ownership that has bought in recently is a game changer and will only continue to trend that way moving forward.  Sit back and enjoy it."
NASLSoccer,39wwq6,FutbolFeller,6,Mon Jun 15 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"I share your concerns about Miami, particularly with the short lead time they've left themselves. As far as on-field/team ops goes, they have very little margin for error if they're serious about starting next season. Off the field, in terms of marketing and building a FO, we'll find out a lot in a big hurry about how serious the ownership group is. Money talks.    As for PR, I don't think painting the Islanders as a complete failure is quite accurate. The Islanders lasted nine years, during which they were mostly funded by the PR Board of Tourism, a government agency. The economic downturn hit the island hard. Puerto Rico's government and finances, were and are a mess and axing a seven-figure-per-year ""soccer team"" line item was probably an easy decision. The country's >12% unemployment certainly does Carmelo no favors, but with a stadium already in place, at least he won't need to worry about too much bureaucratic red tape, and with his high profile and existing endorsements, he may be able to offset the ""expense"" of keeping tickets affordable by leveraging his own connections and image. The large Puerto Rican diaspora in NY won't hurt, either.    The Islanders also played most of their final season at a local park where they couldn't charge admission while JRL stadium was renovated into a soccer-specific layout. Not only did that cost them income at a time when they needed it most, but it caused them to lose out on the bums' rush (and paid admission) a new stadium can provide."
NASLSoccer,39wwq6,alxhooter,4,Mon Jun 15 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"PR failed in part because it was (and i'm going from memory here, so someone can correct me) partially subsidized by the PR gov. The economic downturn and politics shift meant they were cut off."
NASLSoccer,39wwq6,mnnicefc,3,Mon Jun 15 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"The big thing to consider with the PR market is that you cannot just build a team there, but you have to build practice facilities, housing for players, and the infrastructure around the stadium (which was recently renovated).  That means that you're not just investing in buying a team, but really, a fanbase and a neighborhood.  If Mello is able to do that, the amount of loyalty that he will generate is astronomical.  Additionally, there are enough Puerto Rican people in the US that will come out of the woodwork, or even switch loyalties if it means they can see ""their"" team - especially in New York.  I think you're looking at PR as just another market, and in reality, it's going to be its own economic microcosm.  Besides, Carmello makes more money in endorsements a year, than most NASL teams have for an operational budget, over the course of their entire existence."
NASLSoccer,39wwq6,EquinsuOcha,3,Mon Jun 15 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't called PR a ""failed market"" necessarily; it was definitely an ownership that was in over their heads.  The Islanders drew pretty well overall."

In 2010 they played the whole season at Lockhart. Attendance sucked at both locations. The rebranded to the Strikers and attendance shot up considerably, which makes sense, since what they had in 2010 was the equivalent to a Washington, DC-based team being named after Baltimore."

Much of this increase, but not all, is due to the addition of Jacksonville. If they were removed, the NASL's spring season average would have been 5,626, or 280 fans per game above last year's average.   The addition of Jacksonville meant an additional 10 spring games league-wide. So an additional 117,688 fans attended NASL spring season games in 2015 over 2014. Total attendance was 358,270.   If the league kept up this pace in the fall, it would total 1,074,810 fans in attendance, the first time a D2 league has broken the million mark. The current record for a D2 league is 994,559, set by the A-league in 1999 (largely because it had 28 teams)."

NASLSoccer,39tard,dannon20,3,Mon Jun 15 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"Jacksonville's drop in week 10 was attributed to a few things - it was a Sunday match and most people here in Jacksonville go to church, are getting ready for the week ahead, etc, and the fact it was sunny and 94 degrees with reported temps on the pitch of 101 degrees. Only about 40% of the stadium is covered in shade, and I know out in Section 904 we were dead center in the middle of the sun and on the verge of heat exhaustion. But all-in-all, that's not a bad attendance for a Sunday 4pm match for us"
NASLSoccer,39tard,Doge_9o4,2,Sun Jun 14 16:10:11 2015 UTC,You guys are going to have the highest fan death toll in the league by the end of the season. 94 and sunny isn't even unusually warm in July for Jacksonville.  And I was thinking the Sunday part was a likely factor.
NASLSoccer,39tard,Doge_9o4,2,Sun Jun 14 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well the rest of our home matches are Saturday or Wednesday night matches except the last match is a Sunday, but in November where the temps will be respectable. But I do think Jax's attendance will dip once football season starts, mainly b/c people will go watch the Florida Gators, FSU Seminoles, and other teams, plus the 2 Wednesday night matches are during the week. But I still think we will at least sell 75% during football season"

NASLSoccer,39tard,EquinsuOcha,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"REQUEST:  Can we add an additional column for percentage of capacity?  I mean, the Al Lang can only hold 8000 people, so 5000 may not seem like a lot, but that's 2/3rds full.  Conversely, Lockhart can hold 20,000, but average less than 1/3rd full.  I think it makes a big difference as far as gauging fan interest."
NASLSoccer,39tard,EquinsuOcha,4,Sun Jun 14 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"I have that on my spreadsheet, but I think it's only relevant in the case sellouts. Jacksonville selling 16,000 in a 60,000 stadium is more impressive than selling 8,000 in an 8,500 stadium. Basically, the capacity is only relevant if it prevents crowds from getting bigger. More important is market size. Selling 5,000 in Edmonton is more impressive than New York."
NASLSoccer,39tard,EquinsuOcha,2,Sun Jun 14 23:42:09 2015 UTC,It should definitely weigh in the metric. Indy sells out almost every game and hits capacity. Other places struggle to fill a stadium half their size. The winningest team in the league is still middle of the pack when it comes attendance.
NASLSoccer,39tard,madman1101,3,Mon Jun 15 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"My point is that a couple of teams regularly play in stadiums that max out over 20,000. They could have 50% sales and be the best supported team in the league. Unless you're maxing out, your percent of stadium is irrevelant except for how well planned your stadium was for your purpose. At this level of pro sports, percent of the stadium full is pointless.  I think my percent of metro area population stat is actually much more indicative of a team's support."
NASLSoccer,39tard,madman1101,0,Mon Jun 15 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"I realize that it may appear that way, but the percentage makes a difference, simply because we know that teams will give away a shitload of tickets (as in the case of Armada in the Jags stadium) to give the appearance of a strong following.  I'm not trying to pick on the Jax here, but it's like the Olympikos / MNUFC double header match in Minnesota last year - cherry picking numbers.  To me, the percentage shows trending and the ability of the team to maintain a strong presence in the market.  Numbers are meaningless without perspective.  As you've already shown, a lot of the numbers so far are skewed by one or two big matches, and conversely, one or two poorly attended ones.  The latter will become more of a factor as we go into Fall season, and start seeing some more of those dreaded Wednesday matches.  I know where you're coming from, and I don't disagree with your reasoning behind not wanting to include the percentages or variables, but attendance is not something a growing league should pin their ambitions on - because they're not consistent indicators of fan interest."

NASLSoccer,39s215,EquinsuOcha,7,Sun Jun 14 05:43:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's too soon for Chicago. That movement is really just beginning as is Milwaukee.   Hartford is the one that is a lock, to start in 2017.    Hamilton is in question due to the potential of joining the impending CFL soccer league reported by Duane Rollins.    One of the reporters on the Cuba trip told me OKCFC is still very close to happening.  Not sure why NASL would bother though.  I spoke briefly with Bill Peterson on the Cuba trip and asked about California expansion.  He said they were getting close.  Could be something there.  Detroit City FC stated several months back that they want to be in NASL (ideally) or USL Pro by 2016.  I could see them joining in Fall 2016 with Puerto Rico.    This would give NASL 12 teams for the Spring season and 14 teams for the Fall.  Then if Hamilton joins for 2017 alongside Hartford, they will make 16 teams still keeping the league at 75% US-based teams.  If two of OKC/California/whoever else materialize that gets to the 18 teams number Peterson has touted."
NASLSoccer,39s215,oneeyedfool,2,Sun Jun 14 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"Quite shocked regarding the OKC comment. I'm skeptical, but this could be the mysterious ""Midwest market"" that we keep hearing being referred to."

NASLSoccer,39s215,oneeyedfool,2,Mon Jun 15 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"I had forgotten about Detroit City, but I think that had more to do with their ownership group not meeting the financial criteria.

NASLSoccer,39s215,EquinsuOcha,2,Mon Jun 15 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"Sued out of it? The case was dropped before the 2010 USSF-run season.  IIRC, Rob Clark was part of TOA, then flip-flopped toward the end of the 2010 USSF D2 season and rejoined USL because it was (other than LA Blues) an East Coast league that could save the Rhinos on travel costs when the shadow of near financial ruin still hung over the club. The NASL ownerships have changed quite a bit since then, but I'm not sure Rob Clark would be welcomed back at the table unless he came through the doggy door with his tail between his legs."
NASLSoccer,39s215,alxhooter,2,Mon Jun 15 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"By my math, the only teams owners still around in the NASL from when the Rhinos left are Fath in Edmonton and Traffic in Carolina(and they are on the way out one way or the other probably). The major stakeholders from back then are all gone for the most part, doubt there would be any beef on the NASL side stopping the Rhinos from getting back in. I'd take a solid mid-sized market with a 20+ year old team and a great stadium all day if I were the NASL."
NASLSoccer,39s215,HailAnts,2,Mon Jun 15 18:35:44 2015 UTC,I'd take them. I just wouldn't prioritize snagging anyone from USL because I don't see it happening.
NASLSoccer,39s215,alxhooter,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the basis of that case was that the Rhinos had already agreed to be in the USL for the 2010 season, and when they tried to join the NASL, they were contractually obligated to do so.    Granted NASL leadership has changed completely since then, so there shouldn't be any bad blood.  It's literally a different league now."

USSF standards say that no pro league with USSF sanctioning can have more than 25% of its teams located outside the USSF boundaries.  Chicago and LA are pipe dreams. No owner's gonna start up a minor league team in a city with an existing MLS club. San Fran's a tough sell considering the travel. Think FC Edmonton and you quickly get the picture.  Hartford is the most likely candidate. Perfect NASL market, too. I would also like to see the NASL do something to get Milwaukee and Detroit on board."

NASLSoccer,39s215,dietrich14,7,Sun Jun 14 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"While they certainly aren't guaranteed to be successful, Chicago and LA are far from pipe dreams. Both are massive towns with plenty of room for multiple clubs, and both have been rumored to have some sort of investors."
NASLSoccer,39s215,TheChosenJuan99,-7,Sun Jun 14 13:29:15 2015 UTC,"That's about it, though. Rumors. No real fan movement, no real collection of investors, no real talk about stadium options. The LA area already has 3 pro clubs, one of which is the most famous and successful club in US soccer history (sorry Cosmos), with one more coming in with a monstrous ownership group and a fantastic stadium site. The Chicago Sting are a very distant memory. Type in Chicago Sting into a Google search you'll get references to a team long forgotten. Search the same thing on Google News and you'll get nothing about the NASL or even soccer. Just a hodgepodge of random articles that happen to have the words ""Chicago"" and ""Sting"" in them.  With so many open markets ripe for the taking, I don't understand this obsession with MLS markets among NASL fans and leaders. Why take the risk on a market where there'll be stiff competition with a team that can outspend you by millions to bring in much bigger names in the soccer world when there are plenty of markets that are wide-open? With the league on the verge of losing their single biggest financial backer, the NASL shouldn't be taking needless risks on markets where the chances of success are slim. There are better options for the league so why not take them?"
NASLSoccer,39s215,SCarolinaSoccerNut,3,Sun Jun 14 14:12:45 2015 UTC,"By your logic; since the NASL is not a single entity league, but one made up of largely independent organizations, then individual owners are the ones assuming the vast majority of risk.  Any risks the league assumes are lessened by its membership and investment standards.    An alternative league with less resources yes.  A minor league consists of farm teams, and I'm sure you can do the same math everyone else has already done. Stop with the constant fLame war. Nobody really gives a shit and im done with/ignoring it.

It makes sense that some clubs joined a particular country's FA before their own domestic FA was ever even formed then stayed there even when a new one was created in their home country. Puerto Rico, on the other hand, had its own FA long before PRFC ever arrived. It will operate in a jurisdiction well outside the USSF's borders and thus cannot count as a USSF team. It's for that reason that PRFC will qualify for the Champions League via the CFU Club Championship and not the US Open Cup."
NASLSoccer,39s215,SCarolinaSoccerNut,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:13:53 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_association_football_clubs_playing_in_the_league_of_another_country  I don't think the borders of Lichtenstein and Switzerland have changed much. Monaco has had a pretty consistent border for over 150 years... etc. etc. etc.   Also, Gretna was founded in 1946, that's 83 years after the English FA that they left, and 73 years after the Scottish FA that they joined in 2002. It doesn't have anything to do with timing either. In fact, it doesn't have to conform to national boundaries at all, unless USSF puts an arbitrary restriction on it (that they'd surely waive if Don Garber asked them to).  Most of these teams play across borders for two reasons: (1) Convenience, or (2) Competitive level.  For Puerto Rico, it's a little of both, and something very similar to Lichtenstein's situation: they're too small to have a robust competitive league on their own.  Back on point: if there's any restriction on non-USSF regions, it isn't a FIFA rule, it's a USSF rule."

Just play a simple 30 game season and award a championship at the end. It's best to reward teams for performing well for an entire season's worth of a grueling schedule, not favor teams that have fast starts and strong finishes. Besides if you're going to have a split season, make the parts the same length. In the current format the spring season is 10 games and the fall is 20. This makes winning the spring championship arguably easier than the fall one. Split the season into 3 ten-game splits if you're going to do the split season format (spring, summer, fall), with the 3 ""champions"" and the best performing team of the entire year in the final playoffs."

NASLSoccer,39mwba,carrasp,5,Fri Jun 12 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"The point of the league operating the team was to not concede the market to MLS. I think if financially possible, NASL will give it at least one more season in Atlanta. Moving the club is in perception terms surrendering a market to the other league."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,3,Sat Jun 13 16:24:14 2015 UTC,"But the question is is it even financially possible. From what I understand, the club is operating on a skeleton crew in the FO and has one of the lowest roster payrolls in the league and yet is still hemoragging. Considering that the league is on the verge of losing one of its biggest finanial backers, can it really afford to continue to support bad financial investments even if giving up on it would constitute a PR black eye?"
NASLSoccer,39mwba,SCarolinaSoccerNut,5,Sat Jun 13 21:01:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see the point in the team continuing after 2015, Terminus Legion are a cool group but honestly as soon as the MLS team comes along all those fans are going to put their weight behind it, so maybe they could play one more year but I think it would make more sense for those involved and the NASL to look at moving the team, perhaps within Georgia or close by, it's not going to survive once the MLS team starts and it's not in NASL's interest to have another team playing in the shadow of an MLS team. Perhaps they could take what is there after 2015 and merge it with an existing NPSL or PDL team and bump it to the NASL."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,bloodyshambles,5,Fri Jun 12 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"If the league is going to keep running the team, then they should move it to Kezar Stadium in San Francisco and try to find a local investor there.

NASLSoccer,39mwba,SCarolinaSoccerNut,-3,Mon Jun 15 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the notion that the Fire have failed to tap into the Chicago market. During the days of Quatemoc Blanco Toyota Park was rocking every week. Poor on-field performance has helped deteriorate attendance since then but it's starting to pick back up. The team's averaging just over 16K this year. It's not fantastic, but that's still pretty good considering how the team has played this year. According to Forbes the team is actually performing above the MLS average financially, earning more revenue than RSL, Vancouver, or Philadelphia. You also have to remember that, unlike any potential Chicago NASL team, the Fire are on TV. Just because the fans aren't in the stadium doesn't mean they aren't watching on TV and are just as emotionally invested as someone in the stands. So a potential Chicago Sting would have to convince fans to leave the Fire, a premier division team that you can watch in your own home, for a minor league team whose only avenue of watching at home is online streaming, which hasn't really taken off as a medium of watching live coverage of sports and earns zero revenue for the team.  The only other pro-soccer team that could potentially compete with the Fire is a second MLS team in northern Chicago while the Fire take southern Chicago, which has absolutely no chance of actually happening. An NASL team would get drowned out very quickly."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,bloodyshambles,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"What is it you don't understand, Chicago Fire choose to play in the ass end of nowhere, the play in Bridgeview. there is a huge population in Chicago proper that would attend a Chicago Sting game. Putting a team in the best place is not playing in the shadow of team who picked a bad location for a stadium."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,SCarolinaSoccerNut,-1,Sun Jun 14 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"What you don't understand is that because of TV the stadium could be in Springfield and the team would still be by far the most popular soccer team in Chicago. So long as the Sting are not on TV and the Fire are, stadium location is meaningless. You might as well try to put a UFL or XFL team in San Francisco just because the stadium is in Santa Clara."

NASLSoccer,39mwba,Nickp1991,3,Sat Jun 13 02:56:23 2015 UTC,“The NASL’s primary focus is finding new ownership that would continue operating the team here in Atlanta
NASLSoccer,39mwba,oneeyedfool,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"If no local buyer is found soon, the league says it will entertain offers to move the team out of Atlanta. “If we can’t find local ownership, ” Bill Peterson, NASL Commissioner and interim Board Chair, said on a recent podcast, “the next step would be to look at relocation of the team to another group that’s interested in being in the league"
NASLSoccer,39mwba,EquinsuOcha,4,Sun Jun 14 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"The language in there is pretty obvious.  The team will function as normal and the league will try and find a local investor to run it in Atlanta.  IF and that's the big IF, they cannot find a local investor to keep the team there, they'll move it / look elsewhere.  So there's nothing saying the league won't continue to run it in say, San Francisco, or LA, or where ever.  The Silverbacks as we know them, are pretty much done at the end of the year.  But they'll be back around.  The league isn't going to fold a team again.  They can't afford the bad press."

NASLSoccer,39mwba,MGHeinz,-2,Fri Jun 12 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, remember when MLS killed an American soccer club older than MLS itself because money?"
NASLSoccer,39mwba,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,2,Sat Jun 13 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"It's debatable. Silverbacks are technically older (1995) but did take a two-year hiatus (2009 and 2010) so in real terms have played one less season than MLS. This having been said, your point is well-taken. MLS should ALWAYS take the Orlando/Minnesota/Portland approach to expansion and NOT put in new clubs to compete or drive out of business existing ones. I agree with that."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,SCarolinaSoccerNut,3,Sat Jun 13 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"It's not MLS who started this ""war"" between the leagues. The NASL were the ones that backed out of a partnership and decided to challenge MLS' ownership of the American premier division market. If the NASL treats MLS like a competitor, MLS has every right to return the favor and directly compete with the NASL. The NASL decided to fight a war it couldn't win and now is paying for it.  This is also why I think the Chicago Sting ressurection attempts and the Miami expansions are both really bad ideas. MLS has the money, prestige, and connections with USSF (the NASL are the only pro-league in the US without representation on the USSF board of directors) to drive NASL into oblivion. This league needs to be smart about its markets and carve its own niche in the US soccer landscape. Directly competing with MLS then being surprised that NASL teams are being killed off by MLS expansion is like poking a bear in the eye then being shocked that it mauls the offender. There is plenty of room in the US for the NASL to expand and be successful, markets like Milwaukee, Cleveland, Buffalo, Santa Fe, Vegas, Boise, Omaha. I don't understand what the league is trying to accomplish by fighting this battle with MLS."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,Kartik_Krishnaiyer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that Miami and Chicago are terrible ideas. NASL needs to focus on second-tier markets like the ones you mentioned. Omaha is a GREAT idea as is a place like Albuquerque. Lots of markets to fill in the map.   However, I do have a problem with MLS displacing clubs that grew organically. They did the right thing in Orlando, Minnesota, Portland, Montreal etc but in Atlanta they are doing the WRONG thing. Work with the existing pro club to create an opportunity for that club to find more investors and move up to MLS."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,SCarolinaSoccerNut,0,Sat Jun 13 20:42:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that a promotion of the Silverbacks probably would have worked better. We certainly wouldn't have the AU-TL feud if that were the case. But the 'Backs didn't want to play ball and MLS isn't going to give up a market as huge and lucrative as Atlanta when it can easily waltz in and just take it. It's not ideal, but considering how many season ticket deposits the new team has sold I don't think anyone can argue that it's hurting the team's appeal in the Atlanta market."
NASLSoccer,39mwba,EquinsuOcha,2,Sat Jun 13 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"Backing out of a partnership is very different from being MLS's development league - which is what USL is now.

NASLSoccer,39l49a,unfunnyryan,5,Fri Jun 12 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you wouldn't dream of traveling this far without including more than one game on the schedule. They could include games in MIA & SJU or TPA & JAX which are all pretty much in the same travel time/distance region (8-13hrs) from Edmonton. So if you plan on joining the team on travel, take a week or more to hang out in the region. It's all about the scheduling..."
NASLSoccer,39l49a,rafijoe,4,Fri Jun 12 15:16:32 2015 UTC,That would be a great way for them to open the season and close the season - simply because the weather is fucking evil around that time.

But I also looked at it the other way, Edmonton some seasons may only have to do that once, maybe twice, but Puerto Rico are going to have to make 15 or 16 trips to the mainland in a year, are thy going to be able to support that and why did they drop out in the first place? Their last home game in NASL had an attendance of 1375, the game before was 2000. The stadium holds 12,500. Will they fill it for every game under new ownership. The big question is how much money is Carmelo willing to just throw away for the first year or two?"

NASLSoccer,39l49a,SCarolinaSoccerNut,0,Mon Jun 15 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"While USSF sanctioning gets all the attention, this is another major reason the NASL needs to go west. Edmonton is hanging by a thread financially. Adding Puerto Rico puts a major cost for the team."
NASLSoccer,39l49a,rafijoe,3,Fri Jun 12 15:55:33 2015 UTC,If the scheduling works it can be the opposite. They just have to stick around the southeast a bit more and pack more games in a trip. It is obvious that NASL needs to expand west sooner than later but the reality today is that bigger financial issues might be faced by the rest of the teams traveling to Edmonton since their closest one is Minnesota.
NASLSoccer,39l49a,SCarolinaSoccerNut,2,Fri Jun 12 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"Right now the closest team is minnesota, but once they leave the next closest is Indianapolis, over 1500 miles away. There are 12 USL teams closer to Edmonton than that."
NASLSoccer,39il8r,The_Puntastic_Voyage,4,Thu Jun 11 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"With the stadium being demolished, and a full rebuild, they wouldn't join until 2017. The more lead time on anything official would be great, but not necessary. We're 18 months out, at this point, I'd either expect early July or nothing until November/December. The recent trademark gave a glimpse that something is real, although we don't know details on any behind the scenes stuff. A FO is getting the wheels turning, it'll be interesting to see which direction.. but NASL 2017 looks likely.  Note: I highly doubt that the NASL or FO expects anyone to closely monitor the US Patent and Trademark office, it was lucky that one of our staff members at Recklesschallenge.net was looking into something else, only to discover that that was filed."

I think there are more potential options, too.  Providence - the PawSox are moving into a new stadium and the old one could be claimed by a NASL team  Boston - the Revs are south of the city, you could put a team in the city or north of it.  Big market, plenty of room for NASL to counter program.  Use Boston in the name as well to differentiate from the New England Revs. Perhaps the Boston Marksmen as an honor to the Fall River Marksmen.  Philadelphia - Chester is south of the city, you could put a team in the city or the northern suburbs like King of Prussia, Conshohocken, etc and go for a different part of the market or...  Wilmington - Delaware... Meets 750k by being part of the Philly   Lehigh Valley - a Bethlehem Steel FC revival?  The AAA IronPigs consistently draw among the best in MILB.  Market meets D2 standards and is growing  Newark - if someone is ballsy enough to take Red Bull on directly there is the old Newark Bears stadium.  Maybe if they can get their hands on the MetroStars name...  Northern Virginia - Cavalry are dead but someone else could try   Virginia Beach - we are getting kind of far now but this is a good market  Buffalo, Albany and Syracuse  - again a bit far but solid markets in western NY state"

NASLSoccer,39il8r,ReeseCommaBill,2,Fri Jun 12 11:23:06 2015 UTC,Or the Planks from Baltimore.  They own Under Armour.  Give them the league apparel rights and they may put a team out there.  the Baltimore Development Corporation wants another pro team in the city.  They aren't getting the NBA/NHL but the NASL may be perfect.

From Wikipedia:  The North American Soccer League operates as a group of independent club owners as opposed to the single-entity structure of Major League Soccer. Each club is a shareholder in the league, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The league requires that each club has a lead shareholder that holds at least 35% ownership in the club and is worth at least $20M.[72]  The league now has 12 ownership groups for its 13 clubs. At one time Traffic owned three clubs and indirectly owned the largest stake in a fourth until Minnesota was divested. With the recent divestiture of Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale.[73] Traffic only holds interests in Carolina."

ANTHONY: In Bayamon, we had to work out the details for that. The mayor was very helpful with that, figuring out the lease. But as far as me building a stadium, I think it's more about building affordable housing around the stadium, building the town and the city back up, bringing more jobs to the island, whether it's working with the team, working with the stadium. It's more about bringing the island together and bringing more awareness to the island.   This is, for me, the highlight of the article. Building up the local community & bringing in new jobs & homes will do more to build the team & sport than just building a new stadium. I can hardly wait to see Puerto Rico FC grow & flourish.

There was already that team in the NASL, but once they [sat out] a couple of seasons, the league took them out and they had to readmit them and go through the admission process again. I had to got to pitch meetings with the Board of Governors and to the Commissioner. All of this stuff has been going on for the past two years. I kind of kept it behind the scenes.  ESPN FC: You said this has been going on for two years. Did you approach them or did they approach you?

The NASL has better attendance numbers, and their teams would remain the best supported. But both leagues already have a recent history of vaulting new cities into MLS. And while I think that the MLS/USL partnership is beneficial for both tiers, I do think that the NASL's model of independent ownership is important for growing new fans.   But I just want as much competitive soccer as possible. And, as it is, there are good squads in the same neighborhoods who aren't playing one another. Combining the leagues would allow for the best squads to shine, and it would improve everybody's game.   I hope, too, that the bunch of new ""2"" squads in the USL find their ways to new cities or then disband. It seems redundant. Is anybody going to Sounders 2 games?"
NASLSoccer,39adew,okctHunder11,5,Wed Jun 10 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Since you said you're a new fan, I'll provide some historical background on the relationship between the two leagues. I'm not trying to talk down to you. Sorry, this is going to be long.  The NASL and the USL used to be a united league under the USL umbrella through the 90's and 00's. The split occurred in 2009, when the NASL teams broke off from the USL to form their own league. Due to the timing and legal issues during the split, the 2010 season was a combined season consisting of teams from both leagues, known as the USSF Division 2 Professional League. The reason for the split, as I remember it, is the USL was trying to maintain a regional focus to cut down on travel costs, whereas the teams that chose to split off wanted a more nationally branded league. The only west coast teams at this time was Vancouver and Portland who would leave for MLS after the 2010 season. The other historically west coast team in the USL, Seattle, left for MLS in the years before the leagues split.  Furthermore, the NASL teams that broke off tended to have richer ownership. This was displayed by the on field results in that 2010 league: the top four teams were all NASL teams. At the time of the split, the NASL teams were simply better. If MLS hadn't entered into a partnership with the USL, the gulf between the leagues would probably still be noticeable.  Over the past few years, the NASL has gotten a bad rap for the perception that the league is trying to compete directly with MLS, and a lot of this comes from commissioner Bill Peterson's comments about wanting USSF Division I sanctioning and a Concacaf Champion's League spot. Which, alright, you can't have one without the other (a Champions League place isn't going to a Division II league), but I don't fault him for making those comments. He should be looking to get in ownership groups that meet Division I standards, and he should be trying to get existing ownership and facilities to meet those standards.  So that's the historical reason why there are two leagues. Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing the leagues merge, but I don't like the idea of playing MLS reserve sides, but I'm also a significantly more serious soccer fan than most people I know. The average person won't be bothered by playing reserve teams. In fact, a lot of USL fans say their most attended home games are against MLS reserve sides. Your average fan likes to see the brand come to their local soccer park. I'd love to play Charlotte a few times a year. I'd love to play Charleston, Wilmington, and Richmond. Though I don't want to have to play Toronto FC II to do it, nor do I want to sacrifice USSF Division II ownership requirements to bring those teams in the fold."
NASLSoccer,39adew,dahackne,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This was good information, and it was just what I was looking for. Well put, all together.   I understand NASL's superior spot, but that's exactly why I think that its squads need to be showcased nationwide. Meanwhile, the USL is expanding rapidly and into new and meaningful markets like Austin, Sacramento, OKC, St. Louis, and Tulsa. It's a shame that all of the markets can't benefit from one another's success.   I wonder if there could be a happy middle ground. Say, the USL integrates into the NASL but without all of the new ""2"" squads. MLS affiliation continues, but with a very limited # of loans allowed during each season. Thus, teams can maintain a general sense of independence, but the NASL and MLS can still assist with cross-marketing and player development."
NASLSoccer,39adew,okctHunder11,3,Thu Jun 11 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  I hearby invite any USL team with the ability to meet NASL requirements to apply forthwith.

NASLSoccer,39adew,bullsear,6,Wed Jun 10 14:24:49 2015 UTC,"Why would that deter another USL team from jumping?  There were competing groups, the NASL group was under contract and the majority owner defected to the USL camp.  Seems like a breach of contract which is why there's a legal dispute.  I don't see how this would negatively effect perception of the NASL, especially among business people."
NASLSoccer,39adew,jje,2,Wed Jun 10 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"My thinking is that this just builds on the acrimony that has historically existed between some of the NASL ownership groups and some of the USL groups.

That said, if it was going to happen, it wasn't really going to be a business decision anyway.

NASLSoccer,39adew,xspixels,2,Wed Jun 10 15:01:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see any teams moving down either.  When owners joined one league or another, they did so for business reasons.  Most likely look at it as a ""for better or worse, we're invested in this structure now.""  Your point about ""fringe MLS talent"" is premised on two things. First, players, that are frequently dead broke, premise their decisions on something other than where they can make enough money to eat.  Second, you seem to imply that there's a bunch of ""fringe MLS talent"" that everybody is clamoring after.  I think that both of those are flawed premises."
NASLSoccer,39adew,gordieloewen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:18:43 2015 UTC,"The teams that joined NASL joined because they thought they could make the league an alternative to MLS. Honestly with what has transpired with Traffic Sports, I would not be shocked to see a lot of teams jump ship and settle in under the MLS umbrella.  The fringe talent I am referring to are all of the guys that are sent down to get minutes on the pitch and then called back when they are needed. This puts a better product on the field, and the USL teams have to invest little into these players as the majority of their salary is being paid by the parent club."
NASLSoccer,39adew,xspixels,3,Wed Jun 10 16:18:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly with what has transpired with Traffic Sports, I would not be shocked to see a lot of teams jump ship and settle in under the MLS umbrella.   Seems very unlikely to me.  It seems to be premised on the previous sentence:   The teams that joined NASL joined because they thought they could make the league an alternative to MLS.   Show me any amount of proof for this statement.   The fringe talent I am referring to are all of the guys that are sent down to get minutes on the pitch and then called back when they are needed.   The problem is when they get called back.  So far, there hasn't been much MLB-in-September style roster turnover.  If it starts to happen, it may cause a problem not just with the product on the field but with selling the USL teams to locals.  It does seem that, for the most part, the MLS clubs have been fairly respectful of the need for USL teams to actually gel with a lineup and be able to sell the players to local supporters.  We'll see if that stays the norm or not.  Plus, as you also point out, the USL teams get more roster than they can really afford in this structure.  There are certainly positives and negatives to both structures.  Which brings me back to my initial point about the owners making a business decision to join one league or another in the first place."
NASLSoccer,39adew,gordieloewen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Not the majority, the entirety. One of the advantages of the MLS-USL deal for USL teams is that the entirety of player's salary is paid by the MLS team. That's a big plus over NASL teams who not only have to pay for these players but have to over-pay those players in order to convince them to leave MLS."
NASLSoccer,39adew,SCarolinaSoccerNut,4,Wed Jun 10 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"One of the advantages of the MLS-USL deal for USL teams is that the entirety of player's salary is paid by the MLS team.   This advantage is disappearing as more MLS teams field reserve sides. The more reserve sides, the fewer available affiliations. Currently, 8 of the 20 MLS teams field reserve teams so there are 12 available affiliations, this number will probably be further reduced by two next year as Houston and Dallas plan to add reserve sides. Their affiliations are currently held by Charleston and Arizona, respectively. None of the affiliates currently have the full compliment of loan players, and three affiliates (Sacramento, Harrisburg City, and Wilmington) currently have no MLS players on loan.  There's also nothing preventing MLS teams from loaning players to NASL sides. Currently 5 NASL teams have a player on loan from a MLS club. Granted, I don't know who is paying the contract of any of those players.   That's a big plus over NASL teams who not only have to pay for these players but have to over-pay those players in order to convince them to leave MLS.   Over-pay is a fairly relative term. Most of the first team quality players at the NASL level are depth quality for MLS sides. Considering the minimum MLS salary was $36.5K (now $60K), it's not as if NASL sides are having to break the bank, especially when they're able to offer playing time. Also, a lot of NASL contracts are short, a year in length. Players know if they perform well at the NASL level, they'll be able to parlay that performance into MLS contracts."
NASLSoccer,39adew,dahackne,2,Wed Jun 10 18:00:27 2015 UTC,The USL/MLS deal isnt as adventageous as you think it is.  MLS is known for hosing it players with restrictive contracts.  The NASL structure gives players control over their own destinies and the ability to truly move up to a higher league without signing away their rights to a third party in perpituity.  In the long run thats worth a lot more than the few measly pennies MLS offers their grunts.  Same holds true for stars.  Theres a reason Raul and others have gone to the NASL.
NASLSoccer,39adew,dietrich14,-2,Thu Jun 11 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"After 2 years, why is the NASL going ahead with this."
NASLSoccer,39adew,EquinsuOcha,7,Wed Jun 10 13:09:54 2015 UTC,"Because it's been trying to negotiate a better breach of contract penalty. $500,000 will hurt the USL franchise, but more importantly, deter future expansions from backing out as well. They can use the MNUFC buyout as a precedent."
NASLSoccer,39adew,SCarolinaSoccerNut,-8,Wed Jun 10 13:53:22 2015 UTC,Maybe it's becuase now the NASL has seen the success of the Energy and realized how much the league lost when McLaughlin joined the USL bid.

NASLSoccer,396oxs,SCarolinaSoccerNut,-4,Tue Jun 9 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"Chicago's only 13 miles from downtown. For comparison, that's about the same distance from downtown Atlanta that the Silverbacks play. The Fire drew over 20,000 to their most recent game and their average attendance this year is 16,126. While that's not fantastic by MLS standards it's not exactly struggling either. Besides that's not the biggest thing the Fire have.  What NASL fans keep forgetting is that we live in the age of TV. Physically attending games is not important anymore for fan support. Their popularity in Chicago is dependent on their TV network, which means the Fire can be viewed in every bar, restaurant, and home in the Chicago metropolitan area. Any soccer fan in Chicago can watch and love the Fire from the comfort of home. Any NASL team entering Chicago wouldn't be able to compete with that and would flop big time. The same fate awaits Miami FC once Beckham FC arrives."
NASLSoccer,396oxs,dietrich14,5,Tue Jun 9 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"Whats a tv? Actually, we live in the age of the internet where pretty much any game at any time is accessable in your home or on your phone, so i fail to see your logic there.  I highly doubt you have any discernable knowlege of the Chicago and Miami markets.  The problem is you tend to speak as more of a fan of the league than a fan of any club or soccer itself.  This arrogance is MLS's achillies heel so to speak.  Consider that they have chosen to enter Atlanta in a big way, and Miami with an English fashion  model.  The Silverbacks survived in thier own niche in the northern suburbs.  The NBA struggles to draw, the NHL gave up.... twice!, and the Braves are moving out of the county because they couldnt draw well due to the same deographic reasons that will plauge MLS.  Yeah, lets throw a soccer team in the new billion dollar downtown football stadium.... they'll do well!  Same with Miami.  Do you really think anyone outside of Beach Drive gives a crap about Beckham? Miami is a carribean town first, and Brazilian second.  If you think Beckham is the biggest soccer player ever, then you really dont know soccer. Hell, even L.Donovan called him complete shite.  A shiny stadium and big name non-player wont cut it.  Long term, give me the team(s) that capture the communities that live there, be it MLS, NASL, or even the USL.  NASL will be fine in the Miami metro once the MLS gets bored again if they even get off the ground. NASL clubs are independent and tend to speak to the communities they inhabit. Bring your starting line, bring your supporters and lets go.  The idea that any major metropolitain area is only big enough for one club (well Chareleston maybe) sans cometition is ignorant and speaks more of monopolistic greed than sport or supporter fandom.  Stop being a league homer just becuase your team is allowed to play with thier scaps."
