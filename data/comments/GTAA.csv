GTAA,3d7hvp,Tehelee,3,Tue Jul 14 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"I tried applying weeks ago, still nothing; GTAA on PC seems dead. So I sent an app to the reddit rebels and got a response in 2 hours.  This community seems really fun, but if all the activities require you to be a member, and no one is accepting new members, how are you supposed to enjoy this sub?  All the official posts shun non members, and none of the staff want to address the huge backlog.    I just looked at pc applications, and after almost a month they've closed the app to process it. Who knows, maybe I'll finally get to try GTAP"
GTAA,3d7hvp,Tehelee,8,Tue Jul 14 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"Currently you are a member of the ""Reddit Rebels"", which is ok, if you want to be in their crew that is fine, However you will not be in our crew. This is not an ultimatum for you to decide us or them. This is an explanation of why your invite was denied. There has been tensions between us an that said crew and we wish to have no part of anything to do with them.  As for the length of time it takes us to invite new people in to our group. We take our time for a reason, those who are impatient get weeded out first, reason? We do alot of things that takes patience because of the time it may take to set up the event. secondly we want to ensure quality of quantity so we take the time and vette out the new players (which is best done with small groups), by that I mean we want the best people that will fit with our group, that's why our motto is we don't shoot you and take your money. If we just invited every jeg leg that came along then we would be no different than any other crew in the game.  Again, not an ultimatum, but as long as you are in the Rebels crew you will not be allowed here. This also does not mean any request to join in the future will be denied.  Thank you for choosing GTAA."
GTAA,3d7hvp,Kirt1984,2,Tue Jul 14 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"They are not my active crew, and I equip their clan tag when I wish to participate in their events. I was not aware that doing so would exclude me from GTAA."
GTAA,3d7hvp,tresboi,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"Uh ... any other blacklisted crews that we (new applicants) should be made aware of?  I mean, if membership is being denied because of affiliation with another Reddit crew, shouldn't we be aware of that?  Any beef with RDAD (for example)?"
GTAA,3d7hvp,mattverso,4,Tue Jul 14 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"It's not something we really discuss unless it comes up, which is rare. We're on great terms with the rest of the reddit groups, and have many members in RDAD, GYBB, LSA, and the Reddit GTA Crews."
GTAA,3d7hvp,Kirt1984,4,Tue Jul 14 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"We have no significant ""beefs"" with any other crews, reddit or otherwise."
GTAA,3d7hvp,mattverso,2,Tue Jul 14 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"Excuse me if I'm confused, but didn't /u/BR-700 just tell /u/Tehelee that applications are being denied if there is an affiliation with the Reddit Rebels?"
GTAA,3d7hvp,KebJeb,7,Tue Jul 14 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed. We don't have a beef with any other crews, apart from REBL."
GTAA,3d7hvp,Tehelee,6,Tue Jul 14 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/Tehelee   Sorry your application is taking some time to process. The reason is we get a lot of applications and we all do this as a hobby, so sometimes IRL concerns have to take precedent. I can assure you, GTAA on PC is by no means dead. We have regular Saturday sessions as well as a lot of midweek impromptu get togethers. There's even chances to help film videos. This is the most recent one (1). Personally, I've met some awesome folk through this crew, and they definitely care about it. If you think the reddit rebels are the crew for you, you should play with those guys. If not, I wouldn't despair. There's been quite a few crew posts by new PC members recently (2) (3) so invites are being processed.  In the meantime, I'll ask around and see how the invites are coming along."
GTAA,3d7hvp,mattverso,2,Tue Jul 14 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much; I mentioned the Rebels because of their response time, I do realize that we all have other things going on. Perhaps batch invites aren't the way to go, or a better notification about the process when applying.  I'm still very much shopping around, so I'd appreciate getting a chance to participate in GTAA."
GTAA,3d7hvp,BR-700,3,Tue Jul 14 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"I mentioned the Rebels because of their response time   They're desperate for new members. We are more picky about who we let in, to ensure no assholes make it through. They have no such filters.   Perhaps batch invites aren't the way to go   It's been working perfectly for us for almost two years, and we have no plans to change the way we do things.   or a better notification about the process when applying   Literally at the the top of the application form."

I definitely want to encourage group photos but have your vehicle as the one that stands out. I think that will be a happy medium. You can make an album, I usually do.  The one thing that bothers me is that on the submission thread the person who posts first will usually get a lot of the upvotes. I'll be sure to spam the voting thread in the various GroupMe rooms and on the daily thread."

GTAA,3aj29o,picodroid,8,Sat Jun 20 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"Groupme.com, it's a site that allows you to create group chats with other members. The nice thing about it is that the conversations are logged so you don't need to be active the entire time like on IRC. The mobile app (for iOS and Android, at least) will keep you signed in and provide real time notification of chat messages. This can be a pain, as there's plenty of time where people are just bullshitting, not on topic. But there's mute options to avoid nonstop sounds, lights, and vibrations from the app.   It's very useful since members can easily access the service from a phone or PC and read past messages."

You need a lot of explosives (way more than you would think) to knock it down though.   There are a few ways to get it down:   Get a hydra and shoot it down with the cannons.  Put an assload of stickies on it (about 10 to do the trick, I'm not sure if you need to do it all at once or if you can do it in batches, so you might need a friend for this) Shoot it down with a crap ton of RPGs by aiming at the top of the windmill. You'll need a friend because you're going to need more than you can actually carry.   Even then, the amount of explosives you need always seem to vary from session to session. Not every windmill can be knocked down either, for best results try the ones with scaffolding next to them."

By pulling wheelies & turning you can teleport around the map.  There was a wallbreach not long ago which took advantage of this downtown.

My buddy got one the first night they came out, he had it fully modded and was pulling on my fully modded Entity when we were drag racing on the air strip. It was just jumping off the line so fast every time, putting like 6 car lengths on my Entity within seconds, but once up to speed they were basically even.  In my experience, again regardless of what the stat bars or whatever says, the Zentorno is really no faster than the Entity off the line, a tiny tiny bit, if at all. I've never had any other car walk away from my Entity off the line like my buddies new Osiris did the other night.  On the other hand, I bought an osiris last night, only mod I did so far as the turbo tuning (it maxed out the acceleration bar, but i still think there's more to it than that). Then I had a zentorno that slowly pulled away from me while racing after, like 1/2 car length. So... wtf  I'm more confused now then when I started typing this.  I wonder if modding the car more, even after the acceleration bar is already full, make any difference?   I haven't had a chance to run my not fully modded osiris against my friends fully modded, maybe tonight.  Though aside from all that. I bought it more because it was new, it looks awesome, sounds awesome and handles great. Though i was expecting them to make it clearly  abit faster than the old cars, especailly considering the price tag."

GTAA,39ykqk,bombings,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:01:48 2015 UTC,What are you even trying to say? Was that some sort of passive aggressive insult?
GTAA,39ykqk,EggsNbeans,0,Wed Jun 17 00:07:24 2015 UTC,No I just truly feel bad that you never played THPS as a kid.
GTAA,39ykqk,bombings,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:23:28 2015 UTC,I'm so confused..  What is THPS?

GTAA,39ykqk,Thatcrazylemur,2,Tue Jun 16 07:36:17 2015 UTC,Many of these cars were purchased during the billionaire days.  The last glitch I did for cash was on the 360 and it wasn't a crazy amount. That money was long gone before the xb1 version came out.  Pretty much everything I have is from missions and heists...
