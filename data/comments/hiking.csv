My brother didn't wear them... he did posthole a little in certain parts but overall he was able to move way more quickly and with less effort than me.  Of course, it depends on the year (lots of late snowfall this year) but typically Elbert requires no special gear late spring -> summer -> early fall.  In mid-late September, Elbert is supposedly a real treat of a hike/climb from the south trailhead. Lots and lots of glorious aspen trees changing color everywhere you look."

We will be camping next to the passes.  I have done a 3 day trip before, so that is not an issue.  I am just concerned about going off trail for about 3.5km when following Beatty Creek.  The maps on trail, at the campsites nearby, show a trail connecting Mt Beatty to the Great Divide Trail. This was the basis of my trip, I went to the South Kananaskis Pass and saw the map connecting it to the North Pass through British Columbia.  However, I can find no reference to this hike online, nor is it on my map.  Am I crazy leading 3 friends, experienced hikers, on this trip if I can not find the actual trail anywhere?  Worst case is we follow a creek downhill for an hour.  I am not that worried.  But should I be?  I have never gone off trail like this before.  I am used to trail finding and avoiding deadfall though.  I expect day 2 to take at least 25% longer than usual and that there will be a higher chance of bumping into wildlife.  That portion of the Great Divide Trail is not supposed to be maintained until September apparently and the website says it requires trail finding.  My map also notes this.

While they were definitely in shape for high elevation trekking, they were able to do these day trips no problem!

The path clings to the front of the cliffs far above the valley below, often getting very narrow at times as a result of landslides. Not “oh god I am going to die” level, but you are well aware that if you get too distracted by the view you will be bouncing all the way down to the floor.  After the exposed cliff section I looped back around via two saddles which both unveiled a pretty stunning view over the valley(s) below.  I decided to walk all the way down to Vaduz as my hostel didn’t open for hours. Whilst it was mostly just forest I did take me past the wildschloss (the castle in ruins) and Vaduz castle.

hiking,3dz6ji,ndt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:31 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  If there are those in your party with vertigo or fear of heights, I recommend taking a few climbing harnesses along with webbing provided someone knows how to get hikers into them and do a safety check.  You can then clip a carabiner into the cable via a webbing (also needs to be sewn and tied correctly) after each rung and hang out a bit.   Adds some mental cool especially if others on the cables are freaking out, (always a risk) or if folks want to pass you etc.   Yes-- climbers-- I am aware of the static load question, this is not a Via Ferrata setup, but it helps.  Also, these folks wouldnt be taking a UIAA fall over a carabiner edge.  I've passed folks on the cables many a hike with them exclaiming that a harness was a great idea they wish they thought of.  Even had a guy try to buy mine off of me for $140 one year.  ;)"

I doubt our Impreza fits that description, so I guess I'll have to wait to see if there's any road repair."

hiking,3dwh4i,PaijeMaster,2,Mon Jul 20 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"5 hours in a large group (8) with lots of breaks and waiting to for others to catch up.  You can easily do it in 4 in a smaller group with less breaks.  25 KM round trip, 1500m of elevation."

hiking,3dxinr,Freakatheart,2,Mon Jul 20 10:23:21 2015 UTC,"I did it when I was pretty unfit (not overweight or anything just not fit) and the walking was kind of hard some days but you rarely walk more than 5 hrs per day. I hired a porter to take my stuff. Since then I have hiked heaps more and now if I went back I wouldn't dream of hiring a porter - you don't need any camping gear except a sleeping bag if you stay in the tea houses and so a 30L 9-10kg day pack would be plenty to carry everything you need. It just depends on your experience level with this stuff.  I took Diamox for altitude sickness, I didn't get altitude sick but can't be sure if that was the Diamox helping or not. If you take it you need to be prepared to drink 5L water per day and get up to pee a lot at night.  Great trek and if you are fit and feeling game I would recommend doing a loop via the Gokyo Lakes.   Could give heaps more thoughts but your post is too vague. Feel free to ask any further specific questions."
hiking,3dxinr,hobbitle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:13:19 2015 UTC,I could just ask you 1000 q's haha.  What level of fitness would you say you were at? I'd say I'm not in the greatest shape but obviously in the lead up I'll be working out.   What were the biggest challenges? What time of the year did you go?  Who did you organise it through?  What costs were incurred? (Little unexpected things?)
hiking,3dxinr,hobbitle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:59 2015 UTC,"At that time, I don't know, I wasn't unfit exactly but I certainly wasn't doing any regular exercise. The altitude was the biggest challenge (by base camp I couldn't even really carry my 5kg day backpack, too exhausted, flat out putting one foot in front of the other). The hygiene above 4500m became pretty rough too. Don't eat meat once you get to the mountains. Use that hand sanitizer stuff. All the time.  I went in late November. It was warm during the day but cold at night. Zero degrees C maybe. Water bottles sometimes froze. It wasn't a big deal with a down jacket and a few layers. Walking was warm, weather was sunny.  I used a local company called Simrik Real Nepal. There's a review on TripAdvisor that I wrote. You can probably find it. Definitely use a local company. Shop around a bit.  Expect to tip your guide and porter at the end. I gave about $200USD to my guide (12 days) and $150 to my porter but it varies massively. Give more if you are in a group especially if you think they were good. Be prepared for a hit and miss experience with guides and porters unless you get a direct recommendation, the standard varies a lot. You will need much less gear than you think, especially clothes. Just make sure you will be warm.  Take your own methods of purifying water. Buying bottled water is expensive and only contributes to the littering problem up there.  Ummmm that's about it for now haha"
hiking,3dxinr,MrIsazi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:21 2015 UTC,When were you planning for this hike? I guess that after the earthquake in April it will take quite a while before things get back to normal.
hiking,3dxinr,MrIsazi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:09:48 2015 UTC,Not until end of next year. But I did hear they were starting up again in Sept this year? Not sure if that info is 100%

On the 16th when I was on Adams you could start to see the ocean. Glad you were able to be up there though that has got some FANTASTIC views!"

hiking,3duhhb,ih8rit,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:52:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. I need a giant 4 foot cairn to mark the trail.

hiking,3duhhb,counterfitfake,4,Sun Jul 19 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been on Adams (NH) in February when they were extremely useful. We could have made it without them but it would have slowed us down quite a bit."
hiking,3duhhb,furry_slippers,3,Sun Jul 19 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"I once hiked in conditions in the northern presidentials that absolutely required huge-ass cairns. It was unbelievably scary (cold, rain/sleet and dense fog) and the big cairns possibly saved our lives."
hiking,3duhhb,walkalong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:16:52 2015 UTC,Sometimes they help.
hiking,3duhhb,domestipithecus,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:34:37 2015 UTC,"No. ""Cairns"" are the opposite of leave no trace. They are ""LOOK I WAS HERE LOOK AT MEEEEEEE"" And when someone sees one, they build another, increasing erosion by removing the rocks from the earth.  Apparently, I have some strong feelings on this subject."
hiking,3duhhb,walkalong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:54 2015 UTC,That's not how they work. At least not in the White Mountains. They are built by the national forest service/appalachian mountain club to mark the trail. Cairns built by random people will generally be taken down.
hiking,3duhhb,domestipithecus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's how they are supposed to work. I was referring to the random people ones. Because someone sees one, then someone else needs to add to it or build their own and so on. I've seen them on 2 mile loop trails and built on top of benches with obvious signs those rocks were pulled from off trail. I should have been more specific about what I was ranting about."
