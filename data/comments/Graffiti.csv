Graffiti,3dre5i,Valatid,16,Sat Jul 18 18:52:41 2015 UTC,"I knew I was going to see this posted here when I saw it on /r/pics   This really vindicates my theory that mainstream culture is slowly appropriating the term graffiti to fit their understanding of art; Most people legitimately understand art like this to be graffiti, to the point that the top posts sub dedicated to graffiti aren't graffiti.  To all of you who down vote me, while I have no qualm with your expressing you opinion, I politely ask you to explain yourself. I'm looking for real discussion here.  What is graffiti? Why do you think this is graffiti? How do you feel knowing an entire art movement is slowly being stolen from the artists that created it?"
Graffiti,3dre5i,jibsand,3,Sun Jul 19 00:16:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. By definition, this is technically graffiti, but I don't think it should be classified as such. It really should be classified as street art because they're two completely different cultures."
Graffiti,3dre5i,IWantAFuckingUsename,6,Sun Jul 19 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"What is the difference really between graffiti and street art?  Is graffiti more about writing, words, and tagging? Or is graffiti more about rebellion against authority/oppression?  As someone who is not in either culture, I would say that I appreciate when art makes something boring or ugly become something beautiful or at least interesting.  I don't care for graffiti that just makes things look worse.  Rebellion with art can be amazing.  But sometimes graffiti is terrible."
Graffiti,3dre5i,ZippyDan,3,Sun Jul 19 06:34:56 2015 UTC,"Graffiti is writing.  It's a lettering style that follows many traditional calligraphy criteria; Flow, consistency, orientation, size, and coloring.   With things like stencils and posters, while the content itself can still be letting, it's ultimately not producing orignal lettering on the spot, usually under extreme pressure.   Things like painting portaits, landscapes, and simulated reality, while being produced originally on  the spot, are not lettering so they're also not graffiti.  Without getting too into the actual culture, an important aspect writers push on each other is this sort of ""don't take yourself too seriously"" attitude. Essentially when people bring up ""rebelling against the government"" you just kind of roll your eyes. It's not that complicated, it's just graffiti man."
Graffiti,3dre5i,jibsand,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:00 2015 UTC,"OK, but then the part that confused me, in the post I am replying to, is that poster said ""It really should be classified as street art because they're two completely different cultures.""  So I guess what I'm saying is: is the difference between street art and graffiti determined by the artist, the art (the content), or by the purpose?  The post I replied to seemed like it was more about the artist and the purpose, whereas your post seems to suggest it is only about the content.  My point, as someone who simply ""consumes"" or ""appreciates"" art as I walk through a neighborhood, is I don't really give a shit about the artist or his purpose.  I just care about the content.  There is beautiful graffiti, and there is lazy-tagging that seems to do nothing but stroke someone's ego ""stick it to the man"".  In terms of laws and ideals, I support the idea of freedom of expression and I love when a blank, boring, maybe decrepit wall turns into something full of color and ideas (whether it be street art or a lettering), but sometimes graffiti does seem like defacement especially when the artistic skill is poor and the canvas was already a work of art on its own (like historical architecture)."
Graffiti,3dre5i,ZippyDan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think the point I'm trying to get at is people have a habit of totally over thinking things and kind of missing the point. I think the point is traditionally in the art world, art itself has deep varied meaning and speaks on many levels. People who don't understand graff incorrectly project those art culture understandings on to it, not really grasping the sort of brevity that is the core trait of graff.  So again, what most people seem to miss is that graffiti is ultimately a process. People seem to compare it to a style like surrealism, cartooning, our photorealism, when really it should be compared to other art processes  like sketching, stipple, base relief, or sculpting.  So coming full circle here, OPs image isn't graffiti because it isn't lettering. That's all there is to it.  You bring up a valid point though; if common people consistently perceive any form of street art as graffiti, and they discuss it as graffiti, ultimately they're redefining the actual concept of graffiti itself. Which brings me back to my point; Common people's inability to understand graff as a process is leading to the appropriation of graff style and culture to fit their definition of art.  Personally, as writer, I do appreciate that you appreciate street art and graff. Maybe I'm over thinking the fact that you lump them together, not due to ignorance, but because you have a common appreciation for expression and colorful art that occupies what was originally a blank, possibly decrepit urban space. To people like you the process of how the art is produced plays little role in how your consume it.  Honestly I have no idea where I'm going with this post lol"

Graffiti,3dre5i,jibsand,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:48 2015 UTC,Why isnt it? Where's the line? A hot ass tag is but a painting isn't? Banksy is or isnt?
Graffiti,3dre5i,Arakin,5,Sun Jul 19 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"It's actually extremely simple. Graffiti is latin for writing, therefore graffiti is, by definition, writing. In layman's terms, graffiti is street calligraphy, and very much follows the rules of lettering as a process.  Banksy's work often incorporates writing, but since the focus of his work is his characters, I personally don't consider it graffiti.  So to answer your question, both a hot ass tag and a shitty toy ass tag are graffiti. If you see ""for a good time call _____"" in a bathroom stall, that is also graffiti. A painting of a sunset, even if it's illegally applied to a wall, is not graff, though it is vandalism."
Graffiti,3dre5i,jibsand,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:36 2015 UTC,"There are many prolific writers who paint graffiti with no words, BONES from 70k in Aus is a prime example.   To go back to the Latin translation is a good start but meanings grow and change over time."

Graffiti,3dre5i,DentistFucker,2,Sun Jul 19 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"Tagging is the most basic form of graffiti... Graffiti is about infamy and getting your name out there. That's it. This is street art by definition, it uses part of the street to be incorporated into the piece. Thats the most obvious indicator. If you have ever actually done what it takes to go out and paint you wouldn't be saying any of this cause it's wrong"

Real graffiti is about putting your NAME/CHARACTER up anywhere and everywhere so other people who bomb can see it. This isn't even original art work too, it's literally a photocopied picture of a character from kill bill. There is nothing here that makes it graffiti. Go put some work in the streets, toy. Probably tagging in your school bathroom with sharpies. And your name is probably ""Vandal"""
