Either way, enter through the back door. There's a back parking lot and the protesters don't hang out there. Don't go through the front door.  As for the protesters themselves, they're not terrible in that they don't spit on you or call you names or any of that. They're passive aggressive and say shit like ""I'm praying for you"" and stuff like that. There's always a security guard who keeps them at bay.  Finally, not about the protesters, what ever post-procedure advice your doc gives you, follow it, especially if it involved not being alone. While complications are super super super rare (seriously, don't worry about it) if something does go wrong you'll need to be around someone who can get you some care."

If getting drunk and getting a lap dance isn't enough for you (what is up with you kids today?) then do a Brew Cycle in NW or Pedalounge in SE.

Also, kind of a no-brainer but keep your kitchen clean and all food securely wrapped up in plastic or glass containers. When I moved into my house, the previous tenants (who were pretty slobby) warned us that we would never be able to get rid of the horrendous ant problem they had... I cleaned the kitchen and kept all my food wrapped tightly in its packaging and that knocked back ~80% of it within two days. Terro handled the rest."

Terro has never been helpful for me against those little bastards.  Personally, I'd shell out the money to get a good exterminator to do a treatment. I use Antworks and they've done a great job for the last five years at my place. You can either do a one-time treatment or the annual treatment where they come by 3 times in the year. They guarantee their work and have always been absolutely great to deal with. Plus, the treatment that they use is a transfer poison...that means that once the ants cross the treatment, they'll bring it back to their nest and spread it to everything they touch - the eggs, the queen, each other, etc.  You can also try a boric acid paste, which they'll feed on and poison themselves...but it's far less effective than Antworks. It will only help if the poison kills them faster than they can reproduce.  If you're up in the St. Johns area, I can bring some boric acid gel to help mitigate things for the time being."

Surprised about Newburg being cool.  When I had my car tinted the tint guy said they usually only screw with ""ricers with loud mufflers"" and leave ""more respectable looking cars"" alone.  Ultimately I went with 20% all the way around. Legal technically because of a exclusion in the law for vehicles with truck frames or something like that. Carried a copy of the tint ors around in that vehicle just in case I needed to make that argument. Never did get harassed for the tint. Only really drove in Portland though."

askportland,3dyn8o,stases,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"I got my spyderco manix 2 with s30v steel at ""the man store"" aka sportsmens warehouse. It was about $105 if I remember correctly. It's not vintage, but it is a damn fine knife. I carry it with me everywhere I go and I love it. S30v steel is very hard and holds an edge a long time. The manix2 grip is unlike any other. It has an amazing feel in the hand. Anyone who likes knifes that I have handed my knife to comments on how great it feels. You cannot go wrong with this knife.   If you are set on vintage, I would look for a wind up pocket watch without a battery. A quality watch like this will last a lifetime. Avalon downtown is a great vintage store. You should know that anything ""vintage"" in this town = way overpriced.   Best of luck in your birthday gift search!"

But, if you put effort into it you'll loose weight. One of my exes is still stripping and can easily loose ten pounds in a week if she really works the pole.  Your bigger problems are stage fees, plus you have to tip out the DJ and the door guy at most places. This is anywhere between $40-$100 a night easily. If you're unlucky you can come out behind because you still have to pay that even if you don't make anything yourself.   If you really want to go that route, take some pole dancing classes first so that you know what you're doing."

askportland,3dtfwn,Promagnum,6,Sun Jul 19 07:48:17 2015 UTC,"I moved from LA to Portland. Not from California originally though. I have tons of friends that work in production there, and some here. This is what I can tell you: you're more than likely dead ending your career by moving here, or placing it in a holding pattern for a while. I say this because of the friend that I have that work in production here, they have either not advanced, or maybe moved up one rung in about five years. The industry here is still in it's infancy, and the friends that I have that shoot here from time to time get frustrated by the lack of professionalism.  Weather: It can be pretty depressing for most of the winter. I kind of like that though, it forces you to come up with indoor activities. We didn't get any snow last year, so snow sports are not guaranteed.  Surfing: Short Sands beach. The good spots in Oregon will require you to hike in for a mile or two with your board. Etiquette is like anywhere, there will be a locals only vibe, but do your best. You will have to invest in a thick head to toe suit.  Transferring licence and plates is a pain, but not unmanageable. It does cost an arm and a leg though, I think my total was $200+. You will have to study and retake a driving test on a computer.  In all seriousness, unless you're making a huge career jump, I would not move here without having visited first. Otherwise you're just shelling out a bunch of money for a move that you may reverse in about a year."
askportland,3dtfwn,schallplatte,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:53:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. This is exactly what I wanted to know!  About production, did the down time allow for your friend to pursue any production work himself? I'm not sure that makes sense, so I'll just let you know what I do. Outside of working for production companies, I produce my own work for a living. Are these facilities available up there to the extent in which I've heard, i.e. rental houses, motivated people looking for film work, actors, etc. Every where I've read says yes, but I, like you pointed out with your friend, am weary of what is actually available. I'm only making a minor career jump, this production is moving me. And I have no problem with it not advancing extremely fast. LA has been quite stagnant in my field for about 7 years, so I'm used to it. I think the only way it could be worse is if it's totally non-existent up there.  Is the water really that cold? or is it just a winter season?  Thanks gain, I appreciate it."

They were very smug and self-entitled, like they were better than me because I was from Southern California, yet they hide their homeless. To tell you the truth I don't give a shit about territory-nationalism bullshit. Just ran into a lot of bad eggs up there any time I went to an A's game. And who wants to deal with people like that (anywhere). I'm not naive, I've always seen LA on an asshole to nice people scale that is swayed too far on one side. Yet, you go 30-40 miles to the east of LA and it is completely different: better food, cleaner air, nicer people, the Inland Empire, etc. Most people who visit California only see LA, which is why they usually hate Southern California. It's like defining California by 1 of many cities. It isn't fair. But, I do not judge all of Northern California based on a few bad experiences I've had up there, because I've had plenty of bad experiences right here.  It's a prejudice you just have to experience yourself to get it, I think. One instance, I didn't even say a word to these people waiting behind me at a store in SF, but they over heard me asking something to the clerk, and preceded to ask me why Southern Californians keep coming up here in a very snide, ""get the fuck out"" Gestapo way. I could only scowl at them confused... it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  If there is a lot of people in Portland like those bitches, then yes I will probably have a problem. But, I don't think it's possible that a city like Portland and its progression, industry, and arts could even exist if there were nothing but those people."

Just go to the DMV right away when you get here to get things started. The oregon DMV website tells you what you need.

Please have at least a lead on a job and a few months rent when you come. And our rental market is super TIGHT! Be prepared to be on Craigslist like a fly on crap to find and apply for rentals if you don't have housing lined up.  As for people, I didn't like LA people but get along fine with OR residents.  Commute times vary. But nothing like LA (you rarely stop moving completely in my limited rush hour experience). The MAX can be a mixed bag of quality, but the blue line that goes to Beaverton and Hillsboro seemed to have nicer clientele than say the green line that goes to Clackamas/Gresham.

askportland,3dr1sr,Firry,19,Sun Jul 19 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you ask. There are people here on Reddit who hate change and wish Portland were more like it was back in the 1980s. They don't want any outsiders, Californians or otherwise, in town. Things are different on the street though. Students come from all over to PSU and stay, employees come to Nike, chefs and brewers come to stake a claim, and Portland grows and evolves like any other place. Portland is still a unique and wonderful place, even if 2015 Portland is no longer 1985 Portland. Every city everywhere evolves, but attitudes don't always keep up. Portland is wonderful and Portland is home, despite a few grumblers. There are a 100 positive people who love it here for every 1 who wants to go back in time. Portland isn't ruined, it's evolved. People who keep pace with evolution thrive, enjoying the present moment. Those who don't perish, clutching at memories of times gone by.   I'm not a property developer, I'm just tired of grumblers saying bad things about my home. Portland is the greatest city on earth TODAY. Celebrate that, damnit!"

We aren't ever going to be San Fran or LA or Seattle but we like that and we don't want to keep hearing why those cities are ""better"" and we should be more like them and Portland sucks because of this and that. Those are the people I'm tired of and I want to go back home. This isn't Ohio with taller mountains. Stop trying to act like it is. But if you want to bring some cool culture to Portland and add your own little flair to the city, that is different and that is what has made Portland and Oregon such an amazing place with awesome people.   Oh and we hate what it is doing to rent and cost of living, but that is a whole other demon."

Although you said you want to stay away from pricey I think Andina is spendy.

If you want to go decent fish without the price tag I have always liked Seasons and Regions (more like 30 min drive as it is between Hillsdale and Multnomah Village) their service has been pretty bad in the past, but has seemed to have gotten better.

They also have a ton of fresh apples for sale and a cute little gift shop. They're only open to the public during apple season so it's a short window each year to get cider and apples from them. There's also a market out in Beaverton close to Uwajimaya called Portland Fruit that I'm pretty sure I saw their cider at last year. They definitely sold their apples so I think the cider was there too.

askportland,3dn1pv,mcmanninc,5,Fri Jul 17 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"Powell's Bookstore takes up a whole city block and is within good walking distance to several Oregon brewpubs (Bridgeport, Deschutes, Rogue.) Kind of a quintessential Portland experience there, and even though I'm a local I've never felt like Powell's is a tourist trap.  Tickets for the Timbers Army section are going for about $52 a pop on Stubhub, game Tomorrow. We're playing a Cascadia Cup rival on Saturday. Highly, highly recommended. These games are a blast. They sell Widmer Beer and Mac and Cheese hotdogs in stadium.  As much shit as they get flicked around town, McMenamin's properties are all pretty cool. Edgefield is out in Troutdale. You could play some short-range pitch putt golf, get some tasty beer (other people might poop on me for this, but the Ruby out there right now is pretty good compared to last year. Not too tart, plenty of berry flavor.) See a second-run movie. Lots of fun little nooks and crannies to get lost in out there. Lots of outdoor seating. Also, a cigar bar. Go on Sunday or Monday - it's busy on Fridays and Saturdays due to the concerts they have outdoors.  I love, love, love Basecamp Brewery's outdoor seating area. Also great beer (in my opinion.) Awesome (but spendy) upscale Mexican place (Tacqueria Nueve) is just a few blocks away. A nice way to spend the evening after a long day of running around.  I'm also a HUGE proponent of the Distillery Row Passport It's a great deal. Passport also comes with some coupons for purchasing bottles of booze and I think some coupons to local eateries. Pretty sure you can just walk into the participating distilleries and buy one, no need to purchase ahead."

If you're driving you can go anywhere, but be prepared for no parking anywhere (ask before renting if there's a space), and traffic can be tough. If not a driver pull up a TriMet transit map and find a place close to one of their routes. Bike routes are everywhere and heavily used, so if you're a bike commuter that opens up some areas too.

If so, I actually have a good amount of the cards. I was going to sell them to a friend, but if you have them and play, I may hang on to them and take them out to Portland with me.  I've heard of Agricola and Puerto Rico, but never played them before. And I've actually never heard of the rest of the games you've listed!"
askportland,3dc61s,gotfork,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"BSG is definitely long and difficult, but the challenge is what makes it exciting, trying to beat the system! That and trying to figure out who the backstabbing Cylons are among your group. If you love the show there's a very good chance you'll love the game.   That's super exciting that you're a Netrunner player! I own the core set and a few data packs but I could never find an active group. I love the game so I held on to it - you can probably destroy me but I'd love to play!"

I used to play Netrunner a bit, but haven't played in a good 8 months or so, just not many people around to play it with. The friend I mentioned actually just came and picked up the cards yesterday, so I officially no longer have Netrunner cards. If there's a somewhat active community of it in Portland, I may look back into playing."

I just looked it up though, and it looks really cool!  I have so many questions about pdxlan! How much does it cost (I'm seeing $55 and $75 on the website)? What ages of people typically attend? What do you have to bring with you (specifically, will a monitor/mouse/keyboard be provided, and you just bring your tower, or do you need to bring all of the peripherals too)? What games are played?  Currently I have a decent computer, I'm running an AMD FX-8350 (8-core 4.0GHz), MSI R9 290X 4GB, 16GB RAM (I do a lot of programming that requires lots of RAM). However, once I've finished moving, I'm planning on building a new computer, this time I'll be going Intel with nvidia SLI."

The first LAN I've been to which wasn't in someone's living room or similar was https://lanfest.intel.com/ a few weeks back and had a great time.  People were playing all sorts of games with some of the bigger ones being CS:GO, LoL, minecraft.  It was actually pretty diverse with whole families incl kids and some older games.  Tickets to PDXLAN were 82 this year and I think the November one is somewhat less.  People generally bring a tower, monitor and all peripherals with them.  I'm also hoping to build a new computer at some point -- I'm waiting for Skylake processors to appear (apparently in August) and will also be moving from AMD to nvidia since I would like to occasionally run simulations with http://mumax.github.io/."

My husband really likes Portland Brewing(in industrial NW), Breakside, Migration, Burnside, etc. -but i don't drink beer so i don't have much opinion.  But if you have the Yelp app it is super helpful,  we spent a few days in Canada using only that app to find things and it worked out really well (has walking directions too!) You could check REI for bike rentals, I'm not sure if they do that anymore though and maybe community cycling center? I used to mountain bike at Powell butte years ago, also Lacamas Lake in Camas. Forest Park has great trails and its close in -Wind Mountain on the Washington side up the gorge is one of my favorite simple day hikes,Dog Mountain too if you want a challenge. A bit of a drive but the views are amazing.  Another good resource is pdxpipeline.com  it has a calendar of all events happening in town and there's guaranteed to be something happening while you're here!   Have a great time, hopefully the weather will be beautiful for you, and try to stay away from the highways (summer traffic is a nightmare) :)"
askportland,3d1bvz,theheat715,2,Tue Jul 14 15:17:36 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the advice. I've been doing a little research and pin pointing everything we're looking to do distance wise from our hotel. There's 15 breweries and taprooms alone within 3 miles of where we're staying. As far as bikes go I found a company called Waterfront Bicycles that rents them out and I was able to reserve one. They're a little expensive but it'll be worth the experience.

It's one of the closest urban centers to downtown Portland, making it a very attractive area.  What the MAX line (along with the existing and planned bus lines) will do is to allow the new development to be less auto focused then say, the stretch of McLoughlin from Oak Grove to Gladstone.  Downtown Milkwaukie already has a lot going for it.  They have a great Library at the north end of downtown, there's a Farmers Market and the buildings along Main St have a great 50's/60's Americana feel to it.  As to how it will develop, I would guess that some of the first areas will be close to the MAX stop (around Washington and Main), and at the north end of downtown (North of Scott St).  I hope they keep street facing retail on Main St, even as some buildings get replaced."

Studio - upwards of $1000 in Portland. Our vacancy rate is extremely low, and consequently rents are continually rising.  Job-wise with no degree - you could maybe pick up retail or something similar, I've seen signs for ""now hiring"" in a few stores when I'm at the mall.

Even Gresham's worse neighborhood would be considered safe compared to Oakland's nice neighborhoods.   The best way to get apartments is to scour Craiglist and Padmapper, and jump on them the instant you see them. When you find a property you like, hound the apartment manager to keep you in the loop on any tenants moving and be prepared to go fast. The dog part is going to be a problem, expect to pay pet deposit and additional on the rent.   OHSU, as pointed out below, is extremely restricted parking. You have to put in for a parking spot and the list was six+ years when I interviewed there in 2008. They employ even more people now and haven't added any parking. You can use public transportation or the Tram to get up there. I don't know how the exact number of parking spots at the bottom of the tram, but from what I've seen of it, don't expect to be parking there either.   You can figure out mass transit times on http://Trimet.org, but 30 minutes is going to be on the hard side because that encompasses many of the more desirable neighborhoods.   The reason I say to not discount Gresham because there are going to be more open apartments there.

askportland,3cr9y9,waldowv,6,Fri Jul 10 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"I was hit while on my bike last year, and while it was overwhelming at the time, I am super grateful for the 3 or 4 people who witnessed the accident, stopped and gave me their numbers. It made the insurance process a lot easier.   When I was hit, both myself and my bike seemed to have superficial injuries at first - I walked my bike home from the scene. But an hour or so after, the adrenaline began to wear off, and I realized I was in enough pain to go to the hospital. Luckily, I was only (very severely) bruised, but it still caused enough swelling and damage in my knee that I walked with a limp for 3 weeks and couldn't ride properly for a month. My bike ended up being totaled.   A similar thing happened with my boyfriend - he was hit by a car that ran a stop sign, had medics on the scene give him a superficial check that he hadn't broken his neck, and he was so jacked up on adrenaline, he walked his bike to work and worked for several hours before realizing his back was fucked up and going to the ER. Years, many doctor's visits, steroid injections, and consults with spinal surgeons later, he's been diagnosed with a permanent condition. His lawsuit against the driver and her insurance company concluded this spring, with two witnesses testifying - which is lucky because the driver completely fabricated the chain of events when she testified, so the witnesses' accounts backed up my boyfriend's and helped him to meet his burden to obtain a fair outcome.   TLDR: adrenaline is a hell of a drug. Give the cyclists your contact info even if they say they don't need it at the time. Thanks for watching out!"
askportland,3cr9y9,jordanpattern,2,Fri Jul 10 13:42:32 2015 UTC,"Same as a car collision - make sure you get their insurance details for any bike damage/medical claims. Supposedly if it's minor and under ($1000?) you're not supposed to call the cops - but if it seems sketch at all then fuck it. Or if you want the other person to get a ticket for not following the laws.   Also, have no shame in going to a doctors to get checked out and bill it against their insurance. My wife was in a car wreck and her neck felt a bit kinked - seemed pretty much fine just sore, but the first responders told us to go get it checked. Probably some benefit to getting medical issues caught early, of course, but mainly just so you don't have to get dicked around down the line if a couple weeks go by or whatever. Luckily everything was fine, and when we went in to the clinic they just took down the other person's insurance and that was pretty much it."

Sounds sort of duh, of course when you say it out loud. The trick to temp agencies is to interview with quite a few. A certain Nike hiring manager might have close ties to one agent, and just go to her for most things for instance. Then on your own keep applying to things. Get a temp job (pref temp to hire of course) and then keep searching and applying to jobs that are appealing."
askportland,3cphvz,snoopwire,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:01:54 2015 UTC,I think it really depends on who you end up working with at any agency-- there's so much turnover in recruiting that the good folks don't seem to stick around long before moving on to bigger and better things.

Live: Average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment is almost $1400 right now, and is rising. You can certainly find places for less than that, but typically those places are further from the trendy areas of town and/or in the suburbs. The rental market is also extremely competitive, and landlords typically aren't looking to rent far in advance. I'd recommend having a good chunk of change saved up for first/last and a deposit. I think people recommend padmapper as a good resource for finding rentals.   Work: The job market here is also very competitive, and you'll be at a disadvantage applying from out of state. Cast a wide net, and again, save your money so you have a cushion if you can't find something right away.   Good luck!"

askportland,3cpoxo,CaptianMerica,2,Mon Jul 13 08:02:10 2015 UTC,"International affairs. I concentrated on econ but often wish that I had just gotten a straight-up economics degree.   Despite the 50k in debt it brought me, I don't regret going to grad school - I just could have chosen the path better. Even though my job has absolutely nothing to do with my degree, I wouldn't have my job if I didn't have the MA. Previously, I was making $20k working customer service jobs in Indiana. Now, although I don't have a dream job or anything, I enjoy my work and pull in about $70k. Mostly this is because I got lucky, but the MA was a necessary component of this transition.   My advice is to think long and hard about going to grad school, and to have a clear answer to the questions, “What specific, tangible skills will this degree give me? What specific jobs (not careers, actual job postings) do I want but cannot currently get, and how exactly will this degree help me get that job?”   Also consider whether you want to be tied down geographically or by industry. If I were to work in my field, I would really be limited to staying in DC my whole life, and I’m so done with this city. I’d also have to work for the federal government, which isn’t exactly hiring a lot of people nowadays (thanks, sequestration) and required security clearances for a surprising and increasing number of positions (that’s not happening for a variety of reasons).   So yeah, do go to grad school if you have some sort of plan, because MAs are the new BAs. But do think carefully about your path, do pick an economical option (because frankly if you work hard at it, which you should be doing if you are voluntarily going to grad school and paying for it, you can get yourself a damn good education at a state school on the cheap), and do try to live as cheaply as possible while living off those student loans. This is advice that I wish I had heeded a little bit better. It worked out for me, but I had some good fortune along the way, and I do still have that $650/month loan payment.   Good luck!"

California and Oregon are both on the higher end of the spectrum in terms of gas prices, so you could be looking at $100 each way.  Meals will be your next main expense. Most meals can be had for $10-$15 per person, more if you want to go to one of the better-reviewed dinner places ($20-$30 per person).  Hostel prices are on par with everywhere else, so just google them to find the rates.  You can find ways to entertain yourself for ""free"" by either visiting the waterfalls outside of town, or spending most of your time strolling the popular districts. Almost every night in summer has a free movie/concert in the park somewhere.  You have to pay for parking in some parts of town, not everywhere.  Even in a best-case scenario, you're probably looking at 3 days or so  in Portland with that budget. Certainly doable, but you'll have to act frugally in some ways.

I do that drive regularly in a car that gets middling mileage - high 20s. It's about 600 miles each way, which is about two tanks of gas for most cars. That's close to $200 in gas alone.  You'll save some money if you eat at food carts, but to get the feel of the city you might like to eat at one of the numerous brewpubs. (Don't go to McMenamins, though). Before kids I think my wife and I usually spent about $40 at happy hour.  I don't know what to suggest for lodging. You'll have to look around. You'll probably be happiest on the east side of the Willamette river, but not past, say, 60th Ave. That will keep you closer to some of the cooler/hipper neighborhoods here.

askportland,3ck15e,metmerc,11,Wed Jul 8 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"The reasons are manifold, I'll try to make them TLDR:  There are limited legal tools. Sit/lie laws were deemed unconstitutional by the state supreme court. Besides that, developers successfully lobbied to make inclusionary zoning illegal, which constrains the low income housing supply.  Some people want to live on the street, and their numbers increase for the summer. Life is relatively decent for people who choose it. It's easy to find free meals every day, the climate is decent, there's no sit/lie harassment, illegal drug sentencing is as loose as the supply (yet you can't even get real Sudafed without a prescription, grrr).   People who want off… we don't have enough temporary shelter beds for them, much less longer-term housing. You can't really sweep people off the streets, you're just moving them around.  Besides that, market rate housing is a bitch. I know what my sister pays to share a 2BR shoebox in Chelsea—it is cheaper here, but by less than you think.

It seemed that Oregon and Portland had better social services than the surrounding area.  In the summer time, the weather is more forgiving than California and the migratory homeless come up here for the summer.  Heroin is cheap and easily acquired in Portland.  Laws in Oregon pertaining to narcotic prescription drugs were lax for a long time and become more stringent in the 2000's pushing more people to heroin.  Some skilled labor industries are having booms in Portland, which is driving up housing costs, making it difficult for the ""artsy/weird"" community that Portland become known for to find affordable housing.  One of those industries is tech/computer programming, luring a lot of people from California, where the real estate is very expensive to come to Portland for the cheap housing(fueling a fair amount of the California hate it seems).

If Pine State on Alberta is your first stop, you may benefit from taking the second exit (#307) toward Vancouver Ave/MLK and follow MLK down to Alberta.  I prefer the menu at the Tin Shed, but Pine State will be lighter and maybe marginally faster.  Santeria (on SW Ankeny) has excellent Mexican food across from a great beer bar (Bailey's Taproom-and Santeria will bring your food over if you object to the location of the bathroom).  Stumptown is just 4 blocks from there, and Powell's is about 3 the other direction.  The Deschutes Brewery pub is about 2 blocks north of Powell's and is really lovely.  I think the Breakside makes some excellent burgers and blue cheese waffle fries, with the only caveat that it's sometimes really inconsistent when they're busy.  You should bring a growler down for a ""souvenir"" that you can get filled just about anywhere.  If you want one of your rare drinks while you're here, you might want to hit Dig a Pony (Inner SE), Raven & Rose (~12 blocks S of Santeria), or Interurban (on Mississippi-also a great stroll).

Even the low-income housing prices are above $400 these days. Most places also have some sort of surcharge for dogs, whether that be an additional amount per month in rent or more in deposit money. With $400 per month, you can probably pay for a room + utilities in some parts of town.   $400 per month still isn't enough for most parts of Vancouver, but you can get a single place further out with that.

The big plus of NW 23rd is that you can hike up through the King's Height neighborhood (see some super rich houses in a long vertical height- 1000 feet of elevation gain), and it deposits you in forest park (30 miles of woods/trails) with a view of the city (Pittock mansion). Or you could just skip walking through the rich neighborhoods, uber 2-3 mins to Pittock and walk the woods. NW 23rd is a bit less hip then Albina, a bit more established  Waterfront is good for running! Walk out of your front door and jog along the river. You can go pretty far, and can cross over on any one of the numerous bridges, where there is more running on the other side. Not as many restaurants/etc right on the water, but it's pretty. Hotel Rose is a decent spot, or look further south on the map for an airbnb. I'd recommend near the docks, as it looks pretty at night.  Or right downtown is good. The Nine's is a good spot in the heart of downtown, although it's kind of touristy (big chain stores nearby/etc). It's good for riding the train though, as you can get anywhere in the city from there as the train intersection is below you. And you have a stellar restaurant in the same building (Departures), which is run by chef Gregory. He came in 2nd on top chef this year. Really great guy  I'll let other folks offer some recommendations on activities/unique things. My best recommendation would be to bring layers since the weather in October can change quickly (sunny + feels 60 to rainy + feels 35 within the span of a few hours), and spend lots of time outside/exploring. Lots of good neighborhoods to walk, lots of good beer to drink, lots of good food to eat. And you can spend a lot of time in forest park.  Cheers"

askportland,3ckbk0,irishtoast,5,Wed Jul 8 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"I visited NYC from Portland a few years back and if i were you, i'd skip downtown Portland. It's pretty architecturally unimpressive compared to lower Manhattan. Anything Portland has to offer, outside the Japanese garden, you've probably already seen something similar.   If you can, hit up the unique local scenery, shit you won't find on the east coast. Mt Hood's Timberline lodge, Mt St. Helens Johnston Ridge observatory. Head into Portland and see the homeless problem or go see a freakin Stratovolcano!!   just say it.. STRATOVOLCANO  Also if you're up for a easy 4-5 hr hike, the trail of the ten falls at Silver Falls state park is very impressive, and you don't even have to do the whole hike to see the good ones. I'd also say Multnomah Falls, but you can get more up close and personal with the waterfalls at Silver Falls.  All of these are within an hours drive of the city."

You might look into small towns further East like Troutdale, parts of Gresham, Sandy (cool little town), Damascus, Boring. All those places are within 30 min of town if traffic isn't bad and they are all closer to the outdoor stuff on the East side like all the hiking trails in the Mt. Hood National Forest, Sandy and Clackamas rivers, mountain lakes, etc. I don't think you'll have a hard time finding a 3/2 house for under 2k in one of those areas."

Is Boring as boring as people say it is?    I didn't make it to Sandy on my last trips but I'll look into it.  I'm finding very little info and opinions here on Happy Valley which geographically seems ideal for me other than it is your typical suburban family area according to a thread here on askportland.  I am about 40% sure I do not want kids at least until I am 40 so school districts, family communities, etc are not important."
askportland,3cl25m,Strangesyllabus,2,Wed Jul 8 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't lived in any of those towns, so I can't tell you anything. I would pick Sandy or Troutdale over the others and Happy Valley. The only thing Happy Valley has going for it, is it's closer to town. Sandy is probably farthest drive away, but it's really not bad unless you are driving during rush hour.   I know a fishing guide that used to commute from Welches (near Mt. Hood) to downtown Portland every day. Now that would suck."

askportland,3cig5w,HeMightBeRacist,2,Wed Jul 8 05:09:31 2015 UTC,"Beer spots:   Bailey's Tap Room is a fun place to grab beer. They don't offer food, you can bring some in, but I highly recommend going across the street to Santeria - just tell them you'll be at Bailey's..they know the drill.  Horse Brass Pub has been around for awhile from what I hear. I've only been once (I'm new to the area), but it was fun. Play a round of darts and grab some food. Also, pretty close to here is Belmont Station. Way cool place to buy beers for your southern travels.  I've never been, but I've only heard great things about Stormbreaker Brewing.  Lots of places in SE Portland like Baerlic brewing and Blitz Ladd right next door.    Breakfast:   I can only recommend Pine State Biscuits - the one on Schuyler street close to the Moda Center. Go to this one to avoid lines (their location in North Portland is slammed).    Other food:   In downtown, stop by the food carts. There are several different groupings, and I'll let ya'll decide which ones to hit up. Hit up Fire on the Mountain for a portland experience. Good wings (not great) but it's well worth a stop. Fair warning - their El Jefe sauce is fuckin' hot.    That's all I've got. Good luck and have fun."
askportland,3cig5w,i_hate_the_yankees,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"You don't have to just be downtown for food carts, there are pods all over the city."
askportland,3cig5w,Strangebrewer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:38:57 2015 UTC,"It all kind of depends on your own personal tastes.  Do you want something cheap?  Something nice?  Something kind of in-between?  Are you all adventurous eaters, or will you need somewhere with a good burger on the menu? Even for beer, there are a lot of options to suit all tastes.  Here are some of my recommendations:  For somewhere to stay, AirBnB or VRBO might be a better option, especially if there's more than would cram into one hotel room.  For hotels, The Nines and the Heathman are both nice expensive places, Ace Hotel and Crystal Hotel are both solid choices at a medium rate, and the Jupiter is usually pretty reasonably priced and in a great area that isn't downtown.  Fair warning that it is on the same property as the Doug Fir, which is a terrific music venue and neat bar, but it is a music venue and bar.  There are more chain hotels in the suburbs and by the airport, too.  For beer, again kind of depends on what you like.  I usually recommend good beer bars like Bailey's, Horse Brass, Belmont Station, or maybe Roscoe's, though plenty of other bars will still have good local tap selections.  There are a lot of great Oregon breweries outside Portland, so it can be nice to get to try those alongside the Portland breweries.  For brewpubs, Hair of the Dog and Cascade are both amazing though also very specialized.  Hair of the Dog is mostly high-ABV strong ales/barleywines, and Cascade specializes in sours and is rather expensive.  Still, I think they're doing some very unique stuff.  Breakside is awesome too - they won best IPA in the country last year, and the rest of the stuff can be very creative and mostly good.  Commons also just opened a nice big brewpub near Cascade and Hair of the Dog - they specialize in ""farmhouse"" style beers, and are pretty reasonable in price.  Deschutes is nice, a little expensive, but will have something for everyone and are probably still the most consistently good brewery around.  Food is almost too much.  Tasty n' Son's/Tasty n' Alder, or Broder/Broder Nord are two of the beast brunch spots in town, though you can hit big waits, especially on the weekend.  no-Olympic/Olympia Provisions and Accanto are my secret no-wait weekend brunch spots.  I second the recommendations for the downtown carts.  The pod at 10th and Alder is enormous - basically a block and a half of carts.  For non-carts, maybe just check out Eater PDX.  They usually have a map or a list up that's fairly reliable.  A couple of my fairly inexpensive suggestions would be Lardo for great sandwiches (and a good taplist!) and Bollywood Theater for some terrific, fairly unique Indian.  The fish sauce wings at Pok Pok are one of the best dishes in town, but that's a tough spot to get into with a group.  That's too many words already, but if you have anything more specific you're looking for I'd be happy to help."

At least you won't end up homeless, like many people here.  Your budget is too low for close in Portland for a studio or 1 bd. I'd suggest a shared living environment or sublet as you get settled in. Since you're moving from home for the first time, it's also a key step in adulthood. Everyone should have experienced roommates at some point. You may also find a creative community that way.  The job search will be challenging, because the restaurant community here is tight knit, and only likes to hire through personal referrals. Try http://portland.poachedjobs.com/, though.  As for writing, I'd recommend the IPRC."

And that economy was pretty bad compared to now, there are tons of new restaurants opening up all the time.  I bet you'll do fine.    I would recommend getting a local area code ASAP though.  Lots of people don't and I think it's weird. Don't give them any reason to kick you into the slush pile.  Good luck bro, I'm finishing up a novel right now too.  Hopefully within a few months, but it's tough to do while working and having a social life.  In fact, I'm thinking of moving to Montana for two month to ditch the social life and just crank it out.  Anyway, rambling aside...good luck!  Re: the creative community, I've never done it, but you should look into the local chapter of NaNoWriMo.

askportland,3cfloz,UseWhatName,2,Tue Jul 7 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"I moved from NYC to Portland last year. I don't have much love for DC (my sister lives there) and grew up in the Pacific Northwest, so my answer will be a bit biased. It's been a great transition for me for many reasons, partly because most Portlanders in my experience are incredibly welcoming and kind (although there is a particularly vocal minority who don't want outsiders, but they largely save that for internet ranting). People here complain about the cost of living, but you probably won't notice it substantially from DC. You'll certainly get a lot more for your money in terms of housing (assuming you live within DC proper). Having been to a fair amount of restaurants in DC, I'd say the mid-to-high priced food options here are MUCH MUCH better, but the ethnic food in DC is a bit better. Fill up on Ethiopian while you can. The weather here is changing, but is and will continue to be much more pleasant than DC year-round. If you fear missing cherry blossoms, they bloom along the river here every spring. Portland can't compete with DC in terms of cultural offerings, but I do think it bats far above its weight for a city of its size (and the laid back pace will give you more energy to explore what actually is going on during the weekends as opposed to using the weekends to recover from your harried work week). The real benefits of living here are the nature, (summer) weather, (mostly) friendly people, great food/drinks, and the pace of life (if you're looking to slow it down a bit, it's not for everyone). The real drawbacks are the lack of diversity and the faux liberal politics which, in my opinion, are actually more libertarian than progressive. But that's just me. Good luck with your decision!"

In the days before Christmas of 2000, a group of homeless people in Portland succeeded in establishing a tent city which garnered a great deal of both opposition and support, and quickly evolved from a group of self-described ""outsiders"" who practiced civil disobedience, to a self-regulating, city-recognized ""campground"" as defined by Portland city code.  The Village now features dedicated land near Portland International Airport, elected community officials and crude but functional cooking, social, electric, and sanitary facilities,  Dignity Village got its start as a collection of tents and campers ""squatting"" illegally on unused public land near Downtown Portland.

If you can't leave that early, you should wait until 6:30 or 7, or maybe stop for food/gas/stretch in the Centralia area (it's the halfway point).    Friday will have a little less commuter traffic but more weekenders leaving Seattle in the afternoon.  So plan on staying there for at least an early dinner.  With a group that big, someone will be crazy enough to start driving at about 4, and you beat all the Seattle commuters into town and can pull into Top Pot Doughnuts (or the 24/7 5 Point Café) by 7.  The waterfront is nice early, but not much will be open before 10--but I think the Space Needle/Seattle Center opens around 8, if you're into that."

The beers on tap are great too- you probably can only have one if you'll be driving, as our beers in OR are strong.  Alternately I'd also suggest you check out Blossoming Lotus, which is a stellar vegan/vegetarian joint. Even if you're a meat eater like me, it's delicious.

As a disclaimer, I've never rented or bought from them, but whenever I searched for paddling resources they've come up in searches.  I've taken my (new to me) canoe in Vancouver Lake and the Columbia Slough. I've preferred the slough. It's not that large, but it's a nice escape from the city. It's in North/Northeast Portland and you can see quite a bit of wildlife from the boat.   My wife went on a guided canoe tour in the Willamette as well. They put in at Willamette Park and crossed the river to the south side of Ross Island. From what I hear that was also a nice trip and I'm anxious to do it with them in our boat."

If you've never been here before, you should see Cannon Beach, it's beautiful and one of the easiest beaches to get to from Portland. Try to time it so that you're there at low tide and you can check out the tide pools near Haystack Rock.

When you spend an afternoon getting a beer with your haircut, artisanal ice cream, hit a clothing exchange, the green coffee bean store, then the meat store, then the salt store, you'll know you're in Portland.  It's not just a homogenous caricature though, so you'll see lots of hipsters and hippies, and bums and bikers, and wealth and poverty.  You can probably get a $3 beer and a $20 cocktail in the same bar.  Portland actually has a great blue collar history as well an entrepreneurial spirit.  None of that means you'll like it here though.  But unless you need to go out all the time (which gets expensive anyway), you could live outside the core for a lot less money and come in when you feel like it.

Apartments in Pilsen/Bridgeport are cheaper than Portland, and those are the places where you'll find all the artists and 'gritty-old-city' vibe. The music, culture and job opportunities are pretty substantial. And the tech scene is already massive and only growing. Incubators and tech meetups and makerspaces are popping up like weeds, and VC funds are flowing like the green water in the river. I gather you can already handle 7 months of shitty winter weather, and if you don't harbor some dislike for the place, it's worth considering, and you can easily get a Megabus from Toledo up to visit for $30."

I'm just used to the smalltown life but I'm ready to go somewhere bigger.  In most areas of my town, you can keep your doors unlocked, to your car and house.  Chicago seems like polar opposite.  I hear the jokes/seriousness of how gangster it is and about how many people get shot.  Portland is supposedly very safe so of all cities that I felt I'd be able to handle, that's why Portland was on my map and not Chicago.  You have me thinking now;  I'll definitely do some reading."

If you didn't count all the gangbangers shooting other gang members, the murder rate would probably match other towns, and that only happens in hotspots that you can easily avoid. Outside of the Loop, the neighborhoods do feel like small town (with more diversity, creativity and bars ;). It's not Manhattan.  I grew up on a farm, then started out by moving to Pittsburgh (also a good option these days), and Columbus (lame), and Chicago grew on me. That said, I'm done living in the same climate region. 45 years of tundra-like winters gets old."

I've recently began to hear otherwise a little bit though. lol.  I'm just at a point where I'm looking for something extravagant to get me out of bed every morning, and moving ~2200 miles to a place with elevation [being from Ohio all the elevation must feel like Narnia], mountains, Washington and California both nearby, and so on; its basically just a gigantic laundry list of little bullet points that make it feel like a good spot for me.  It's twice as big as Toledo, which seems perfect size for me.  It's supposedly rated as the second safest city in the US, and one of the most green-energy encompassing cities in the world.  I'm a hoodie guy and the average temp of ~68 (supposedly) is perfect for me.  Apparently a lot less snow than Ohio as well.  All the little things.  Basically, I'm aware that there's cities that could really complete my checklist pretty well (columbus for example which is about two hours away), but it appears that Portland would be ""going all the way"".  For example; an electronic artist I seen in Columbus; he sells 4,000 ticket shows on the west coast, but in Columbus he sold about 100.  The scenes I like are that small around here."

Supplemental to what?  I don't have a definitive answer, so this isn't legal advice.  I would also expect a human from the car rental agency to try to aggressively sell you insurance.  I don't know if you'll find an easy answer.  Perhaps the state can help, but they might just refer you to the company:  http://www.oregon.gov/DCBS/insurance/gethelp/car/Pages/car_overview.aspx  Sorry that I can't help more.  Also depends what you think your risks are for getting stopped or in an accident.  If you get in an accident, state minimums won't cover enough anyway.  If your rental period isn't too long, you might just want to  buy insurance and feel more comfortable knowing that you have $1 million in coverage."

askportland,3bsq34,haleyn12,4,Wed Jul 1 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"Long story short: They are okay enough  They took over my lease in the middle of the lease. They raised the rent by several hundred dollars at the end of the lease so I decided not to renew. I was paying $1200/month and they raised it to $1600/month. The place was definitely not worth that much, IMO. That having been said, they were really fair with fees at move-out time. It was an older house that needed some work/touch ups (it was that way when I moved in and the reason it wasn't worth $1600/month!) and I was concerned they would take deposit money for dumb stuff like the already peeling door frames, messed up screen door or any other manner of little issues that already existed. The only thing they did was charge $50 to haul away some stuff I forgot and left behind (totally my fault, one of the items was a gross old recliner and I have a small car...I forgot to have it hauled away). I was very pleasantly surprised to get my entire $1700 deposit back, minus the $50.  HOWEVER! I did have to get the place professionally cleaned, which was NOT in the original lease and a very expensive surprise. It was not professionally cleaned when I moved in. AT ALL. With all the specific things they wanted (clean windows inside and out, clean filthy garage and back porch, etc etc etc!) it cost $800 and took days for it to be truly professionally cleaned. I was not super happy about that. They required receipts from a professional cleaning company so I couldn't just skimp or do it myself.  All in all, they were okay enough as property managers. I felt like they didn't have their shit together when they were showing the house to prospective tenants but I think it was just that one guy."

In the lease it states that some of the basement units flood because of the rain, and we are responsible for the damage. The basement is 1/2 of our unit.   We asked them about that and they said in email that our unit does not flood, but they won't change the lease.  We aren't really sure what to do.  We need to use the area because it takes up such a large part of our unit.  We already paid the security deposit, without having seen the lease first.   We aren't sure if we should go for it, since they said it won't flood. Or if we should ask for our deposit back, because the lease says it might."

askportland,3br57o,hairylunch,3,Wed Jul 1 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"We just moved here 2 weeks ago.  We actually applied and got accepted for Burnside*26, but after the kerfuffle around that, decided not to sign.  That was maybe 2 weeks before our move.  I had been looking for the last month or two before then, but not real seriously for the same timing reasons you mentioned.  Fortunately, my cousin and his family live in the area and have a large house, and we were able to crash with them.  We found a place within a few days (having feet on the ground made a huge difference).  Most of the larger/newer complexes seem to have pretty quick turnaround, and low vacancy rates, with a unit or two available.  They're all a bit cookie cutter - stone counter tops, stainless appliances, smallish, etc, especially the Greystar managed properties.  We got lucky and found a newish ADU (less than a year old), and were the first ones at the open house at 8 AM on a Sunday.  I talked up the owner a bit, and we fortunately had a few things we were able to chat about (he was a retiring MD, we were moving here before the GF was starting her residency; we were able to talk about minor league baseball, especially since we'd been in Reno since they got their AAA team; and he was just a down-to-earth guy - no management company, pretty straight forward, and a Craigslist post that said something like ""no photos since the owner is an old guy and does this old school"" or something like that.  We found out 3 days later that he picked us out of 6 applicants from his 4 hour open house that morning.  So, lessons learned (and other things people told us along the way):   Budget at least $500 for application fees - we only applied to Burnside*26, and the place we're in now, so we didn't spend anywhere close to that, but I could easily have seen that happening.  (As an aside, the guy we're renting from was nice, and didn't charge the fee until he picked someone, and we paid the fee with our deposit/first month.) Places go quick - less than a week for the ones we were looking at, but we were looking in some pretty popular neighborhoods that definitely appear to be going through gentrification, influxes of outside money, and all that comes with that  Personal connections matter - we did another open house, and I was surprised how much folks were chatting up the agent there, but in hindsight, that makes sense.  This seems akin to the ""love letter"" idea people keep mentioning for home buying these days Posts without pictures on Craigslist - we took a gamble on this one (and I really thought it was a bad idea, but fortunately the GF wanted to do it), but the lack of pictures kept the interest pretty low.   edit: fixed the bullets"
askportland,3br57o,shudder636,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious to hear what's wrong with Burnside*26.  Our last ditch option is one of the big corporate apartment buildings (which won't quite be what we want, but it'll do for 6 months or a year) and I'd like to know what to avoid :)"
askportland,3br57o,shudder636,3,Thu Jul 2 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"Nothing's wrong with it in my opinion . . . seems like a nice, new building.  As far as I could tell, the complex put up [a video/ad that was pretty quickly lampooned]((http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-33244-meet_luke_and_jess_your_new_portland_apartment_overlords.html)), but also served as a lightning rod for all the criticism around gentrification.    Fuel was added by one of the tenants who tried to justify living in the building, but in a pretty confrontational tone, and a follow up (which I admittedly did not read as I was over the tempest in a teapot).  The debate helped highlight what lots of cities go through - trendy neighborhoods tend to gentrify and attract folks with money, which then leads to conflict with haves vs. have-nots.  Sustainable growth is hard, and Portland looks like it's going through growing pains now, especially as it seems to straddle the line between a big city and not.  While houses are expensive around here, it's amazing that you can buy a house (maybe even with a small yard) within a mile or two of downtown.  I think there's also some fear of change, as these bigger complexes are likely going to be part of the answer if Portland keeps growing.  We backed out mainly because of the cost, but the debate around the building didn't help things either.    I realized I didn't really answer your original question . . . we actually found the place and were moving into it in less than a week.  Not sure if that's normal or not, but one more data point for you to consider."

When I tried to do this with a similar situation in Kenton, the neighbor told me that if he got busted by the city, he'd know it was me, and retaliate by breaking into my house, raping me, and slitting my dog's throat.  Thankfully it was a rental, so I kept my mouth shut and got out as soon as my lease was up. There's the potential for a legal proceeding to reveal your identity to the neighbor, but if you own the home and are going to be there for a while, I would be sweet as pie to the neighbor's face, and contact BDS on the down low."

askportland,3bjci0,diabloblanco,2,Mon Jun 29 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if PSU still offers campus housing to grad students, but if they do, don't bother no matter how good the price looks. They don't separate grad/undergrad housing, which means you will probably be surrounded by 17/18-year-olds on their own for the first time. Frankly, I was too old for that when I started grad school at PSU, got fed up after a few weeks, broke my lease and got a nice little studio for a little under $500 right by PSU. This was in 2002 though, so housing prices weren't as ridiculous as they are now. Your budget is very low if you're hoping for your own place (even studios are around $1000/month) but you might be able to swing that with roommates.  If you live in Portland proper, you probably won't want a car most of the time (parking is a pain), but for the outdoorsy stuff you'd like having one. If you go often then keeping your car might not be so bad, otherwise I think that you can do Car2Go or other options like that for excursions out of city (I don't have any firsthand experience with those since I have my own car).  And yes, no other team colors in the Timbers Army section for games. :)"
askportland,3bjci0,climbingherc,2,Tue Jun 30 05:26:49 2015 UTC,"Just reinforcing what a bunch of people already said, but, yeah, you're going to have to live outside of downtown. I recommend the East side over Beaverton/Western suburbs but the best way to know is to visit and feel it out.  Stay West of I-205 (some say 82nd, I don't think it's that big of a deal) and be along a bus route. Almost every bus will get your to downtown and PSU.  You will need that car to get to good hiking/camping. You can be on the trail in 30 minutes.  RSL fans are well liked by the Timbers Army--you have a solid squad that plays the right way and your supporters threw us a hell of a party our inaugural year."

I can't comment on the pricing, but our rental and housing markets are nuts right now. The suburbs (beaverton, hillsboro) are viable for cheaper rates. But for me that would mean I'd definitely want a car. There are tons of nice neighborhoods in the area so this is tough to answer this. Anything NE, North Portland (NOPO), SE is going to be pretty nice and particularly NE and North Portland will be a bit more economical. I'd stay away from anything far east past maybe NE 82nd. Or Gresham.. I'm sorry locals, I've lived there, but its tough as a newbie to the area. You'll be able to get pretty much anywhere using public transit, or cycling. We've got it great for cyclists, and most anyone in cars will have experience with cyclists. Utah and Oregon are worlds different in both the cycling and transit space. I love Portland so much, but this has been the biggest adjustment to me. We have forrest park as others have said, but getting to the real mountain(s) (Mt. Hood) takes about an 1h45m. The ease of access to the outdoors is a big adjustment. Just takes a bit more time to get there.  We need more RSL fans here, but yeah you'll be scorned and laughed at. If you like football/american soccer in general you'll be in fine company with lots of people."
askportland,3bjci0,diabloblanco,-7,Mon Jun 29 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"All apartments cost at least a million dollars (average rent is $1200 per month and going up by at least 20% a year. Downtown is more expensive.) Gresham. NW seems to be a home for many PSU students but is expensive. A new one bed or studio, which seem to be the only things with vacancies, run about $12-1500 a month.  You don't need a car to do anything ever here! Wait. Not true. Public transport is decent. Better than being kicked in the head or waiting for a train in England or strikes on the Metro. Sell your car and get a zipcar membership but beware, there are too many people moving here from Utah and not enough ZipCars. Maps.google.com tells me that Warrenton is approximately an hour and 45 minute drive away. But since you'll be living in Camas on your budget it's much closer. Maps.google.com tells me Timberline ski lodge (not so much since it stopped being Oregon here) is approximately one hour and 25 minutes away. From Longview that's significantly longer though.

I really like this area. It's really close to the Max red line, the 12 bus, (super convenient for getting to Hollywood, and, well, whatever else you want to go to on Sandy), the 205 bike path, and a lot of freeway entrances.   We don't have a whole lot going on right close by yet, but development is creeping out Sandy (there's that Chinese place/brew pub, BTU, on 58th or something on a block with some good Thai food, and a new bar, the Kache, just opened on 68th. There's actually a good neighborhood spot, the Park City Pub on 81st - pretty standard bar food, but a decent beer list, pool, and a good neighborhood vibe. It's also not far over to Fremont, which has a few bars and Fire On The Mountain at 60th(ish).   For groceries, we usually go to the Fred Meyer on 102 (by Gateway). There are roughly 80,000 tweakers there at any given time, but it's never really been an issue. For bougie stuff, we just head over to New Seasons either on Broadway or the one on 33rd.   If you ride a bike, you're really close to the Marine Drive bike path (accessible via the 205 path), and if you REALLY ride a bike, you can be in Troutdale in 30 minutes and at Crown Point in 1:15 if you haul a bit of ass. Rocky Butte is right there, and the trails in the natural area are great for dog walking or trail running. There's also the SAN lot between 92 ave and the freeway on-ramp, which is a sort of un-official dog park. There's a big field for fetch and running around and a nice 15-minute loop back into a grove of trees that my dog really likes.   Other than that, I think this area has a great neighborhood feel. We know our neighbors, and people are friendly. For the first time in years, we had trick or treaters show up this last Hallowe'en. There are some sketchy elements, most notably homeless campers who hang out in the Rocky Butte wilderness area who sometimes wander around the neighborhood scoping out places, but we haven't had any problems in the year we've lived here. Safety-wise, I'm a petite-ish lady, and I haven't had any issues walking or riding my bike at night.  I hope that helps! Happy moving, and I hope you like it here."

I haven't had a chance to look around the website of the Xerces Society (and it's down as of posting this) that someone posted in the thread about milkweed, but it looks like it could be a good resource for ideas to attract more butterflies and other pollinators.

askportland,3b83l6,NotAnEmoGirl,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:56:54 2015 UTC,If you happen to have or can get access to a multimeter you can see if the battery is holding charge (if you haven't already).  If you have an old wall DC adapter with a very similar voltage you can also test the camera side with that and some wire.  Good luck.
askportland,3b83l6,gotfork,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:21:04 2015 UTC,Can you operate the camera with the battery removed and USB plugged in?
askportland,3b83l6,trackofalljades,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:53:57 2015 UTC,unfortunately no...which is probably a bad sign?
askportland,3b83l6,trackofalljades,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether the battery is shorted open or closed. Basically, if you can apply DC power directly to the battery compartment contacts and the camera boots up happy, no problem. If not, you're in deeper than a new battery. If this sounds hard, just buy a battery from a store that will take an opened no questions return."
askportland,3b83l6,trackofalljades,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:57:18 2015 UTC,not a bad idea (I don't have too many tools on hand) so a quick test with a battery that I can return would prolly be fastest.   thanks! i suppose if it doesn't work that means new camera?
askportland,3b83l6,burritoroulette,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:43:18 2015 UTC,You could pursue repair but honestly there probably aren't a lot of things that could be wrong with it that would be worth the effort versus repurchasing. I would sell the dead one on ebay or something for parts though. The fortunate thing is HERO owners are upgrade crazy so an older model is usually very easy to find used for cheap.

Poorly planned infrastructure (like, let's face it, most cities) has translated into abominable traffic and a ruthlessly competitive housing market inundating us with astronomical rents and home prices.   So yes, Austin's situation does sound familiar!"
askportland,3b2rzi,WikiAdam,5,Thu Jun 25 14:54:46 2015 UTC,Yes.
askportland,3b2rzi,thatsgreat2345,8,Thu Jun 25 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"More or less, yes.  Now, take that with a HUGE grain of salt.  I'm not sure the planning history of Austin, and I've spent all of two days there 6 years ago, so bear with me.    Like Austin, Portland is growing.  I, myself, am not a native, but moved here to take Graduate classes after living in Colorado for 3 years.  The city has done a good job of acknowledging and planning for a vast increase in population over the next couple decades.  I believe Portland METRO is anticipating 750,000 additional people in the next 20 years.  (Metro is our regional planning commission, it might be like Austin and San Antonio and everything else combined).    Portland metro has seen an increase in population by 600,000 people since 1995.  With all that, rent's are going and have gone up.  Gentrification is huge and is a mounting concern.  New developments open every month for better or for worse, depending on political/cultural/economic beliefs.  But hey, it's still amazing.  Like Austin, there's a reason people move here.  Quality of life, access to outdoors, (fairly) healthy job market.  Beer, music, beautiful people, food.  They will certainly keep coming.  But I hear Salem, OR is rad.  Or Vancouver, WA.  Tell you're friends those are the happenin places."

I think Austin's growth problems may be more severe than Portland's due to the lack of transportation planning and infrastructure.  The massive gridlock on 35 and on Mopac seems insurmountable, and yet the people keeping moving there.    The public transit system in Portland (along with a fairly good cycling environment) makes for real alternatives to owning a car.  In Austin, you're hard-pressed to live a car-free lifestyle and not rely a lot on cabs.    Sure do miss those breakfast tacos!"
askportland,3b2rzi,theemptymirror,2,Fri Jun 26 05:22:53 2015 UTC,Denverite here.  We moved here ~9 years ago from long island NY.  I take the bus 12 miles to work and it usually eats 45 minutes to an hour.  Denver spent almost a decade expanding lanes on I25 to accommodate the influx but it was overrun as soon as the project was finished.  BTW the population is expected to double by 2050 or so and the front range is already faced with water shortage problems.  Leave it to people to turn everything into shit rather than self regulate.
askportland,3b2rzi,reventropy2003,6,Fri Jun 26 05:18:09 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Portland has an urban growth boundary resulting in developers building upwards instead of outwards.

Where should I stay? Depends on what you're going to be doing, but you'll probably spend most of your time downtown -- Powell's is at NW 10th and Burnside, the Rose Garden and Japanese Garden are in the west hills, and there is convenient light rail and bus access to pretty much anywhere else you want to go, especially around Pioneer Square. The Lloyd District is also close-in, has a lot of hotels/motels and good transit and freeway access. Kennedy School is a popular spot if you'll have a car, but you won't want to rely on transit there.  Should I wait in line for Voodoo Donuts? No."

If you're determined to do it, save up a few thousand dollars so you can pay for an apartment as well as first and last months rent. Also have enough to live on for 6 months without a job. Consider getting some sort of certification in something that interests you, so you'll have a better chance of finding work. A lot of people from around the country move here because they think Portland is cool, and it is, but frankly being broke all the time really makes a town far less fun. Portland Reddit may seem harsh, but I remember seeing a post from a kid a few years ago who had moved to Portland, run out of money, was unable to get a job, and was living in his car, too poor to buy the gas to drive himself home. You really don't want that. So spend the next year saving money and working hard if you want to come here. If you work for a big chain store, they will sometimes help you transfer within the company, so you could get a job here that way. Good luck."

Punching in some numbers into a cost of living calculator, the cost to live in Portland is about 34% more than Denton.  You're likely only going to find $10 an hour jobs here. Can you make it on that wage? Rent here is expensive, there is no rent control, and it's rising at an average of 10% a year. Wages are not keeping pace.    Edit: the jobs here still drug test, legal weed or no."

askportland,3b24n6,Strangesyllabus,7,Thu Jun 25 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm just trying to help you with some actual figures. If you make 10 bucks and hour in Portland, but it's 30% more expensive to live here than Denton, it's like making $7 per hour in Denton while trying to maintain the same lifestyle.  People that live on those wages are really struggling here. It's not a fun life living hand to mouth.

askportland,3b24n6,Strangesyllabus,3,Thu Jun 25 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"Most $10 per hour jobs aren't going to be full time Most $10 per hour jobs aren't going to have great reimbursement or employer coverage for health insurance. (Poverty taxes are fun!) Even if your employer is a good one that covers the majority of health insurance and it's a full time job, $38,000 per year for a dual income household in Portland is bad. There aren't a lot of places you can rent that would be close to work, you'd spend a lot of time commuting and it would suck. All the fun things about Oregon would be unattainable for you.

I'm really not trying to be a dick here, but the answer is, many folks here have skills and high paying jobs.  A second set of people have lower paying jobs and struggle to make ends meet.  If you move here with no skills and no built in family safety net, you'll be in that second set of people.   You're getting slammed because your concept of 'fuck it, I'm going' is going to mean there's a significant chance that you end up homeless.  Here's some advice, learn to code.  Learn PHP, CSS, HTML and Javascript.  If you spend 6-8 months getting a real handle on those skills, and saving up $15k-$20k you'll have a skill that translates to getting a decent entry level job in Portland and you can actually apply for those without moving here and becoming a statistic.

If you can find a place around E Burnside St, you'll have the convenience of a light rail line that can take you into the city. You will not find a place you can afford in the city of Portland, or that will take you without a source of income. Our vacancy rate is 3%, the lowest in the country, and average rent on a one-bedroom apartment is about $1200. The market is incredibly competitive right now and there will always be someone with more income that looks better to a prospective landlord.  If you're going to move here, nowhere you move is going to the Portland you're dreaming of. It's going to be a grungy, sprawling suburb. Maybe that'll still be better than where you came from, or at least it's a start. Absent any more specialized skills, you might find a job pumping gas or working at a convenience store (Plaid Pantry is a local chain that has a ton of stores all over the metro area).  I do feel your frustration with where you're living, but please think hard about what you're getting yourself into before you make such a drastic move. If you want to be in the area, you might have a better time in a place like Salem, which again isn't going to be glamorous but it's more affordable and an hour away from Portland any time you want to go to the city.

askportland,3b24n6,rachelsaver,8,Thu Jun 25 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Portland! I've assembled a list of things you'll need. Normally I'd start with 'A great attitude' but you've already got that, bud!   A lot of emotional baggage and disdain for your home town or state. Portland is full of weirdos (Keep it that way, LOL!) who love to talk about how great Portland is compared to those backwood fucks in the south or the misogyny of the midwest. If you can figure out how you're going to 'find yourself here' before you arrive that will make your patio conversations way easier. I wouldn't pack any clothes, furniture, art, or books with you. That's the quickest way to get spotted as a transplant and you'll want to pretend you've been here a while ASAP. I'd recommend only bringing laptops (MAC ONLY GTFO DELL AND YOUR RACIST TEXAN SHIT) and guitars, possibly a sitar I'd have to check if we're at quota or not.  Be sure to stock up on good grass and large bongs, we're almost at a shortage here. Things are likely to mellow out (LOLGETIT) once pot becomes legal here man, but you can't count on free markets to do the right things. If you don't have any skills, relevant work experience, education, or connections, you'll have a tough time finding work. I'd recommend wearing 'lifestyle appropriate' clothing when you drop off applications at places that aren't hiring. They are just playing hard to get so that only awesome people will apply. That means suspenders if its a brista job, thick rimmed glasses for anything with a computer, and a summer scarf for retail.  The fastest way to get awesome tech skills that will get you hired is at a place called Free Geek. They'll show you how to turn those disgusting Dell PCs into serviceable computers for poor people, students, and the elderly. If you mention you're a texan they might push you to the front of the line to volunteer, since you might be a PC whisperer. Don't mention that you had no say in where you were born tho, that might ruin it. There are always jobs at the prison, usually thing like pressing license plates and clearing garbage from the side of freeways. It's tough, honest work but it'll turn you into a man. I've heard you have to be arrested first, so just bring miniscule amounts of pot around until someone clubs you with a night stick. This may also be a solution to temporary housing and is way better than Vancounver LOL SUCK IT WASHINGTON.   Hope this helps!"

Most of those areas are shaded by tree canopy, so they should be manageable.

Now, however, they have a lot of construction going on in the property and a few of those jogging path entrances have been cleared out entirely.

askportland,3ag740,tedder42,2,Fri Jun 19 23:04:53 2015 UTC,I've never seen any theft there in the past. But just an fyi there's bike space on both the north and south ends. The south bike space is nearest to the max line and the other is near police parking. So if you're worried its likely safer in the north side away from the max line.

askportland,3aexzu,schallplatte,5,Fri Jun 19 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"It's going to be tough with the size of the dog and number of pets, but with that budget you should look at renting a full house.

askportland,3a75ud,ventimus,3,Wed Jun 17 19:28:59 2015 UTC,Pumpkin Ridge is pretty nice
askportland,3a75ud,moistgnome,5,Wed Jun 17 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're looking for upper-end, but for those searching /r/askportland for golf in the future, here's my rundown, generally from ""nicest"" to ""not as nice.""    Pumpkin Ridge- Ghost Creek  Probably the ""best"" public course in the area, Pumpkin Ridge is out in North Plains.  There are two courses, but Ghost Creek (the other is Witch Hollow), is the only course open to the public.  Witch Hollow even has its own private club house; don't want members to have to mingle with the hoi polloi.  Ghost Creek is a great course.  Cool design, beautiful course and setting, decent challenge.  It also ain't cheap.  Summer rates are around $100.  Worth it to play once or twice, in my opinion.  The Reserve  Another west side course, The Reserve is about 15 minutes off Highway 26 in Aloha/Hillsboro.  I actually prefer The Reserve over Pumpkin.  The Reserve is mixed public/private.  There are two courses (North and South), and the way the handle the member/nonmember situation is one course is reserved for half of the month for members only, then it switches.  Members can play both courses at either time.  I like this because in (my) theory, they have members paying a hefty penny for membership, so they keep both courses maintained to keep members happy.  I have had at least a couple members of Pumpkin Ridge tell me the club spends quite a bit more time and money on Witch then they do Ghost.    It's a testament to The Reserve that I can't decide which course I like better- depends on the day.  South is more traditional NW course, North is kind of links style without the hard pan- lots of bunkers and mounds.  The rough is actually quite punitive.  You're paying top dollar again- probably around $100 during summer.  But, like Pumpkin, in my opinion the courses are worth it, and the ""feel"" of the course/grounds makes you feel like you're at a nice place and getting your money's worth.    Langdon Farms  The once course in the area that's a ""must play"" that I actually have never played.  To hear people talk this is somewhat unforgivable, and I've heard that enough that I'll include it hear sight unseen.  If I recall, rates are up there for the area (maybe $70-80).    Stone Creek  Stone Creek is one of my top 3 courses in the area, and #1 for value.  You only pay $40-$50 on summer weekends, and early bird and twilight deals are great.  The course itself (in Oregon City) is a tale of two sides.  Front nine is pretty wide open, back nine fairly wooded.  Bunch of really fun holes, and challenging without being unfairly so.  Love Stone Creek.  Quail Valley  Located in Banks, Quail Valley is for those who want a break from the trees that seemingly line every course in the area.  VERY few trees on the course.  It always seems to be windy out there which helps with the challenge.  Very well kept with a fun layout, it can be easy to score out there.  Also a decent value, around $40 on summer weekends.    Heron Lakes- Great Blue  Probably the best municipal course I've ever played.  In north Portland, the Great Blue is a links-style (again, without hard pan) course with difficult, fast greens and approaches.  If you just want to hack it around, Great Blue is not for you (see below re: Greenback).  It's a difficult course all around, but a fair challenge.  Also in the $40 range.  Heron Lakes- Greenback  Don't want as much of a challenge?  Don't want QUITE the quality?  Want a course that's a LITTLE more boring?  Want your putts to be straight?  Want to shoot your personal record?  Pick Greenback.  That makes it sound like I don't like it; I do, I just prefer the Great Blue.  Greenback is a little cheaper, so that's nice, and definitely helps with the ego.  It's easy.  Like, really easy.  And especially compared to the Blue, the greens are flat flat flat.  Eastmoreland  Another muni.  I hate Eastmoreland (in Eastmoreland/Sellwood), but that's mostly because I'm not very good at golf.  Every single hole is lined with trees, and if you're in them you're screwed.  I tend to be in them.  Honestly, I really don't hate it, but if you're not hitting it straight it's a tough track.  Usually in pretty good condition with a lot of fun holes.  Pricing similar to Great Blue, maybe a little cheaper: $30-40 on summer weekends.  Greens are in great shape and it's a really pretty course that I recommend.  Busy busy busy in the summer, though.   Tri-Mountain  Not a Portland course per se as it's up in Ridgefield, but I think it's worth noting.  Open layout, good conditions, great views, affordable.  If it were closer to Portland it would be slammed, but it's not, so it's usually not that busy.      Rose City  Located in NE Portland right off 84, Rose City is by all objective accounts a bad course.  Really busy, inconsistent, not in great shape....but I really like it.  It's fun, and I've had a good time whenever I've played it.  Could be because it's short and easy to score, but it's a nice setting.  Price isn't that much cheaper than Great Blue or Eastmoreland, but Rose City has it's place.  I've found that it's not as busy as the other muni courses.  Glendoveer  In east Portland, Glendoveer has three nines, and if I had to describe it in one word, it would be ""meh.""  Nothing particularly memorable about it, but I've only played it a couple of times.  Best part about Glendoveer is Ringside Steakhouse (East) is onsite (if they've completed the renovations).    Meriwether National   Out in Aloha near The Reserve, Meriwether is another course with three nines.  I actually like Meriwether; it's a fun course that's usually in pretty good shape.  But I don't recommend because it's a hell of long ways out there, isn't as good/fun as Great Blue or Eastmoreland, and is the same price point.  They often have deals on Living Social or Groupon that are pretty good, but with one of those (they're usually at least half off) is the only time I'd recommend playing it.    Redtail   The only course I'm listing that I flat out don't like, and will avoid playing.  I've played it quite a bit (despite that previous sentence) and it has NEVER been in good condition (greens or fairways), and is ALWAYS super crowded.  Course itself isn't horrible, but it's not good enough to overcome the negatives (including rates slightly above Heron, if I recall correctly).  Redtail DOES have good practice areas, great merchandise (including fitting and pricing), and friendly staff.  In fact, I've heard from several people, including members at some of the private clubs in town, that Redtail is the only place to go for fitting and buying sets.  Still hate the course.  Alright, that list certainly isn't definitive, as (other than Langdon) I've only listed courses I've played more than once.  I haven't played Forest Hills in deep Hillsboro, which I hear is worth visiting.  I've only played OGA once and it was a long time ago, but if I recall I thought it was a good value even if slightly expensive.  Not too difficult, in great condition.  Never played Broadmoore, which also seems popular, but maybe a little goat-tracky."

askportland,39xynt,JohanBroad,3,Mon Jun 15 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"Atomize is definitely the best in-house juice in town.  Nice and cheap ($10/30ml) and they'll adjust to your tastes as well.  Just bought 3 bottles of Junkie Monkey there today, it's my new ADV.  Rose City down by PSU is okay, they're a bit more expensive (still cheaper than premade) and there's a lot of variability in their juice - one that's great one time can be crap the next depending on who's mixing.  Division Vapor has no in-house juice, and all their stuff is ""premium"" - I don't think they have anything there less than $0.75/ml.  Don't bother with Escape Vapor Lounge - small selection and what they do have is expensive.  Vape Shop @ 2nd and Burnside is good in a pinch, but their cheap juice isn't very good and the rest is too bloody expensive.  Avoid Nic Station unless you really just have way too much money."

I know there are a few programs where you can get therapy from students still working on getting enough hours for their certification at $10-15/hour. They will be consulting with an advisor, so the lack of experience maybe isn't as big a deal as it might seem. I think the biggest drawback with this is you will probably have to find a new therapist every 6 months or so, as students move through the program. I think there are some other counseling centers where licensed therapists with their own practices elsewhere may offer their services on certain days on a sliding scale, probably in the $25-50/hour range.  Sorry I can't offer specifics, as I haven't looked into this in a few years.

Amazing movie selection tho, but it sounds like comfortable seats is a high priority for you.  As mentioned, Living Room Theater also has reserved seating.

If I had to try to find somewhere with the same appeal as Portland in the northeast, I'd probably first look to Vermont. Vermont is most like minded to Oregon of any state in the country, from my experience. Burlington or even Montpelier (which is small) would be worth looking at...although everything's cold up there.   After that, maybe look at Cambridge MA, or maybe Newport, RI or somewhere like Amherst . All perhaps expensive, but with thriving art communities and stuff going on - Cambridge, esp."
askportland,39emk5,manadoesstuff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"I've been in cool smaller cities before and I think I need a decent population to stay engaged (Ithaca and Athens GA).  Actually, my job is based in Boston, so that's really high up on my list. I know Boston a little and I'm not psyched about it, but I do ""like"" it. It's just expensive and obviously doesn't have the nature appeal of the PNW, which seems important to me.   Can you say anything more about Boston/Cambridge?"
askportland,39emk5,bollykat,3,Thu Jun 11 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"Cambridge is a very expensive, but very cool city next door to Boston - usually with a lot of stuff going on. Harvard and MIT are there, and Harvard Square - the space right outside Harvard - has a lot of stuff going on...and the Harvard museums are pretty cool. There is art in Cambridge and some galleries. There's a really cool bike path that runs for 20 miles out from Cambridge to the west all the way to concord/lexington. It's not a cheap place to live, but probably has the 'coolest' yuppies of all the various yuppie enclaves which make up our fair city. Brookline is also that way. I had a sibling who went to Tufts, and Somerville near Porter Square was a pretty happening place. Same with Brighton near Brookline.   The thing about Boston is that it is a small, small place, surrounded by towns that have, for all intents and purposes, been incorporated as areas of the larger city. The trick is to find one of those smaller places - Brookline or Cambridge are the best. Maybe Jamaica Plain in certain parts which are more low key and more 'like portland' - verdant, urban gardening, small communities...but JP in the past has had higher than normal crime rates, and I'm not familiar enough with the area to endorse it or not. Boston proper isn't what you're looking for, nor is the north shore, I'll tell you that. A lot of meatheads.  All that said, Portland's way nicer."
askportland,39emk5,mannyv,3,Thu Jun 11 14:06:40 2015 UTC,I've been told by some coworkers that Somerville is pretty great.
askportland,39emk5,trackofalljades,2,Thu Jun 11 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"Parts of it are. It borders Cambridge, which has a lot of stuff going on. And it has a large student population. The same could be said to varying degrees about a lot of those areas up there, brighton, allston, medford, arlington. Somerville, maybe, moreso than the rest.  There are two factors. One is what the population looks like. The other is the squares. Not all, but most of the stuff going on in these places (especially cambridge, somerville, brookline, etc) is happening in the squares - junction points between 2 or more roads with built up commerce and stuff there. They're all over the city. But...find a set of squares you like, find some housing near people who are reasonable, profit."

My family is across the country, which is doubly hard now that I have two nephews I'm crazy about and my brother doesn't fly (he will never come here).

I missed having Portland's specific art scene, food, recycling, walking around the neighborhoods, the Oregon parks/hikes, etc. That's actually how I discovered Portland is more home to me than family. I spent so much time here over the last two decades that the way Portland works (and doesn't) became what I expect out of a city. But I didn't understand that until I left.

Most people here just tough it through the few months of 80-90 degree weather.   Since I work from home, I have a window unit in my office, and I love it.

I've lived here since 2007 and usually find myself wishing for AC once or twice a year at most.

I don't know if you're planning on sleeping but the city shuts down after that, so you won't have much to do, and downtown gets a little stabby/shooty then so watch your back.  Get brunch at Mother's because that's where out of towners eat Sunday brunch. After that, go to Powell's (obligatory), and then up into the hills for the International Rose Test Garden and the Japanese Garden if you have time/money. Don't wait in line for donuts.

I don't know what your financial situation is, but most EMTs have a hard time living on just that income, especially in the city of Portland. You won't start out working 911 ambulance, but instead doing non-emergency transport on a wheelchair car. EMTs cannot transport 911 in Multnomah County. AMR (Clackamas County) and Metro West (Washington County) hire EMTs with options to work 911 after a certain period of employment, but the opportunities are limited. The good news is that most of these jobs are full-time with some benefits. But be prepared to work more than one job or have a roommate or two. Also, start the reciprocity process for Oregon licensure as soon as possible, as it can take a few months sometimes, and you can't work until it's approved.  EDIT: I don't know what the requirements are for Texas, but you need NREMT certification to get an Oregon license."

askportland,39docy,theemptymirror,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"Former Austinite here.  The job market is weirder here than there, and I'd strongly encourage you to find a position before you move here.  You might want to try finding more than one position to cover your expenses here, as it can be pricey the closer to DT Portland that you want to live.    This is a GREAT place to live if you love Austin.  You'll find a similar, independent-minded population here that's very creative.  The climate is far milder, and you'll want to learn to like grey, rainy days.  But there are even more opportunities for outdoor activities than the Hill Country, and the community is very welcoming to weekend warrior types (meaning, you can always find advice on where to go for outdoor stuff).    The music scene here isn't as vibrant as Austin's, IMO.  There are a lot of niche bands, though, and plenty of opportunities to hear live music in virtually every genre.  There isn't a centralized live music district like Austin's, though there are pockets of punk, experimental, and folk in various areas around the city.  Not a lot of all-age shows, I'm afraid.   If you're amenable to public transportation, you could live in a cheaper spot, like Tigard, and catch the bus into town.  The transit system here is WAY cleaner and more reliable than Austin's.  You'll hear people complaining about TriMet, but that's probably because they've never been in a city with shitty public transit before.  You could drive around in your own car, too, but you'd save money by using transit.  Room shares might be a good thing to look into considering your age and where you're living now.  It might be a more affordable way for you to live on an EMT wage and still enjoy the city.  People here seem more open to room mating than Austin."

Some have cheap beer, some have good food (looking  at acrop here only IMHO), some have lots of people, some are small, some are big, and some are expensive.   The point is that it's all about your tastes and what you enjoy in a club. There's never going to be just one answer to this question becasue we all have different opinions and feelings."

It will be paper, and not a plastic card, but it will have your photo and all the required data on it.  Should be good enough, I would think.  What most employers need is proof that you hold a valid SSN.  That means a social security card with a valid number, and some way to prove that card belongs to you."

askportland,394ix1,hairylunch,2,Tue Jun 9 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"I used to hire people here in Oregon, the law requires us to have a couple of forms of valid ID that fits into multiple categories. SS card is one of them, so that together with the DMV temporary card should be enough. A passport or military ID is also acceptable, if you have either of those.  Reading from the I-9 Form Instructions:   If an employee is unable to present a required document (or documents), the employee can present an acceptable receipt in  lieu of a document...  Employees must present receipts within 3 business days of their first day of employment...  A receipt showing that the employee has applied to replace a document that was lost, stolen or damaged. The employee must present the actual document within 90 days from the date of hire.   Of course what the law requires and what employers expect aren't always in sync. Some employers (generally small business) will give you more leeway on these things, honestly the I-9 forms feel like busywork nonsense, but of course they're good to have if Homeland Security looks into your business."

I've been to some fantastic suburban areas in the Boston area (Hingham, Cohasset), and those are awesome--quaint and full of charm. In Portland, not so much--avoid the suburbs at all cost, unless if you and your husband's jobs are out there. In which case, I'd still recommend a Portland home on the west side of the city. Also, the traffic in Hillsboro and Beaverton is awful. Like, truly dreadful. The only way to/from the city is Hwy 26 and possibly Hwy 217, and both are just terrible.

Here's what's big over there:   McMenamins: most Oregon snobs don't drink it. Also very popular. Rogue: see McMenamins. 10 Barrel: owned by AB-InBev, better product, often crowded with pretty bright things. Fat Head's: best brewery, iffy atmosphere, rarely busy. Midwest comfort food, amazing IPAs. BridgePort: uh… try all their bottled product on draft? I don't know why people keep recommending it.  Deschutes: good all around, onsite brewpub with one-offs, basically what BridgePort should be. Bailey's Taproom/The Upper Lip: 20 OK beers (and two good ones) downstairs, a well curated tap & bottle list upstairs.    The Central Eastside is what you really want, and it's more like Ballard in Seattle: a heavy industrial/commercial/residential mix. Take a trip across one of our many bridges to explore the area bounded N/E/S/W by Burnside/SE 12th/SE Division/Water (as in the river or street name, your choice).  My personal feeling is that Commons Brewery is the can't-miss destination, although from a tourist perspective the Cascade Barrel House and/or Hair of the Dog are bigger draws. Commons only has the ""Cheese Annex"" so if you're especially hungry at the time, I'd lean Cascade for sours and HotD for food.  In that same neighborhood, you've also got 50+ taps at both the Green Dragon (a Rogue property & brewery, if you care, but mostly not Rogue beers) and Growler Guys.  In easy walking distance to the north, two breweries: Base Camp and Burnside.  Not much farther south, still a reasonable walk or easy bike ride, two more breweries: Baerlic and One Nation (it should be open by then). Ground Breaker Bistro is also there for your gluten-free Untappd ticks (and diet). And of course there's APEX, Portland's unapologetic take on San Francisco's Toronado and Zeitgeist. Depending on your exact timing, you can ride just about straight there on the new MAX Orange Line.  There are other parts of town to recommend.  NoPo, Yellow Line to Killingsworth: Hop & Vine, Saraveza, then a walk down Michigan, then Mississippi, to Prost!, Bridgetown Beerhouse, Stormbreaker, Ecliptic, and Widmer (yes, that other AB-InBev place).  Many of the listed destinations also fall along TriMet's high frequency #4 bus. Imperial Bottle Shop is also along that line."

askportland,38xxal,adthree,3,Sun Jun 7 20:01:37 2015 UTC,I'd strongly recommend looking for a truck you can rent/borrow and taking it to the dump yourself. The price difference between renting a dumpster and dropping it off yourself is significant; your standard 3 cubic yard dumpster starts at around $200 and I paid about $50 to unload about as much as you have when I took it in myself. That leftover $150 should definitely cover a rental truck for a few hours (or pizza/beer for a buddy with a pickup truck in the ideal situation).

askportland,38xxal,hamellr,2,Mon Jun 8 02:03:00 2015 UTC,"If you do go that route, make sure to check about restrictions for what you can put in the dumpster.  I was surprised a few years ago about the stuff they wouldn't take..  edited to add:  That was in WA county."
askportland,38xxal,felony_flautas,2,Mon Jun 8 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"Way too much experience! Renting a U-Haul (Pickup or truck, the costs are nearly the same) is about $100/day depending on mileage and how much gas you have to put into it. A pickup truck load typically costs about $80 - $100 to dump, more if it is heavy stuff. A box truck might work better if you've got a lot of bulky, but light things.   Dumpsters cost between $300 and $800 depending on what city you're in and how long you want to keep it around."

Cats can develop bathroom issues for a number of reasons, including stress (recent move?), illness (kidney problem, UTIs, etc.) or even if they're just mad (did you move her litter box? Does she otherwise get along with your roommate? Does she like her box to be cleaned more frequently?)    Cats can get very attached to their people so before sending her away I strongly suggest taking her to the vet to see if there is an underlying condition that is causing the urination problems.

She's been to different vets and a behaviorist but nothing my partner and I do seems to work. After finding that she didn't have a uti or kidney problems, we thought it might be a food allergy and put her on a sensitive diet. The problems still continues and she usually goes about a week without peeing and then will randomly return to her favorite 2 or 3 spots. She has all the recommend things like two litterboxes, one covered and one not. They both get scooped every day  My old apartment had carpet and the pee was deep in it so we assumed she would stop after we moved to a new apartment with hard wood floors this February. She did for about a month and then started up again :(   Other than that, she seems happy and loves to cuddle and be petted by myself, my partner, and my roommate. I think it's just something she does. Which makes it extremely difficult to find a home for her.

However, I've had a cat for 7 years that likes to pee anywhere besides the litter box. Here is a list of things that I do to help. They are all very simple and have made a world of difference. I have almost completely stopped the ""peeing anywhere"" from happening (she still gets upset if I am out of the house for more than 14 hours in one day). Feel free to PM me with any specific questions.   -bedroom doors always closed, so nothing personal is ruined while you are away  -litter box in one of those big plastic storage boxes (shorter than the litter box so it doesn't affect the cat entering). Twice as wide is best. In the space on the side that is about the size of my cat, I keep a folded towel. She prefers to pee on that, and I wash it 1-2x/week. Cats are very clean by nature and litter boxes are pretty gross, especially if you've got long hair that dips into the litter every time you get in.  -to make an exaggerated comparison, some litter is more similar to pebbles while other litter is similar to boulders. Use the Boulder option.   -pay attention to if your cat seems to like 4-6 inches of litter or something shallower like 2 inches. Diggers like deep, non diggers usually don't like deep.  -wet catfood every night or every other night. A happy cat won't want to destroy your things. Also, a treat in the morning if the cat didn't pee on something while you were sleeping. POSITIVE reinforcement helps so much.  -pay attention to meowing patterns. When your cat meows, they usually ARE trying to tell you something.  -give your cat at least 10 minutes of undivided attention each day. Whether it is cuddles, pets, or playing.  -cats do NOT learn with punishment. I tried this for way too long. It won't change a damn thing. Well, it might aggravate your cat and make it worse. Act like it doesn't bother you and clean up as quick as possible.  -don't live in a house with carpet if possible.   -keep a scratching pole around  -Clorox/Lysol wipes are your best friend during training  -if you move, expect your cat to be at least a little aggravated. Monitor closely for the first 4 weeks to make sure your cat is handling the transition well and isn't stressed."

There was nothing medically wrong with her-- it was just stress. She's a little odd kitty. When she was SUPER stressed (while we were moving) she was peeing AND pooping outside her box & making us CRAZY.  So we put her on Prozac (yes, that prozac). It helped her SO MUCH. The out of litter box peeing stopped 100%. It was interesting trying to get her to take it, but we both got better at it.  The best part is that we kept her on it for a couple months, until she seemed really good, and slowly took her off. Still no peeing after months. She just needed some medicine time.  I keep my cat because I know that if I didn't, it's likely she would get put down or abused by someone who is less understanding."

I haven't poured a foundation in a while, but I could possibly oversee your project for you.   A retaining wall is the most recent project I've done significant concrete work on (they are pretty much the same as a foundation when done like I did here).   Lifting a house to replace the foundation is a pretty complex project, and a careful inspection of your current one should be done (again if you've already gotten one) to make sure it is truly needed (it sounds like in your case it is, but it's best to be sure).   Some foundations have a parge coat on them, and when the parging is wearing off it looks pretty bad.   As another user mentioned, now is the time to consider adding a basement, because lifting the house isn't common, and adding habitable square footage-while adding cost, will increase your appraisal value significantly (most likely more than enough to offset the investment) and this is your best chance to do it."

askportland,38jnxm,Portlandiata,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"MLeon could only give rough estimates based on other completed projects. Depends on the square footage and many other factors. Lifting the house, pouring a new foundation, reconnecting all the services (ducting, plumbing, electrical), mitigating cracks in the drywall from re-settling and mitigating all the landscaping involved: ~50K minimum. Plus, you have to vacate the house for about 8 weeks minimum. It's a very shitty situation to be in. :(  Check out NW Seismic. I like that they offer cheaper solutions. I'm pretty close to calling them too.  Another thing I'm considering is digging out the basement (if the engineer says it's OK) to add headroom and make it legally habitable. That wouldn't require a lift and reconnection of services. Caveat: MLeon guy said it may not be wise since it makes your basement lower than the neighbors and could invite flooding."
askportland,38jnxm,green_and_yellow,2,Thu Jun 4 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"I think if you were to replace the foundation you'd totally want to lower the basement floor as well; the new foundation walls would have waterproofing and drainage mat on the outside, and I assume a perimeter drain below the level of the basement floor.  The new basement floor should have some insulation and a moisture barrier underneath.  I expect you'd have fewer water intrusion problems afterward than you have now with your current permeable foundation walls.  The guys as Space Down Under do a lot of this sort of thing.  I haven't hired them, but there are probably reviews on Angie's List.  Could be a good time to put in plumbing arrangements in the basement for a future basement bathroom/kitchenette.  Also you could think now about insulation for the foundation walls.   The joys of home ownership..."

I'm unsure if PCC has instate vs out-of-state tuition, or if you can become a resident while attending a community college (you can't while attending state/private schools), but once you move to that level it'd be very worth it to take the time off to save that much money."
askportland,38hhr6,Strangebrewer,2,Thu Jun 4 06:34:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, PCC and then PSU or OSU.  Starting out iwth a community college is the best way.  Especially if grades are an issue.

Make sure he does both."
askportland,38hhr6,blackcain,8,Fri Jun 5 00:00:41 2015 UTC,"PCC is going to be the way to go. Community colleges are great places to earn an education and often times have additional supports not found at a regular four-year university.  With a C average, he may need to take classes in ""Developmental Education"" - this basically means he'll need to take math or English courses that get him to college-level before he can take ACTUAL college-level English and math  (at the 000 level - instead of 100 level).. This will extend his stay past two years (which is completely fine as a four-year college trajectory is a bit of a myth), and the actual amount of time will vary based on how many courses he has to take.  For residency, its' very easy to qualify for in-state tuition at PCC - however, there are some differences if he were to transfer to PSU. Please speak to an actual advisor at either of these colleges to make sure you've got the details sorted out.  The most successful students at a community college tap into the services available, such as tutoring, academic advising, and extra-curricular activities. When you meet with enrollment counselors, please discuss all of these and make sure your nephew legitimately plugs into them."

I'm not sure they care about your circumstances much either though. You can call the financial aid office and ask them for help in figuring out what programs he can take advantage of.  They both have agreements with oregon universities to make sure their classes will transfer to a 4 year degree, you just have to make sure you're in a program and taking the classes which will count."

TriMet is a flat fee, 2.50 for 2 hours, or $5 for the day. That gets you all street car, max, and bus routes. It is normally on time, especially the max, but I'd show up a little earlier than the recommended stop. There are transit trackers online and apps so shouldn't be a problem.     Union station will drop you right into the heart of old town and you'll be greated by a lot of homeless people. I don't know what you're trying to see, I might recommend going 2 more stops to the Couch stop and walking up Couch towards the Pearl and going from there.      Your eventual goal is food carts, which SW 10th/Alder is the largest most popular pod. But there are multiple pods around the city (3rd/Washington, 5th/Oak, 2nd/Burnsidie or Ash)"

However I've also recently developed a walking tour of downtown. Please let me know if the link works properly. This tour will take you to the best (imo) of downtown. Saturday Market, Ground Kontrol, Powell's, Food Carts, iconic Parks, as well as the Art Museum / Oregon Historical Society. It's a good, safe loop to walk and has plenty of opportunities for shopping or side adventures. This route intersects the Yellow Line at NW 5th and Couch (Kootch).  Union Station is probably one of the scuzziest areas of downtown, by the way. It's not seriously dangerous but it can be gross, with open drug sales it's one of the few areas in downtown where I feel unsafe. Staying on the MAX a few stops (to 5th and Couch for example) gets you to a much safer part of town imo. Not that anywhere is really scary, you'll see what I mean.  Trimet is really reliable, MAX especially is good at being on time. Being at the end of the line will help. Everyone else's answer have been accurate, definitely do the all-day pass, it's the same price as two one-way tickets which you'll need anyway."

In general, with exception to Ground Kontrol (think 1up or 2up in Denver), avoid the area inside W Burnside / NW 5th / the river. There's nothing else worth seeing in there. It's not dangerous, but it's avoidable. Might as well.   I eat a lot of lunches at the SW 10th / Alder food carts, which is a two block walk from the Galleria / SW 10th Max (lightrail) stop.    I'm a big fan of Whole Bowl. It's vegetarian, which I'm not, but it's fucking tasty and filling and cheap.

askportland,38gm9u,KarmicEnigma,2,Thu Jun 4 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"September is usually cool and dry, but as a Portlander I am always ready for rain any month outside of June-Aug.  I'd bring a small umbrella at least to shove in your purse just in case. This week, Monday was 65 and raining and Friday is supposed to be 85 and sunny.  It changes quickly.  I don't stay in hotels here so I don't know how to help there. Sorry. Walking along the Portland water front is free, take a walk across the bridges, check out the art museum maybe.  The rose gardens... Pittock Mansion or Council Crest park gives you a view up in the hills overlooking the whole city. That might be cool.  Not sure exactly what waterfalls you're talking about, but if you're up for a hike, check out Silver Falls near Salem. It's about 45 minutes south of Portland. Not sure about public transit.  Punchbowl falls at Eagle Creek is another really popular hike out in the Columbia gorge. Angels Rest will give you beautiful views of the gorge, simply breath taking.  While Portland is somewhat bike friendly, it isn't a bike haven.  It's not like everyone rides a bike here.  Plus we seem to have a lot of problems with bikes getting stolen.  I would recommend using Trimet (the transit system) to get around. They have a trip planner where you can plug in a to and from address and it tells you step by step directions.  There are good phone apps for it too."
askportland,38gm9u,ginger1925,2,Thu Jun 4 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"agreed. I've had friends who have stayed in airbnb places that have worked out real well.  IMO Portland doesn't do big creations made just to inspire. There is no Space Needle, no Statue of Liberty. We are more about the little things. There is the longest trail within city limits in West Portland, called the Wild Wood trail. I think it spans 30-40 miles. You can hike a portion of it from the Rose Garden/Japanese Garden. And it being early summer, the roses in the Rose Garden should be bloomed and beautiful.  I am thinking you are talking about waterfalls in teh Columbia Gorge. I don't think it is very accessible by public transit. There might be a bus that goes to Multnomah Falls. It is the most touristy of waterfalls. The hike up is not too bad, and you can get a great view of the waterfall without even doing the hike. You're just rewarded for showing up.  I would recommend not riding a bike. We have bike friendly streets and very bike non friendly streets. If you stumble upon one of the latter, you'll piss off a lot of drivers and put yourself in danger."

Spend some windshield time driving around the northwest. Texas hill country is beautiful, but apart from that, the northwest is nothing like it. Drive through the gorge to Mt Hood (3 hour roundtrip starting/returning to downtown). The coast is amazing, too.   Have you looked into any yoga classes while you're here?

It's so beautiful here most of the time. Maybe you'll be unlucky and it'll rain the whole time. Most likely it will be in the mid 70s and mostly sunny, but bring a jacket for the evenings.  2 - Air BNB sounds great, there are also a couple of hostels - including one in NW Portland - that are well reviewed and in nice neighborhoods.  3 - Happy birthday. I found the most stresstful thing about turning 40 was the year I spent worrying about it beforehand. Basically the day after I passed the mark it was like ""whatever."" Unfortunately I'm sure I'll do the same thing when I am 49...  4- While public transit won't get you to the Gorge, Mazamas surely will. Check their website, find a hike you like (Eagle Creek is amazing) and go with some locals. That's your only option short of renting a car or doing like a CL ride share.  5 - Plenty of people bike here but it's far from all of us. Pedestrians are pretty well regarded here, and our transit system is really great, so no need to bike to fit in. If you do want to tho, you can rent them at plenty of places, and there are some beautiful bike-only trails you can ride to see all sorts of great parts of Portland."

The rest of Hillsboro is a mix between suburbia and somewhat rural. Mostly everyone I know who lives in Hillsboro works at Intel & a few work at Nike.

North Plains    Forest Grove    I don't know about plans to change any of the cities soon but more development seems to happen in Forest Grove just since it is larger than the other two and has the college there. Forest Grove is better, in my opinion, just because it's larger, there's more to do, and it's close in to Hillsboro.    North Plains hasn't really changed at all in the last 10 years or so, as far as I can tell. My best friend in high school lived there, and I spent a lot of time out there, and it's very small and quiet.

It's the second smallest school in PPS. We have a very active PTO and community that I can't speak of highly enough. It's a drive, but it's way up on the ridge of the Tualitin mountains surrounded by hundreds of acres of rolling farmland. It also feeds to Lincoln High School so there's that.  As far as PVS: we went to their open house and they had to split it in to two sessions due to the crowds. I'd estimate 200-250 families attended for a total of 20ish open spots."

askportland,37vqgs,Throwingtrash,2,Fri Jun 5 08:25:53 2015 UTC,I've grown up here and I've bounced around a few of the schools. Avoid King Elementary school. Boisey Elliot elementary prides itself on cultural diveristy(but I haven't been there in 13 years). It really depends on where you are choosing to live and if commuting your kid to school prior to work isn't an issue. I would suggest sending your kid to Winterhaven a math and science heavy school. That or Beach elementary school.

askportland,37vqgs,whyamihere6359,2,Sun May 31 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"Most (any?) of the Special Focus Option or charter schools are going to require that you apply to play the lottery system to get in. So not only will you have to decide which school you are most keenly interested in, but also how likely it is that your kids will win places at that school. Your best bet is for the incoming kindergartner, of course, because there will be the most slots available for incoming students. Depending on the school and how PPS is rejiggering their policies, you might be able to get the 7yo in with a sibling option but I'm not sure about that and I wouldn't count on it.   I cannot speak to the learning environments at any of the schools you mentioned but my kids attended Creative Science School so I know how hard it can be to pick what you hope will be the right school and then hope again to actually get in. We thought we chose well but it turns out my kids needed something other than CSS could offer so we moved them to our neighborhood school and have had great success this way. There will be good teachers and administrators at every school and there will also be times when things aren't so good. Staff changes every year so even the best laid plans can change (for better or worse). Good luck!"

askportland,37vqgs,sillyconforrest,2,Sun May 31 05:51:35 2015 UTC,"Emerson, Opal, and Winterhaven (mentioned below) are focus option.  It's unlikely you'll get in at this point but you could ask.  I'm not familiar with German International  Portland Village is Waldorf style, and is probably closest to what you're looking for.  However, it is charter, and very likely already full also.  Lake Oswego schools (all of them) are among the best in Oregon.  The community really supports schools with a foundation and additional property tax to make sure they have adequate funding.  As a former PPS and now LOSD parent, I would choose LOSD again in a heartbeat.    There are also some really good programs in Beaverton you might take a look at.  When we were fleeing PPS, Beaverton schools were our second choice, but you do have to look at the individual school.  Good luck with your choice!"
askportland,37vqgs,pkulak,1 point,Sun May 31 05:51:25 2015 UTC,Are there any schools in Lake Oswego that lean towards the Waldorf style of education? My job has offered me the choice of a few different branches and one is there.   What specifically is better in the Lake Oswego schools?   What did you like and dislike about PPS?
askportland,37vqgs,pkulak,2,Sun May 31 05:59:18 2015 UTC,"My big beef with PPS is the near constant experimenting.  The schools just aren't stable.  The rules are constantly changing about the lottery, whether focus options will even be offered/supported, the boundaries, the transfer system.  Latest word is they are going to move away from K-8 back to K-5 + 6-8.  You don't know what you are getting.  LOSD - the opposite.  I think the community support is a big part of this.  A school levy has never failed here.  They did have to close 2 elementaries a few years ago due to declining enrollment (down from 8 to 6) and changed Jr High (7-8) to Middle School (6-8).  But that was done as all one fairly well thought out change, and there haven't been structural changes since.    I'm not sure if any of the schools lean more toward a waldorf style, but I think you could reach out to the district directly and get their perspective."

If there's no transit or reasonable bike routes, you could A) convince someone with a car to go with you, or B) use one of the 4(?) carshare programs in town to rent a car to get there. Some of the Getaround cars have very reasonable dayrates."
askportland,37u952,cboyd1970,2,Sat May 30 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"There are some transit options in the Gorge Portland Spirit Explorer will get you to Cascade Locks, but not cheaply.   I've done plenty of biking in the Gorge, though never to Rooster Rock. It is possible to bike there, but unfortunately not very pleasant. That said…  Get yourself to Troutdale. The scenic ride is via Marine Drive, and it'll burn 20 (often breezy) miles one way. Killingsworth to Sandy is less pleasant, but what I came to prefer for time and distance. Transit-wise, TriMet Line 77 goes straight through, or you can start riding from the end of the MAX Blue Line.  Ride the HCRH to Angel's Rest trailhead. For many people the ride up to Vista House and back down to river is a good ride in its own right. Joining the highway via Stark will save a few miles.  The real fun begins when your next step is to ride I-84 westbound. This is 100% legal east of 122nd Ave. As a fairly confident rider, I think it's totally sketchy. Others swear by the gentler grade and wide shoulders of Interstate highways, and in this case there are no offramps to cross.  Messier still is the return, at least if you're me. I try to ride loops instead of out-and-back routes, but Corbett Hill Road is an exceptional challenge even without traffic, and it's an 8 mile grind to Troutdale.  Luck be with you."

I honestly think your best bet is to just send out lots and lots of emails to craigslist listings. Just be sure to make your responses are personal and actually respond to info in the ad - don't send out a generic form email. As someone whose had to find roommates here recently for openings in my house, my roommates and I automatically delete impersonal or super general responses. Also, you kinda have to be here already for that to work, so just come (and see advice below) and figure out housing once you get here.  Out of curiosity, what do you mean you've had no luck with Airbnb? You just pick the dates you want to stay in a place and that's that. It's not for long term rentals, though, if that's what you're looking at it for. Worst case scenario: book several nights in a few different places (ideally without stringent backout requirements) so you at least have a reliable home base to stash your stuff and sleep. You might have to move around a few times b/c places have limited availability and usually don't want long-term ""renters."" Then look for something long term from there.

askportland,37rofr,moomoo723,4,Fri May 29 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"Oregon Hiker's Field Guide is a great resource to all things hiking in PDX and beyond.  If the weather is good, I would check out Mount Hood -- if you have backpacking equipment or can rent it at REI or Next Adventure, I would go to Paradise Park. There are a bunch of other great hikes all the way around Mount Hood. If you don't want to backpack, you could stay at Timberline Lodge which was seen in some of the shots of The Shining. However, there's not much to do there except hike.  The waterfalls aren't going to be as spectacular in the fall but should still be flowing. Multnomah Falls is the big tourist hike. Probably by October it should be pretty reasonable."

askportland,37rofr,ExiledOkie,3,Fri May 29 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"While I fully recommend Oneonta Gorge for it's beauty, I'm not sure I would recommend it in November. To hike Oneonta, you essentially walk up a river. During summer time when the water is low and the temperatures warm, it's beautiful with only some minor annoyances. However, October/November is the start of our winter (read: rain), making it a possibility that Oneota will be a more dangerous hike due to higher water levels, faster flows, and lower temperatures. You might get lucky, but I might consider this a long shot given how many variables might be in play.  For another outdoors option, I'd strongly recommend Silver Falls State Park. That place is absolutely stunning anytime of the year.  Another word of advice - if you are considering staying at a campsite overnight, consider booking early. Oregonians love their outdoors and many sites fill up months in advance. November is outside of the busy season so there will be MUCH more availability, but a nice weekend can easily fill a campsite quickly."
askportland,37pqdd,eHyena,3,Fri May 29 12:51:33 2015 UTC,"All of Forest Park is really beautiful, and the Wildwood Trail is both well maintained and a lot of fun.  I'd start at the Lower Macleay Trail entrance off of NW Upshur, head to the intersection of the Wildwood Trail, and then go up the Wildwood Trail. Some steeper bits where the Wildwood meets the Lower Macleay trail, but nothing a trail runner can't handle.  You can go as far as you want on the Wildwood - it's over thirty miles long. When you feel like you're a little past your halfway mark, take one of the many branches (I usually take Alder, Firelane 1, Chestnut, or Maple - depending on how far I want to go) over to Leif Erikson Road. (Yes, it's called a road, but it's more of a wide trail, really - it's closed to cars and the pavement has crumbled away.)   Once on Leif Erikson, you can head back to the Forest Park entrance on Thurman St., and do just a little bit of street running to get back to your starting point."

If you don't choose to go that route, you'll need to rely on street parking.  Since you've chosen to live in a pretty popular part of town, street parking will be very limited and you may find yourself parking MANY blocks away from your home. You should also be aware the Portland code stipulates you are supposed to move your vehicle every 24 hours if it is parked on the street, but I've only seen it enforced when someone from the neighborhood complains.  In that part of town, parking is always going to be a problem on weekends and weeknights due to the various entertainment options in the area. Try to plan ahead to avoid frustration. Also consider walking, biking, and/or transit to reduce the amount of time looking for parking."

Granter, there's some nice places east-side that aren't too bad of a drive up 205 into West Linn. It depends entirely on where you are working and what kind of scene you are interested in.  I personally prefer the burbs (near blasphemy on these reddits) I don't have to worry about parking, homeless, have a nice yard, cleaner, less traffic, my house is newer etc. But as a downside yes, I am farther away from more hip things.  Although even in the Burbs you'll find a good local bar most likely. And Beav for instance has the best Viet and Korean food in all of Portland. I live in Tualatin and have a 3mi commute to work and then it's right under 30mins to just about anywhere in Portland I want to go on the weekends. I'd love to be closer to some of my favorite brewpubs, but realistically that's more of a weekend event for me anyways. But I'm a grump old man, so do with my opinion what you will."

Portland is not actually a tv show, it's a real city with an increasing cost of living and not a lot of housing or jobs.  No one is being mean, they're being honest. $1200 is MAYBE one month's rent for a studio, but you're not going to get one because that's not enough for a security deposit, application fee, first month's rent, AND most places want to see proof of income or savings. It's a landlord's market right now since demand for housing is MUCH higher than availability, so they have the luxury of being picky and I guarantee any kind of romantic ""I moved here with just the clothes on my back for a fresh start!"" story is not going to make you look appealing over someone with a steady income and proven ability to pay.  You're not going to find an unskilled labor job ""on the double"" unless maybe you want to swing out to the suburbs and sell yourself as a day laborer outside Home Depot.   You are not unique. We've had a ton of people moving here with no money, no job, and no plans, and as a result we have a major homeless problem that no one knows how to deal with.

Right now, Portland is a place where people who have lived here for years are having to pack up and move elsewhere, because rent has become insanely expensive and there are no jobs. A place where people with college degrees are slaving away at minimum wage (which, btw, is not nearly enough to afford your own place, even working full-time), and many consider themselves lucky to have work at all.

I have a friend who's paying 100 in se portland by Powell and 82nd so it exists. Secure this deal before you arrive in town. Do not enter portland without housing unless you're comfortable and prepared to pitch a tent. All housing except for couch surfing will use too much of your money.  For this to work, you will need to be charismatic and dedicated at the beginning. Don't waste money on beer and other shit. Stay focused on snagging the job and securing housing and things will follow.   Also think about starting in Vancouver wa.

It's true that tax breaks play into it - and that's a strategy employed by many places around the country and in Canada (Georgia, Massachusetts, British Columbia, to name a few). But, I think additionally, Portland's a very cheap place to operate, it's much closer to Cali than some of the other places with similar architecture and it has varied, generic architecture which can be used in a number of subjects.

We do have pretty good public transportation, and it's easy to get around by bike. The job market is not good, especially for entry level jobs, due to an influx of folks moving here.

If you hate traffic, why would you live a long way out?  Jobs are tight, traffic is heavy, rent/homeownership is expensive (though obviously less than SF).

askportland,37d69q,tedder42,2,Tue May 26 21:02:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know your field so I could be wrong about this, but most likely the job options you have in SF likely are going to pay more than anything here since our cost of living is still lower. I suppose one option you have is to see if something pans out for you there, build up experience & live frugally to sock away some money, and then consider again if you want to move here - you'd likely be better off moving with some experience under your belt & money saved up than a newly minted college grad."

askportland,37crc8,bollykat,3,Tue May 26 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"I'm from Fresno too. Been living in Portland almost 10 years now. Although I love it here, and I definitely understand your frustration, you would really do best to go somewhere else first. The job market is terrible here. Don't be homeless if there's literally any other way. Otherwise you are just being a drain on the social safety net. It will be difficult to get a job unless you have a place to live. The general advice these days is to have $5-10k saved and a job lined up before you get here. The rent is rapidly becoming similar to the Bay Area and other inflated areas. It's becoming more and more difficult to find an apartment under $1000/month unless you're willing to live way out in the boonies, in which case you'll also need a car.  I wish you luck."
askportland,37crc8,kroproudhon,3,Tue May 26 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"I know it's not easy for you to hear what people are saying about your options in Portland. I'm sorry for that. But it really is NOT easy to make a decent life here at minimum wage.  I used to be homeless myself. I have tried living a few different kinds of ways in different places. More about that below. I strongly suggest you try living a few other ways before you settle for Portland.  It used to be easier here, much much easier. It is not a place I would try to move to now. I'm here and have been able to do okay mainly because my family is here and because I was on waiting lists for all the low income apartments in town FOR THREE YEARS before I got lucky enough to get an apartment.  I'm lucky to have a full time job at 10 bucks an hour, and even though I split the rent for a low-income studio with a girlfriend who has the same income, we barely get by. We are in this lucky spot only after years of working service industry jobs where they won't let you go over 40 hours a week (in this state you only get overtime pay after 40 hours in a week, I've heard it's by hours-per-day in Cali). Generally, at a lot of minimum wage jobs here you're limited to around 20 or 30 hours, and to keep your job, you need ""open availability"" (basically you have to work whenever they want you, often at short notice like being on call), which means you can't really work a second job with regular hours at all.  Which means: it is really really hard to find an affordable living situation.  I still don't have enough money left after expenses for health insurance (I paid the penalty with my taxes last year and will again this year), and forget about being able to save anything. I plan on this being my way of life for years to come, because moving into higher paid work is proving to be hard. And remember, this is as good as things get, this is like the best situation I could hope for. I'm seriously lucky.  There are definitely easier places to live. I've been all around this country and will tell you it will be worth using this summer to explore the country yourself.  I don't suggest you ride freight trains...that would be illegal :( ...though it is absolutely free...but anyway I sure rode a lot of freights over the years and lived with zero money, I just ate a lot of dumpster food and I found a lot of different towns with great people and decent opportunities. If you talk with friendly people wherever you go you'll find ideas for work and living situations. I suggest you head out east from right where you are, through the southwest, just see how far you can go! Just don't think you're gonna find a decent livelihood in New York City either, that place is only a few steps ahead of Portland in being impossible to afford.  You could do some haybucking in the plains states and move north with the harvest, you could go for the cranberry harvest in Massachusetts, you could sign up for a wildland forest firefighting crew right where you are. These are hard jobs, but you don't have to pay rent when you do them, and you get fed for free when you're a firefighter too. All you can eat! I know because I did it for a couple of years. You can save up a lot of money in a summer of firefighting and you'll see all kinds of beautiful things.  The more I think about it the more I think your very best bet is the firefighting (as long as you have a working phone to get the calls when it's time for work). You just have to pass a ""pack test"" where they see if you can carry a backpack. Hotshot crews especially get tons of overtime if you can prove yourself to be ready for that work. California is always burning like crazy but especially this year, man. You will have a busy summer and come out of it with more money than you ever had before. I promise you this is a better plan than moving to Portland right now.  Here's where you can find a firefighter job. Go for it! I hope this helps you out: http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/people/employment/  You would probably start on a hand crew: http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/people/handcrews/about_handcrews.html  Here's a job listing for one where you would be based right over the border from where you are now. Arizona may be hot, but it's truly beautiful country you'd be protecting. You just gotta stay hydrated. Give it a try! Apply!

askportland,37crc8,kroproudhon,2,Tue May 26 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"I do want to add some things I forgot to say in my last post.  If you do choose to travel, remember a few things:  There are tons of people doing this thing right now where they go around the country asking for strangers for money so they can do their own thing. There are way too many people doing this, especially in Portland. Every block downtown has some kid asking us for money to feed their heroin addiction, and it gets old. I dont know if this happens in Fresno. SO many travelers started doing this for fun, but then a huge number of them have gotten into hard drugs. Maybe because once it starts to look like this way of living is all they will ever be doing, there's no reason not to use.   Whatever you do, don't become one of those people, not until after you try different living situations. Sometimes it's going to look like an easy option, like a way to pass the time. But people have a hard time getting out of that pattern. This city really seems to keep people in that dead-end life, unless those people really really want to change. This city is full of some very rich people and lots of struggling middle people and too many very poor people and there is such ridiculous competition for jobs that sometimes life seems like it will be easier if you give up.  So if you end up deciding to travel, you should travel until you find a good situation. Don't settle for a crappy life. Here's some of my best advice for if you don't have much experience outside your home town and you're wandering around the U.S.A. without a real destination in mind... There are smart ways to make your way around and there are risky steps you might be tempted to take when outdoor life isn't as easy as you hoped it would be. These rules also pretty much apply to if you are ever homeless in a city like Portland...or Seattle or San Fran or Asheville and so on:  1) Never ever touch heroin. Never touch crack cocaine. A lot of light heroin users become heavy users before they know it. I know so many people who died of overdoses before they reached 30 years old. And crack addiction can just make you act dumb for the rest of a long crappy life.  2) A traveler who starts hanging out with ""street kids"" who spend their day asking people for money and getting high and drunk, that's a taveler who is losing their independence. Don't hang out too much with other travelers, they will make it too easy to forget that you can find your own path.  3) Don't ask people for their spare change, not even if you are very hungry. If you desperately need food, ask for that but not ever for money you don't really need. And cigs and alcohol are not ""needs."" People get tired of being asked for money by lazy travelers, people will think you are a junkie. You can survive off of dumpster food and if you need to you can look up food banks in each new town you visit. Keep some dignity.  4) Be friendly, don't be shy. Talk to all kinds of people, especially about jobs they might know of, and about good swimming holes and about where they think you should go next from where you are, and all that stuff.  And that's about all the advice I should give.  By the way the firefighting job post I linked to says something about having to be qualified with college and stuff, don't worry about that, just find a similar post for people looking to fill a job with the same sort of title but without the words ""leadership"" or ""supervisor"" etc.    They have those kinds of gigs all over the western united states, so you can find any open job they have listed and hit the road.  And remember, if you travel, even after you save up money from firefighting season, dont forget to go EAST too. Too many people who wander the west coast will never explore the rest of the country. Check everything out while you are free of relationships and big responsibilities. This might be the only time in your life that you'll be able to!"

askportland,3765xw,jdsilva7914,2,Mon May 25 15:21:09 2015 UTC,i'm pretty sure that there are lots of tech support jobs at comcast in beaverton and at xerox in wilsonville.  there are probably also call centers in salem that are hiring.
askportland,375bbi,bananastealingcat,5,Mon May 25 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm going to be totally honest with you and tell you most of the jobs you're going to get are through personal connections here. Also, if you've got your heart set on an art director gig right off the bat without extensive prior experience, this is probably not the market for you. Wieden is unbelievably competitive and has an ungodly turnover rate (I think the average tenure is 10 months). It's not a place to work for if you have a family or want an outside social life (it's more of a ""get to work at 10 am, fuck around until 7:30pm and work until 4am"" place). Nearly ever single new designer to the area I've met and worked with all had stars in their eyes about Wieden and ultimately decided it's not the place for them after learning about the culture. I've done some contract work for happylucky, but they're pretty small and I don't know if they're hiring. XPLANE is more of an internal corporate gig and I know they treat their employees very well. Once a month, they have a design camp thing that they sometimes hire from, but I think they're a pretty small agency as well. Your best bet is to get in good with a few small shops and make some connections.  Good luck!"
askportland,375bbi,princess_headband,1 point,Mon May 25 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks for the help! I sort of had that assumption about Weiden.  I know I want to be an art director, but I've been working as a designer and production artist to build up skills, and know I will probably have to work my way up to get the job I want. Technically, I'm looking for a ""Jr. Art Director"" position, which is at least what the entry level version is here. I'm 23 and a hard worker, and like to think I'm somewhat talented. So, hopefully I can find somewhere to give me a chance."
askportland,375bbi,princess_headband,5,Mon May 25 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of really talented people in the city. Just make really sure you have both a strong online and print portfolio, but don't be surprised if you end up having to take a paid internship or two while you're getting established (this is all depending on what kind of clients you've had in the past). This is an oversaturated market and depending on your talent, may be really hard to get into. We do have an AIGA chapter which may not be a terrible idea to join since you don't have many contacts in the area. There's also a yearly design week, but that's not until next April (I could have sworn it was in the fall last year, but I guess they shifted it this year). Oh, and Nike and the Trailblazers all have their own in house design team, but they're very competitive. You're pretty young and there are a lot of young designers here. Make friends with them. Just don't be an asshole.  Actually, that's probably the most important advice. Don't be an asshole and you could do alright for yourself.   I also might caution that the rental market here is pretty grim. Previously affordable neighbourhoods are fast becoming completely out of reach for a lot of people who first moved here ten years ago. If you were budgeting for NYC prices it might not be terrible for you, but I might keep that in the back of your head. I would also follow /r/portland just to keep tabs on what's going on in the city and if you think it's a place you really want to move to. If you have an already in place support system it won't be too bad, but I've known several people who have moved out here and have found it to be very isolating and difficult to make friends.  I don't mean to be all doom and gloom because Portland really can be a great city to live in, but there are some major issues, especially for creatives. I would really seriously start sending out feelers to shops now if you even think you might be moving here. I would highly recommend having some sort of job set up before moving here."
askportland,375bbi,madeofashes,1 point,Mon May 25 06:00:10 2015 UTC,We would have living arrangements completely taken care of (which is why we're considering the move). I'd be over-the-moon with a paid internship at a good company. My only concern is finding work somewhere I'd be happy with for a year or two that also is good on a resume/porfolio.
askportland,375bbi,madeofashes,5,Mon May 25 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a designer here in Portland and it's completely over saturated. It took me about 3 years to even regularly get jobs/contracts. Getting a salaried job is ridiculously impossible. Everyone I know does contracts, some have been hired on. PSU puts out tons of talented grads so it's even harder competing with them because the school does a lot to help them network. It used to be pretty easy to work for a couple months and just relax while you looked for another job bc living prices were low but that's not really the case anymore.   Agreed with the top person about networking. All the jobs I've gotten in the past year ( including a contract at WK ) have been through people I know. WK was great, people are great and the work is interesting but it's definitely a live to work environment as said above. ) all the agencies here definitely have the pick of the litter it feels like, so yeah you have to network a lot and be super flexible and PATIENT.   Also I've never heard of the Portland Ad Fed."
askportland,375bbi,lexuh,2,Mon May 25 16:29:54 2015 UTC,"I looked it up, I swear it exists haha.  I would love LOVE to get a contract somewhere. With our situation living costs would not be a concern, but only if we move to Portland. My SO would be finishing school so we only need to be in the area about a year or so, and I just can't imagine not using that time adding to my resume."

My experience has been that the work they offer is mostly corporate UX/UI for mobile and web. I've also had trouble finding contract work while everyone wants to hire FT salaried people, but that could be my position (senior UX design/design research).  Good luck!"

askportland,372uiu,msgsquared,2,Sun May 24 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"Tigard is safe. There aren't really any dodgy types, but there is a mobile home park a little bit off the ways of main street, where someone got busted for a meth dealing operation. Other than that, there's really no issue. You'd be really close to the Tigard transit center. Traffic might be an issue during the early and late part of the day, but much of it is stop-and-go so it'd be relatively quiet.  I've found that any apartment complex I've ever been in have obnoxious neighbors. That just kind of goes with apartment living."

Some people, apparently, just want a signed copy of a book, so when an author comes in they have him/her sign a bunch of copies that they sell. But if you want a personalized signed copy, you can get that done after the reading.  Just last night I went to a reading by Neal Stephenson at the Cedar Hill's store. Pretty packed (I had to stand), and afterwards, probably half the people who came to hear him seemed happy enough to grab one of the pre-signed copies, and most of the rest (including me) got in line to have a personalized copy signed."

askportland,36sm8t,Sillycomic,2,Fri May 22 00:28:04 2015 UTC,"That seems like a decent price for this town. I just went through padmapper and it shows quite a few different options for a 3 bedroom houses for rent.   Are you here asking for information beyond how to help you find a rentable house in Portland? Craigslist and padmapper are good starts. I would also suggest going out to the neighborhoods you particularly want to live in and just looking for signs that are up. They usually advertise that way.   Unless you aren't from Portland, in which case you should probably specify that."
askportland,36sm8t,Sillycomic,-3,Thu May 21 22:24:38 2015 UTC,Originally from Indiana. Moved here 8 years ago.  Just looking for any leads on something super available or to maybe catch the eye of a landlord or broker.  I actually have been using padmapper myself.  Some places are just garbage and not worth it at all or to far away from downtown.  We only use our bikes and public transport so that's a factor I didn't mention. We bike from the NE Kenton area now so we do about 6.5 miles one way.
askportland,36sm8t,Sillycomic,3,Thu May 21 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure how we can help you if you don't give us some of those important factors, like transportation, to help you out. You might want to edit your post to suggest any other restriction on place.   If I am not mistaken you need:  3 or 4 bedroom house, 1800 rent, Close to downtown, Not a shithole, Available within 30 days.  I can see why you are having a harder time with this now. These new factors change things a little bit.   I hope a landlord or broker is taking the afternoon off to hang out on reddit and sees this. Best of luck to you friend."

Here is my evidence, though, for why I believe it to be true -   1) When we put the job ad up with our name on it, we would often receive bizarrely overqualified applicants (people with 20 years of experience applying for jobs that require 2 years of experience).  2) Those people almost never responded to requests for interviews.  3) Once we took our name off, we stopped receiving that type of resume (bizarrely over qualified candidates).  Finally, we track our response rate to interview requests (how many emails do we send out requesting an interview, how many responses) and the percentage of people who responded increased once we took our name off."

askportland,36npl1,scavenger,1 point,Thu May 21 00:15:05 2015 UTC,"I personally think there was probably more to that applicant drop off than just unemployment seekers; but if you're getting an overall better quality of applicant, then it's clearly doing something right."
askportland,36npl1,drunkengeebee,1 point,Thu May 21 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably right. I think people are less likely to apply when they don't know where they're applying, and so that is a definite downside to it."

askportland,36kltn,cftvgybhu,8,Wed May 20 02:38:52 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/tedder42 was trying to say was ""Um. We currently have the lowest rental inventory in the country which means housing is extremely competitive and prices are climbing rapidly. Job scene isn't much better and if you have no education or years of experience you're going to have a bad time. The food industry is good but also really competitive here. We don't have as many opportunities as a big city and our explosive population growth is outpacing the small job market.""  My advice: Find somewhere else. Get some more years of experience, maybe some education/formal training. Let Portland's current growth settle down. Consider moving here in a few years."
askportland,36kltn,tedder42,2,Wed May 20 02:48:52 2015 UTC,That. I scrolled through every possible response and decided they were negative and OP probably wouldn't listen/understand.

askportland,36kltn,my_toesies,2,Wed May 20 02:44:10 2015 UTC,"Where are you coming from? What's decent rent to you? What do you know about Portland besides generalities?   Portland is a great town but it's growing quickly. Rent is getting higher quickly, especially if you want to live in the city proper. I can't speak personally for service jobs, but my understanding is that there are many many people trying to all get these jobs. Also, lots of people move out with an idealized portrait of the city. So you're likely going to get some flak for wanting to move here with no real prospects.  I'd recommend trying to find a job or housing, at least a place to crash before coming out. Living in a city with no money or support network can leave you in a bad way quickly."

askportland,36kltn,tossaway4856,1 point,Wed May 20 16:07:02 2015 UTC,You'll want to expect to pay $1000 a month in rent if you want to live in the city on your own. Finding roommates and living out of the city is best. Come with at least six months living expenses and a job already lined up. Jump on an apartment if you find one. If you're lucky and all your ducks line up its a great place to live. Unfortunately it's also very difficult to live here right now so opportunities aren't leaping out and making it easy for the dreamers (or the hard workers.)

It will be hard to get a place if you are not here physically and if you don't have a job. Most places require a proof of income along with good credit. I have a friend who moved here about a month ago and did couchsurfing, in fact, people who he is staying with are so nice they are letting him stay till he gets more money saved up to move into his own place.   Mid I had a big enough apartment I would let you stay at my  place but I only have  small 2 bedroom (myself, my bf, and 2 dogs). PM me, maybe we can work something out where you can crash with me for a couple of days or a well at least.

askportland,36ecty,cullyborn,4,Tue May 19 08:03:20 2015 UTC,"PSU has a great farmers market on Saturdays; downtown Beaverton also hosts a good one, too. Kennedy School and Edgefield make for great adventures as well- if you want to stay overnight at them, you can, and they all have multiple venues inside of them. Sauvie's Island has some fun day beaches for when the weather gets a bit warmer. Rose Gardens are always fun, though I prefer the Japanese Gardens. Hawethorne is old hat by this point but it's still something to do if you've never gone out there, and it's also adjacent to the Belmont District. We frequent the Laurelhurst Theatre and the Hollywood Theater, too, as they've a lot of stuff going on- Hollywood District in general has some fun restaurants and bars to boot. The Zoo is nice, though it will be crowded on a weekend (so take the Max). Fubonn, the Asian supermarket on 82nd and Powell, is a fun little adventure (though I confess I make the trip relatively regularly for groceries). If you're on the West Side and like poker or karaoke, Golden Crown in downtown Beaverton has great American-style Chinese food, poker (though I am not entirely sure if you have to be in the league or not) and karaoke. Plus, the restaurant is just fun to see (also it's near Ouajimaya, another fun Asian supermarket). You could go to the Mercado that just opened up out on the East Side (at like 78th and...I forget, but it's out there). Food wise...Olympic Provisions, Potato Champion, AND Café, Harlow, any of the McMenamins, Dick's Kitchen, Beau Thai, Red Curry Thai, the Montage, the Roxy, House of Louie....  I mean that's just Portland, but there are some ideas."

askportland,36bz1a,FootInTheMouth,2,Mon May 18 03:50:27 2015 UTC,"I notice the same clear out here in Hillsboro. My ISP is one very few people have - Clear, the WiMax ISP which I have heard will be shut down in November."
askportland,36bz1a,oldsweng,2,Mon May 18 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"We have a similar problem in Beaverton, right by Nike. Saturday and Sunday things get congested, same as when we lived way out in Hillsboro. We also switched providers. However, it's not local traffic (that is, the traffic feeding into the network from you and your neighbors)- you can get congested on your end of the network, though on your personal Wi-Fi network (this happens to us frequently, with two phones, two tablets, two laptops, a television and a hard-wired desktop all running through our router). The main reason you get congestion if your own network is freed up is that the server/site/service from which you're streaming can also get congested; this degrades your services. It doesn't have anything to do with what the content is, it is the traffic on the server/router in your home and the traffic on the server of the service you're trying to access. You might not remember but there was a minor kerfuffle a the last time that Game of Thrones or something started- HBO GO crashed because there were too many people trying to access the service at once. Sunday night is prime time for streaming services."
askportland,36bz1a,eridax700,2,Mon May 18 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"If you're capable of causing ""congestion"" on a home network, either it's poorly set up, or you have a junky router, or your devices are highly unusual. Under normal circumstances it shouldn't be possible for home usage to ever saturate a modern wi-fi network (an older 802.11g one, maybe). Maybe you just need a proper router properly configured?  Also, the kind of ""content"" absolutely does matter. Many ISPs shape the traffic going to their bargain class (residential) customers in ways they would never mess with business/corporate clients, and that includes deliberately degrading things like video chat or streaming media. Comcast for example is famous for doing all kinds of packet inspection and throttling."
askportland,36bz1a,trackofalljades,1 point,Mon May 18 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't set up our home network; my partner who does systems administration and networking stuff for a Large Portland Chip Manufacturer set it up and when he says the network is saturated, that's what I go with. I don't know the details. We did have a shitty router that caused most of our problems; a new one improved performance but occasionally it does still act up.   Also, if you read OPs post, they are clearly not talking about throttling based on content type (streaming video vs. video chatting vs. streamed music vs. surfing vs. etc). OP is talking about like-kind streamed content where there is no difference from a data-content standpoint- the only difference is watching an old episode of a show versus a new episode. It would be news to me if an ISP were provided that level of scrutiny, e.g. ""the people watching old Netflix shows don't get to watch them at full resolution/without buffering/etc because we need to provide access to those seeking new content."" Further, if anything, the ISP's would seemingly be motivated to demote in demand (i.e. new) content in order to bilk more money from the content providers. Demoting video traffic as opposed to web surfing is one thing- and you're right, they're notorious for it- but filtering at that level (old vs. new streamed video) is another beast, and that's what OP was talking about."
askportland,36bz1a,eridax700,1 point,Mon May 18 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that was my initial assumption. However, I was trying to watch the 1st few episodes of the new season of Louie that aired 5 weeks ago and I was still getting buffering messages. I was also the only one on my network. Although, it may have continuously just been bad servers, based on my experience that would be a pretty extreme coincidence with it so happening to be a Sunday night. However, if the links are from the same sites as the populuar shows, I guess it wouldnt matter."
askportland,36bz1a,trackofalljades,2,Mon May 18 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"I've been watching all the usual popular Sunday shows without incident, and I think what you're running into is totally an ISP issue and nothing to do with the CDNs for HBO or whomever being heavily loaded. Portland is very well served, CDN-wise.  You probably have ""residential"" class service, which is a ""best effort"" deal where the ISP turns down your bandwidth whenever they want to make sure they provide enough to their other kinds of customers. I hate Comcast as much as anyone, but since I have no other choice at my current address, I use their ""business"" service.   Whenever your Internet is slow and buggy, it's because Comcast is giving that speed to people like me. Mine is rock solid. It doesn't even cost much more, maybe $3-5/month or something if you compare real rates and not intro silliness. Maybe consider getting a ""business"" account."

Watch out for state troopers.  Coming back, it really depends on what part of Portland you're heading to. I-5 north of 26/the Terwilliger Curves becomes a headache at the end of the day with all the traffic heading back to Vancouver. If you're in SE or SW, you should be looking at around 45-50 minutes. Anywhere north of that, you should tack on a half hour at least, and start learning side street work-arounds."

And yeah, our Chinatown is nothing anymore.   I guess, just sort of rambling, but when you say ""large Chinese population"", if you're thinking that you'll find something on the magnitude of, say, Seattle's Chinatown or Chinese community, you won't really find that here. My Chinese friends (foreign exchange students that emigrated here for school and now live here) generally go to Seattle for any sort of authentic experience; the community here is simply not as a concentrated as it is elsewhere (Portland isn't a ""big city"" per se, but that's a whole different story)."

Hiking-wise, I really like Wahclella; it's pretty easy (it's a bit of a climb and it's unpaved but you don't need to scramble or anything. If you hate heights, skip this one since there's a steep dropoff on one side) and the scenery is beautiful. If you get tired of waterfalls, the Mosier tunnels are really cool - you go through the tunnels built during the 1920s for the original Columbia River Highway."

Multnomah might still be crowded though. If you're heading out on 84, there will be signs if the parking lot is full. Multnomah Falls are a weird one, because the falls themselves are beautiful, but it's RIGHT off the freeway, so it's not like some tranquil haven in the woods :) But since it's so easy to go there and get a beautiful picture, everyone does it. Ooh, and other good places if you want nice views of the gorge would be Vista House and the nearby Women's Forum. Really great panoramas up there, just beware of high winds, especially at Vista House."

askportland,36azso,wastro82,3,Mon May 18 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"Multnomah Falls might be THE most popular place in Oregon and is well worth a visit.  The Columbia Gorge Scenic Highway is pretty stunning, and you should at least drive up to the Vista House for some amazing Gorge views.  Another great hike is Angel's Rest. It's pretty close in (about a half-hour outside of Portland) and is only about 5 miles round-trip, but it offers 270-degree views at the top. The views are absolutely spectacular.  Eagle Creek, about 45-60 minutes out of Portland, is a pretty easy hike with some cool waterfalls (Punchbowl Falls is about two miles in and is pretty unique, and you get to go through a tunnel behind, well, Tunnel Falls at the 12-mile mark). Highly recommended! Just make sure to keep all valuables out of sight (if you have to bring them at all) and lock your car before setting off. Break-ins are way too common there.  Just past Hood River, the McCall Nature Preserve offers some of the best wildflower displays in the Gorge right now. The balsamroot (those yellow flowers) is just past its peak, but the lupine (cone-shaped purple flowers) is in full bloom. A meadow at the top offers views of Mount Hood, Mount Adams, the Columbia River, and the natural curves and formations of the Gorge. Truly stunning.  You can't go to the Gorge without hitting up some amazing brewpubs out that way after the hike. Pfriem, Thunder Island, Full Sail, Walking Man, and Double Mountain are all pretty fantastic."

I know downtown areas are quite expensive. We are staying multiple days in Seattle and San Francisco, so I didn't mind staying in the downtown area to beat traffic - especially since we're staying through the week. Ultimately, my thought is that since it would be a Saturday morning that we would be going into downtown without any issues in traffic. Whereas, in San Francisco, staying out of town on a Monday and Tuesday morning could cost extra hours.  I'm not opposed to staying downtown at all. Just realizing that we'll come downtown to do the markets on Saturday, as well as the books, but I haven't necessarily found anything ""must do"" for Friday night.

I think there also might be some cheaper hotels in the NW which would offer more to do in the immediate area.  I got married last year, and I know a couple of my guests found a pretty affordable hotel over there.  Maybe check airbnb as well?"

Especially with a 9 month old, which is what has kept from from airbnb. Most whole homes for rent are the same as rooms.

askportland,36anlz,rabbitSC,2,Mon May 18 01:38:11 2015 UTC,The alternative to downtown is the Lloyd center area. Not much to do there. But with a little one you are likely either stuck inside or out and about anyway. Its a short hop to all downtown things and probably $100/night cheaper.

This may mean visiting them during slow hours or find out where they hang out after work. It's called market research and reddit is not the way to do market research. Have you gone to local farmers markets(more than one!) to see if anyone is selling snails? That's one part of competition research. I would think that some of the local fish markets like Flying Fish might be interested in carrying snails. Call them and find out. Research, research, research, then spend appropriately. Trying to sell direct to individuals would be so hit-and-miss I don't think it would be worth the time unless you had a booth at a farmers market."

askportland,363jt4,bomburdoo,6,Fri May 15 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"You'll have to sift through a bit, but here is a directory of Intentional Communities in the Northwest.  Most, if not all, of the ones in Portland proper are co-op condo type set-up where you have your own unit, but there is shared common space or gardens.  There are some in ""sketchier"" neighborhoods because it is cheap, but coming from Chicago this is moot.  They are not sketchy, but they are cheaper.  It sounds like you may already have known about most of these places.  As far as ""intentional communities"" that aren't actually intentional communities, pretty much take your pick of inner Eastside neighborhoods.  There is a lot of community involvement here and most neighborhoods have community garden space of some form.  The Urban Farm Collective is a good group with true community plots.  All produce is pooled and you get a certain take of the harvest dependent on your volunteer hours.  If you are aware of the Permaculture scene, Mark Lakeman is from Portland and did his first community building projects in SE Portland neighborhoods.  Check out The City Repair Project.  Portland is very neighborhood centric, which lends to a small community vibe.  My neighborhood, for example, has an Urban Farm Collective garden, a community driven and maintained street mural, a gardening club, a permaculture homesite that hosts cob and garden workshops, multiple neighborhood bulletin boards, in addition to your coffee shop, small produce market/deli, neighborhood brewery, etc. etc.  If you land in one of the neighborhoods it really does take on a small town vibe.  Most people know their neighbors and end up chatting on the sidewalk.  When our mail carrier had an illness the neighborhood started a food drive to take her casseroles and things.  Anyway, I guess my point is, even if you aren't living in an intentional community it's easy to create that lifestyle here."

Quick overview:   Crosswalks may give the pedestrian a false measure of confidence and privilege in crossing the street because they are seen as a ""shield"" from traffic. At every intersection there exists ""invisible"" crosswalks where pedestrians may cross unless there are signs saying that pedestrians should not cross. Crosswalks do not increase the number of crossing opportunities. Although Oregon law favors pedestrians in many cases, the law stipulates certain rights and responsibilities walkers should adhere to, and should use caution and common sense when crossing the street with traffic present.

Uber: Probably $25-35 depending on time of day and traffic.  Uber and Cab will likely take 20-40 minutes depending.   You may be pushing that 625 Greyhound no matter what frankly.  Your best bet may to be to a later schedule like the 7PM Amtrak Thruway or the 9:30PM Amtrak. That's around $28. That way you should probably be able to MAX.

CentryLink is (slowly) rolling out 1Gbps fiber, but it may not hit your area right away. Pockets in Southeast have it already. Don't be fooled by their FTTN ""fiber"" option- delivered via phone line at 12Mbps. Their DSL is awful.  There are a few smaller/independent providers who do wimax and whatever wireless services but they're terrible for gaming."

We had an extended outage this weekend, but this was the first major one in my six months with them and I had a few outages with Comcast as well. With CL, you just have to check specific addresses to see what they have -- a lot of places are stuck at 1.5 and it's kind of a crapshoot what you'll get."

askportland,35qmr4,cftvgybhu,3,Tue May 12 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"Last I checked most new subscribers have to sign for at least a 2 year contract and you'll start off with promotional speeds/services which end after 6 months. Fortunately I've been off contract for like 6 years. But in order to get higher than basic speeds (Blast service) I'd have to go on contract again and sign up for other services. You might be able to sign up without a contract or a lesser term, I dunno.  Fortunately Comcast is losing their bargaining power as Google Fiber flirts with our market and CentryLink expands their fiber service. If you go outside the city core you have more options like Verizon Fios."
askportland,35qmr4,cftvgybhu,1 point,Tue May 12 18:48:34 2015 UTC,Part of why I don't want to sign into a 2 year contract is because if google fiber comes I want to be the first one to sign up.  :)
askportland,35qmr4,smellsoffriendship,2,Tue May 12 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you, but they already passed on Portland for their next roll out which means it will be a while before we're in the running again. And even if they do choose to come to town it will take a while for them to get their network up/expanded.  I'm pretty sure Google Fiber won't be available to Portlanders in the next 24 months so your contract will likely expire by the time you have the opportunity to switch.  On the other hand you could sign up with CentryLink (whatever they provide in your hood) and cross your fingers that they'll roll out their fiber to your street in the near future. Much more likely to reach you within 2 years, but you'll have to put up with whatever DSL/FTTN crap until then."

I've heard second hand that many purposely distance themselves from the African American community for a variety of reasons and was curious if that is true.
askportland,35ltjh,hamellr,4,Tue May 12 04:35:48 2015 UTC,"Within Portland, as that's the only city I can actually say I've got a read on, from what I can tell it's more of a cultural divide. A lot of things that recent African immigrants would never do or let themselves be associated with is commonplace in what most people consider black culture in America. Many come here and find their own subculture and don't identify as African American because they're simply not. In my mind, I wonder more why anybody would assume African immigrants would latch on to African American culture. I mean, rhetorically, would you really assume moving to a new country that you would associate more with your race or more with your culture? You'd probably be more likely to make friends with some other Americans (if you're American) than say the half Irish half Chinese guys from Hong Kong where you're living. You'd have nothing in common with them, not nearly to the amount that you would with other Americans.  Sorry if that wandered a little, I'm a touch distracted cooking a late breakfast.

askportland,35ltjh,rubba_dubba,3,Mon May 11 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"WARNING: white person pontificating on race  I think there's two different ways to look at being black in Portland: you've lived here for decades, or you just moved here. You're moving here with a job offer so you should be able to afford to live in a decent place. If your problems don't revolve around money, you shouldn't have any problem being black here. Portland is super liberal and there is really zero overt racism here (except in the comments section of OregonLive articles -- never read the comments on OregonLive). Portland is incredibly liberal and we'll be happy to have you here. You'll never get a ""you're not from around here, are you?"" if you walk into the wrong establishment and you probably won't get shot by the cops (unless you're also mentally ill).  The real difficulty with being black in Portland is being someone who's lived here long enough to have experienced when Portland wasn't so harmonious. Oregon was incredibly racist up until a lot more recently than we'd like to admit, and black people were redlined into North Portland, they were denied the opportunity to buy their homes, blocks of houses were bulldozed for freeways and hospitals (some of which never got built) and now that it's the trendiest part of town, people can't afford to stay there anymore and they're seeing their community torn apart to build bike lanes and Whole Foods. But that sort of thing is happening everywhere. This is an idea of the kinds of issues we're dealing with: http://www.kgw.com/story/news/2014/07/26/12605382/  You shouldn't be concerned about coming here. In fact, you should come here.

There are many dogs here that do not receive any vet care, and you need to take steps to protect your dog if you plan on visiting parks (including dog parks).  We vaccinate our dogs against lyme and leptospirosis in addition to the core vaccines because we do go camping and hiking.  It may be overkill, but I prefer smaller medical bills upfront than large unplanned ones - for people and pets."

Like I don't do bordatella every 6 months since my dog is never boarded and we don't go to dog parks. I didn't know if Lyme disease in dogs was a serious concern. Where I currently live (Columbus, OH) this isn't something we really have to worry about. We have heartworm and fleas here, but as far as I'm aware there are some parts of the country that don't have any.   We've had too many bad experiences at dog parks so we don't go to them anymore. We have a nice city Park near us that has trails through the woods and large open area that acts as an ""unofficial"" dog park. The majority of people that go there have dogs and they run off leash. We love going there. My dog likes to say hi and play with another dog occasionally, and the rest of the time we enjoy hiking together. From my experience the people at that park are more responsible than people at dog parks, and the dogs are much more well behaved. Are there any parks close to SE Portland that are like this?"
askportland,35lqr7,lexuh,2,Mon May 11 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, there's little to no Lyme in Oregon. If you're going to be taking your dog into the wilderness at all (hiking or camping), leptospirosis and giardia vaccines would be wise. I make sure to use a flea prevention med that also prevents ticks because we go hiking and camping in dry, grassy range land, and my dog picks up ticks like crazy.  I skip flea and tick prevention during the colder months, but that's a personal choice. Heartworm year round, for sure."

In my experience, downtown Portland is full of unpredictable people using all modes of transportation, and a lot of them seem to think that they are above the law. Drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and skateboarders alike. I haven't honked my horn in years. I don't get honked at often either. I also ride a bike sometimes, and am a pedestrian a lot of the time.I'm better than most people at all those things though.   Except for the people like me.  it's everyone else who's the problem.  At the end of the day, these are all people."

During the summer Portland is flooded with homeless and shelters fill up fast. If you have a skill you may be able to find work. The unemployment level is really low right now. This town is a magnet for the unskilled and homeless so you will have competition for a job. The common response here is ""have a job before moving"" and that is very good advice. Housing is in short supply and therefore expensive. The waiting lists for low cost housing are years long. Have I discouraged you yet?"

And by single person, does that mean you want to live by yourself? $800 could work for that but not in Portland proper, unless you happen to find a micro-studio (about 150 sq ft) but that still wouldn't cover utilities. Or you could look for roommates. But really what would be best is find a job first and then find somewhere nearby to live, because you'll end up hating life if you find a cheap apartment in Forest Grove but get a job in Troutdale."

askportland,35bmz4,Gliese667,2,Fri May 8 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the job market here is not so great and the rental market is extremely tight. So it's a bad combination for people who want to move here and aren't wealthy or already have a job lined up. And unfortunately your situation isn't very unique - a lot of people want a fresh start or they like the idea of living in Portland but don't have a job moving them here or a ton of savings, so I think that makes some orgs less likely to take an interest in someone who isn't established here."
askportland,35bmz4,mossandbooks,1 point,Fri May 8 20:30:05 2015 UTC,does this make people more selective about who they agree to take in as a roommate? What if you're waving your savings at them but aren't employed in the city/ work at home?
askportland,35bmz4,Gliese667,1 point,Mon May 11 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"I think people looking for roommates are going to be picky since the demand is bigger than the supply, so they have the luxury to be selective.   I would say as long as the work at home setup is an established, reasonable income in the range of what other people in the household make, that should be fine. But if it's something like ""I sold $50 of handmade soap on Etsy this month"" or ""I found this opportunity online where I can make up to $80k a month working from home!"" then people looking for roommates aren't likely to be open to that."
askportland,35bmz4,mossandbooks,1 point,Mon May 11 18:52:22 2015 UTC,good tip on having similar income range as the rest of household - I'll keep this in mind.

Seemed like a suburb that's kind of bland and boring (there didn't seem to be much in the way of nice trees and scenery that you get in the rest of Portland) from what I could tell when I visited. Probably some kind of commute (30 min max I would guess). I have a hard time quantifying traffic times in Portland since everything seemed very reasonable compared to where I live.

askportland,34xul2,mfiasco,3,Tue May 5 18:26:55 2015 UTC,"Roseway  Pros: Nice, quiet residential neighborhood. Big, old houses on large lots. Lots of trees and wildlife. Little traffic due to the narrow roads and dead-ends. Can walk to groceries, dining, and drinking on Sandy. The 12 bus line runs fairly frequently and gets you into the city center reasonably quickly. Can walk to MAX if you like the exercise. Good biking networks. Extremely friendly people.  Cons: A little farther out of the heart of the city than most people would like to be. Sandy, while steadily improving, is still kind of grungy and ugly and horrible to cross. They just tore down an old church to build a Walgreens and its parking lot across the street from the Safeway and Comcast service centers and their giant parking lot. When you get into the 70s and especially 82nd, it gets a little rough. Hope you like the 12, because there aren't any other convenient options for taking transit in the city, and Sandy could use priority bus lanes to bypass the awful rush hour traffic. Safeway sucks and there are no other grocery stores. Could stand to diversify some of the business offerings - it's like 75% Vietnamese and Thai restaurants (though that is starting to change).  When I was buying a house, I did not intend to live in this area, but the market pushed us out here. All in all, I'm happy here. I wish I lived in a hipper/closer-in/more transit-friendly area, it's a little too suburban but it's a good place to live."

It's between the perennially up-and-coming St. John's and Kenton neighborhoods and just north of the University Park neighborhood. It's a little more affordable, but not really within easy walking distance of any business districts. On the north side of the neighborhood you have the New Columbia housing project, which is a remarkable example of how to fix public housing. On the south side of the neighborhood things tend to be a little higher income, but it definitely ain't no street of dreams.  The homes range from absolute heaps to $500K+ and everything in between.  It's generally modest homes, but older ones in really bad shape are getting razed and replaced with 2500 sq. ft. behemoths. There's a bunch of in-fill as well.  Columbia Park is a gem.  There are lots of families with young kids as it's one of the more ""affordable"" close-in neighborhoods."

Otherwise you're going to be living on the wrong side of town and making insufferable commutes. Beaverton/Hillsboro aren't so bad and they're definitely where you want to live if you're working on that side of the west hills.  If you think you can get a job at the airport, anywhere along I-205 or 82nd Ave will make for a good commute and you'll probably find OK prices (though the neighborhoods might suck).

Most of the questions /r/askportland fields, the questions probably seem urgent enough that an outdated FAQ would be meaningless.  Don't get me wrong, the questions here are repetitive. I feel like they're being asked by people who are either:  1) Too lazy to google  2) Interested in personal interaction  3) Trolling  FAQs don't really help in those cases.  On the other hand, it's impossible for us to know how many people use do the FAQ and never ask a question, so it could be that we'd cut down on a lot of activity if the right link was stickied."

Idk, it's frustrating how many god damn people are on this planet...and seeing what has happened to the bay area is really frustrating because I already live in a good area for what I want, but what its becoming I can't stand anymore..not to mention the fucking drought so I'm getting out before everyone else decides to. Unfortunately yeah they're all probably heading north too...  Its frustrating that I genuinely want to try Portland out, and for being vegan/art-field it seems right, but then these past few days lurking in this sub wanting to research knowing alllllll the others that are trying to do the same for the same reasons I guess and having to compete just sucks. For seeing the whole tech/corp takeover in the bay, I admire Portland for its strong community and the people power to want to take care of its city and try to keep it its own, but I guess the effects of being ""popular"" everyone out there's just gonna ruin it wanting to join the club and I guess I'm just one of those...  Kinda why for the sake of this post I am also interested in areas that aren't Portland, but maybe have a future slower developement.

I know people who live in Portland, and their commute is horrible. If you're planning on getting to work between 8am and 9am, and going home around 5pm, you're going to be spending a lot of your free time driving.  Additionally, I don't know of any apartments for that cheap, in Hillsboro, Beaverton or Portland. In Hillsboro, you'll get a very nice apartment for around $800 to $1000 a month, which you should be able to afford just fine on an intern salary.  Shoot me a PM and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about Intel, the surrounding area, etc. I work at Jonesfarm, but will likely be moving to Hawthorne soon."

I'd look in Goose Hollow - it's your only hope.  However you could live out in Hillsboro and be close to work and enjoy that side of things for much closer to your budget, and just take MAX right in to town for fun. Only drawback there is the lines shut down pretty early, like around midnight or earlier.  Driving with the flow of commuter traffic will take much longer than 20 minutes. I've had it take me 90 minutes to get out there, although that is on the worst days. I imagine 45 is probably closer to reality more days than not?

askportland,34jzru,pdxsean,10,Fri May 1 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"Portland is super walkable. If you're staying downtown (on the west side of the Willamette) then you'll be able to walk to most of the interesting attractions in Portland. Light rail and bus service is super convenient from downtown and pretty comprehensive for the city. I live just west of downtown and haven't driven in like two years.  Renting a car is completely unnecessary if you're planning on staying in-town, but of course if you're going to take time out to hike and see the outdoors it is totally worth it. The drawback of course is if you're here over Memorial Day weekend all of the hiking and such will be super crowded, but if you go on like Tuesday or Wednesday of the same week you'll really be able to enjoy what Oregon has to offer.  BTW here's my visitor's guide, which is pretty downtown-centric... unless noted otherwise most of this is within walking distance of the downtown hotels.  First some basics:  Washington Park. This is a great old park with a lot of neat things to see. Good hiking trails, Rose Garden with nice view of the city. Pittock Mansion. The place for the postcard view of downtown. Also giant mansion from late 19th century newspaper baron. Portland Japanese Garden. In Washington Park, often considered the best in the world outside Japan.    Food : Blue Plate downtown has great lunches, it's a sort of old fashioned diner. Bunk Sandwiches are also a local favorite. Over on the east side, I love City State Cafe for breakfast/lunch as well. It's right near the Laurelhurst if you insist on seeing a movie (something I rarely do on vacation) and in an interesting neighborhood to explore. Screen Door is another much-favored restaurant over there and they are really good. Arrive early or be prepared to wait - especially if you try to hit their weekend brunch.    Food Carts are a Portland institution. You'll find massive collections (or pods) of them all over the city. Downtown pods include SW 10th and Alder (Taste of India and Frying Scotsman recommended!) SW 5th and Washington and SW 3rd and Washington. As well as several other places around town. Avoid carts that serve a wide range of items (ie burgers, shwarma, and fried rice simultaneously) and focus on places that specialize in one type of food. There's tons of great stuff and it's mostly very cheap.    Bonus food: Italian - Ristorante Roma, Grassa. Pho - Pho Hung, Pho Da'Lat. Coffee: Coffeehouse Northwest, Case Study, Bipartisan Cafe.    Neighborhoods: Portland has a ton of interesting neighborhoods, often named after the major streets. North Williams, Hawthorne/Belmont, Albina, Division, NW 23rd, Sellwood/Moreland. The list goes on and on. They're neat and fun to explore.    Parks: Among the many I mentioned, my actual favorite park of all in Portland is Lower Macleay Park. It's convenient to downtown but feels like you're hiking in the woods. Great stream (named after Oregon's first death penalty recipient) along the trail and really cool abandoned WPA restroom about 2 miles in. Easy access to Forest Park, and a modest hike to Pittock Mansion.    Mount Tabor is another interesting park with a great view of Portland and downtown. If you're going to be over near it it's worth visiting, but it's not like walking distance from downtown or anything. Easy access from Trimet.    If you have a car, go to the coast, it's beautiful. Ecola State Park (Indian Beach specifically) is really nice and has some good hiking. If you want somewhere less touristy (and nicer) drive down to Pacific City and check out Cape Kiwanda. Or visit Fort Stevens near Astoria.    Also, if you have a car, get out to the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is amazing, but if you want a hike don't hike there, either check out Eagle Creek (just west of Cascade Locks) or Wahkeena Falls trail up to Fairy Falls or Wahkeena Springs.    Silver Falls state park down near Salem is amazing, and there are tons of Willamette Valley wineries to the south/southwest of Portland to explore.    Portland has a good art museum with a solid permanent collection. Our parks system is really strong, lots of great parks.    Portland Farmer's Market is at PSU on Saturday mornings, it's really neat. Portland's Saturday Market, also downtown on the waterfront, is worth seeing if you're here on a weekend. It's pretty touristy but if you're not a jaded local it's a good place to check out.     A worthy destination for any gamer is Ground Kontrol, Portland's famous barcade. While other cities have jumped on the bandwagon, GK has been bringing old-school arcade action to Portland for 15 years. Their pinball collection is pretty amazing, as is their great collection of classics arcade consoles.    Another Portland landmark that is pretty famous but well worth visiting is Powell's City of Books downtown at 10th and W Burnside. If you like bookstores, check this place out. It's pretty incredible. You can literally (and easily) get lost in the massive collection they have.    Finally, the South Park Blocks are a pretty interesting historic area of town. Really nice to walk, although they do attract a lot of homeless people. This is where you'll find the art museum as well as the Oregon Historical Society museum.    Here's some things I'd avoid if you're looking for quality fun as opposed to overhyped tourist nonsense:    Voodoo Doughnuts - Go to Blue Star (fancy) or Coco (traditional) instead. Underground/Shanghai Tours - These are the worst. Just walk around look at old buildings and read plaques in Old Town and you'll see more history. Pink Bus Tour - They cover some ground, but almost all of it can be seen via transit/walking (and is almost all included in my list) so you'll save time and money. They have pamphlets you can pick up at Pioneer Square if you want to replicate their route.  Have a fun visit."

askportland,34jzru,kangaroosfuzzypouch,3,Fri May 1 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"You can see a lot here in three days, especially with your plan to enjoy the outdoors separately. The downtown attractions are easy to get to so you can hop around pretty well. For instance, Saturday Market to Ground Kontrol to Powell's to 9th and Alder Food Carts to South Park Blocks to Oregon Historical Society to Pioneer Square is a pretty good loop that will show you a lot of history and variety (and ""Portland"" feel) and can be done easily in one day. Then a second day to check out our unique neighborhoods - Hawthorne or Mississippi or NW 23rd or many others, depending on your priorities - using Trimet and get more of that ""Portland"" feel. A third day would give you time to explore the parks or return to things or whatever.  I'm just glad you're going to enjoy the outdoors away from PDX/SEA while you're here, the best part of the NW is out amazing outdoor recreation. And Seattle is pretty cool, lots bigger than Portland if not quite as unique, you could easily fill days up there."

The car may be gone when you're ready to leave, but you can use the app to find a new one. As long as you stay in the popular areas (which sounds like you will be), you won't have trouble finding a vehicle available. It's not the best option if you anticipate spending a lot of time outside of city limits, but it'll work for everything in town.

As I'm sure you know, if you work hard and show up every day it's not hard to get into a shift lead or whatever position and do OK.  Minimum Wage in Washington is over $9/hr so it's not outside of the realm of possibility to make $1500/mo that way, but it does seem like it would be exhausting."

askportland,34liyh,pdxsean,1 point,Sat May 2 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"Well $4K doesn't seem like much money although having a roommate built-in will really help. I guess if you're willing to take the first job you can find and basically stretch your dollars until you start making decent money you'll be OK. Having a local connection will really help you find your way around, know which neighborhoods to look for work in, etc.  It sounds like you're pretty responsible in general so hopefully you're planning to work hard and make it go. It'd definitely be tight and of course it's a risk but nothing in life is guaranteed.  If you're looking to live in Vancouver and work in Portland - which may be the case if you want to work your way up at a decent restaurant - then the commute can be a real nightmare."
askportland,34liyh,pdxsean,1 point,Sat May 2 19:33:01 2015 UTC,I should add I won't have a deposit to pay when I move in as my cousin is already renting the house. He's basically just charging us a portion of the rent ro live there. I was hoping to get a job near or in Vancouver at first just so I'm secure financially then I planned on looking for the more preferable jobs.
askportland,34liyh,pdxsean,1 point,Sat May 2 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense. I mean if your cousin is able to help out in the most dire circumstances - that is to say, if you faced homelessness he would let you stay there and feed you for free until you get on your feet - then absolutely you should move here. If this isn't the case, I assume you could eventually end up back at a parent's house or something, in which case why not move here? However if your alternative is to run out of money and get kicked out of your cousins house and end up homeless... well I'll say you wouldn't be the first in Portland. Things are great here it's true but it's not a magical wonderland; drug addiction, poverty, and bad relationships ruin plenty of lives out here too."

Honestly I know it's dumb but I feel like there's no better time to move because I have so little holding me down. All I own is my bike and car. I don't think Portland is where I'll end up for many years but I feel like everything sort of fell into place this way and it doesn't hurt that it's a great city :P  To add to this I would like to think I'm at an advantage over most other young transplants as I'm not too proud to work a crap job.

askportland,34h9rs,tedder42,3,Fri May 1 04:07:00 2015 UTC,"Well, for better or worse, I'd shoot for getting a 4-year degree.  Many companies want it, irrespective of your skill level.  It's lame, but it's a weed out thing for less experienced employees.  You probably won't be able to get into security straight away.  I'd start by learning how networks work (heh) since that becomes key to understanding network security.  Later you can get into more serious stuff.  Look around for local security groups.  2600 is a bit dated, but might help to find other like-minded folk.  If you want to work on server/host security, think about learning to program (probably C, maybe C++/Go, but you'd need a solid understanding of how pointers and C work regardless).  Personally, I'd start with networking.  It's super-valuable, generally overlooked in most small/mid-sized IT departments, and can be a job unto itself, and doesn't require a ton of arcane programming/computer knowledge."

I still recommend a 4-year degree now because are asking for it again)."
askportland,34h9rs,Saucysauce,2,Fri May 1 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"yeah, obviously that (and what I'm about to say) is a very broad brush, I know exceptions myself, but there's a lot of truth- self-taught means it's harder to get in the door and you are more likely to lack theoretical knowledge. OTOH I've interviewed plenty of four-year and six-year grads who couldn't do a sample problem, let alone communicate.  I have, and will, hire people anywhere on that spectrum. I'm sure plenty of people (and shops) will. That doesn't mean everyone is like that.  My bit of career advice is to avoid helpdesk and sysadmin. I think they are dying (from BYOD and 'cloud'/software-driven devops). At the beginning of your career you can't spend time building a skillset in a stale area- you only get to roll the d20 for a few skills, after all. Later you might have a dozen major skills and you can ignore one."
askportland,34h9rs,tedder42,1 point,Fri May 1 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  I recommend education because I recognize I'm an anomaly and, really, it helps in the first few years of a career.  +1 for avoiding helpdesk (pigeon holing is strong in this department) and sysadmin (you'll have to compete with very experienced folks in a shrinking job market, long-term)."

In early March, I plant peas, spinach, carrots, etc that I can harvest through May. I then transition to tomatoes, peppers, and tomatillos in most places with being able to harvest until the winter rains begin, usually in mid-October. You can also plant overwintering crops, some that you can harvest mid-Winter, but I generally don't do those as they require valuable plot space in July and August. I grow hot peppers every year in Portland. For your garden, you'll be dealing pretty much exclusively with transplants. They just can't grow outside until early-to-mid June, and it's too late to start from seed then. I transplant starts around June 15th each year and have PLENTY of peppers by the time sunlight becomes too dim. I have no experience with tropical fruit, so I can't be much help there. I have seen people with smallish orange/lime/lemon trees, but they routinely bring those inside in the winter. Tomatoes are probably the local favorite in terms of veggies, along with peppers. But every major garden plant is pretty common, with spinach super easy to grow. For a real NW flavor, you could grow Hops and start your own beer-brewing enterprise. Most locations west of the cascades are pretty similar, with differences in the effective growing season. Portland has a longer growing season than Seattle (by about 4-6 weeks or so), while Eugene is about 4 weeks or so longer than Portland. The book I linked to above has some great tables for determining effective growing seasons in the region."
askportland,34gwo7,ExiledOkie,0,Fri May 1 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Sweet! I'm off to a good start! If we move to Portland, it's not going to be Portland proper, but somewhere in the area. Eugene may be another place we'd like to look at and wasn't originally on our list, but I like the one extra month of gardening aspect. We may have to take a detour! This is a bit off topic, but how is Eugene compared to Portland as far as jobs and housing prices go (if you know)?  One thing I was mostly concerned about is whether or not hot peppers can get truly hot. I say that because we had a fairly mild summer last year and a lot of my hot peppers didn't even get hot, like my Trinidad Scorpion for example. I wasn't sure how much unfiltered sun you all get over there, or if that even matters.  Hops would be a good business eh? One of these days... If I had half a brain, I'd grow them here. We have a lot of breweries in this area too that would gladly buy them, but my dream is to one day open a brewery. I just need to get a lot more brews under my belt.  I'm sure I'll buy the book after our trip. I think we'd appreciate the west coast lifestyle over deep south, so we're most likely going to end up there someday anyway.

askportland,34gwo7,ExiledOkie,2,Fri May 1 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"Eugene is certainly less expensive than Portland in terms of home prices, and cheaper if you live in Springfield or a few miles outside of town. In almost any career, Eugene will have fewer options than Portland just due to the differences in size, not factoring in airport access, etc.  Given that most peppers need sun the most, I think you'll find the PNW fairly hospital to peppers. Our summer is almost exclusively dry and sunny from July through September -- rain (or even clouds) are fairly rare with high temperatures from 70 to 80 degrees. Nighttime temps around 60 degrees. Your biggest enemy may be time as sometimes the spring rains don't end until mid-July while the winter rains beginning in early October."

Some pretty decent sized 100M companies. A lot of workers are at the temp agency because it can lead to direct-placement or temp-to-hire fairly common.

askportland,34exmb,duffrey,5,Thu Apr 30 16:11:34 2015 UTC,Return them where you bought them. Larger grocery stores will have machines where you put them in to get the count. There are stores that are cleaner and less busy than others. Cider bottles aren't returnable.
askportland,34exmb,yestanotherusername,4,Thu Apr 30 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"All of the answers so far are correct: deposit comes with bizarre exceptions (cider, wine, liquor—for now), and depending on your proximity to a bottle drop, you either take them there or return them to the point of purchase.  What they haven't said is that the system pretty much guarantees that redemption isn't worth it. Bottle returns are a stinky time sink and bottle drops are a racket. Consider it a perverse tax for the convenience of your recycling bin."
askportland,34exmb,champs,4,Thu Apr 30 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"For instance: the Fred Meyer on Interstate near my old place in North Portland was about a mile and some change away. It was an easy trip on MAX and maybe even a doable walk without a bike or car.   One day I needed cash and some exercise, so I gathered up all the bottles in the house, loaded them in my bike trailer, and went down to Freddy's. I spent half an hour waiting for, then fighting with the machines for a whopping payout of about five bucks. That ain't minimum wage.  It's now in a Bottle Drop district. That place is another two miles away, and not on the MAX line—just enough hassle to negate the relative ease of that system."
askportland,34exmb,champs,4,Thu Apr 30 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"If you return them once, you will put them in the recycle bin at the street thereafter. You might as well save yourself the hassle."

That means everything from your large grocery stores (such as Fred Meyer, Safeway, Whole Foods) to the tiny corner store. Bigger stores are most likely to have automatic machines, making the redemption less of a hassle.  The one exception are in ""bottle drop service districts"" (my term, not a legal one) such as the area around Gateway. In that case, the stores no longer offer redemptions and all traffic is directed to the Bottle Drop at 122nd and Glisan."

askportland,34d0hx,lexuh,3,Thu Apr 30 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"As other commenters are stating, rain isn't the problem. Save up and invest in good rain gear (pants and jacket) that are breathable yet waterproof. Having a base layer of some sort is really helpful as it wicks away sweat while keeping you warm from cutting winter winds. Some headgear (such as beanie) that will fit under your helmet is vital to keeping your ears warm.  Don't neglect other gear, such as good lights since, as in winter you may be commuting to and from work in the dark. Fenders are also a necessity."

askportland,34aqrz,outinthedesert,13,Wed Apr 29 17:31:56 2015 UTC,"You're definitely going to hit traffic if you drive but you're somewhat doing a reverse commute. I don't think you'll have too many problems getting to work in the morning but the freeway exchange by the river is going to be clusterfucked when you're trying to get home.  You might consider biking to the MAX (that is our light rail system) and taking it towards the Airport, the red line goes all the way there and that way you can read a paper or something instead of just sitting in traffic.  Just to ballpark it you'll be looking at 30 min to an hour depending on route and traffic. Maybe a little more for being tucked all the way back in Goose Hollow."
askportland,34aqrz,cinemabaroque,3,Wed Apr 29 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"Seconding MAX as probably the best option.  MAX isn't perfect though - it's known to have delays every so often, usually in the evening. If you're working at a place that says ""8 am on the dot each morning or you're fired"" you might want to consider that.  If you drive, I think you'll find it a bear each morning to get across the river to east side and reverse so on the way back. You'll find roughly 40 to 50% of your commute time is going to be in the 2 miles close to your home.  It was hinted at in the above post, but biking is another option. Based on your location, it might be an hour or so each way and will pretty easy as there are a few E-W bikeways on the east side. Start slow by splitting with MAX (you can take your bike on there) and build up your stamina."

askportland,34aqrz,ExiledOkie,2,Wed Apr 29 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"Brooklyn wouldn't be that bad either as your wife could hop across the Ross Island to get to OHSU, while you could go opposite direction of most Powell traffic to your job.

askportland,34aqrz,salomoncascade,2,Wed Apr 29 19:59:01 2015 UTC,That's a great point. I love the Brooklyn neighborhood and it would be a great option especially if the OHSU-wife were willing to bike across the new bridge to work.
askportland,34aqrz,ExiledOkie,2,Wed Apr 29 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"Speaking of new bridge, the Orange Line would also simplify a public transit commute from Brooklyn-area as it will stop near the Tram, which she could then take up the hill.

askportland,347m98,maincomp,6,Tue Apr 28 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty good, mostly downtown-centric visitor's guide that I'll paste here for you.  First some basics:  Washington Park. This is a great old park with a lot of neat things to see. Good hiking trails, Rose Garden with nice view of the city. Pittock Mansion. The place for the postcard view of downtown. Also giant mansion from late 19th century newspaper baron. Portland Japanese Garden. In Washington Park, often considered the best in the world outside Japan.    Food : Blue Plate downtown has great lunches, it's a sort of old fashioned diner. Bunk Sandwiches are also a local favorite. Over on the east side, I love City State Cafe for breakfast/lunch as well. It's right near the Laurelhurst if you insist on seeing a movie (something I rarely do on vacation) and in an interesting neighborhood to explore. Screen Door is another much-favored restaurant over there and they are really good. Arrive early or be prepared to wait - especially if you try to hit their weekend brunch.  Food Carts are a Portland institution. You'll find massive collections (or pods) of them all over the city. Downtown pods include SW 10th and Alder (Taste of India and Frying Scotsman recommended!) SW 5th and Washington and SW 3rd and Washington. As well as several other places around town. Avoid carts that serve a wide range of items (ie burgers, shwarma, and fried rice simultaneously) and focus on places that specialize in one type of food. There's tons of great stuff and it's mostly very cheap.  Bonus food: Italian - Ristorante Roma, Grassa. Pho - Pho Hung, Pho Da'Lat. Coffee: Coffeehouse Northwest, Case Study, Bipartisan Cafe.  Neighborhoods: Portland has a ton of interesting neighborhoods, often named after the major streets. North Williams, Hawthorne/Belmont, Albina, Division, NW 23rd, Sellwood/Moreland. The list goes on and on. They're neat and fun to explore.  Parks: Among the many I mentioned, my actual favorite park of all in Portland is Lower Macleay Park. It's convenient to downtown but feels like you're hiking in the woods. Great stream (named after Oregon's first death penalty recipient) along the trail and really cool abandoned WPA restroom about 2 miles in. Easy access to Forest Park, and a modest hike to Pittock Mansion.  Mount Tabor is another interesting park with a great view of Portland and downtown. If you're going to be over near it it's worth visiting, but it's not like walking distance from downtown or anything. Easy access from Trimet.  If you have a car, go to the coast, it's beautiful. Ecola State Park (Indian Beach specifically) is really nice and has some good hiking. If you want somewhere less touristy (and nicer) drive down to Pacific City and check out Cape Kiwanda. Or visit Fort Stevens near Astoria.  Also, if you have a car, get out to the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is amazing, but if you want a hike don't hike there, either check out Eagle Creek (just west of Cascade Locks) or Wahkeena Falls trail up to Fairy Falls or Wahkeena Springs.  Silver Falls state park down near Salem is amazing, and there are tons of Willamette Valley wineries to the south/southwest of Portland to explore.  Portland has a good art museum with a solid permanent collection. Our parks system is really strong, lots of great parks.  Portland Farmer's Market is at PSU on Saturday mornings, it's really neat. Portland's Saturday Market, also downtown on the waterfront, is worth seeing if you're here on a weekend. It's pretty touristy but if you're not a jaded local it's a good place to check out.  A worthy destination for any gamer is Ground Kontrol, Portland's famous barcade. While other cities have jumped on the bandwagon, GK has been bringing old-school arcade action to Portland for 15 years. Their pinball collection is pretty amazing, as is their great collection of classics arcade consoles.  Another Portland landmark that is pretty famous but well worth visiting is Powell's City of Books downtown at 10th and W Burnside. If you like bookstores, check this place out. It's pretty incredible. You can literally (and easily) get lost in the massive collection they have.  Finally, the South Park Blocks are a pretty interesting historic area of town. Really nice to walk, although they do attract a lot of homeless people. This is where you'll find the art museum as well as the Oregon Historical Society museum.  Here's some things I'd avoid if you're looking for quality fun as opposed to overhyped tourist nonsense:  Voodoo Doughnuts - Go to Blue Star (fancy) or Coco (traditional) instead. Underground/Shanghai Tours - These are the worst. Just walk around look at old buildings and read plaques in Old Town and you'll see more history. Pink Bus Tour - They cover some ground, but almost all of it can be seen via transit/walking (and is almost all included in my list) so you'll save time and money. They have pamphlets you can pick up at Pioneer Square if you want to replicate their route.  Have a fun visit."

If you have a rental, take the time to drive 45minutes to Multnomah Falls in the Columbia River Gorge.

My first time there I saw a 400lb woman with her legs held back by one guy and being fisted by another.  Opened my view on sexuality damn quick.    I was there with my partner (we were 30,31) and met a few couples our age, but yes, for the most part it's 40-50 year olds (some younger, some older) that want to have some fun sexually.  The couples room was by far the best in that regard.  I, unfortunately, don't know of any swinger club that's any 'cleaner' or 'nicer' in town.   If you want to get into swinging/kink, lots of people host parties at hotels in the area.  You might want to check out kinkfest that happens yearly here if you want to open your mind.     Good luck!

askportland,344d63,diabloblanco,2,Tue Apr 28 21:29:02 2015 UTC,A large portion of the Russian and Ukrainian population are recent immigrants or first generation and thus a huge hub of their social life is the church.  Gresham and Clackamas are both areas with a high Eastern European presence.  Finding young stoners may be hard as the culture norm of that community is to marry young and start a family early.

Bring a 5 Gal bucket for all you guys to crap in and trash bags to clean up everything and party away. If you are anywhere in a developed campground you guys will be killing it for everyone there. Mt Hood NF or Gifford Pinchot NF have plenty of places to camp that you guys can celebrate without scaring the more tranquil types and its maybe 1.5 hour drive to get somewhere remote.

There are a couple of jetties in the general vicinity of Cannon Beach / Ecola State park.  Barview Jetty at the mouth of Tillamook Bay or South Jetty at the mouth of the Columbia river.  If you spread the ashes at the mouth of the Columbia during the outgoing tide - you could be guaranteed that the ashes get distributed into the ocean.  Ecola is really a beautiful place to spend an eternity - could you put some ashes into a small biodegradable sack and tie it to a rock and hurl it out from the cliff / beach?

askportland,33weog,HeMightBeRacist,3,Sun Apr 26 07:50:01 2015 UTC,"I also frequently repost a list of food recommendations (and tell people to skip Voodoo) so I'm not quite sure what the basis of your statement is... certainly it's not based on /r/askportland or /r/Portland .  That being said, I'll paste my visitor's guide which has lots of suggestions.  First some basics:  Washington Park. This is a great old park with a lot of neat things to see. Good hiking trails, Rose Garden with nice view of the city. Pittock Mansion. The place for the postcard view of downtown. Also giant mansion from late 19th century newspaper baron. Portland Japanese Garden. In Washington Park, often considered the best in the world outside Japan.    Food : Blue Plate downtown has great lunches, it's a sort of old fashioned diner. Bunk Sandwiches are also a local favorite. Over on the east side, I love City State Cafe for breakfast/lunch as well. It's right near the Laurelhurst if you insist on seeing a movie (something I rarely do on vacation) and in an interesting neighborhood to explore. Screen Door is another much-favored restaurant over there and they are really good. Arrive early or be prepared to wait - especially if you try to hit their weekend brunch.  Food Carts are a Portland institution. You'll find massive collections (or pods) of them all over the city. Downtown pods include SW 10th and Alder (Taste of India and Frying Scotsman recommended!) SW 5th and Washington and SW 3rd and Washington. As well as several other places around town. Avoid carts that serve a wide range of items (ie burgers, shwarma, and fried rice simultaneously) and focus on places that specialize in one type of food. There's tons of great stuff and it's mostly very cheap.  Bonus food: Italian - Ristorante Roma, Grassa. Pho - Pho Hung, Pho Da'Lat. Coffee: Coffeehouse Northwest, Case Study, Bipartisan Cafe.  Neighborhoods: Portland has a ton of interesting neighborhoods, often named after the major streets. North Williams, Hawthorne/Belmont, Albina, Division, NW 23rd, Sellwood/Moreland. The list goes on and on. They're neat and fun to explore.  Parks: Among the many I mentioned, my actual favorite park of all in Portland is Lower Macleay Park. It's convenient to downtown but feels like you're hiking in the woods. Great stream (named after Oregon's first death penalty recipient) along the trail and really cool abandoned WPA restroom about 2 miles in. Easy access to Forest Park, and a modest hike to Pittock Mansion.  Mount Tabor is another interesting park with a great view of Portland and downtown. If you're going to be over near it it's worth visiting, but it's not like walking distance from downtown or anything. Easy access from Trimet.  If you have a car, go to the coast, it's beautiful. Ecola State Park (Indian Beach specifically) is really nice and has some good hiking. If you want somewhere less touristy (and nicer) drive down to Pacific City and check out Cape Kiwanda. Or visit Fort Stevens near Astoria.  Also, if you have a car, get out to the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is amazing, but if you want a hike don't hike there, either check out Eagle Creek (just west of Cascade Locks) or Wahkeena Falls trail up to Fairy Falls or Wahkeena Springs.  Silver Falls state park down near Salem is amazing, and there are tons of Willamette Valley wineries to the south/southwest of Portland to explore.  Portland has a good art museum with a solid permanent collection. Our parks system is really strong, lots of great parks.  Portland Farmer's Market is at PSU on Saturday mornings, it's really neat. Portland's Saturday Market, also downtown on the waterfront, is worth seeing if you're here on a weekend. It's pretty touristy but if you're not a jaded local it's a good place to check out.  A worthy destination for any gamer is Ground Kontrol, Portland's famous barcade. While other cities have jumped on the bandwagon, GK has been bringing old-school arcade action to Portland for 15 years. Their pinball collection is pretty amazing, as is their great collection of classics arcade consoles.  Another Portland landmark that is pretty famous but well worth visiting is Powell's City of Books downtown at 10th and W Burnside. If you like bookstores, check this place out. It's pretty incredible. You can literally (and easily) get lost in the massive collection they have.  Finally, the South Park Blocks are a pretty interesting historic area of town. Really nice to walk, although they do attract a lot of homeless people. This is where you'll find the art museum as well as the Oregon Historical Society museum.  Here's some things I'd avoid if you're looking for quality fun as opposed to overhyped tourist nonsense:  Voodoo Doughnuts - Go to Blue Star (fancy) or Coco (traditional) instead. Underground/Shanghai Tours - These are the worst. Just walk around look at old buildings and read plaques in Old Town and you'll see more history. Pink Bus Tour - They cover some ground, but almost all of it can be seen via transit/walking (and is almost all included in my list) so you'll save time and money. They have pamphlets you can pick up at Pioneer Square if you want to replicate their route.  Have a fun visit."
askportland,33weog,pdxsean,6,Sun Apr 26 08:22:49 2015 UTC,"Really no spending cap? I'd suggest dinner at Beast or maybe Nodoguro, if you can get a ticket. I'd also maybe check out Chizu and the nearby Whiskey library. If you like sushi, Bamboo Sushi is fantastic.    As others have said, Voodoo is sadly not all it's cracked up to be. Blue Star makes great doughnuts, so I'd recommend going there."
askportland,33weog,Dashtego,3,Sun Apr 26 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you say nobody can recommend a single food cart since there are whole books that only cover the food carts in town. There are even food cart tours. Also, when are you going to be in town? Certain restaurants and food carts aren't open every day of the week.  If you do end up trying Voodoo, I'll go ahead and apologize in advance because their donuts are not good, at all. Although there is a kitschy sort of appeal to the theme and decor, I thought I'd point the former out since you mentioned wanting high quality food options."

So it's become an institution for ideas like the Cocoa Puff Donut, Cap'n Crunch Donut, etc. There's no shame in going there, it's fun for touristy-ness (the pinball tables at Voodoo 2 are great), just not for ""I'm looking for the best donuts in Portland"". You'd be better served to do Pips or Blue Star. If you just wanted donuts for old-school non-fancy Donuts' sake, Annie's on 72nd & Sandy is great.   I second those who suggested Beast and Le Pigeon.

askportland,33uvht,omgomgomgahorse,5,Sun Apr 26 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, getting a degree that's not vocational training puts you at a disadvantage when you're starting out.  Getting a job in your position is going to be about who you know, not what you know. The job you end up getting will likely never be posted anywhere public - most aren't.  If I were you, I would start networking aggressively - asking everyone you know for introductions to interesting people at interesting companies, and then asking them to meet for a coffee so you can get some advice about breaking into their field or company. While you're at it, get some more introductions. The more you do this, the more likely you're going to meet someone that says 'oh, yeah, we're planning to hire a [entry-level position] in the near future - job's not posted yet, but come on in and talk to us.' Or they'll just think of you when a job opens up, because honestly, going through a proper hiring process for some entry-level job is a pain in the butt.  If I didn't care about field, by the way, I'd try to sneak into a tech startup - probably, with your skill set, as a customer support rep, although other roles are possible. Tech startups are great for hardworking people just starting their career for a few reasons, but mainly because it's relatively easy to hop your way up into a decent position with more responsibility - they're always strapped for people and knowing how things work on the inside puts you at an advantage. Go to some dot-com meetups and start making friends."

I've known many folks who've graduated with honors from good schools who couldn't land something in their field, and ended working in service industry for a while. It's something to keep in mind when applying for entry-level positions in Portland.   The fact that you're bilingual and have had leadership experience both in domestic and international settings will increase your chances of landing something. What kind of position(s) are you applying for?   Every first day of the month, the mods at r/Portland posts jobs available for May, so definitely check there.

askportland,33qzv5,WazzuCougsAllDay,18,Fri Apr 24 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"Well, 20% over asking price for a $200K home is far different than a $500K home, so you have to be specific.  That being said, I don't believe it is a bubble.  Here is why:  1) Population growth: it is clear that more and more people are moving to the Portland area.   Forecasts have the area doubling by 2040.   Meanwhile, the urban growth boundary locks in the amount of land that can be built in.   High demand, low supply for the next 20 to 30 years at least.  2) Low inventory: owners are not listing houses.   Inventories are at an all time low.   The low supply of houses on the market is partly why prices are rising, but I think there is more at play here.   Why aren't people listing homes?   Mostly, it has to do with the fact that prices have not gotten high enough for them to justify it.   If you bought a house between 2004 and 2007 for X and the price is now only slightly above X, then you are not motivated to sell.   You have to take your equity and put it into someplace new and if you don't have a lot of equity to do that, you are not going anywhere.  3) Interest rates are stable: Yes, interest rates will likely be going up as the Fed finally loosens rates, but they are not going to raise a ton and not for at least another quarter or two.   As long as rates are low, people will want to buy.  Now, you ask if Portland is going the way of San Francisco.   I can't tell you that for sure, but Portland's size and wage growth would suggest the answer is no.  Hope that answers your question."
askportland,33qzv5,jonjacobmoon,6,Fri Apr 24 21:03:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for the well thought out and thorough answer.
askportland,33qzv5,schallplatte,3,Fri Apr 24 21:11:35 2015 UTC,I think the reason why you got a lot of nonsense responses is because this has been chewed over in the sub a few times recently (just do a search on the word bubble).
askportland,33qzv5,MikeCanDoIt,3,Fri Apr 24 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"You'll never know until time has passed and you can look back.  But the difference between now and 2007 is that back then, if you could fog up a mirror, you could get a loan. On top of that we had loans that were 2 years at one low rate and then jumped 2-5%. It was insane. We also had loans that were given at 120% of value and lastly, there were option ARMs. You could choose from a 30 or 40-year fully amortizing payment, a 15-year fully amortizing payment, an interest-only payment, a minimum payment or any amount greater than the minimum payment.  The likelihood of mass foreclosures like we saw back then aren't as likely any time in the near future because payments aren't going to change.  Prices might go down if interest rates rise too fast."

askportland,33mu16,_somedayadog,5,Fri Apr 24 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"You specifically asked for not strip clubs, but this is what I tell everyone, I call it the StripBrew Crawl:  Optional Steak Starter  Acropolis -- this is more of a personal favorite, there might not be a ton of draw for out of towners. It's a strip club owned by a rancher/butcher so they serve dirt cheap steak. We're talking steak starting at $6, and ~$11 for a 16 oz filet mignon. They've got 60-some-odd taps with mostly mediocre beer but always at least a couple decent IPAs. This is the only one of two (or three) that are far away and might require a cab, so it can easily be cut off the trip.  Beer!  12th and Division: Just hit this corner, you've got Apex on one side (huge beer bar, 40-taps, cash only, rare cellared bottles at pretty high prices), Beermongers (6 taps but tons of bottles, some cellared most fresh)  Optional Breweries on the way to the next strip club.  Commons Brewery -- farmhouse heavy, occasional sours Baerlic Brewing -- new brewery, solid barleywine, flagship is a cream ale that is highly reviewed (I don't like cream ales) Groundbreaker -- it's all gluten free and it's not great. I don't even know why I'm including it here. Lucky Labrador on Hawthorne (there's a few of these) -- solid beer, easy to pass, but if you just want to sit for a minute or if you got started really early and have tons of time...  Distillery Row  Side note, you're in the middle of distillery row. There are approximately six distilleries within a few blocks of you. They all specialize in different liquors and I only like whiskey so I'd send you to Eastside Distilling if you're interested.  Strip Club #2 (or 1)  Sassy's. This is an old name in Portland and is definitely worth a stop. Usually one of the best tap lists in town at a club. Don't be intimidated by the door-man, just play it cool. He gets a kick out of scaring people, just as a heads up, he's got a face full of tattoos and some crazy piercings and he wears a tactical vest. Nice guy though, just show him your ID and walk on in.  More beer!  You're right next door to Cascade Barrel House, which you'll more than likely want to hit. Expect the tap list to be 2/3 sour, so if you have buddies who don't like sour there will be something, but not a ton. Check out the oblique stout for a less known but amazing Cascade. If you want to make the side-trek, you're only 10 blocks from Hair of the Dog. Nearly everything is high-gravity here, so it's worth passing on if you think it'll send you over the top.  On the way to Union Jack's  Another old name in Portland is Union Jack's and it's worth a visit. While you're on your way there, I'd recommend refueling at Base Camp Brewing. Some of their beer is pretty underwhelming, but their Ultra Gnar Gnar IPA (stupidest name ever) is pretty solid, and they usually have some good seasonals on. I usually stop here because there's always food carts out front and you can grab some more grub and a pint. Alternatively, there's a gastropub called Burnside Brewing. The beer here is passable, but not very great; however, the food is better. So if you'd rather eat in a restaurant, go here.  Union Jack's  Enough said, go and have a good time. The taps won't be great, but it's an A+ strip club.  Are you still alive?  If you're still going, this is my favorite part. Exit Union Jack's and take a left. Just go straight. After 7 blocks you'll be on or approaching the Burnside Bridge. I highly recommend everyone visiting Portland cross at least one bridge by foot, it's just a lot of fun. On the west end of the bridge is where a lot of homeless encampments hang out. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone; there have been some weird one-off attacks in this area, but I assure you it's perfectly safe, especially if you're in a group.  Ending the Night  Portland's kind of sleepy and a lot of the great places don't stay open late. I'm assuming at this point it's at least 11 if not 1 in the morning. The bars have last call at 2 and close at 2:30, so if you're looking to keep going you're running out of time. I'd recommend going to Kit Kat, a really laid back strip club, or Ash Street saloon. At this point, you're relegated to dive bars, strip clubs, or dance clubs. You're right in the heart of the clubbing district, so if you want to dance, just listen for some music.  Alternatively, if you're strip-clubbed out, and a dive bar sounds awful. Don't go downtown (across the bridge), instead head East to EastBurn, only 11 blocks away. It'll have a good tap list and is open until 2 when everything is closing down."

Most cooks mince the liver, add coriander, chopped onion, salt and Worcestershire sauce then wrap balls of this mixture with the netvet and secure it with a toothpick. The balls, approximately 80 mm (3.1 in) in diameter, are normally barbecued (grilled over an open fire) and ready when the fat is crisp.

How important is being close to downtown? Looking to buy or rent?   Just know housing is getting very competitive, so if you want to be in the city, it will be fairly expensive. Especially compared to Oklahoma. If you're ok with commuting, there are some nice suburbs with more affordable options.   But generally, people often say anything east of 82nd is 'rough'. Everything west of there is 'nice', with exceptions of course. These are super relative terms depending on what's normal, too. Having lived near DC, I've felt safer in 'rough' parts of Portland compared to lots of DC."

askportland,33dlrz,PortlandThro,5,Tue Apr 21 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"I never understood the ""other than craigslist"" question.  Coming from someone who has moved twice in the past 18 months and did extensive research both times, Craiglist is far and away your best spot to find apartment rentals.  Sites like padmapper and trulia are 99% made up of Craigslist posts, and are often out of date.  Pro tip that a shocking amount of people don't know (by shocking amount I mean the three or four people I've talked to who didn't know): you can change craigslist to map view so you can more easily search by neighborhood.   There are very few property management companies around that don't post on Craigslist, or at least don't do so consistently, that are worth checking out.  Capital Property Management is probably the one with the most properties."

You also need to be willing to pay premium $ to live close to downtown...  I rented my loft in inner SE sight unseen... they had lots of photos of the unit and so it was not that hard to make the decision. I had booked a flight in advance of this signing to do major apartment hunting but did not need to do any of that.

We got lucky--the apartment was in decent shape with wood floors and our neighbors are nice enough.  As long as you have the income verification good to go, they'll send you a lease. We pay $1310 for an older two bedroom in SE.  Pro tip: try not to apply for multiple apartments at once since the application fees can add up quickly. Also, double check that the date the apartment is listed for is the date you can actually move in. One place we were approved for told us the apartment we wanted wasn't free to move in to until two weeks after the advertised date on the website."

They are definitely worth taking a look at.  Something to remember about CBD though is that it is BIPHASIC meaning that youll get different effects from certain dosage sizes.  Also you have to take cbd several days in a row for it to have the infamous profound effects.

Although, I believe if he can get more than enough to use that he should take much more than this.  I think tea's and tinctures and foods cooked with cbd oil would also benefit him.  I know it's not a cure but in some cases it really is for the most part.  If CBD oil is something that can help him live out the rest of his days away from pain then I'm going to help him get it.

Unless the economy tanks I only see rents going up.    In the past three years, the average and median home prices dropped after July while surging ahead in March '12 and '13 and January of this year.  But those are averages and each area and price point is different http://mikecandoit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/15-3-Average-Portland-Real-Estate-Price.jpg  Home prices will stagnate if interest rates go up because people typically buy based on monthly payment, not the price.  1/3 of homes are bought by cash and it's edging out lots of people, even those that offer more."

askportland,335c2n,Redlance,21,Sun Apr 19 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"Portland is not a particularly good place to move to on a whim. The housing market is extremely competitive, although no one can really answer your question without knowing exactly what 'cheap' means to you.  The job market is not great, unemployment is slightly above the US average, but education levels are well above average, making good jobs very competitive.  People are for the most part exceedingly polite but not particularly 'friendly.'"

If you search around you'll find a lot of thoughts on the matter.  1 Probably? I've only attended one class and it was fine. I am not sure what constitutes a ""good"" community college tho, but PCC has several campuses and lots of classes available.    2 Everywhere in Portland is low-crime, especially for people from out-of-state. It might be more dangerous than your part of AL I suppose but there's no ""bad"" neighborhood exactly. The worst you'll find is kind-of-rough. As for prices, I pay $845/mo for 400ft2 near downtown, and it's a bargain. I'd expect to pay $800 or so for a studio no matter where you live, unless you really head out to the east side, or a suburb.  3 Really hard to find work here in my experience, but I am looking for management positions. Minimum wage jobs are probably easier - grocery stores and fast food are pretty much always hiring.    4 People here are friendly but most people find it difficult to make friends. The ""Seattle Freeze"" applies to Portland as well. I suspect it's common of pretty much every city when people move from across the country, but the NW has a name for it I guess.  Good luck, if you do move out here I hope you enjoy it! Oregon is pretty great."

They're legit, and it's something cheap like $12 flat for any place downtown proper (way cheaper than a taxi, which will be over $30).

askportland,332cd6,Jurellai,5,Sat Apr 18 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"Lots of food suggestions in my visitor's guide...  First some basics:  Washington Park. This is a great old park with a lot of neat things to see. Good hiking trails, Rose Garden with nice view of the city. Pittock Mansion. The place for the postcard view of downtown. Also giant mansion from late 19th century newspaper baron. Portland Japanese Garden. In Washington Park, often considered the best in the world outside Japan.    Food : Blue Plate downtown has great lunches, it's a sort of old fashioned diner. Bunk Sandwiches are also a local favorite. Over on the east side, I love City State Cafe for breakfast/lunch as well. It's right near the Laurelhurst if you insist on seeing a movie (something I rarely do on vacation) and in an interesting neighborhood to explore. Screen Door is another much-favored restaurant over there and they are really good. Arrive early or be prepared to wait - especially if you try to hit their weekend brunch.  Food Carts are a Portland institution. You'll find massive collections (or pods) of them all over the city. Downtown pods include SW 10th and Alder (Taste of India and Frying Scotsman recommended!) SW 5th and Washington and SW 3rd and Washington. As well as several other places around town. Avoid carts that serve a wide range of items (ie burgers, shwarma, and fried rice simultaneously) and focus on places that specialize in one type of food. There's tons of great stuff and it's mostly very cheap.  Bonus food: Italian - Ristorante Roma, Grassa. Pho - Pho Hung, Pho Da'Lat. Coffee: Coffeehouse Northwest, Case Study, Bipartisan Cafe.  Neighborhoods: Portland has a ton of interesting neighborhoods, often named after the major streets. North Williams, Hawthorne/Belmont, Albina, Division, NW 23rd, Sellwood/Moreland. The list goes on and on. They're neat and fun to explore.  Parks: Among the many I mentioned, my actual favorite park of all in Portland is Lower Macleay Park. It's convenient to downtown but feels like you're hiking in the woods. Great stream (named after Oregon's first death penalty recipient) along the trail and really cool abandoned WPA restroom about 2 miles in. Easy access to Forest Park, and a modest hike to Pittock Mansion.  Mount Tabor is another interesting park with a great view of Portland and downtown. If you're going to be over near it it's worth visiting, but it's not like walking distance from downtown or anything. Easy access from Trimet.  If you have a car, go to the coast, it's beautiful. Ecola State Park (Indian Beach specifically) is really nice and has some good hiking. If you want somewhere less touristy (and nicer) drive down to Pacific City and check out Cape Kiwanda. Or visit Fort Stevens near Astoria.  Also, if you have a car, get out to the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is amazing, but if you want a hike don't hike there, either check out Eagle Creek (just west of Cascade Locks) or Wahkeena Falls trail up to Fairy Falls or Wahkeena Springs.  Silver Falls state park down near Salem is amazing, and there are tons of Willamette Valley wineries to the south/southwest of Portland to explore.  Portland has a good art museum with a solid permanent collection. Our parks system is really strong, lots of great parks.  Portland Farmer's Market is at PSU on Saturday mornings, it's really neat. Portland's Saturday Market, also downtown on the waterfront, is worth seeing if you're here on a weekend. It's pretty touristy but if you're not a jaded local it's a good place to check out.  A worthy destination for any gamer is Ground Kontrol, Portland's famous barcade. While other cities have jumped on the bandwagon, GK has been bringing old-school arcade action to Portland for 15 years. Their pinball collection is pretty amazing, as is their great collection of classics arcade consoles.  Another Portland landmark that is pretty famous but well worth visiting is Powell's City of Books downtown at 10th and W Burnside. If you like bookstores, check this place out. It's pretty incredible. You can literally (and easily) get lost in the massive collection they have.  Finally, the South Park Blocks are a pretty interesting historic area of town. Really nice to walk, although they do attract a lot of homeless people. This is where you'll find the art museum as well as the Oregon Historical Society museum.  Here's some things I'd avoid if you're looking for quality fun as opposed to overhyped tourist nonsense:  Voodoo Doughnuts - Go to Blue Star (fancy) or Coco (traditional) instead. Underground/Shanghai Tours - These are the worst. Just walk around look at old buildings and read plaques in Old Town and you'll see more history. Pink Bus Tour - They cover some ground, but almost all of it can be seen via transit/walking (and is almost all included in my list) so you'll save time and money. They have pamphlets you can pick up at Pioneer Square if you want to replicate their route.  Have a fun visit."

You'll be close to work and Caltrain will take you in and out of the city so you don't have to deal with traffic.  Liquefaction doesn't happen on flat ground; it happens on landfill. Live on land that isn't dirt piled on the bay and you'll be fine. This is a liquefaction map of the south bay. Most of it is minimal risk. You'd be just as safe in a house in Palo Alto as you would be in a house in SE Portland.  Make the most of it. San Francisco is a beautiful city. There's tons of nature in all directions. It's not even that smoggy - the reason Southern California gets so smoggy is because it's a basin surrounded by mountains. You're on a peninsula surrounded by water. Focus on the good (going from public housing and food stamps to 12k a month -- 12K A MONTH!!) and remember that nothing is permanent. Hell, you might be there for a month before another company comes and offers you a telecommuting job that lets you move back to Portland on a San Francisco salary."

Also the tech industry in Portland is getting better and better so you might be here sooner than you think.  I lived in SF for 3 months, great food, interesting culture and so much to do.  As much as I am sure going to be downvoted to hell for this comment the people in SF were so much more friendly to me than people in Portland.  The flight from PDX to SFO/SJC/OAK isn't that bad... and neither is the drive.  Also if you are afraid of earthquakes the one that will hit Portand will level the city.

Overprices housing? As you're learning, SF kills PDX in that sense.   However there's a lot of good about SF imo. Great transit system, really nice parks system, very diverse and distinct neighborhoods, amazing outdoors recreation within a few hours drive. Easy access to all of CA for weekend trips, and CA has a ton of great stuff to offer.    I'm like you, I wouldn't want to move away from Oregon (or Portland) either but if I had the chance to make $12k/mo I'd move pretty much anywhere in the country.

askportland,32un5b,pdxsean,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:33:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was talking about just SF too (just moved from there). I am surprised that anyone like the transit! That's great that you do, though.   In my experience, 1- Bart sucks, never on time, doesn't really go anywhere you need to unless you are traveling into the city from east bay. also, it shuts down super early on the weekend, leaving people trapped on the wrong side of the bay often 2- buses are never on time. there's not really a schedule. you just have to look them up constantly. 3- buses and trains often just out of service for no reason or are suddenly delayed extreme amounts of time (N TRAIN I AM LOOKING AT YOU, JERK). So for instance, if you live in the Sunset area and the N train yet again is down, you pretty much have to Uber into the city. Since they get delayed a bunch, this leads to buses being overfull and then just refusing to take on people (so you could wait for hours-- better to just give up and walk for 2 hours). 4- They are really dirty, filthy, which you also said. But imagine having to take them every weekdays for hours at a time... with them covering in filth and poop and litter... the smells OH THE SMELLS... they haunt my dreams 5- they are often actually dangerous to ride 6- in the middle of their route, a bus driver will just suddenly throw everyone off the bus for no reason, leaving you stuff in the middle of nowhere. this happened to me dozens of times. UGH.  7- everything. SF transit is literally the worst. I've never been to a large city (or even medium city) that has shittier public transportation. I am getting mad just remembering it :(:("

The water in Oregon is among the freshest and cleanest municipal water sources on the planet. Here’s some raw data, collected from the tap as of last spring: (units measured in PPM)  Portland:   Sodium: 0 Potassium: 0 Calcium: 1.8 Magnesium: 0.75 CaCO3 (hardness): 10 Sulfates: 0.5 Chloride: 1.6 Bicarbonate: 7.5 pH: 8.3   Portland water is treated with Chloramine  These numbers don’t mean much yet in context, so let’s get a comparison with some water, to me, is awful. I've never tasted tapwater that gave me a sore throat for drinking it before I had water from West Los Angeles. I understand, and don't question why so many people prefer bottled water in California.  West Los Angeles:   Sodium: 52 Potassium: 4 Calcium: 28 Magnesium: 11 CaCO3(hardness): 113 Sulfates: 13 Chloride: 65 Bicarbonate: 110  pH: 7.8   West Los Angeles water is treated with Chloramine and Fluoride.  The water in Portland is soft enough to make German pilsners out of the tap, and enriched with just enough mineral content to be better tasting than distilled bottled water. Unless the water is affected by rusty pipes, filtering in Portland is a complete waste of time."

After going to two of the typical chain stores (Sleep Country and Bed Mart), I was about to give up. The products were fine, but the prices seemed steep and the service was ... unimpressive. Sales clerks were either utterly disinterested or way, way too pushy.  I happened to drive by The Mattress Lot and stopped in on a whim. It was great. Folks working there were very helpful and pleasant, not the slightest bit pushy, and invited me to lay down on any of the floor models I wanted. They were able to answer all the questions I had, and asked key questions that hadn't come up at either of the previous places.   I got a really great, firm, pillow-top queen mattress (didn' t need a box spring) and mattress cover for about $650, which was signficantly less than the prices I'd been quoted elsewhere. And I remember seeing queen sets (mattress and box spring) starting around $400 or so. My mattress today is just as good as the day I bought it -- which is rare for me. I'm a big guy (250 lbs.) and a fitful sleeper, and I usually have that ""mattress trench"" going within a year or two. But this one hasn't caved an inch.  And they do deliver. In fact, I think I remember seeing a sign for free or discounted delivery for customers who arrive to shop by bike.  They also take old mattresses and box springs away.

askportland,32q57b,Saucysauce,3,Wed Apr 15 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"My previous company had an internal recognition program where any employee could assign a brief written praise to any other employee of any level at any time for any reason. The reward for receiving one was a 10 dollar gift card to one of 20 or so predetermined places. The company called it a ""one minute recognition"".  This was a professional office environment, and it created an opportunity for regular praise across departments and teams, and allowed a formal avenue (visible to your supervisor) to receive praise. This means a director could praise the janitor or an intern could praise another intern or the CEO. It was an outstanding (and inexpensive) policy.  Edit: Also, a key core to this policy was that there was no limit to the frequency/volume of praises given out by or given to any individual. No one abused this. The gift cards were to various local restaurants,  hotels, amazon.com, public transit, build a bear, etc. A big selection, and the recipient obtained the gift card in hand same-day. No public announcement was made, so it was only known among the giver, the recipient, and the recipient's supervisor.  If you consider a policy like this at all, I will be happy to elaborate on the precise logistics."

I can verify that the Tigard group still plays, awesome group of people. Unless otherwise stated, I believe all groups listed on that page are mixed (coed).  Also, Skillz league is starting soon and you may still be able to sign up for that. You should be able to find the sign up on the second link there, or at least email someone from the ""contact"" section to inquire about it.  It's perfect for all beginning to intermediate levels. Basically, if you didn't play ulti for 4 years in college, its the best place to start.  Btw, it's not free. You get a jersey though and the end of season tournament is fucking awesome. Also playing one season of spring league will get you more competitive than a full year playing with a pickup group. It's mixed, so you can do it with a SO, the coaches actually play on serious teams in pdx, so they are the best coaches you can find.

No idea about the tickets If you don't have the title you have to take the pass paperwork back to the DMV and pay for the registration there.  It's 21$ for passing the smog test, and I believe 80ish for the registration, plus a multnomah county fee if thats where you live.  Just over a hundred - more if you need a title and are in Mult. county. You'll get a ticket eventually. Couple hundred I think.

askportland,32mowr,urbal,20,Wed Apr 15 00:45:52 2015 UTC,I've lived in Oregon for most of my 60+ years with only a 3 year break living in the San Jose area in the early '70s. In my opinion the ire of Oregonians toward Californians has been totally based upon home prices. Californians would move to Oregon after selling their higher priced real estate and outbid Oregonians for homes driving up home and rental prices. Then Californians were also seen as always griping about the weather or something else different than California. Most of the animosity is now gone in the Portland and Eugene area. Outside the metro areas your mileage may vary.
askportland,32mowr,oldsweng,3,Wed Apr 15 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"All this, plus the notion that Californians are taking our jobs. Which is silly, all sorts of more qualified people are moving here and filling jobs that pay half what they were making back in NYC/SFO/CHI whatever."
askportland,32mowr,myconoid,16,Wed Apr 15 22:45:22 2015 UTC,We have a great deal of distaste for people who move here and then complain about how Portland is different from where they came from. Since California is the most populous neighboring state it is where the most immigrants come from. Since they have an outsized share of the incoming population they also have a larger share of the annoying newcomers. Since they're the most identifiable group they get the lion's share of the crap thrown at them.  People in real life won't care that you're from California so you don't need to hide it from a potential landlord or anything like that. Just don't grumble about the lack of breakfast tacos or complain about how people drive slow and the pitchforks will stay in the basements.
askportland,32mowr,cinemabaroque,-2,Wed Apr 15 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"We have a great deal of distaste for people who move here and then complain about how Portland is different from where they came from.

The current crop of 20-something hipsters that have displaced us natives are a different breed, and they have their own problems- namely, they move here for the ""lifestyle,"" found out that the lifestyle isn't economically sustainable beyond 18 months, start complaining after the first 12 and then ditch out because of the rain, the summer, the people, the lack of work, etc. The problem isn't that people miss home. It's that they move here without understanding what it's like and endlessly complain until they leave. It's not missing tacos or breakfast burritos or whatever. It's ""everything here is awful"" in an endless loop."

Its one thing to note that the Mission in SF has better taquerias than Portland, its another to say ""God the Mexican food is terrible in Portland, where the fuck can I get a good breakfast taco?"" (actual quote) which gets old real fast.  I, for one, totally love it when people have been here for a week and they're already complaining about the rain. Uh... maybe they should have been aware that it rains sometime up here, it isn't even that bad, Portland Maine gets more rain each year than we do. I've known several people to get up here in October, complain all fall and winter long about how the weather is shit, and head back home by the time April rolls around. You see that a few times and it too starts to get old.  People generally do move here to live in Portland and to them I say ""Welcome, yes, it is pretty awesome up here, do your awesome thing and add to the awesomeness"" but there will always be that 10% who don't and I'm quite fed up with new arrivals telling me how Portland should be. If someone knows so well how a place should be set up maybe they should have just changed wherever they were from instead of coming up here to moan about things they don't like. I really don't enjoy self styled ""libertarians"" start in on how the urban growth boundary is the dumbest thing they've ever heard of.

It's more general transplant disdain but since California makes up a rather large portion and have been doing it longer so they often get a larger target.   The neighborhood I grew up in used to be a bunch of teachers, construction workers, cooks and the like. Now it's tech, tech, and tech. Mostly bay area transplants. They all sold their million dollar houses and bought up our 'cheap' ones. They all have their earth toned Prius (Prii?). Half of my neighbors used to bike to work, and while I hear how much my parents new neighbors love biking, any time I'm in their house because my parents don't have something in particular their bikes are hanging up collecting a large amount of dust. Houses used to have eclectic paint jobs and whimsical gardens, now they're all basic and well manicured. Seen business go out of business because they couldn't pay the new rent now that the neighborhood had tech money, instead of teacher money. My chef mother and teacher father could never afford their neighborhood now. A lot of what made it great is now gone. And what's left is fighting between what it once was and what it has to do to stay afloat. Transplants, don't be a passenger to Portland life. A lot of them talk about what they like about Portland but don't actually do any of it.  Though I don't just blame transplants for that. Developers and city planners also get a lot blame by using migration as a gold rush. How many $1800 1br faux-industrial type apartments do we need?   Edit: Places like Seattle, Portland and Austin need to learn from SF to stop it from happening to them."

askportland,32mowr,HorribleTroll,6,Wed Apr 15 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"As someone who moved here from California to get AWAY from California and Californians, the biggest thing I'll say is don't BE a Californian. Have you noticed how Californians are kind of self-important jerks? Don't be a self-important jerk. Don't do things that identify you as a Californian. Smile. Let people merge. Walk places. Wait your turn. Relax. California is such a stressful place full of stressed-out people. Don't bring that with you. You're no longer a Californian. You're an Oregonian."
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,14,Thu Apr 16 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"No and yes.   It started in the mid 1860's, when those damn Californians made the choice to head south instead of continuing on the Oregon trail to it's logical conclusion. ""It's not our problem that California's farmland needs all that water and hard work! You should have stayed on the North side of the trail to the place where you can casually toss out a few seeds and harvest the crops a few weeks later!"" (I'm paraphrasing, but that is essentially what early Oregonians said.   And then we were invaded by Californians looking for gold. They used it all up in their streams and had to come steal it from hardworking Oregonians.   Then it became a problem again in the early 1900s when Californians fled San Fransisco after a mere earthquake and fire burned down their city. I mean seriously, an Oregonian would have just simply cut down a few trees to make a new city!  Then we went to war. Twice. And got a lot of Southerns in. Most of them we tolerated because we knew they'd go away after the War was finished one way or another. But those dang Californians stayed!   And then we get to the 1960s. Oregon had a huge economic downturn and Californians (usually retirees,) purchased land and built homes, but contributed very little to the economy otherwise.  This happened again in the 1980s. We also blamed the Spotted Owl.  And now, all those California tech companies are moving up here and pricing all those second generation ""natives"" out of their homes."
askportland,32mowr,pizza_partyUSA,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:06:31 2015 UTC,I would have said Yes and No.
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,4,Wed Apr 15 03:23:15 2015 UTC,"I moved here from San Diego nine years ago and no one has ever given me shit for it.  The reason is that Portland is inexpensive compared to many places in California so people move here with a ton of money and buy houses for more than locals can afford, driving up real estate and rental units too.  As such, native Portlanders cannot afford to live in the neighborhoods they grew up in and are bitter about it.    I understand that sentiment as the same thing was happening in San Diego in the late 90's, early 00's.  Housing was insane and I was faced with being priced out of the city and living in a desert suburb.  I chose Portland.  Landlords don't give a fuck.  If anything, they may try to price gouge you if you're from SF as they'll think you expectation for fair rent is higher."
askportland,32mowr,pizza_partyUSA,3,Wed Apr 15 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing about how this is a Portland phenomenon, but I've known California transplants getting beef about the move in cities all across the United States, but especially the South, mostly in places where wages don't compete with rising real estate prices.  It's all about 'I can't afford a house because these assholes from California keep buying everything'.  Weirdly enough, despite the prices being higher in Northern CA, other areas of the country have just as much, if not more, disdain for Southern CA residents buying up all their housing stock, even when it's fairly rare for either to actually be having any real affect like it does in OR."
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,7,Wed Apr 15 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, /r/portland can be a bit echo-chamber-y.  Don't sweat it.  Like others, I have not seen views of /r/portland gain a ton of traction outside of that sub.  As a similar transplant, I can share that I was honked/yelled at for having CA plates (generally well outside of Portland, actually), and only a handful of times.  I will say that it was hard to get people to take me seriously when job hunting and apartment hunting.  If I used my out-of-state number and/or address, my calls were rarely returned.  There's some legitimate reasons for this, but I still think it's shitty.  Basically, there's always the possibility that you'll come up here, date us for a while, realize that something isn't right (weather much?) and go back to your old GF (damn you SF!).  But that was a decade ago, so I can't say anymore.  I got a local number via a cheap SIM card, registered a PO box, and then gave it all up after I got a job and moved to Portland (again, only my experience here, so I can't say if this changed the outcome).  This is a bit extreme, but it worked for me, so I give it at least a little ""truth""."
askportland,32mowr,pizza_partyUSA,11,Wed Apr 15 01:56:36 2015 UTC,"If I used my out-of-state number and/or address   Well, yeah. They would prefer to hire people that actually live here than talk to people who may not even intend to move to the area. That's everywhere."
askportland,32mowr,cinemabaroque,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"True, but having lived in several states and moved professionally each time, I will say that only Oregon contacts routinely failed to return calls and respond.  Everywhere else I moved (California, Texas, Oklahoma), I would get a response, with a reminder that they didn't provide relocation (which I wasn't asking for), and generally I could proceed with my business.  Basically, I agree that it's a widely-held belief, but Oregon is peculiar (in my experience) with patently not responding to out-of-state folk."
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,4,Wed Apr 15 03:15:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Good point. I think Portland is such a 'hot' place to move to/live in right now that they don't need to consider out of towners that much. Maybe something like that? I started applying after I moved, so used new address and old phone number.  My boyfriend applied for a job while we were in SF, interviewed online, and was hired before we set foot in here. So I think it depends what kind of job it is, too. If it's highly specialized, they will probably consider more options."
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,3,Wed Apr 15 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"Well, my story is from ~10 years ago, and I have no real idea of how ""hot"" Portland would have been then.  I still agree, though, that for the most part the Oregonians that I met like this just really didn't care about filling the position as much as it not being a hassle.  I think the truth is somewhere in the middle.  Well, I worked in tech as a programmer, so I think I had one of the ""hot"" jobs at the time (had just left a semi-successful start-up), so I figured they'd respond faster.  Nope.  I dunno.  I'd love to see this studied."

askportland,32mowr,pizza_partyUSA,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Wooot!  Since being here, I've discovered that a large number of tech professionals ended up here via the same route (a stop-over in SF, then up to PDX).  Most people in tech I talk to all had the same, rough process :   Short flight to SF/SEA for work/family Great climate, relative to NoCal and SEA (checkout the number of overcast days in downtown SF!  It was larger than PDX when I moved) Totally affordable, since salary modifiers were in our favor (salary dropped by 20%, costs dropped by 50%, including housing) Great people, generally accepting, and quirky   I dunno.  I feel in love and really never looked back.  Glad you guys like it up here :)"
askportland,32mowr,ThePrimCrow,2,Wed Apr 15 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"Yep. I ended up in the Bay Area for school and worked a bit afterwards. I knew it wasn't my forever home. We decided on Portland after a ton of thought. I love the pacific nw. There's only a handful of places I really want to live, and this was at the top.  Since I was 18, I tend to move to wherever I really, really want to live. This was just the next stop. It's so lovely that I could easily imagine staying past my typical 6 or so years. We'll see! So far, it's pretty much everything I could have hoped for. I am a bit worried about the summer, as I'm one of those weirdos that hates any sort of heat."
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,2,Wed Apr 15 08:51:52 2015 UTC,"Heh, well, if you lived in California through a summer, I'd venture to say that's worse than any summer here, but weather has been pretty strange the last few years.  Having said that, I spent time in Sacramento growing up and I've never experienced anything like that here in Portland.  Buy an A/C unit now (they will run out when the heat starts) and you'll be fine."
askportland,32mowr,cinemabaroque,2,Wed Apr 15 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"Buy an A/C unit now (they will run out when the heat starts) and you'll be fine.   Luckily, this apt has A/C. I'll just to try avoid outside a lot."
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,2,Wed Apr 15 18:31:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm. *out-of-towners + rambling? I wasn't paying the closest attention. Maybe my comment makes more sense if you read it in the context of my previous comment.  To be more clear: My boyfriend and I also moved to Portland from SF. He applied to jobs before we moved and was hired fairly quickly. I didn't try until I moved up here, so I couldn't say that much about Oregon hiring people from other states."
askportland,32mowr,cinemabaroque,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:45:45 2015 UTC,Perhaps some Oregon companies would rather have the most qualified Oregonian than the most qualified person in the U.S.  It's in line with keeping things local which is a strong Portland ideal.
askportland,32mowr,Saucysauce,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:11:21 2015 UTC,"Well, there are many possible solutions, and this is just as valid as the rest.  Still, that's pretty trangressive from a ""we're all US citizens/humans"" standpoint.  I hope that sort of discrimination isn't as popular as you suggest."
askportland,32mowr,tedder42,3,Wed Apr 15 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"It isn't that they're biased against people in other places as that a lot of hiring here happens on a more personal network, through recommendations and people you know. It is really hard to justify hiring an out of town person when your 'intern' who is waiting tables on the side is someone who you know can do the job, both because they're already doing it and the fact that they've stayed on at a really low wage waiting for the opportunity even after their initial involvement when they were in school has ended.  One of the reasons its hard to find a job from out of state is just that there is a (declining, but still present) surplus of local talent, and Portland isn't that big so most people know the other people in their field as opposed to a bigger city like LA or the Bay or NY."
askportland,32mowr,pizza_partyUSA,2,Wed Apr 15 04:48:02 2015 UTC,"I think my experiences in my field (""tech"") don't match what you've written here, but since I don't know about other professions, I can't really say.  I'm going to assume that you're trying to explain the POV of /u/ThePrimCrow and I'll say that I don't think that example seems likely to explain the hiring practices of people that fall outside of that description (aka, people with any experience).  Where do you find numbers for talent surplus?  I've seen this mentioned several times, but I haven't seen anything to back it up.  And, again, I guess that's true for other professions, but I haven't experienced that in ""tech""."
askportland,32mowr,5710,2,Wed Apr 15 05:25:42 2015 UTC,"Well, on one hand I was just hired in tech over some very qualified people so maybe my own experience is coloring things. I think that qualified people can definitely find work here, I've not really known anybody with a master degree+ or six years experience+ not finding work here.  On the other hand, before I went back to school most of my experience was in non-profits and retail and neither really took out of town applicants.  On the gripping hand, when I was at PSU my department was hiring a position and all of the final applicants were stunningly brilliant, three of the four were from Ivy League departments and would all have been taking a major pay cut to come to Portland."
askportland,32mowr,cinemabaroque,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say the field you're going into has way more to do with hiring than a general PDX-specific phenomenon.  I happen to have some knowledge of the non-profit market and, yes, it is absolutely as you originally described.  It's one of the most insular ""markets"" I've run across.  In California and Texas, non-profit jobs were just like any other job, normal turnover, etc.  Here, people get these jobs and keep them for a long time.  I actually think this is good because it means people can live/survive off of their wages (hard to work in NP in CA due to pay), but it also means there's not much in the way of room for newer folk.  RE: Pay, yeah.  I took a pretty hefty cut, but I'm used to those adjustments between cities.  I don't think that's too particular to Portland.  All of these things make Portland a ""lifestyle"" town for most.  In tech, it's still a win, although you could easily make more money elsewhere."
askportland,32mowr,5710,2,Wed Apr 15 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, I'm keeping my same job, just continuing to work remotely, so finding a job or steady source of income is not an issue in my case."

The culture of portland ON REDDIT is anti-californian, the culture of portland itself is not.  However be wary when looking at rentals that are priced to look like a good deal to you (from SF) that are actually well over market value in portland."
askportland,32mowr,doubleyew3times,2,Wed Apr 15 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think its just a by-product of the fact that California is heavily populated, far more so than our other direct neighbors especially, and therefor most of the immigrants are from California. Since the immigrants from California are the most noticeable, well, they get noticed and therefor complained about the most.  In reality nobody really cares unless you violate the compact by complaining about how Portland isn't like wherever you came from."

There is an active Facebook group called Friends Living with Friends, but it's closed to non-locals. I would advise a short term rental through airbnb until you find something permanent.  Also, from reading FLWF, it seems like the established houses renting out rooms are often say no couples, no additional pets, because the market is so competitive, they can be picky. You might be better off renting a 1 bedroom or studio."

It has the lower walkway, so there's less unnecessary climb/descent, and the walk is nicer, especially on the east side - going over the Broadway Bridge is much more trafficky, Steel is more walking-friendly.   Safety-wise, Broadway might be marginally better because it's along more trafficked roads, but around 7pm, there will be plenty of people on both routes."

Fortunately there are lots of neighborhoods that fit your description. Check out Hawthorne, Alberta, and Mississippi to start with. Secondary places to check out include E Burnside around 28th (Kerns), NW 23rd outside of downtown, and SE Division."

Also check out the neighborhood around N Mississippi Ave, between Fremont and Skidmore... lots of cool stuff up there as well."

You'd have to make a pretty decent case for someone hiring you over the tons of local people who are equally qualified and have been working the cleaning crew waiting to get into a brewer's position. A lot of hiring is done through personal networks here so unless you've really got a killer resume or are willing to take a demotion to get in somewhere I wouldn't count on finding something quickly.
askportland,328zcl,cinemabaroque,2,Sat Apr 11 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input and I completely understand. Having worked my way up from Assistant Brewer to Brewer, I get it, it can be difficult to cut in line of others waiting to be promoted. Not all breweries have the means to bring up an untrained current employee to the level required to brew their product, or flat out, don't have staff qualified enough. Do you feel their is an over abundance of qualified, out of work brewers in PDX? I understand that the job market in the area is not so good in some, if not most, industries but I don't really know how that pertains to such a (comparatively) niche industry as craft beer. Thanks again for your input; Cheers!"

My best advice is to pound the pavement and meet a lot of people. Since you aren't dependent on getting a job right away that gives you some flexibility with how you can approach things.

The thing that I've found is that that's entirely true, IF you're at the very bottom of the ladder. If you have real experience, a strong resume, you're professional and responsible, and you have a great work ethic with great results, you're automatically worlds above the rest.  I'm finding more and more that there isn't really a shortage of jobs, but rather there are tons upon tons of young, unqualified, entitled folks who can't get the jobs and whinge about it really loudly on the internet.

askportland,324ri0,totempoll,16,Fri Apr 10 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"Do you already have the money saved for the rent? It will be very hard to find a short term lease in our very tight rental market without having proof of income. In Portland, there are many units in your price range, but many applicants, and all of them are going to be willing to sign a longer lease than you, stymieing your success. I have applied and lived in places around Portland ranging from 900 to 3050 in rent, so I am very familiar with the current leasing situation in this budget range.  If you want to set up a job in advance and you have some basic work experience and you interview well, apply here and be willing to work weird hours. You will start with a 90 day contract with them typically. This company is a great place to work, despite the strange hours. That way, you can work in Tualatin near your girlfriend. Whom, by the way, you should crash with while you start working and then you can use your pay stubs to prove income and get your own place.   If you want to work in Portland, I know a few people who have done summer apartment cleanouts and painting for the summer months, but this does involve early mornings and a lot of hours, which is why I recommended a job that gives you 3 days off in a row on a schedule.  You can save some money by finding a place in Tualatin over Portland, but a 3 or 4 month lease is still going to be a stretch to get. If being near your women is the goal, Tualatin is a nice place to live in the summer. They have chill public events in the parks and you can ride the bus up or drive into Portland on your days off. I once got a 4 month lease at Brightwaters at Redhawk in Tigard, but YMMV if you cannot prove income.  If your women live in Portland and commute to Tualatin, then living near them in Portland for 3 months may only be possible through an arrangement with a homeowner (think airbnb). Just being realistic.  The dream of treating Portland like a summer camp or a dream city where 20 somethings can float in with the warm weather and find a job and a pad right away is a common misguided goal we see in this subreddit. I am not trying to be a buzz kill, so I hope you look over the thoughts I brought up and let me know your further questions. Good luck to you both."

HOWEVER, /u/coolhandmarie is correct in that it will be nearly impossible to rent it without proof of income.  I would call them and ask exactly what kind of co-signer arrangements they allow.  If it's like the buildings I manage, they will allow you to move in without a job if your co-signer can prove that they have a bank account totaling at least 36 times the rental amount.  In this case, $790x36=$28,440.     Sorry if that amount looks ridiculous, but housing is in very short supply so landlords can ask for pretty much anything they want right now."

Today, however, I was asking because I'd have loved to stand up for the person an officer was having move from where he was sitting for what seemed no other reason than to assert his authority, or possibly that the officer saw him as a transient (and he may or may not have been, but that seems besides the point.) and it feels shitty to stand by and watch someone who's sitting peaceably waiting for a train be displaced from his seat for no apparent reason under threat of fine or arrest (be it implied or stated) and feeling powerless, even in such a seemingly minor case  I can understand that the stoop of the doorway there is private property, and the police have likely been called enough that they just make a point of clearing that doorway of people sitting there (pointless though it seems now, with that property vacant, but I suppose they have to cover their own asses). There are however, several other curbs, cement planters, and other features one might naturally sit on while waiting on a train, in the absence of any actual clearly designated official seating in the area. I'm just trying to ascertain if there's anywhere that's safe to sit without being subjugated by transit cops defending an empty building and it's surrounding planters."

askportland,31frvf,dela2185,2,Sat Apr 4 22:49:23 2015 UTC,I've been near there early in the morning. It's essentially dead. But lines can also coalesce out of seemingly nowhere when groups of tourists happen to come along at the same time.

If you go to this site, you can set up alerts to tell you whenever a bridge you frequently cross is raised.

Both suck but CenturyLink only offers DSL service to most neighborhoods which means its most likely that Comcast is your only option if you want >5Mbs service.

askportland,30vkpl,kai_zen,6,Fri Apr 3 03:50:34 2015 UTC,"Just for fun I'll throw in my visitor's guide, it's oriented around walkability from the area you're staying. The only thing it's missing is drinking, but there's tons of great bars in NW and downtown.  First some basics:  Washington Park. This is a great old park with a lot of neat things to see. Good hiking trails, Rose Garden with nice view of the city. Pittock Mansion. The place for the postcard view of downtown.  Also giant mansion from late 19th century newspaper baron. Portland Japanese Garden. In Washington Park, often considered the best in the world outside Japan.  Food : Blue Plate downtown has great lunches, it's a sort of old fashioned diner. Bunk Sandwiches are also a local favorite. Over on the east side, I love City State Cafe for breakfast/lunch as well. It's right near the Laurelhurst if you insist on seeing a movie (something I rarely do on vacation) and in an interesting neighborhood to explore. Screen Door is another much-favored restaurant over there and they are really good. Arrive early or be prepared to wait - especially if you try to hit their weekend brunch.  Food Carts are a Portland institution. You'll find massive collections (or pods) of them all over the city. Downtown pods include SW 10th and Alder (Taste of India and Frying Scotsman recommended!) SW 5th and Washington and SW 3rd and Washington. As well as several other places around town. Avoid carts that serve a wide range of items (ie burgers, shwarma, and fried rice simultaneously) and focus on places that specialize in one type of food. There's tons of great stuff and it's mostly very cheap.  Bonus food: Italian - Ristorante Roma, Grassa. Pho - Pho Hung, Pho Da'Lat. Coffee: Coffeehouse Northwest, Case Study, Bipartisan Cafe.  Neighborhoods: Portland has a ton of interesting neighborhoods, often named after the major streets. North Williams, Hawthorne/Belmont, Albina, Division, NW 23rd, Sellwood/Moreland. The list goes on and on. They're neat and fun to explore.  Parks: Among the many I mentioned, my actual favorite park of all in Portland is Lower Macleay Park. It's convenient to downtown but feels like you're hiking in the woods. Great stream (named after Oregon's first death penalty recipient) along the trail and really cool abandoned WPA restroom about 2 miles in. Easy access to Forest Park, and a modest hike to Pittock Mansion.  Mount Tabor is another interesting park with a great view of Portland and downtown. If you're going to be over near it it's worth visiting, but it's not like walking distance from downtown or anything. Easy access from Trimet.  If you have a car, go to the coast, it's beautiful. Ecola State Park (Indian Beach specifically) is really nice and has some good hiking. If you want somewhere less touristy (and nicer) drive down to Pacific City and check out Cape Kiwanda. Or visit Fort Stevens near Astoria.  Also, if you have a car, get out to the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is amazing, but if you want a hike don't hike there, either check out Eagle Creek (just west of Cascade Locks) or Wahkeena Falls trail up to Fairy Falls or Wahkeena Springs.  Silver Falls state park down near Salem is amazing, and there are tons of Willamette Valley wineries to the south/southwest of Portland to explore.  Portland has a good art museum with a solid permanent collection. Our parks system is really strong, lots of great parks.  Portland Farmer's Market is at PSU on Saturday mornings, it's really neat. Portland's Saturday Market, also downtown on the waterfront, is worth seeing if you're here on a weekend. It's pretty touristy but if you're not a jaded local it's a good place to check out.  A worthy destination for any gamer is Ground Kontrol, Portland's famous barcade. While other cities have jumped on the bandwagon, GK has been bringing old-school arcade action to Portland for 15 years. Their pinball collection is pretty amazing, as is their great collection of classics arcade consoles.  Another Portland landmark that is pretty famous but well worth visiting is Powell's City of Books downtown at 10th and W Burnside. If you like bookstores, check this place out. It's pretty incredible. You can literally (and easily) get lost in the massive collection they have.  Finally, the South Park Blocks are a pretty interesting historic area of town. Really nice to walk, although they do attract a lot of homeless people. This is where you'll find the art museum as well as the Oregon Historical Society museum.  Here's some things I'd avoid if you're looking for quality fun as opposed to overhyped tourist nonsense:  Voodoo Doughnuts - Go to Blue Star (fancy) or Coco (traditional) instead. Underground/Shanghai Tours - These are the worst. Just walk around look at old buildings and read plaques in Old Town and you'll see more history.

There isn't nearly enough demand for delivery or population density to support most restaurants having in-house delivery.

It was a few years ago for me so maybe something has changed, but I actually had to take it a second time because the test contained several questions that involved specific distances and speeds with more than one answer within the bounds of common sense (eg when asked about appropriate speed in a given situation two of those speeds are within 5MPH of each other and both seem reasonable, but only one is correct by the letter of the law). At the time they had a little info book you could pick up that had all the specific numbers in it, and if they still do I'd recommend going through that once or twice before you take the test."

If you haven't been, invest in a plane ticket, come out for a few days, try job and apartment hunt on the ground and see for yourself.  Anyhow, to answer your question, Portland is one of the top destinations of any interstate move. Job growth has not kept pace with population growth. Many of those moving here are recent college graduates like yourself. The market for entry level positions is very tough, across the board.   Population growth and other factors have caused a severe housing shortage. This means that finding a reasonable place to live is almost as hard as finding a job. I did a quick COL comparison, you'll need to make about 30% more here to live at the same level as you did in Nashville.  Don't move without BOTH OF YOU having a job. If you move without a job, have at least six months of living expenses saved up. For two people, I'd estimate that to be around $10-15k."

askportland,30th97,cinemabaroque,2,Mon Mar 30 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"As has been mentioned a lot of hiring is done based out of personal connections here so you aren't really going to be landing a job in your field or commensurate to your education when you move out here. You'll have to do some networking, get to know some people, and all that takes time and actually being here. Portland chews up a lot of transplants and they leave a year later because they still haven't found a decent job, are tired of working a rotating array of part time gigs, and don't realize how different it is when you don't see the sun for weeks at a time.  If you're cool working in a coffee shop or warehouse and living outside the areas that are considered super cool then you can totally make Portland work. If you're serious about starting a career in your field then this is definitely not the easiest place to do it.

The farm is very large and they have a trailer you can sometimes hitch a ride on to the outer edge of the farm. Their Hood strawberries in particular are absolutely amazing.  I also like Sauvie Island Blueberry Farm, which has a wide variety of mature blueberry plants. The farm is fairly small and specializes in blueberries.   I'd also recommend Columbia Farms U-Pick. They have a variety of berries, including raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and currants, but I'd recommend them in particular for their raspberries. They are rarely very busy, which is nice.  If you're looking for cherries, the best places to go are in the Columbia River Gorge. I like picking at the Evans Fruit Company in Mosier, Oregon, which is about 10 minutes east of Hood River.

Your best bet is to either go into a shop and look at the work the artists have done, or look up online portfolios. Find one who's style matches up to what you want and then go in and talk to them. Most artists will do a sketch for free or a very nominal price. Be sure to get what you want, and don't feel bad about asking for changes. They are working for you, so try to be as open with them as possible.   Good luck!"

They both seem like nice cities, Seattle has a better job market, San Francisco is expensive and competitive so it wouldn't really be much of a big move up in terms of employability.  If it were only about jobs and housing, Texas has a great high-paying job market for accountants (my major). Unfortunately, this isn't true for the one city a person might actually want to live in, Austin.  All said and done, I'd probably move to Philly if I were leaving the Northwest.

askportland,30imhe,oregone1,5,Fri Mar 27 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"Philadelphia. It's still cheap (you can rent a whole house in a decent neighborhood for $1000-1200/month), it's super liveable, the food and beer scene is really solid, NYC is a short, cheap bus ride away, you can get out into the country and away from the city quickly, the arts scene is stellar, and there are more jobs than in Portland (sort of). It's the best city to live in on the east coast. I left for school here in Portland, but if I ever moved back to the the east coast it would be to Philly.  EDIT: If the east coast isn't your cup of tea, Denver is amazing, and I've heard lots of good things about Albuquerque and Santa Fe."

While I was stuck, I ran into some of the friendliest people I've never met. It actually reminded me of Portland, when I moved here in 92 - ""hip"" enough to have a Trader Joe's, but not so hip that it becomes self-conscious/self-hating/a mecca for New Yorkers.  Admittedly, the climate isn't everyone's cup of tea, and every time I walked my poor dog he got weird burrs and shit in his paws, but the food was amazing."

I can give specific recommendations if you give me any of your preferences.     If you're here on a particularly clear day, take the aerial tram up to the hospital. The view is totally worth the $4."
askportland,30goye,treblemaker,0,Fri Mar 27 06:49:32 2015 UTC,"Well I'm very much an IPA person, but I like all ales, particularly red ales.  I'm also not opposed to hefferweisens.  My girlfriend is kind of the opposite.  She's not a huge fan of hops, but I know she likes wheat beers and more of the lager type.  She's also a fan of ciders.  Do you have any recommendations?"
askportland,30goye,pizza_partyUSA,0,Fri Mar 27 23:32:30 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you'll be in beer heaven, then! I don't drink many IPAs, but there are so many good ones, it will be impossible not to find one you like. Belmont Station is excellent. The people working there are very knowledgeable and will be able to get you exactly what you want. Reds aren't as common here, but if you like the hops of IPAs and also like dark beers, I would recommend trying any beer in the CDA (Cascadian Dark Ale) category. Bitter like an IPA, dark like a stout and smooth and outdoorsy like a red.      For your girlfriend, I'd recommend trying something like Reverend Nat's or Cascade Cider.  Nat's has a more diverse selection, but Cascade is a fairly typical cider and quite prevalent. I've heard bushwhackers is good (and one just opened in my neighborhood, so I might check it out today). There are also plenty of specialty places that make interesting drinks. A place in my neighborhood (Hi-Wheel) makes fizzy wines from fruit juices. I think your lady would love those.      I would avoid buying from the following brewers: Widmer, Portland Brewing Company, 10 Barrel, Elysian, Weinhardts, and any macro brew.      If you want to get absolutely obliterated, I'd recommend trying mead. Belmont Station has a good selection. And if you want to diversify even more, I'd recommend trying a marionberry or blackberry wine."

If you want land/yard and office space, you're looking at a house rental, which in outer SE Portland is going to be somewhere around $1,500-1,800 for a two bedroom.   I live in SE and work from home, Comcast has been fine. I've had more issues with power dips and outages than issues with the internet service.

More room, cheaper housing, just as close to nature and stuff, and potentially walking/biking distance to the MAX for downtown trips. Beaverton, Hillsboro, Oregon City, Vancouver WA. They don't really feel like ""Portland"" to me but it sounds like you've moved past the ""Basement Bungalow Houseshare"" phase of life."
askportland,30dl6o,AlphaPotato,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yea I am definitely past the bungalo living phase.  Last time we visited we did an almost entire state road trip.

I travel maybe 6 times a year for work and am a little apprehensive about the Eugene airport.  I'm not a city person either.  I'm from north county san diego so about 45 mins from downtown and would never want to live in a downtown area.

Most houses in Portland are on 50x100 lots and there isn't a lot of open space. It's still a city, after all. If you want actual land, you might look across the river, and Portland is still less than an hour away.   What was it you didn't like about Beaverton?"

It's a neighborhood of Portland but it may as well be its own city, feels less stale and is more blue collar. Kenton also has an old working class Portland feel to it but it's closer to things."
askportland,30dl6o,cinemabaroque,2,Thu Mar 26 18:39:57 2015 UTC,Rents in St Johns aren't much better anymore over the past couple of years.  Portsmouth next neighborhood over is still somewhat affordable.

Really confused on what you actually are looking for. There are tonnes of different towns in Portland metro.    Countryish that's 45-1hr to Downtown. Might be pretty close to some OK amenities, but nothing exciting. Suburbs that will have a decent yard for you to garden, big garage for brewing, plenty of shopping and OK bars etc within a few miles. Average half an hour to downtown. Portland proper. You likely won't have a big yard but you could fit a small garden. Lots of hip restaurants and brewpubs though.    What sounds best, and how would you prefer to tweak it?"
askportland,30dl6o,schallplatte,2,Fri Mar 27 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"You're kind of in luck because places get a lot cheaper as you move away from the Urban core. By the time you're out around east 82nd street it gets to be super easy to find houses with yards to rent. You'll be closer to the Columbia gorge that way too. Gresham has the same relationship to Portland proper that north county has to SD proper and is much less expensive as well, like how North Park or Hillcrest is more expensive than Encinitas.  Also, 45 minutes from downtown (assuming it isn't rush hour) will place you in the wilderness here. Urban growth boundary and all that."
askportland,30dl6o,cinemabaroque,2,Thu Mar 26 16:21:27 2015 UTC,Good to know thanks.  I'm actually from the Encinitas area.  Should I bother to check out Gresham?  I heard it has quite a bit more crime unless I'm mistaking it for a different place.
askportland,30dl6o,pizza_partyUSA,3,Thu Mar 26 16:24:23 2015 UTC,"Gresham gets a bad rap but there are plenty of places you can find that are nice pockets.  Avoid the Rockwood neighborhood but further out by Powell is nice.  Milwaukie isn't bad either.  Good Mexican food in both areas too.  You'll be close to the mountain too, which is pretty awesome."
askportland,30dl6o,electriceric,2,Thu Mar 26 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Check out Troutdale. It's probably your vibe, and super easy shot to the airport."
askportland,30dl6o,electriceric,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"Well, depends on the part and since crime levels are so low in Portland it isn't really saying much, I'd be surprised if it was higher than Encinitas outside of some of the really poor areas but even Gresham doesn't have bad neighborhoods in the way that a place like Albuquerque does. But if you want a yard, cheap housing, and easy access to the many hikes and waterfalls in the gorge its kind of hard to beat. Or just east Portland between the 205 and Gresham gets really cheap, you could also look at the Foster-Powell area in the SE or around Cully in the NE to be a little closer in but paying a little bit more."

I can certainly believe that if the last thing I saw in this world was that view as my house crashed around my ears, I might consider myself lucky, and I'm guessing the general thought of owners in the area is something along those lines... or 'hysterical outsiders, let 'em believe it, keeps prices down'. But it's a thought."

Trash companies have exclusivity on their areas of service so you don't have many options. My disposal company has options on how often they pick up. It's worth contacting Pride to see what options they have available.

You'd like to think that but the Portland arts scene is.... amateur at best. People get all kinds of excited because one Titian came to our cut rate art museum.

The biggest difference between NYC and PDX is that PDX is a small city (a very small city to be honest) and people here know the other people active in their area. There are people who have been volunteering for years, building up connections, and those are the people you'll be competing with for your arts management positions. It essentially doesn't matter how qualified you are because there are a horde of people who have proven their worth and know the person doing the hiring and they're highly unlikely to hire the random from NYC over the people who have been putting in blood and sweat for the last couple years.  You said you have a big network in Portland so maybe you already know enough people to wedge yourself in somewhere. If they can't get you a job though I wouldn't count on your experience to get you into an equivalent position here. There just aren't as many positions/institutions here as there are in NYC."
askportland,30azra,eridax700,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Preach! Also, there is definitely a stigma in the job market against transplants. Portland devours people and then spits them out in pretty short order; that is, people move here, can't find work or can't stand [insert something about this place here] and pack up and leave, frequently in less than 18 months. As such, there's an unsubtle bias against hiring transplants when there's a good likelihood you'll just have to refill their position again in the next 18 months. When you add to the fact that our pool of living wage jobs is small (because yeah, this is a very small city), most businesses can both afford to be picky because of the large qualified applicant pool and can't afford to take a risk on someone that might up and disappear right as they're getting into their groove.   Just sayin'"
askportland,30azra,theterminizer,8,Mon Mar 30 03:12:32 2015 UTC,"From what I understand of the green industry (and I'm not in it so take my advice accordingly), if you're not already in it, it's too late. There is going to be a limit on the number of licenses available and there are already medical dispensaries on every block (not literally but it seems like it) that surely are priming themselves to switch over to full-blown retail outlets. Do you know anybody already in the industry? They could probably give you some advice there. But I absolutely would not count on that being a realistic option. It feels like the gold rush, when something like 10% of people who went looking for it actually found it. It seems like the ticket to riches but most people will go home penniless, especially if they get there after everyone has already dug it all up.    Some people I speak to seem to think it's a function of people moving to Portland en masse to ""take it easy"" and thus, being less than desirable hires.   I don't think that's really the case. Portland is extremely overeducated. That's the side you don't see on Portlandia, the people with three master's degrees and nothing to do with them. There just aren't enough good jobs to go around.   The ""dream of the 90s"" Portland is dead, ironically thanks largely to Portlandia spreading that notion and oversaturating the city. Housing prices have soared, vacancies have plummeted, but the jobs aren't keeping up. Portland used to be a place you could come to live with no prospects and find enough work to rent a room in a house. It's really not like that anymore. Now it's people moving here from San Francisco and New York, either selling their houses or telecommuting on their SF/NY salaries, living like kings and making it so that ordinary people can't afford it anymore.  It sounds like you have the advantage of good friends who will help you transition, and with some time and savings, you might be able to land on your feet. But this sub is also littered with posts like, ""Help! My friends who said I could stay with them now told me I can't and I need somewhere to crash tonight!"" Or people come out here, exhaust their savings, can't find gainful work, and go home. I would say a year is a good cushion. And if you feel that strongly about it, it's worth a shot.

If you find a job before July, you'll likely get some wiggle room with when you start and can push it out a while as you wrap things up with your current job.

As far as the ""green industry"" I look to our neighbor to the north, Washington, where retail legalization has been around about a year.  The first months prices were high and supply scarce.  For the last several months supply is outpacing demand and the growers are losing as far as pricing.  Keep in mind that we have had A++ supply for medical greens for several years and the retail market is not as hot as it once was just a 5 minute drive from Portland.  If I were you I would have a plan b just in case housing/ jobs do not go as planned.  But folks have made it here with less resources than you will have.

This was about ten years ago. I lived near 12 mile corner in Gresham - not far from Fairview (which has a creepy Stepford vibe).  I wouldn't say that I hate Gresham, but it does seem rather ordinary to me. While Portland has mostly local businesses, Gresham is full of chain restaurants. The oldtown area was alright, but is only a couple of blocks. Mostly, it really didn't feel like living in Portland and that's the problem. For many of us, we came to Portland because of it's unique vibe and that's just something you don't get so much from Gresham, or Beaverton, or Hillsboro, or Tigard, etc.  I don't think it's fair to use outer NE Portland as your baseline for living in Portland, though.

askportland,3059wp,RumAndCookies,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:54:04 2015 UTC,Grant park is a lovely area - I lice in that hood. Kennedy School is fairly close too. Perhaps even check out Craigslist or Airbnb for a room?   We don't have a lot of hotels as previous posters mentioned. But the neighborhood /Hollywood area is an old established area and close to transit and downtown. Good luck!
askportland,306si0,Loki_SW,3,Tue Mar 24 22:59:44 2015 UTC,Look into places off the Yellow line (N Interstate / N Denver). 20-30 minute train ride to your work and close to golf courses. Maybe look in the Kenton neighborhood.

askportland,306si0,schallplatte,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Looking to rent at first, not going to buy without being in the area for a bit. Ideally less than $1,500 a month, I can pay more for the right spot."

You should be fine with that budget if you're okay with being further out. Your dogs will be a bit of a challenge in this tight market, just be prepared to pay an additional pet rent.

askportland,302xvg,dragonmaster32,5,Tue Mar 24 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"I always say ""Document, document, document""  she does something weird... make a note, a complaint is filed... make a note.  If there are apts to the left and right of you make sure that you see if they think you are noisy, if they don't than you can get that information to back up everything you say.  If you do have to fight fire with fire it is good to know you have all of the information.  But don't fight by trying to be crazy... true crazy always wins.  There isn't much you can do except go to the manager explain that she obviously has a problem with you and that although you are sympathetic about the possible hour differences (3rd Shift) that isn't your concern.  I would ask them about their ""violation"" procedure as it seems to be a ""her vs you"" situation, so why did they take her side.  I would also avoid bringing up the overheard conversation, it won't make you look good and I don't think it would help you.  Sorry I kind of went on and on there... good luck."
askportland,302xvg,overimbibe,3,Tue Mar 24 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"I was in similar situation. Moved into apartment, second floor, all nice and cozy. During that time I was still leaving part time in Seattle so the apartment was empty for 5 days out the week. Got a call from the management saying that a lady downstairs called and complained that I'm being too loud during the night. Lady downstairs is crazy. I told them that i was still living in Seattle part time and I wasn't at the apartment during that time. Weeks go by and I finally move to Portland full time. Lady downstairs calls again and complains that I'm too loud, listening to crazy music and take showers super late (11pm). That night I wake up at 3 am because she is screaming at her kid and slamming doors. I documented everything, recorded noises with my cell, went to the manager, filed a complaint about her and haven't heard anything since.   Document everything. Talk to your other neighbors and ask them if they think you are being loud. Possibly have them write a statement for you? If that crazy lady makes noises at night try recording it or document exact time date and specific noises/things she is saying and file a complaint. It's a ""she said/he said"" kind of deal but at least you will have things documented and possible statements from the neighbors. Maybe try talking to her? The best you can do is follow rules of your complex (no loud noises after 10pm, etc). Crazies will always be crazies."
askportland,302xvg,elizavetavl,3,Tue Mar 24 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the stories/advice, I thought the matter was closed the first time when I talked to the property manager, but they have apparently been sending her emails for the last few months.  So we wrote her an email and plan on going over there this afternoon.  This is just really unfortunate because we are good neighbors, we have never had any issues in over a decade of different apartments.    The funny thing at that point was they made all these specific claims, and we either weren't home (we were camping every weekend at that point) or sleeping with nothing on to make noise.  I think my biggest hope is they will let us out of the lease, because this is getting really ridiculous and uncomfortable.    Thanks again  One other thing is the property manager seems really nosey, when we moved in she basically told us what all the neighbors do, when they are home etc so I have a nagging suspicion that the crazy lady and her gossip and talk smack regularly, but that's just a gut feeling at this point..."
askportland,302xvg,MakeMeAnIrishCoffee,3,Tue Mar 24 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"Ugh. That sucks. Sounds like you've already spoken with the neighbors  and they're just jerks? If you're really not that loud, I would have a conversation with management and have it on record that these people are making false accusations. I don't know how much weight complaints have against you for future references, but you need to come to some kind of understanding/compromise if you're stuck living over them for six more months."

And if you walk just a bit east there's Club 21, Conquistador, The Standard and so much more.  Portland is so walkable, not many hills and very short city block.  Plus, there are car2go's everywhere, so a rental doesn't seem necessary.  Public trans is alright but doesn't run late.  I don't know your orientation, but stip clubs are fun for all out here.  Try Sassys or Lucky Devil.  Hope this helped you.  I love the prospect of a fresh faced 21-year-old getting lit in Portland because I was once one not long ago.  Chin chin!"

It may be cold and raining on the outside, but you will get warm once you are inside. Portland is diverse in its food, culture and fashion. Everyone is very welcoming and down for good times. So bring your positive vibes :) Also if you are a coffee, tea or beer drinker you will fit right in! The app ""yelp"" is very much on point when it comes to food, even our blocks of food carts are very good. We are the tree state, so don't forget to bring some hiking gear. There are so many beautiful places outside of PDX if you ever seek adventure outside the city. If you are looking for a part-time job start searching now because it is hard to find jobs in the city. Maybe you can find one at your school? I agree with everyone else, prepare your housing and job situation before you head over. Otherwise, welcome to PDX! Safe travels."

If you're bringing a car parking is a pain.    I agree about the rain coat! You'll need a good, comfortable, one. You'll practically live in it for a good part of the year. If you bring/use an umbrella we'll all know your a transplant, not necessarily a bad thing but if you want to blend in leave the umbrella at home :) I'd also recommend a waterproof bag for school or if you plan on walking or biking, timbuk2 is a pretty good bet if you like keeping your things dry.    Housing goes quickly so if you're not doing student housing you should start looking as soon as you can.    Relax! We're pretty chill for the most part. I will say that you should be careful at night (Portland has crime too) and if you an on having a car for the love of god don't leave anything that even looks like it could be valuable in it or you WILL have it broken into to.

If it's a well-paying job, you'll be better, but don't worry, having a job before moving here is much more important than having housing.  The rental market is super-hot, and very tight, but compared to NYC, it will probably look relatively tame.  And much more housing is in the process of being built.    There are hostels, inexpensive motels (though be careful about those, we definitly have our share of sketch motels), moderately priced hotels, and airbnb/vrbo options.  AirBnB actually has a unique relationship with Portland - AirBnB recently opened a hub here, and the city has updated the hotel regulations to include AirBnb-style-lodging."

If you do well in the program and are proactive in looking for a job, you should be fine whether you stay here afterwards or not.    And yes, this city is much more laid back than NYC.  I can't really compare to New Orleans, but from what I know of NO, the nightlife is a lot less drunken-debauchery-clubbing oriented, and a lot more brewery/live music/good food oriented.  There are clubs filled with the drunk and debaucherous, to be sure, but it's not a primary focus of the night life.  And while PSU has made an effort to build more housing on and near campus, it still retains much of the commuter school origins in its student culture.  Good luck!  I love Portland.

We've already had like, three 70 degree days this year and it's only going to get warmer. We very rarely have snow of any substance.   Honestly, however, you probably wouldn't like it here, if you're a NYC native.

Trying to do all you list would be a reaaally long day - esp. with a toddler. The Mt. Hood loop is the Gorge scenic highway heading east, I-84 to Hood River then Hwy 35 to Mt. Hood and return to Portland area. That's a long day by itself but covers a lot of scenic ground. I agree with the Astoria and Cannon Beach suggestion for a coast visit."
askportland,2zvblg,oldsweng,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:21:24 2015 UTC,Is I-84 more scenic than taking 26 east to Mt. Hood?
askportland,2zvblg,oldsweng,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:49:34 2015 UTC,The return from Mt. Hood will take you down 26 to complete the loop. If you leave I-84 at Troutdale and take the Gorge Scenic Highway you will see many waterfalls and scenic views. The Scenic Highway rejoins I-84 and you will see Bonneville dam (there is a fish hatchery with huge 6'-10' fish to view) before you continue to Highway 35 to see Mt. Hood. Zoom in on the Gorge portion of this Google Map of complete loop to see the Scenic Highway access.
askportland,2zvblg,theterminizer,3,Sat Apr 4 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you're coming from (east, obviously) but I'm assuming you're taking I-84 into Oregon. Baker City and Pendleton are worth a stopover for some good old west historical sightseeing, and then it meets up with the Columbia and is a nice drive. Drop down Hwy 35 around Mt Hood to 26, and then back to Multnomah Falls.   Now, when you go to Multnomah Falls, don't take I-84 back; take the Historic Columbia River Highway and stop at the Vista House. It's absolutely worth it. Then you can take 84 back into town.   After that, you're going to want to go to Astoria and Seaside, and then drive down 101 all the way to Newport. The drive down the Oregon coast is one of the most beautiful drives in the world, no exaggeration. It's too bad you don't want to go any farther south than Newport because it just keeps getting better the farther south you go. But you'll get the idea.   If you go down to Newport, then you can cut back to Corvallis on 20, then go up 99W back to Portland. Stay off I-5. It's ugly and crowded and 99W goes through a bunch of old Oregon towns and is just a better trip.  I made you a map because I like planning road trips."

askportland,2zvblg,Korsola,5,Mon Mar 23 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that Astoria or Cannon beach are nice, if you take the right route you can swing by the Tillamook cheese factory and see a lot of beautiful scenic areas off the highway. Newport is fun as well, it has the aquarium, small little shops and restaurants, and of course the beach and a nice lighthouse. Pretty much no matter which way you go and which beach you go to you'll see some antique places off the highway. Most of the towns have little antique stores as well.    Multnomah falls is beautiful - if you're heading out that way it might be worth it to drive down to Hood River - lots of beautiful scenery and it's got that nice small town quaint feel to it. There's a train you can take from Hood River that will take you up to Mt. Hood - if you're coming in the summer sometimes the train is Thomas the Tank Engine which might be fun for your child.    On the way to Hood River you could stop at Oneida Gorge. It's fantastic but you do have to walk through waist deep (cold) water so it might be a little challenging with a toddler.    Inside the city obviously there's quite a bit more to do. The Oregon zoo is awesome and if you schedule ahead you can do behind the scenes tours (like feeding penguins). The zoo is right next to the Children's Museum too which would be a lot of fun for the family. You can also see the Japanese Gardens, which is also right by the zoo. Downtown you can go to Powell's, the Chinese Gardens, the Children's Theater and so much more."

It was definitely hard and the options were surprisingly few.  If you already live out east, some neighborhoods have neighborhood social media sites such as Nextdoor. You could create a profile and then post that you are looking to rent and give a little info about yourself. This would probably work best if you're flying solo. And it only works if you already live in the neighborhood that you're searching for a place in, as you have to verify your address to join.  One piece of advice for you in your search (though you may already know this): move as fast as possible because rooms and houses go quickly. Respond to ads the day they're posted and go meet the landlords the day you make contact if possible. I replied to an ad, met my landlords, and agreed to move in all in the same day the ad went up. Before that, every room I inquired about was filled or someone was ahead of me in line.  Edit: better wording"

If I recall, food carts typically either fail in the first few months or stick around for years. This is because start-up costs are low, so entry and exit from the market is relatively easy. Food-carts tend to be started by people who aren't wealthy and don't take out a lot of loans. If they're making money, they keep doing it. If not, they can't afford to hope to build a reputation over the course of years.  Food-cart owners also try to transition to traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants and they can move around quite a bit."

When the promotion expires and the price jumps up 30% - 150%, it'll be hard for you to let go of those extra services you weren't interested in before you signed up.

askportland,2zmioo,elbowhero,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:11:48 2015 UTC,"Well, going with your example, when the promotion time ends it will automatically jump to the regular advertised price.

At that point you get your bill, see that it is significantly higher, curse loudly, your SO tells you to put money in the swear jar, you call Comcast and they'll give you a slightly more expensive promotion than your previous for 12 months.   Even if you don't own a TV, you'll still be charged for the service you selected. it doesn't really matter to them, it'll actually help their numbers.

askportland,2zljj2,orbitcon,0,Fri Mar 20 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by experience Portland. If you are looking for the recent Portlandia and hipster trend, you'd probably find something you like along the yellow line in North Portland where there's been a lot of gentrification. But I'd imagine many people that work at the US Bank tower live in the Pearl District, which is where a lot of the yuppies and middle to higher income ""urban"" dwellers are."
askportland,2zljj2,schallplatte,0,Fri Mar 20 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: that building is known to locals as Big Pink.   Are you looking for a room share or place of your own? Either way, you're probably best off seaching airbnb.com, which will let you search by distance. The rental market is very tight here, and without the ability to meet people on location beforehand, it'll be difficult to find something off craigslist."

askportland,2zljj2,theterminizer,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"Own room definitely, studio might be harder in that range, but you may be able to find something with a short commute on light rail (MAX). Again, the difficulty is the lack of housing and that you're looking for a short term rental, not the actual cost.   I'd look at the Trimet.org site to familiarize yourself with the public transportation, and pair it with airbnb or padmapper.com.  Big Pink is big and pink. We like to state the obvious around here."

You can walk there from downtown, however it's still a hike.  Plot it out on google maps, etc and set it to walking mode and see if you're comfortable with that.   The  waterfront loop isn't necessarily unsafe -- it's always busy, but there are a lot of homeless.  So if you're expecting something gentrified, downtown waterfront really isn't it..  I would probably suggest driving it just to save on stress.  Downtown traffic is no problem on the weekends, but parking can be a little bothersome depending on hours.  Saturday market is open -- http://www.portlandsaturdaymarket.com/ ; not really my thing, but it's always packed with people when I drive past it running errands.

askportland,2zikn5,MaNiFeX,3,Wed Mar 18 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"You'd have no problem with that.  You could get a fucking 6 bedroom house in Sellwood or Hawthorne for that.  You will have no problem finding a short-term rental.  There are property management companies in Portland that rent short-term houses for vacationers/visitors.   Maybe a fellow redditor has had experience with this here?  You guys should totally do this...  Finding work?  That might be an issue, but I've found you can always find low-wage part-time work in Portland.  You might be a server, work day labor, or play with your dick on stage (just kidding), but you will find work.  Most likely, under the table, as there are plenty of Americans looking for this kind of summer work, and I don't know how many businesses have experience with dealing with Visas (we're a damn big country, man).  If you want to be in a young, lively part of Portland that will be fun in the summer?  Live close in on the East side.  Think within 40 blocks from the river.  You can bike that part of town, and there are plenty of young, happening things around there.   So, I'd say anywhere from SE 15th-45th somewhere north of Hawthorne, but south of Burnside.    There are a few festivals/events on the waterfront in Portland, but you will find most of the stuff that goes on here happens in small clubs or at parks.    Being Irish, you will have no problem socializing here, and as another redditor mentioned, check with Kell's, one of the few true Irish pubs in town.  There's so much cheap beer and so many hot young chicks here, dude, just get here.  I'm 34, single dad of two, and have a house here. My life is fucking awesome, never have a problem finding a young, willing lady to have fun with.  Don't forget, there's legal recreational marijuana here starting this summer.  It's going to be fun.  Get your ass over here."
askportland,2zikn5,Strangebrewer,2,Wed Mar 18 23:32:01 2015 UTC,"Students do rent in Portland but most rentals are on lease for a year. Portland is a pretty sizable city so colleges don't really dictate the rental market.   It's going to be hard to find a 6-7 bedroom house, you might have to split up. Edit: (Or use rooms that aren't bedrooms as bedrooms)  It's hard to say if $3000 is enough since those size houses aren't very common, but $3000/7 is $428.50ish per person, thats on the pretty low end of rent in Portland. While that kind of rent isn't impossible, it's highly unlikely. Especially in the areas where you'll want to live to experience Portland as people in their 20s want to. To up your chances your going to have to up to $500+ a bedroom. $450~ is doable but not the best odds. Around $500~ is pretty ok. $550+ you'll have a lot of options."

The unemployment rate is very high and though you may hear it about other cities, this one really has a shortage of work (except in certain fields).  It's also hard to find part time jobs because a lot of people cobble their career into 2+ jobs to make ends meet.  We have a lot of over qualified people working in the service industries.  (A friend was recently moving here and was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed about finding work.

I haven't done that southwestern commute regularly, just know that 30 minutes can turn into an hour both ways very quickly.  Those highways can get really backed up.

I believe the public transportation to Sherwood is somewhat limited.

McMinnville seems to be a solid town, but I've only been through on day trips since Portland is so close.   Third, could anyone recommend any scenic hikes in wine country or outside of Portland of a moderate difficulty at most? Waterfalls are always a plus. Is the drive to the coast worthwhile?   If you want an easy hike with water falls, take a look at Silver Falls.  It's got very easy hikes and gorgeous waterfalls.  It's also pretty popular, but worth it.  Located about an hour and a half away from Portland or 50 minutes from Salem.    And taking a trip to the coast is absolutely worth it, especially if you are not from the area.  It's so close. You could head out to Cannon Beach to see the iconic Haystack Rock or maybe check out the views from Ecola State Park.  You could head up to Seaside and walk along the beach or visit the shops/restaurants.  As far as driving through Portland goes, I'd try to avoid I-5 during rush hour, especially heading south in the morning.  It wouldn't be the worst traffic, but it does get backed up.  I assume getting out of Seattle would be the same, but I've always had great luck with the traffic there.  Wine country is only about 4 hours away from Seattle, so you could leave later and still have plenty of daylight left."
askportland,2z8bal,lunarblossoms,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"Silver Falls looks great, though the coast looks a bit more unique to the area.

askportland,2z8bal,lunarblossoms,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"As in heading down to Cannon Beach from Seattle?  The coastal drive is longer than coming straight down I-5, yes, but it's a much cooler drive.  You'll get to see a lot of what makes the coast so unique.  People like stopping in Astoria which has some things to do, but I've only stopped there for food, really.  There are hikes and parks up and down the coast that give great views.  I would just leisurely make my way down, if I were doing it.  Seaside is also along the way to Cannon Beach from that direction.  The coast is nice, but I also recommend getting out into the forests while you are here.  Our forests are also pretty unique to the area.  Even if you don't get out to Silver Falls, you could head out to Forest Park while you're in Portland.  You won't see falls, but it will be really green.  The hike to Pittock Mansion is only like 5 miles round trip, and you get views like this."
askportland,2z8bal,kovasin,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"Nobody has mentioned Forest Grove yet. It's not as fancy as Dundee/Newberg, but that makes it a lot more affordable. It's about 30 mins (w/o traffic) to Portland, and you can stay at the McMenamins Grand Lodge for cheap. I recommend doing tastings at David Hill, Apelloni, and Montinore in Forest Grove. If you want to try something unique, you can also visit SakeOne in Forest Grove.  You might be trying to cram too much into a short trip. I would choose either the coast or waterfalls, to make the most of your time here. If you choose waterfalls/hiking, you'd love the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is the famous tourist trap, but there are many beautiful falls nearby if you want to skip the crowds.  If any of this interests you, I'd be happy to share more info and experiences."
askportland,2z8bal,kovasin,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"I would very much appreciate more information and experiences.  I am assuming the coast is not your average beach.  Are there hikes over in that direction?  It sounds unique and beautiful over there.    As far as Forest Grove v. Dundee v. Newberg, etc. are any of them truly ""worth"" staying in.  For example, when visiting SF and the surrounding wine regions, there are tons of great restaurants, wine bars, tasting rooms, breweries, etc. that make it worth while to spend 2-3 days in.  From what I am reading, that is not necessarily the case here?  Thank you!"
askportland,2z8bal,kovasin,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"Correct, in Oregon, we say we're going to the coast, not the beach, since there aren't warm beaches like Southern California. They're more for hiking, tide-pool exploring, kite-flying, horse riding, etc. No one really gets in the water, except maybe in the warmest weeks of the summer. even then, the water is damn cold.   A lot of Portlanders dislike some of the more touristy coast towns, but personally, I've always had a really good time in Cannon Beach. It's perfect for a day trip from the Portland area.  So if you decided to stay in Forest Grove, for example, you'll be a 15 min drive from about 15 good wineries, a 30 to 45 min drive from Portland, with hundreds of good bars/restaurants/coffeeshops, and about an hour from the waterfalls in the Gorge.  To answer your question, staying in Forest Grove or Newberg doesn't limit you to only visiting nearby attractions, because you're still so close to the Portland metro area.   By the way, in your original post, it sounded like you were a little worried about driving through Portland traffic. It's really not bad at all, compared to the bigger west coast cities. Even in rush hour, you won't spend more than an hour getting from one side to the other."

As another commenter pointed out try living close to where you work, if you can, but our public transit system is pretty sweet (I use the bus and the light rail system to get around pretty frequently). Places in the suburbs are a bit cheaper than in the city, but the city is where all the cool stuff is.  I used to work with a couple of people who moved here from Hawaii and they like it here well enough.   If you know what kind of job you are looking for or what skills you have I might be able to point you in the right direction. If you really are looking for ""just a regular job"" my company has an attached call center, which tends to be looking for new hires depending on the week. Anyway, good luck."

askportland,2z3hqt,jeremec,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"I've been here for 26 yrs, was born and raised in Hawai'i as well and Portland has become home for my 'ohana. If you're outdoor fanatics, you and your dogs will love it here.  Portland's pretty much pet friendly anywhere you go.  We have dog parks in every county of the metro and Multnomah county which is Portland property has 33 dog parks alone.  http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/38287  From the city you're about an hour to Mt. Hood and a bit less than 2 hours to the coast.  You'll see dogs out on the Columbia on SUP boards, kayaks and canoes all the time. Pubs, restaurants always come down to a personal preference, but you can pretty much sit your okole down at any pub in the city and strike up a conversation with anyone nearby.  Portland Monthly has an Eat Beat section http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/eat-and-drink/eat-beat and the Oregonian has a food and dining section as well:  http://www.oregonlive.com/food/.  You'll find food carts all over the city with food that represents countries all over the world.   A few such as Viking Soul Food and Koi Fusion have also been featured on TV in other countries.  If you love food the way islanders do, Portland's a foodie mecca you'll fall in love with. Other rags in the city that give you places to do and upcoming events are Willamette Week http://www.wweek.com/portland/ and Portland Mercury http://www.portlandmercury.com/. If you're just getting started, of course craigslist is the way to get some basic home items for less than retail.  Otherwise, Costco has been great for us.  We use their online store as well since their delivery is free and if it doesn't work we can return it to any warehouse around. I've a family of five and a German Shepherd.  Water/sewer runs $200/mo., electric runs the same.  Our heating bill which is natural gas runs about $150 in the winter. There are many island families in the Portland Metro and Vancouver areas.  When I first arrived, my kumu hula, who is no longer with us came from Ni'ihau.  A lot of his students are still in the area and dance for different halau.  If you hula or play music, let me know and I'll introduce you to aunty Kim or aunty Deva with http://kekukuifoundation.org/.  Another resource for island concerts is Mele.com. Rental market is tight, perhaps even more than O'ahu.  If your nana or 'ohana are still here, they will be a big help for you.  Rents in some areas are more than if you had outright bought your home, so most definitely will need to do your research bringing your pack here.  Unlike Hawai'i, we don't have a multiple listing for rentals, so my keiki have relied on word of mouth for their places or calling around on their own when they're in neighborhoods they like. I've been a real estate agent for the past 15 years here.  There are cool neighborhoods all over the city and each of my clients will tell you theirs is the best.  And they're all correct, each home is perfect for their needs.  Portland Monthly comes out with an annual report that puts our multiple listing info into tight graphics.  Much easier for people to get a snapshot of the city, including lifestyle.  http://features.portlandmonthlymag.com/real-estate-2014/neighborhoods.html                      ~all pau"

Also finding a place for 3 dogs will cost you a substantial deposit and then pet rent on top of your rent if you do end of finding a place.

According to KUOW radio, the term may have been coined in a 2005 Seattle Times article.   Newcomers to the area have described Seattleites as being standoffish, cold, distant, and not trusting.  While in settings such as bars and parties, people from Seattle tend to mainly interact with their particular clique.  One author described the aversion to strangers as: ""people are very polite but not particularly friendly.""  A 2008 study published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science found that Washingtonians were some of the most introverted in the nation.   Some residents dispute the existence of the Seattle Freeze.    It has been speculated that the origin of the phenomenon stems from the reserved personalities of the city's early Nordic  and Japanese immigrants.  Other reasons might include the emotional effects of the climate, the increasing number of socially disinclined workers in the technology industries, or the region's history of independent-minded pioneers.

Less than $10k is iffy.  Lower expectations about your career path.  I can't imagine that there are many wildlife management jobs well, anywhere.  What other jobs have you had?  Prepare to become one of those again, or else some sort of random admin type person.  Your dogs will severely limit your portland experience.  Portland has a very strong cultural gradient based on location: the central city is fucking fantastic and the outer suburbs are fucking not.  Your menagerie will force you into the ""not"" zone, but I imagine it's still slightly better than anywhere in DFW.  But it won't be very different, like the central city would."

askportland,2z5ghk,cinemabaroque,6,Mon Mar 16 23:26:27 2015 UTC,"Its going to be hard to find something in central or ""close in"" Portland with the 3 dogs. A place with a yard is also going to be fairly expensive in inner Portland and you'll be competing with people who don't have animals which makes it that much harder.  The good news, and this might play into your educational background if you get a job working in the Columbia gorge or something where you're commuting out of town on a regular basis, is that there are quite a lot of places in east Portland (look around the 205 freeway) or out in the surrounding suburban towns (Beaverton, Gresham) that are cheaper, much more suitable for dogs, and much more likely to have yards/fences.  Especially if you're already planning on having a car, and coming from Dallas/FT I can't imagine you're getting by without one, you might look at the outskirts first until you get settled and know your way around more. Also be prepared to work below your pay-grade at first, lots of people with college degrees are slinging coffee and stocking shelves here."

Its difficult to find places willing to rent to us even here because our dogs are Pittbulls, does Portland have the awefull breed restrictions like we do here in Texas?"
askportland,2z5ghk,brockelyn,2,Sun Mar 15 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"There are no breed restrictions here. As a pitbull owner myself I've found that people here tend not to have the biases that are common elsewhere. There are a lot of pittie owners here.  I've both lived on the outskirts of Portland and close in. I would never move to the suburbs again. For what it's worth, my wife's and my experience in the suburbs was that we rarely went in to the city. It didn't really seem like we were living in Portland - because we weren't. As soon as we moved closer in we really started experiencing the city we lived in."

I have a malamute and I am finding more places accept my malamute than accept pitbulls, but there are still many that restrict malamutes as well.    Edit: check out Portland Pooch, a site I found on another post in /r/AskPortland.  It has a pet-friendly apartments list that you can sort by size restriction.  Then you can contact the apartment sites directly to find out if they have breed restrictions.  That has been the easiest way I have found to narrow down the apartment search."
askportland,2z5ghk,brockelyn,2,Tue Mar 17 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"The city has no breed restrictions, which is what I mean. You're going to find individual breed restrictions at apartments all over the nation. Even many homeowner's insurance companies have breed restrictions.  Edit: That said we were able to rent with out pitbull when we first moved here. Of course, when we bought our house and found the one big insurer that doesn't restrict based on breed the rental market didn't matter to us anymore."
askportland,2z5ghk,metmerc,2,Tue Mar 17 19:39:25 2015 UTC,Oh that makes sense.  I had no idea that cities could have a breed restriction like that.  I thought only property owners could decide.  Thanks for the clarification!

You could move to Beaverton and it would be fine to live in, but you'd have to take the highway to go downtown or to any of the hip neighborhoods on the East side (which really are what make Portland so cool). While you may think you'll go to cool parts of the city once you factor in traffic and parking you'll find yourself going less and less frequently.  Part of what makes this city so cool to live in is being close to a neighborhood so you can go there a lot. I can only speak from my experience, but in the year we lived in the suburbs we rarely went to the city proper. Once we moved to North Portland we started really getting to know neighborhoods and going places. Even now, with two kids, we go to more cool places than we did before having kids."

askportland,2z5ghk,orbitcon,8,Sun Mar 15 20:41:23 2015 UTC,"Portland already has an above average cost of living, which is mostly driven by high housing costs. Portland suffers from unique stressors including slightly above-average unemployment despite a well above-average level of education (which means lots of underemployment and more intense competition for quality work), the lowest rental vacancy rate of any major city in the U.S., and skyrocketing home prices.  I haven't seen many breed restrictions because most places just don't allow dogs. A housing shortage means landlords just don't have to. 'Pet rent' of $50 per animal per month is also common.  P.S.

It is true, though, that people don't want to live in Albany or Alabama or Lansing. Most people look at ""cost of living"", but that's basically a score of how desirable a city is to live in. Portland's cost of living is somewhat high, especially compared to the unemployment rate or the median income.  But yeah. Most people haven't moved as an adult, they assume making friends and finding work networks and finding a job is just as easy. You don't have a friend with an uncle who runs a restaurant in Portland (or any other not-home city). You don't have a ton of connections. You don't have a safety net- no nearby friends you can move in with when you run out of money since you thought you'd have a job in the first week.  Many cities are shit.

From what I've heard about HIA (hillsboro aviation) it's a top notch flight school both fixed wing and rotary. It's becoming the west coasts largest flight school and they have expanded to central Oregon around the Madras area. I've heard (rumor only) that they might be moving their rotary school to Madras due to the mostly VFR days in central Oregon vs. The Valley. So, that is something to consider. Also, it is a HUGE HUGE school for foreign pilots. HIA has contracts with Japan Air, Air China, Taiwan, and I think Korea Air so, they MIGHT take precedent due to the large contract with them (speculation only). I due know they have a great VA front office since I was looking at getting my private pilot rating through them and I am a Vet as well. So I'd ask them about the Central Oregon flight school just to see if you'd actually be in Portland Vs. Madras. But on the flip side you can't go wrong with HIA."

Check out their gift section by the front door as well.  Portland is definitely a pro-cat city, though we don't have a lot of cat things to do - it's just kind of pervasive, like the rain (during a not-dry winter).

Here is how it goes every time -   1) Tenant says, ""gimme my money back""  2) Judge says to landlord, ""how much did you take, and why, and what evidence do you have?""  Then it splits into one of two judgement.   1) If the landlord is prepared, has pictures of damage, receipts for what was spent on cleaning etc, the landlord wins.  2) if the landlord is NOT prepared, has no good evidence, no receipts, and doesn't sound credible, the tenant wins.  It seems to split about 50/50 on the cases I've seen.  Do not bring up anything about the landlord being a bad landlord btw, sometimes people just start bitching and the judges shut that down in a hot second.

askportland,2yqlwy,AlphaPotato,2,Thu Mar 12 15:31:26 2015 UTC,Unless you plan on spending a lot of time hiking in the gorge Troutdale is kind of far and you're going to spend the extra $ on getting to town or on a rental car.  Have you looked at BnB's in town instead of a hotel?  Once you're in town you can walk/rent a bike/public transport or whatever pretty easily
askportland,2yqlwy,jayteemo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:20:30 2015 UTC,"Is Traffic usually that bad?  GoogleMaps was showing 20 minutes without traffic and 30 with traffic.   Haven't looked at a BnB, but will do so later today, any suggestions? The place we're at is $80 a night after fees."
askportland,2yqlwy,daeschek,3,Thu Mar 12 16:41:30 2015 UTC,If you're coming from somewhere that you have to drive everywhere that might not sound bad but if you stay somewhere around town you can walk out the door and find plenty of things to do within a few blocks.  From Troutdale you're looking at 20-30 mins min to get anywhere you want to be.  When we visited before moving here a few years ago I think this is the one we stayed at but I'm sure there are plenty of others around  www.bluebirdguesthouse.com
askportland,2yqlwy,MikeCanDoIt,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome, was looking at that one. The others seem to be $100+. I'll run it past the girl friend and see wassup.   Otherwise, coming from the Bay Area where we drive... everywhere."
askportland,2yqf5z,landtree,10,Wed Mar 11 23:07:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest you won't be able to apartment hunt until you're either already here or very close to moving. The rental market here is super tight right now so unless you're willing to pay to hold a place you'll find it will get rented out very quickly. Most places won't rent to you without meeting you in person first either but if you have money and a good story, getting into grad school is pretty respectable, you might find an apartment or property management place that will rent to you sight unseen.  Which school did you get accepted to?  There aren't really bad neighborhoods in Portland, things get slightly rougher in the outer eastside around the 205 freeway but those neighborhoods are by no means bad. Also as a general rule things get more expensive as you get closer to downtown, pretty consistently in all directions, so your budget will largely dictate which swath of Portland you end up looking in. You'll likely end up somewhere between the east bank of the river and 82nd street.  Transit is really good connecting to PSU but less so to the other universities around town."
askportland,2yqf5z,cinemabaroque,2,Wed Mar 11 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I know that I won't find a place till it is super close to August, Milwaukee is the same way.  I was just hoping for some general information of areas that are cheap to expensive.  My grad program is actually split between two campuses. Oregon College of Art and Craft and Pacific Northwest College of Art are the two colleges.  I am super into cycling as much as possible, I biked pretty much 90% of winter, So I'm not afraid to bike a couple miles to where I need to go!  8245 SW Barnes Road & 1241 NW Johnson Street are the two streets so I am not sure where that exactly lines up with east bank and 82nd.  I will end up studying a map to try and familiarize myself as much as possible.  Thanks for the information you have given me so far! It at least gave me some grounding."
askportland,2yqf5z,cinemabaroque,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"1241 NW Johnson is right downtown and easy to get to. 8245 SW Barnes is out in Beaverton but right on the 20 bus line which is a major route that runs frequently. I'm sure there are ways to bike out that way as well.  Neither is close to where I recommended looking for a place. Downtown is a bit pricey (and easy enough to get to quickly regardless) and Beaverton is mostly suburbia and is not as bikeable as Portland is. The Willamette river runs north south and is a general line dividing the East from West in Portland, with a few quirks, but I'd still recommend living in central/east Portland for cheaper rents but still having easy access to downtown and lots of things to do within biking distance."

There aren't really bad neighborhoods, but we could help you find a more desirable place to live depending on details like where you're going to school, and what your price range is, or other important factors. Generally people try to live close to the things that are important to them (school or work) or get close-in to Portland.

Further east its basically ye olde suburban sprawl past 82nd but even areas that had very little going on five years ago (Foster-Powell springs to mind) have quite a few bars/restaurants/cafes these days.

askportland,2yej1a,Strangebrewer,2,Mon Mar 9 04:02:29 2015 UTC,I was told by a police officer once that driving 60+ mph with a siren really serves no purpose. You won't even hear the siren until you're basically right next to said emergency vehicle.
askportland,2yej1a,taylort96,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"Emergency vehicles around here often do not use sirens, freeway or not."
askportland,2yej1a,C41n,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:33:32 2015 UTC,"Having driven an ambulance, yes we do often turn off our sirens on the freeway sometimes our lights too. This actually has to do with how fast we can go given the traffic conditions. If the freeway is clear we can go the same speed as traffic and not worry about the people who have unusual responses to emergency vehicles with lights and sirens, such as slamming on the breaks and stopping dead in the lane in front of your ambulance (yes it happens way more then it should). Also if the speed limit is 55 we are only allowed to exceed the speed limit by 15 mph which means we go 70mph (which is also somewhat hard to do in an ambulance) and this translates into maybe 30 seconds difference which really isn't that big of a deal.  Usually the people behind us can see us coming when we have lights on and we are usually just fine going the 60 mph behind the person who is clueless.  I know on certain roads in Portland such as Powell where the lights are all synced, it is actually recommended that lights and sirens be turned off because to go from one end of Powell to the other with good code 3 driving is about 60 seconds difference, not enough to justify the danger to the ambulance and general public for that little amount of speed gain.  Where lights and sirens do make a big deal is trying to get through lights at large busy intersections, however then you have to worry about the people pulling to the wrong side of the road and blocking you."

It helps to be really selective about who you actually meet up with, and even then, it's not going to work out most of the time, so kind of set expectations there.  It can really help to read between the lines of peoples' profiles.  A lot of people aren't good at this, so maybe ask a friend who has more insight if you're not sure about someone.  But even then, you can't get a read off of everyone from their profile...so the other method would be to just be blunt and have a few questions you ask everybody who you're interested in to weed out the bad apples and get a better feel for them before you actually meet up with them and increase your odds of finding someone who has what you're looking for.  One other suggestion would be - if employed and educated are critical qualities for you, it might help to put something to that effect in your profile so people know what you're after and don't waste your time."

I knew some people in Portland so they gave me advice, and pretty much told me to live in the same area you are thinking about. And just like you I definitely wanted something figured out before I arrived.  So I ended up signing a lease on a place about a couple weeks before I arrived. To save money, because I am in a similar price range, I am basically living in Beaverton for now and using this as a chance to explore the city and figure out where I want a more permanent place. Worked out great for me, I love my apartment, I got everything done over the phone, and they emailed me my lease and I was able to sign it on my phone and send it back right away.   When I showed up I had a great place, with everything I wanted, for a great price. I was worried there would be something wrong with the place when I turned up, but I've been loving it."

I basically just looked around Craigslist for larger buildings, mostly to just avoid getting scammed. Most of the newer buildings will let you rent sight unseen. Also, many of them do short leases. We didn't want to stay in this building forever, so we're only doing a 6 month lease. Some places, you would be able to find something shorter.  I'll PM you some buildings from the list I made earlier this year."

Many places offer pre-approval with a credit check and application. Depending on the management company they might offer all online services, but we went with a more local smaller land lord. I highly recommend searching for local management companies that manager a few nice buildings and locations in Portland. The big apartment companies don't care about their tenants. Good luck."
askportland,2xx913,johnnyp1231,4,Wed Mar 4 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, it is best to have a job before you move. If you don't have a job, it is good to have some savings you can live off of while you find a job (and which you can use to move somewhere else if finding a job in this area proves too difficult).  Also, be aware that many people live in Vancouver WA and work in the Portland OR metro area which can make the commute miserable."
askportland,2xx913,elmay,3,Wed Mar 4 20:45:04 2015 UTC,"Best of luck, truly!  Lived in Connecticut for 20 years prior to moving here w/ my wife in 9/08.    Start looking for gigs that require QMHA (Qualified Mental Health Associate) certification.  As you've a Bachelor's in Psych, you qualify.  Almost every agency you'll apply for will require fingerprinting as part of your criminal history background check (because you've resided outside of the state more than 90 days out of the past five years).  Getting printed typically runs $10-15 per set and unfortunately you'll have to have a set produced for each agency.  The processing has previously been done by the state itself, but they've recently transitioned to a 3rd party.  Hopefully this will be in place by the time you arrive.  When I last had my prints run for a job, it took 2-3 weeks before the agency could move forward to a second interview.    Hunt and peck for MH gigs in agencies such as Cascadia, Northwest Mental Health, ColumbiaCare Services, Luke-Dorf, Rise Services and several other residential-framed agencies.  Multnomah and Clackamas Counties do occasionally have openings for case managers and other similar positions.  Entry level residential line staff positions can start as low as $11-12, but having crisis management experience could be valuable to working w/ homeless populations or possibly at a crisis-respite facility.    It's difficult, but it might be worth looking for on-call work.  On-call gigs allow you to test out agencies and job sites to see which ones might be a good fit.  There are also wage differentials in working overnight shifts, so pay attention or ask about this when inquiring.  Cheers to you both and prepare to laugh your asses of at the way snow is dealt with here."

Your desire in quality of life matters, while understandable, should be secondary to this issue.   $8-10k for the actual move plus the move in costs on an apartment (which will be $3-4k if you plan to live in studio/1 bdr) will not leave you with very much of a cushion for you both to find gainful employment, which may take at least 3-6 months."

The cheapest studio apt in NJ besides Camden (which is very dangerous) is about $650. I've found studios for closer to $500 in the Portland area. So it seems like it might be a bit cheaper then NJ, but not significantly.   Lining up a job is crucial as you guys keep reminding us relocaters. If that fails for the Portland area, ill give Colorado a look. Thanks for the suggestion!"
askportland,2xx913,schallplatte,0,Wed Mar 4 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"It probably is! I need to do more research it seems, I just did a search on Craigslist.   And I like rain! It doesn't seem to effect my mood when its not sunny or rainy, I actually rather enjoy it."
askportland,2xv6nt,therealseabass,2,Wed Mar 4 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"Drink and party if you're into it. There's a great alternative music scene for just about every taste. The same climate change that's turning Florida to Atlantis is basically turning our winter into California Winter Lite (it's supposed to be 68 and sunny this weekend; it's normally about 40 and raining), so anything outdoorsy- hiking, surfing (if you can get a wet suit), skiing/snowboarding, fishing, you name it, people do it. The food is top notch. Also, just exploring the city is really fun, too- every little neighborhood has its quirks and stories; I'm a native and at 30 I'm STILL finding new and interesting places to go. There's the Blazers (if you like basketball) and we're a big soccer town, too (the Timbers). If you want the traditional college experience at PSU, it can definitely be more or less had if you put some work into it; really, though, it's an urban, semi-commuter school and so you have access to a lot of non-traditional activities and engagement in the city.   Newcomers frequently complain about Portlanders/people from the PNW being ""cold"" or ""aloof,"" which can be something that takes getting used to (especially people from coming the south). We're not aloof, we just generally stay out of each other's business. You're not going to necessarily meet people just by living near them or what have you; people here build socialize structured around their interests and activities. If you don't have many hobbies, I would suggest developing some; getting involved with that hobby, no matter how mundane, is going to be the best way to meet people in this town."

The rental market is even more competitive which will make it difficult (more like impossible) for you to line up any housing until you get here.  This is a very difficult place to move to without roots, a job, or a place to live, which is why pie-in-the-sky ""let's move to Portland even though I've never been and know nothing about it"" posts are met with very little warmth.

I would say Portlandia is somewhat absurd, but more of a documentary than some people around here care to admit. If you like things sustainable, enjoy public transportation, and really need more alternative friends in your life, Portland is the place to go.   Everything I have read about Denver says that it is a far more up and coming place though. The weather is better, there are more opportunities, and much more liberal people.   I know that is a hard one to say, but it's true. You go outside of Portland here in Oregon and the forward progressive liberalism falls away really quickly. It's not everywhere, but especially east of the mountains, it is pretty rampant.   It's funny in Portland there are places where someone might feel uncomfortable if you say the word ""lame"" because of its negative connotations. And outside of Portland, you come across the Fox News people who will tell you how Obama is turning the White House into a mosque.   Portland is a hard town to find a decent job in, mostly because a big part of the marketplace are young professional people in their 20s and 30s who will do whatever they can to make their dream job work, even doing it for free while taking a part time job as a barista... I know, I have a few professional friends like that.   I would say it all comes down to whether you like rain or snow more. If you like rain more, come to Portland... we get it 9 months out of the year. If you like snow, well perhaps the mile high city is better suited for you."

Burgers and pizzas are good.) Hair of the Dog  Base Camp   Pre-game place: Go have a beer at Spirit of '77. It's a Blazers fan-bar near the Moda. You can take the Streetcar to the game from there, or you can walk if the weather is decent. It's probably a 3/4 mile to a mile, door-to-door.  Other activities: If the weather is good, head out east on I-84 and go check out Multnomah Falls. You can even drive another 30 minutes after that, and go have beers and lunch at Double Mountain Brewery in Hood River.  I know you wanted to stay downtown, but I would recommend heading over to N. Mississippi Ave. and doing some (tax-free) shopping at some of the many local shops and boutiques, and then have drinks and food at some of the many bars and restaurants. Go to Bungalow Bar, and go check out their back patio if it's before 10pm. They have a bunch of swings and hammocks back there to sit on, it's fun. Girls love that place too, because of the swings. Bar Bar is also a great spot for late night burgers and beers, and they have an enormous outdoor patio area. Prost is a fun German beer bar.  If you're really stuck on staying in the downtown area, hit up the happy hour at Saucebox, get the udon noodles, and then walk across the street and have beers at Bailey's Taproom. You could also take the streetcar up to NW 23rd and do some shopping at local boutiques. Get a slice of pizza at Escape from NY, but bring cash because I think they're cash only."

You're definitely going to get wet, so if you have a high pain tolerance for cold, go for it. I've only tried it 4 times below 50 degrees, and it was definitely difficult for me. I only made it to the waterfall 2 of the times, and immediately booked it back to the car. Definitely exhilarating, but it's hard to appreciate what an amazing spot it is when it's a race against the numbness creeping up your legs.  I think you would have a better experience if you hiked up the trail to the bridge above the falls, climbed into the creek, scoped it out from the top, and then hiked up the creek bed to the next big falls. The wind and mist won't be as chilling, and you can look at the second falls from farther away than the blast zone. And there's a lil cave area to explore.

The only thing would would want to stay away from is:  Beaverton mostly because it's harder not to have a car there, Hillsboro, and anything too far east known as felony flats all the way out to Gresham.    There you go. That should help you out with your neighborhood search.   That being said you are extremely young and don't have much of a job prospect here. I imagine (and correct me if I am wrong) you don't have much money and you will be grabbing a job as soon as you get up here.   That alone will completely change where you will live. Why? Because all of those places I mentioned as great places to live in portland usually have studios that start at around 12 hundred a month.   The reasonable renting places are all in those lesser desirable areas around portland. You can get a studio for 600 a month in felony flats, versus 1200 around Hawthorne.

It takes 25-30 minutes to get to Wilsonville (via car) from there, so you might as well live in the city and commute.

The fare is the same across all of Trimet (WES commuter rail, MAX Light rail, and buses), $2.50 for a two hour ticket, $5 for all day, or $100 for a month pass.  I would check to see if your employer offers any monthly/yearly passes for a reduced cost.    Based on what you've said in your replies, I would recommend Beaverton or Tigard if you plan on taking WES to work.  They have better transit to downtown Portland than Tualatin.  If you are fine with driving to work, you could look at the Milwaukie or Clackamas areas.  Not sure how long the commute would be, but both have (or will have) MAX light rail to downtown Portland.    Helpful links:  This Interactive TriMet map lets you plan trips.  If living near transit is a priority for you, especially ones that will get you to and from downtown Portland late at night on weekends I would choose somewhere close to the frequent service lines  If you are driving, I would look at Google Maps and check out the ""typical traffic"" feature to see where rush hour is worst.

It is close enough to downtown that a commute is easy and it is very walkable.  You have grocery, bars, restaurants, food carts, shops all within walking distance.  Because of this it is a rather desirable place to live and it is not cheap, but IMO worth the cost.

My experience has been:   Northwest - small towny; side streets of townhouses, etc Pearl and nearby - the most iconic looking area of Portland. The kind of place you might go to get drunk, but not necessarily live (although I wouldn't have a problem with it). Downtown / South - I like this area best, but then again I live here. Apartment buildings mixed evenly with commercial buildings. Northeast Portland - not explored this area thoroughly, but it's had some what of a commuter town feel to it. More empty lots, strip malls, fewer people on the streets. There are lots of little corners of commerce, but often long stretches of ""let's walk some place more interesting."""

There is a very good market for people with certain IT/engineering/programming skills, a group of people that are hugely overrepresented on Reddit.  Overrated would not be a good word to describe the housing market, as no one in their right fucking mind could think it is anything but bloodsport. Portland has the lowest vacancy rate (percentage of rental properties that are not being rented at any given time) of any major city in the US, just a hair over 3%. Ohio's vacancy rate is over 6%.

People employ their friends, former co-workers, or people referred to them by one of the two. Finding a job here is very, very hard. Don't kid yourself.

Even for that terrible job, I had a one inch stack of resumes at any given time. More in the winter, because bars cut security in the dead season and everybody's hungry for work. Your special skill set is unfortunately not very special here; the bar industry is thriving here with little room for innovation. I ended up starting my own businesses in completely unrelated fields because bar work wasn't paying the bills.

I may be a bit jaded since I've done a metric fuckton of brewery tours but honestly 99% of official brewery tours are same ole' same ole'. The ones that do them in town (Pyramid, Widmer and BridgePort[I think]) don't do anything spectacular or unique. The ones that would have interesting tours don't/are basically in or can see from where you drink.   Widmer lets you keep a branded tasting glass, gives you a couple large samples. Pyramid lets you take a pint glass for free (at least they used to) and some samples. I can't remember anything about BridgePort so they actually not might do official tours.   Grab a beer at Upright or The Commons and poke around all their stuff and it'll probably be more fun than actual tours of Widmer or Pyramid.   But all thats just my 2cents."
askportland,2ws597,boopdeeboo,5,Sun Feb 22 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"I have a visitor's guide that should be right up your alley. Lots of parks, food, and downtown-centric activities. Let me know if you have any questions!  First some basics:  Washington Park. This is a great old park with a lot of neat things to see. Good hiking trails, Rose Garden with nice view of the city. Pittock Mansion. The place for the postcard view of downtown. Also giant mansion from late 19th century newspaper baron. Portland Japanese Garden. In Washington Park, often considered the best in the world outside Japan.    Food : Blue Plate downtown has great lunches, it's a sort of old fashioned diner. Bunk Sandwiches are also a local favorite. Over on the east side, I love City State Cafe for breakfast/lunch as well. It's right near the Laurelhurst if you insist on seeing a movie (something I rarely do on vacation) and in an interesting neighborhood to explore. Screen Door is another much-favored restaurant over there and they are really good. Arrive early or be prepared to wait - especially if you try to hit their weekend brunch.  Food Carts are a Portland institution. You'll find massive collections (or pods) of them all over the city. Downtown pods include SW 10th and Alder (Taste of India and Frying Scotsman recommended!) SW 5th and Washington and SW 3rd and Washington. As well as several other places around town. Avoid carts that serve a wide range of items (ie burgers, shwarma, and fried rice simultaneously) and focus on places that specialize in one type of food. There's tons of great stuff and it's mostly very cheap.  Bonus food: Italian - Ristorante Roma, Grassa. Pho - Pho Hung, Pho Da'Lat. Coffee: Coffeehouse Northwest, Case Study, Bipartisan Cafe.  Neighborhoods: Portland has a ton of interesting neighborhoods, often named after the major streets. North Williams, Hawthorne/Belmont, Albina, Division, NW 23rd, Sellwood/Moreland. The list goes on and on. They're neat and fun to explore.  Parks: Among the many I mentioned, my actual favorite park of all in Portland is Lower Macleay Park. It's convenient to downtown but feels like you're hiking in the woods. Great stream (named after Oregon's first death penalty recipient) along the trail and really cool abandoned WPA restroom about 2 miles in. Easy access to Forest Park, and a modest hike to Pittock Mansion.  Mount Tabor is another interesting park with a great view of Portland and downtown. If you're going to be over near it it's worth visiting, but it's not like walking distance from downtown or anything. Easy access from Trimet.  If you have a car, go to the coast, it's beautiful. Ecola State Park (Indian Beach specifically) is really nice and has some good hiking. If you want somewhere less touristy (and nicer) drive down to Pacific City and check out Cape Kiwanda. Or visit Fort Stevens near Astoria.  Also, if you have a car, get out to the Gorge. Multnomah Falls is amazing, but if you want a hike don't hike there, either check out Eagle Creek (just west of Cascade Locks) or Wahkeena Falls trail up to Fairy Falls or Wahkeena Springs.  Silver Falls state park down near Salem is amazing, and there are tons of Willamette Valley wineries to the south/southwest of Portland to explore.  Portland has a good art museum with a solid permanent collection. Our parks system is really strong, lots of great parks.  Portland Farmer's Market is at PSU on Saturday mornings, it's really neat. Portland's Saturday Market, also downtown on the waterfront, is worth seeing if you're here on a weekend. It's pretty touristy but if you're not a jaded local it's a good place to check out.  A worthy destination for any gamer is Ground Kontrol, Portland's famous barcade. While other cities have jumped on the bandwagon, GK has been bringing old-school arcade action to Portland for 15 years. Their pinball collection is pretty amazing, as is their great collection of classics arcade consoles.  Another Portland landmark that is pretty famous but well worth visiting is Powell's City of Books downtown at 10th and W Burnside. If you like bookstores, check this place out. It's pretty incredible. You can literally (and easily) get lost in the massive collection they have.  Finally, the South Park Blocks are a pretty interesting historic area of town. Really nice to walk, although they do attract a lot of homeless people. This is where you'll find the art museum as well as the Oregon Historical Society museum.  Here's some things I'd avoid if you're looking for quality fun as opposed to overhyped tourist nonsense:  Voodoo Doughnuts - Go to Blue Star (fancy) or Coco (traditional) instead. Underground/Shanghai Tours - These are the worst. Just walk around look at old buildings and read plaques in Old Town and you'll see more history. Pink Bus Tour - They cover some ground, but almost all of it can be seen via transit/walking (and is almost all included in my list) so you'll save time and money. They have pamphlets you can pick up at Pioneer Square if you want to replicate their route.    Have a fun visit."

askportland,2wqnt4,farfromhome9,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"Portland is roughly divided into 4 quadrants, NW, SW, SE and NE. (There's also a 5th ""quadrant"" called North Portland kind of wedged in the top.) Burnside Street is the north-south divider and the Willamette River is the east-west divider for the quadrants.  Aloha and Beaverton are pretty ""suburby"", which around here is generally not considered a good thing. If you live somewhere in Portland proper you'll generally find the roads to be bike friendly and more walkable than you will once you get out into the suburbs. (Outside of downtown Portland, however, I'd say SW Portland is the least bike-friendly quadrant.)  For your fiance's friend: Lewis & Clark is in SW Portland, so somewhere in SW Portland will be close-ish to LC. (Downtown is in SW Portland, but there's plenty of space in SW Portland that's not downtown per se, and thus less expensive.) Sellwood, in SE Portland, is another possibility because it's right across the river from LC, or Lake Oswego could be a good place for your fiance's friend because it's the closest suburb to the LC campus.  What kind of IT work do you do? That will make a big difference in terms of finding work in Portland."

I work in all the commercial high rise buildings   Which Portland only has a few of. New York City has over 100 individual buildings taller than Portland's single tallest. We have only five buildings over 30 stories!  You need to research the companies who perform this work and see if getting a job with one of them is a realistic possibility.

I wouldn't even advise living alone making $35k if you can help it."
askportland,2w9c98,rabbitSC,2,Wed Feb 18 03:55:13 2015 UTC,"It may be possible (mortgage rates are low atm), but it'd be extremely difficult.  Even if you did get preapproved, it's a total sellers market right now. Inventory is really low so homes are getting multiple offers in just a few days, often over asking price if the home is reasonably priced. Your buying power would be very limited and could easily be beat in a bidding war."

Pretty similar to where you're thinking.   You'll love how close you are to downtown. If we're getting drunk downtown, my wife and I can always find a car2go within walking distance from our place and it's about a 5 minute drive to downtown (about $4-$6  via car to go) then we cab home.   While there is quite a bit of homeless in the area, I have never had any issues. Every now and then they come by the apartment complex dumpsters and pull out bottles and cans to recycle, but they're always respectful and my wife and I have never felt threatened by them. It might be a little different story if you're that close to Powell, not quite sure.   Never had cars broken into and one of our cars is parked on the street. Never seen shady shit going on. All in all it's a great area to live in. You get the benefits of being close to downtown, East Burnside, the Moda Center, but you down have to pay exorbitant amounts of rent. We've got a two bedroom for just over $800. . . but it's a shit hole.   I suggest doing a good walk through and asking a lot of questions before you sign a lease. A lot of the buildings in the area are at the point where they are beginning to really show their age and the landlords charge a pretty cheap price to get away from having to renovate. Our apartment has single glass windows that leak air like a fucking sieve all winter. We also noticed mold on our window sills and under the sink- so protect yourself from that. It can get you really sick.  Good luck!"

The fact is that only a small fraction of Portland can afford $1400 a month for rent even with two incomes.  Good luck OP! It's only been up two days, don't panic too much yet. :)"

askportland,2w0ewr,phdatanerd,2,Mon Feb 16 07:44:24 2015 UTC,The Craigslist ad is up there. Let me know if you have any questions or anything :)
askportland,2w0ewr,ChaosDesigned,2,Mon Feb 16 19:05:53 2015 UTC,http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/sub/4892324155.html  Here's the link we have up at the moment. We've tried adding our story to it (the whole Ireland thing) then we changed it to a plan and simple description with the pictures but that got an even worse response so now we're back to this..
askportland,2w0nrv,cottoncandygrapes,3,Sun Feb 15 23:18:13 2015 UTC,Brietenbush is probably your best bet.
askportland,2w0nrv,hamellr,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:20:09 2015 UTC,I'll look into that one- thank you!  EDIT: They are all booked for my dates (man they booked up fast!). But this is awesome and I'll remember it for the future. Thanks again.
askportland,2w0nrv,3orangespaces,2,Tue Feb 17 05:13:57 2015 UTC,bagby is not that private.. when i went there was tons of people there and we even had to wait in line to get in one. there was a little bit of a wall that blocks people from seeing you in the tub but people walk right past it all the time to see if there is anyone in it
