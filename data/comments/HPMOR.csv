HPMOR,3dzt8i,wren42,16,Mon Jul 20 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"Yes Yes More likely, I think, that Harry turned Dark."
HPMOR,3dzt8i,malgalad,9,Mon Jul 20 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, he means Harry.  Dumbledore used the Hall of Prophesies to determine how to guide Harry into becoming the tool to finally beat Voldemort.  Under the hypothesis that the breakout was Harry's doing, Dumbledore is probably thinking:   Need a Plan B for stopping Voldemort. Need a plan for containing this Voldemort-level loose cannon I have created. The prophesies didn't warn me about this. If Harry is working for Voldemort, this might be game over."
HPMOR,3dzt8i,jgf1123,8,Tue Jul 21 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"This always irked me. I get that Harry is an occlumens, I get that he fudged the time-turner test afterwards, but it really seems to me that Dumbledore should have found out that Harry was involved, or done something more to investigate, or been more careful around him afterwards.  At the very least, Dumbledore should have asked Moody to investigate - although I suppose it was possible that he had to do something else to prepare for the return of Voldemort and was unavailible.  And maybe Dumbledore figured that a dark Harry was an acceptable option, as long as he didn't destroy the world."
HPMOR,3dzt8i,TwelvePointFive,16,Mon Jul 20 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"When Dumbledore hears from Severus about Lesath Lestrange, he says he's relieved because that's the best possible reason to rescue Bellatrix Black from Azkaban.  I think Dumbledore was intentionally not investigating Harry too much."
HPMOR,3dzt8i,sir_pirriplin,14,Mon Jul 20 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"This always irked me...it really seems to me that Dumbledore should have found out that Harry was involved, or done something more to investigate, or been more careful around him afterwards.   Dumbledore has peeked at the box and knows what the puzzle should look like, so he isn't interested in trying all the pieces out to see which ones fit. Turning Moody against Potter would not help Dumbledore's goals if indeed Harry was behind the escape. If Harry Potter is not our friend, then we are all certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he is."
HPMOR,3dzt8i,RDMXGD,11,Tue Jul 21 03:40:31 2015 UTC,Maybe Dumbledore didn't confront Harry so as not to push him further towards Quirrellmort. Harry has a habit of trying to wiggle his way out of trouble by taking idiotic risks.
HPMOR,3dzt8i,PhantomX129,6,Mon Jul 20 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"We know that Harry, the most rational character in the fic, had a blind spot for Quirrel. Even when faced with rather strong clues that Q was dark, was even Voldemort himself, Harry missed it.  It doesn't seem likely that Dumbledore could have seen through his own biases enough through his biases to pin the breakout on his pet protagonist."
HPMOR,3dzt8i,LeifCarrotson,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"And maybe Dumbledore figured that a dark Harry was an acceptable option, as long as he didn't destroy the world.   I think this is the key. Whether Harry is good or evil might be important to Dumbledore personally, but it has little real strategic value. Keeping him alive and on the path is still paramount."
HPMOR,3dvdio,Sailor_Vulcan,32,Sun Jul 19 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Trivial solution: Each teacher teaches all four houses in a single day, but only for a single year.  Presumably the actual schedule is more complicated, but I think the faulty assumption is that every teacher teaches every year every day."
HPMOR,3dvdio,protagnostic,30,Sun Jul 19 21:41:28 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty clear that the classes aren't every day both in canon and in HPMOR. Each class is only a couple times a week.
HPMOR,3dvdio,Uncaffeinated,3,Mon Jul 20 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"If that is the case, then you would either need to have classes on weekends, or you would need extra teachers for each subject."
HPMOR,3dvdio,MrControll,21,Sun Jul 19 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  Remember in... I think it was book 6?  it was established that different teachers required different NEWT results to accept students for that year's classes in that subject.  It was mentioned Slughorn's 6th year potions class had only like, 5 people in it from all houses.  Plus certain classes, like divination, were optional in the first place.  In Divination's case, it wasn't even available in first year.  My point being, there is probably a lot more nuance to the Hogwats schedule."
HPMOR,3dvdio,protagnostic,6,Sun Jul 19 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yep! Or you could give each teacher five or six classes per day instead of four - really, each needs to teach 5.6 sections per day on average in order for all 28 sections to fit into the five weekdays, assuming that each section gets each class once per week.   Assuming eight hours of class per day, this gives us about 1.43 hours per class, or 85.8 minutes. Let's round that down to 60 minutes per class in order to give students ample time to get from class to class and brew Polyjuice in the girls' restroom. We could then give each teacher six classes per day four days a week, with an off period one day per week, and every two weeks an additional off period."
HPMOR,3dvdio,donri,16,Sun Jul 19 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting the requirement that it's all in one day?  Is that in canon or HPMoR somewhere?  Otherwise it's easy to imagine teaching about six classes a day, five days a week, which adds up to two classes more than the necessary 28.  And that's ignoring how many subjects are optional for upper years, or not taught at all for lower years."
HPMOR,3dvdio,spencer707201,7,Sun Jul 19 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"Herbology and Potions: (2 subjects x 7 years x 2 sets of two houses)=28 classes/2 teachers or 14 classes per teacher  Flying: (1 subject x 1 year x 2 sets of two houses)=2 classes/teacher  DADA: (1 subject x 7 years x 1 set of 4 houses)=7 classes/teacher  All the other required classes: (4 subjects x 7 years x 4 houses)=112 classes/4 teachers, or 28 classes/teacher.  28 classes/5 days=5.6 class/day.  Okay, I stand corrected.  Also, each day has 3 periods plus midnight for days when you have astronomy. So that's about 2 classes a student takes per day on average if you exclude midnight. (15 periods/7 classes)  The schedules would probably have to be different every year. Harry's second year schedule in canon would conflict with his first year schedule in canon if they were taken by two different gryffindor students in one school year. That's part of why I got confused. Sorry lol."
HPMOR,3dvdio,thedisquietedpen,2,Sun Jul 19 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"Flying could also be only 1/2/3 years. somewhere betwen 4/5 year they would either be on the Quidditch team or they would stop, with a basic understanding of how to fly.   they could also have some joint classes and some by individual house. Transfiguration/DaDa (cannon not HPMOR) could be set so students learn in a smaller group then the next class be with a larger group (maybe all 40 students in a year, maybe 20, or some combination of them) they could also have 7th year students helping."
HPMOR,3dvdio,Indon_Dasani,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:39 2015 UTC,"As someone else has pointed out, don't forget that NEWT classes (6th and 7th year), the classes are much smaller. Although Potions may be an extreme (only ~5 students in canon), I think it's definitely reasonable to assume that there are not 4 different 6th/7th year classes for each course.  That could conceivably change the All other required classes: (4 subjects x 5 years x 4 houses) + (4 subjects x 2 years x 2 houses) = 96 classes/4 teachers = 24 classes/teacher. That brings the average down to an even more manageable 4.8 classes/teacher/day."
HPMOR,3dvdio,GoReadHPMoR,19,Mon Jul 20 22:48:49 2015 UTC,"Because of the 6-hour information limit, Harry would probably be unable to use his time-turner after interacting with a 6-hour turned teacher.

HPMOR,3dvdio,jgf1123,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"I think that only applies to information gathered from the future, not all information from future sources. That's why the Auror asked Dumbledore if he wanted the information from six hours in the future; their mere interaction doesn't affect his ability to use the time turner, only the transfer of future information. So long as the professors never revealed anything about the future it could work out, I think."
HPMOR,3dvdio,Linearts,2,Sun Jul 19 23:28:34 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable for the teachers, but I don't think Harry has that kind of discipline."
HPMOR,3dvdio,AmyWarlock,7,Mon Jul 20 03:53:24 2015 UTC,"You can find a sample canon first year timetable here:  http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/First_year  The wikia can't seem make up its mind how many periods there are as (ignoring the midnight astronomy session) they vary from 3 to 6 per day and double periods (one class extending over two consecutive periods) are fairly common.  Bottom line, students don't see every teacher every day.  In HPMoR, Harry has Quirrell twice in the first week, Tuesday and Friday.  And this is after Quirrell rearranged his schedule to have twice as much time with each student.  That is not to say teaching at Hogwarts is not a full-time job.  Lesson prep plus teaching seven classes per year plus grading plus other stuff like patrolling the corridors, house discipline, fighting in wars..."
HPMOR,3dvdio,Transfuturist,6,Mon Jul 20 00:20:35 2015 UTC,Has it been confirmed that every year has every class on each day of the week?
HPMOR,3dvdio,coredumperror,16,Sun Jul 19 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they don't, they wouldn't really need a timetable if that were the case.

HPMOR,3dvdio,Transfuturist,2,Sun Jul 19 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the case in the books, and I see no reason why it would be in HPMoR."
HPMOR,3dvdio,Merad,5,Mon Jul 20 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"Every class isn't taught every day. Most classes are once or twice a week, max. And then you also have to consider double-classes, where two houses are taught the same material during the same class."

That's my problem with most fanfiction stories, characters doing really stupid things all the time. Like, Harry's glasses slip off his ear in a battle scene in the fourth chapter.

Once he was immortal, he looked around, saw nuclear weapons, and said ""Yeah, that'll do.""   Listen, boy, when I had devised my great creation and come into the fullness of my magic, I thought the time had come for me to take political power into my hands. It would be inconvenient, certainly, and take up my time in ways that were not enjoyable. But I knew the Muggles would eventually destroy the world or make war on wizardkind or both, and something had to be done if I was not to wander a dead or dull world through my eternity.

Pre-prophecy: strengthening Harry and propping him up as ruler of magical England so that he'd have a worthwhile rival to fight against for all eternity, as entertainment.

HPMOR,3dvl25,pycus,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"He did not realize exactly how dangerous Harry was until it was too late.  However, Harry's creation (seemingly) caused a prophecy about the end of the world. That's enough to give anyone pause when they consider making a second Harry."

The two older men each muttered identical charms over the can and frowned briefly at the result.    I wonder what exactly did they reveal?   ""Tell them I ate it,"" said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry to choke on the soda he had unthinkingly raised to his lips.   'cause he's a Death Eater, get it?   But there is an interesting pattern to them, you see. One might say it sounds like something of a riddle.    The best guess of the pattern that I saw in this reddit: it's 5 classical elements: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Ether.   I must admit, Mr. Potter, that although it has had its ups and downs, on the whole, this has been a surprisingly good day.""   I still don't understand why.

Getting a ""this drink has a magic niveau of 1 on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being high"" would seem to make it safe to drink without knowing its exact purpose.   Quirrels quote: Well, all we can read out of it is that good, and bad things happened, but some unknown and previously unpredictable thing happened that made Quirrel happy. So what might have influenced Quirrels emotions in both negative and positive ways?"
HPMOR,3durlp,Yasuda1986,4,Sun Jul 19 18:16:54 2015 UTC,Positive because his goal was to make Harry remember some of his truth memories and it worked.

HPMOR,3dqusw,rockham,21,Sat Jul 18 16:02:28 2015 UTC,Prophecies are tricky things. Voldemort doesn't want someone a week or a year or a millennium down the line somehow releasing Harry from the Mirror.
HPMOR,3dqusw,LogicDragon,6,Sat Jul 18 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"Point taken. Still...    given how painstakingly the Mirror had been crafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroy the world using a lump of cheese.   I don't think adding ""Use the mirror to release the prophecised star-destroyer"" to the list of ways to destroy the world with the mirror would overweigh the in-built countermeasures."
HPMOR,3dqusw,LogicDragon,3,Sat Jul 18 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"The Atlanteans weren't omniscient. The Mirror itself won't destroy the world, but there's nothing to suggest that it will actively combat the threat that is Harry."
HPMOR,3dqusw,Phhhhuh,13,Sun Jul 19 08:30:56 2015 UTC,"His intention was not to do it ""with some Unbreakable Vows."" The Vows were merely put in place as a precaution to try to gradually lessen Harry's potential for destruction before the grande finale— killing him. Voldemort could get away with a move like that because Harry started to believe that Voldemort actually intended him to live, a little hope is a very dangerous thing, it's the root of a lot of bias. The intention was always to kill Harry, a more permanent solution than trapping him inside the Mirror. The reason the Mirror is a worse choice is that Voldemort can't be sure of knowing the full properties of the Mirror, maybe someone would come along one day and find a way to release Harry."
HPMOR,3dqusw,melmonella,3,Sat Jul 18 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"Is killing Harry a better solution though? I mean, QQ knows of at least one person who has managed to survive death, and of no people who have managed to get out of the mirror. This seems to suggest that Mirror is a surer way to disable someone than death is."
HPMOR,3dqusw,Phhhhuh,13,Sat Jul 18 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Only if the total number of people who have died is comparable to the total number of people who have gone into the Mirror, no? Otherwise I think that's some sort of statistical fallacy.  Besides, the point is that Voldemort shouldn't be overconfident in his knowledge about the Mirror, being an old artifact shrouded in myth. This means that the fact that he doesn't know about anyone who has escaped the Mirror is not very relevant. Death on the other hand is a subject he has researched well! He probably knows more about death, and the means of escaping it, than anyone else, so he knows that Harry will stay dead (since he is the only person that can resurrect Harry)."
HPMOR,3dqusw,melmonella,5,Sat Jul 18 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, fair point. On an unrelated topic, he should have totally cut Harry's arms and legs off before giving Harry a minute to tell QQ secrets, and not after."

HPMOR,3dqusw,PsychoRecycled,7,Sun Jul 19 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"He probably knows more about the mechanics of death than he does the mechanics of the mirror, and therefore assigns higher probabilities to his predictions about death than he does to his predictions about the mirror."

HPMOR,3dqusw,Phhhhuh,2,Sun Jul 19 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think you're half right. I'll have to reread it to be sure, but I think he said something very similar to that, while still leaving himself a little wriggle room. He wasn't able to kill Harry during most of it, because of the safeguard he had made so that his horcrux clones wouldn't be able to fight each other. That might have been his way out of it, he couldn't really plan to kill Harry at the time, he could just plan to manipulate Harry into attacking him first and destroying the safeguard? Or he was able to say it because he planned to have the Death Eaters kill Harry, maybe it's that easy?"

And it would've pretty much been necessary for HJPEV to have different motivations to choose Hufflepuff over Ravenclaw (like choosing his own happiness over being able to remake the world).  But they have very similar personalities and interests: they both like to experiment and invent, and they both have a hard time interacting with others (or caring about other people's opinions).  And I think they'd get along great: HJPEV would see Harry the Hufflepuff as someone who could recognize irrationality in the magical world and help fix it, and would quickly find the appropriate incentives to get Hufflepuff Harry to work on problems of interest to HJPEV. Hufflepuff Harry would see HJPEV as someone who appreciates a good shortcut and has lots of useful ideas and knowledge."

HPMOR,3djbna,thetimujin,8,Thu Jul 16 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"This is hands-down my favorite arc/chapter, and I always get emotional when reading it.  I got similar chills/emotions from chapter 96: Spoiler  Dementors as incarnations of Death in the world also makes much much more sense than the canon Dementors-are-incarnations-of-fear."
HPMOR,3djbna,inherentlyawesome,2,Fri Jul 17 01:18:20 2015 UTC,"Well it was more like Dementors cause depression and fear, not that they were the shadows of those emotions."
HPMOR,3djbna,Yasuda1986,2,Fri Jul 17 01:48:10 2015 UTC,Dementors were supposed to symbolize depression according to Rowling

Everything about the story builds up to this point, and the payoff is absolutely superb. If the context of the lore or plot or characters were any different, the Boy-Who-Lived gaining the ability to destroy Dementors would seem like a contrived power fantasy or wish-fulfillment thing. But instead, everything in the story comes together in a perfect way such that the reader is left to conclude that after all of that, it would be impossible for Harry not to be able to destroy Dementors.   Sorry if my thoughts seem rambling, but seriously. I don't have enough good things to say about this chapter."

HPMOR,3de7ps,ae_der,7,Wed Jul 15 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"I guess it would depend on whether or not the original body could be recovered? With troll regeneration, perhaps it's possible to bring the body back, which would normally be useless due to brain death, but not in the case of horcrux++?"

Unless the secret gets out that she's got Troll-based regen, few would try the typical counters against Trolls, and her Unicorn nature may very well negate even that weakness. I would therefore assume that she need only fear the Killing Curse when fired at her by surprise, because she should be able to dodge it, otherwise."

HPMOR,3de7ps,Amphorix,6,Wed Jul 15 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"If you could make everyone in the world impervious to physical injury by sacrificing a cockroach for each of them, Hermione would do it.

HPMOR,3de7ps,embrodski,2,Wed Jul 15 23:21:57 2015 UTC,"The way I think it would work is that you would lose consciousness from oxygen deprivation, but you would never sustain enough organ damage to kill you because of the regeneration.

HPMOR,3dgad3,pycus,8,Thu Jul 16 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"Just transfigure yourself a bunker dummy!   That would be well beyond Harry's demonstrated ability in Transmutation. His achievements in that field have been through min/maxing and unorthodox approaches, not through sheer power.   Or go up, its a circle not a sphere!   There is a ceiling there. Quirrell demonstrated the ability to rapidly blast through the walls of Hogwarts using Fiendfyre, a spell that Harry does not know and that would almost certainly be vastly beyond his ability.   Grab your solidfuelboomstick and hufflehoop out of there.   It is heavily implied that that plan only worked because Quirrell made his own adjustments, and that Harry in hindsight realized that it should most likely have killed him. Also, ceiling still a thing.   For that matter why doesn't Doubledoor try to flame in and grab HP in like a jizzminute?   Dumbledore didn't know. Quirrell had set a distraction – Bellatrix Lestrange killing Nicholas Flamel. The Dumbledore in the mirror did not have a phoenix, and it is unclear whether that would have worked across the mirror anyway."

Psychopaths don't actually have a preference for the non-existence of (non-useful) people, they just have no moral problems with hurting or killing others when its more convenient.  If Tom Riddle actually prefers people to be dead, that's a completely alien utility function."

Now you have the Hero, plagued by incurable illness, and the Heroine proposes to kiss him to make it better.

HPMOR,3d9jdb,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Wed Jul 15 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"Presumably because he didn't think Voldemort or Harry's Dark side were capable of love.  I wonder if this exchange from Ch. 63 indicates Dumbledore changed his mind after this:   Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. ""What about that one?""  ""Love potion.""  ""Love potion? "" said Moody.  ""Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond with an unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the Headmaster hopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly loved each other.""  ""Gah! "" said Moody. ""That bloody sentimental fool -""  ""Agreed,"" Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on his work."

Which is, basically, by practicing mindfulness and trying not to start a sentence unless you have some idea how it's going to end. This may also move you in the direction of subtlety (hence my ""might as well ask""); but you are unlikely to approach the perfection of a written character in either skill."
HPMOR,3d7biz,Tayacan,9,Tue Jul 14 06:09:57 2015 UTC,"Subtlety is an effect, not a cause, and not what you want to aim at. What you want to aim at is something I vaguely label as ""choosing precise words to get across exactly what you want to.""  This skill manifests itself as subtlety in a battle-of-the-wits context, and as other awesome shit that you want in regular contexts. Let me be more specific about the awesome shit - it means vivid imagery and phrasing, it means questions that cut to the heart of the confusion, it means driving to the base of your disagreement and learning from it, and it means being the kind of person that intelligent people enjoy talking with.  The short of it is that you probably want to increase the bandwidth of your communication instead."

Preliminarily I think it's unclear what you mean by subtlety, unless you just mean the way smart people think and talk, in which case you can only:  1) Be smart. Ship might have sailed (I don't know you).  2) Talk to smart people and try to notice when they are unimpressed, then ask or try to guess why. (I.e., practice.)  3) Read things written well by smart people.  4) Remember that you are not in fact spending a lot of time matching wits with evil geniuses and probably don't need to learn to talk in riddles, and actually probably shouldn't do that regardless.  Maybe you could give an example of a time you failed to be sufficiently subtle?"
HPMOR,3d7biz,MuonManLaserJab,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I've ever failed to be sufficiently subtle, because life seldomly calls for subtlety and honestly I've a doubt there is a lower threshold you must meet to be effective.

Exchange words using the thesaurus and observe the changes in connotation, efficacy of rhetorical devices, ambiguity or clarity of meaning etc.   I would advise you to not listen to people who tell you not to develop this skill.

HPMOR,3d43rj,NotAHeroYet,4,Mon Jul 13 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"you're assuming it's not a translation-based spell, that derives from a real and extant language, and that the demons can do that. option one might be possible, but option two is... kinda difficult, when you've been summoned, and bound to a single action. if people almost entirely bind their demons, and demons aren't omnicient, the ones that get lose might not realize this. plus, while demons function like evil genies, their power is far more limited. it certainly doesn't sound like they've got enough power to single-handedly conquer the world.  plus, it sounded like they want to maximize human suffering- this is their objective. hence, they would rather permanantly- or repeatedly- break your legs than kill you, and rather kill you slowly than quickly. humanity thriving for a while means more humans, which means when you make it all go downhill, more suffering."

Humans have difficulties. if demons lack persistence of information, then they might never remember how to pull that off.  they may obey based on conveyed intention, but copy their knowledge from the language of the summoner.  or it could be that they won't be able too, but they did originally. (but now all summoners except idiots know to add a ""when this duty is complete, leave this plane"" command at the end of any string of orders.)"
HPMOR,3d43rj,SlangFreak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hm I didn't think of that. I assumed that the demons were sort of intelligent, like the ones from the Bartimaeus trilogy. Of course, those ones couldn't escape their bonds using my argument."

HPMOR,3d3gk6,ManyCookies,2,Mon Jul 13 06:00:29 2015 UTC,Thank you. That was it.
HPMOR,3d3gk6,WTFwhatthehell,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:39:57 2015 UTC,"ok, that one was fun."
HPMOR,3d3gk6,HeirToGallifrey,2,Mon Jul 13 21:09:09 2015 UTC,"That was personally my favorite suggested ending; succinct, powerful, ingenious, and making use of basically all the introduced Chekhov's Guns."
HPMOR,3d3gk6,WTFwhatthehell,3,Tue Jul 14 02:31:51 2015 UTC,Except that it did introduce a lot of things which were not previously shown to work and new magic like the hat being able to bind a vow.
HPMOR,3d3gk6,benzimo,2,Tue Jul 14 10:07:44 2015 UTC,"If you mean using the Unbreakable Vow to solve the P=NP time travel paradox problem, I'm not sure that was explicitly stated in text to be impossible. WOG might have dismissed it though."
HPMOR,3d3gk6,WTFwhatthehell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"nah, that makes sense but nowhere did it say that the hat could choose to spend it's power to seal a vow."
HPMOR,3czbm4,qbsmd,14,Sun Jul 12 03:45:05 2015 UTC,That's really interesting; I've always been fascinated by how large internet communities seem to follow mathematical laws.
HPMOR,3czbm4,alexanderwales,9,Sun Jul 12 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this strikes me as really cool.  Whenever I see something like this I feel like psychohistory is a real possibility."
HPMOR,3czbm4,mrphaethon,19,Sun Jul 12 14:14:31 2015 UTC,Using 5 data points?
HPMOR,3czbm4,mrjack2,6,Sun Jul 12 08:41:10 2015 UTC,"The Reddit API has a limit of 1000 items per request, so the bot is grabbing the 1000 newest posts. Wolfram Alpha has 201 character limit on input requests unless you give them money, and people don't usually like 1000 line comments from bots either. So this is the best way I've come up with to display the data.  But, here's the full data. Apologies to everyone for the crazy length.  /u/plotkarma /r/hpmor"

HPMOR,3d06n3,thetimujin,6,Sun Jul 12 11:14:31 2015 UTC,"There was something horribly humiliating about being informed that you weren't happy enough.   The first time I read this sentence, I remember that it resonated with me, and I meditated on it for some time. Now, I don't remember what I was meditating about, and the sentence makes no sense to me whatsoever. What happened to me?   Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners from Noble Houses and Muggles from wizards. He'd had many fine friends and true, and lost no more than half of them in one good cause or another. He'd listened to the screams of the wounded, in the armies he'd raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of courage had rallied to his calls, and he'd buried them afterward. Until finally, when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his old age, he'd brought together the three other most powerful wizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from the bare ground; the one great accomplishment to Godric's name that wasn't about war, any kind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and not Godric, who'd taught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had taught the first Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green growing life.  To his last day he'd never been able to cast the Patronus Charm.  Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.  Harry didn't believe in angst, he couldn't stand reading about whiny heroes, he knew a billion other people in the world would have given anything to trade places with him, and...  And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had abandoned him, and Rowena passed before) that he didn't regret any of it, and he was not warning his students not to follow in his footsteps, no one was ever to say he'd told anyone not to follow in his footsteps. If it had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for those who did follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would remember that Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right for them to be happier than him. That red and gold would be bright warm colors, from now on.  And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was Headmistress she would make sure of it.   I don't even know what to comment about this, but I feel the post would be incomplete without this being quoted. Powerful.   ""Peregrine falcon,"" Harry said without hesitation. ""It can dive faster than three hundred kilometers per hour, it's the fastest living creature there is."" The peregrine falcon had been Harry's favorite animal since forever. Harry was determined to become an Animagus someday, just to get that as his form, and fly by the strength of his own wings, and see the land below with sharper eyes...    Is that an Animorphs reference? Animorphs doesn't seem... well, smart or even good enough to be featured in HPMoR. I might misremember it, though.   During his reading, Harry had discovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the Dementor's Kiss would eat your soul and that this was the reason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the victims. And that wizards who believed this had deliberately used the Dementor's Kiss to execute criminals. It was a certainty that some called criminals were innocent, and even if they weren't, destroying their souls? If Harry had believed in souls, he would have... drawn a blank, he just couldn't think of an appropriate response to that.   I also was completely dumbfounded at this thought, but then I remembered that death penalty is a thing in real world. Yeah. Humanism. Nailed it.   No, his mind was trying to see the wrong thing under the cloak, Harry could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake. But Harry had done his best to train himself to notice that tiny feeling of confusion, to automatically flinch away from making stuff up; and every time his mind tried to start inventing a lie about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to shut it down.   Hey. I am pretty sure rationality doesn't work like that. This paragraph makes it look like a magical power that you unlock and suddenly become unconditionally immune to bullshitting. I mean, however hard you train yourself in rationality, your brain doesn't change how it functions. I don't think Eliezer sees his blind spot constantly, refusing to let his brain fill it in with interpolated visual information, for example. You get the idea."
HPMOR,3d06n3,Yxoque,10,Sun Jul 12 11:30:00 2015 UTC,"Animorphs is plenty smart. The kids perform as well as one might expect teenage guerrilla fighters with no training or experience to perform. They make some silly mistakes, but overall the series is quite clever and a good deconstruction of the ""teenagers save the world"" genre.  That said, I don't think it was an Animorphs reference."
HPMOR,3d06n3,Yasuda1986,2,Sun Jul 12 11:41:52 2015 UTC,The dementors are magic so it probably fits at least in this context. Also given Harry's true nature his rationality is for all tense and purposes instinct.

But at the moment, LV had to choose between using an untested magic ritual on himself (with possible unforeseen negative effects) and testing it out on a subject that would actually further his other plans. It doesn't look so bad, especially when we take into account that he was still in his ""do nice things until they come naturally"" phase."
HPMOR,3d07x0,justanotherlaw,2,Sun Jul 12 11:44:35 2015 UTC,I thought the whole 'practice nice things until they come naturally' was LV seeing straight through Harry's last-ditch effort to make LV a decent guy.

Even now, as a transfigured gem on Harry's hand, he is in a better position than had he given himself those powers. Hermione is still alive (and will be for a long time, as a result of those powers), and Harry is bound by unbreakable oath to consult her on potential world-ending stuff. Also, LV is still alive, as a transfigured gem, and still has his Horcrux network.   When he gets out, which is just a matter of waiting for the world to not end, I don't doubt that he will give himself troll-unicorn-phoenix-nargle-fairy-basilisk-powers."

HPMOR,3d07x0,Fredlage,7,Sun Jul 12 16:30:52 2015 UTC,I would argue that the far more obvious goof was not taking Harry's wand back after the Unbreakable Vow.
HPMOR,3cxxf4,mrphaethon,13,Sat Jul 11 19:47:59 2015 UTC,This fic never stops impressing me.
HPMOR,3cxxf4,nevinera,12,Sat Jul 11 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I'm worried it's not getting the attention it deserves, and the author might be discouraged. It's a fantastic piece of writing so far."
HPMOR,3cxxf4,offending,16,Sun Jul 12 01:24:42 2015 UTC,"I do wish it reached more people, but the audience is probably inherently limited since it's a continuation of a lengthy targeted fanfic -- any readers will probably need to have read HP, and almost certainly have read HPMOR and enjoyed it enough to want more of that story.  I did once write Eliezer Yudkowsky to ask him if he could put a link from hpmor.com, but I'm sure he gets a great deal of mail (or maybe he's changed his mind about the fic).  Site analytics show I have about three to five hundred regular readers or so, which is definitely nice.  But either way, don't worry: I'm committed to the long haul.  We're a third of the way through, and we'll make it all the way there."
HPMOR,3cxxf4,Coadie,11,Sun Jul 12 01:32:09 2015 UTC,"I feel that a well written prologue could solve some of the problems inherent in a continuation of a fanfic.  Something like: Previously on ""Harry Potter"":   Harry Potter was raised by Muggle parents who loved him, and had an appreciation for Science. Harry Potter discovered he was a wizard and set about optimising the flaws he saw in the wizarding world. Unfortunately, he did not realise that one of his mentors was in fact Voldemort in disguise.  Voldemort was obsessed with ensuring that he did not die, and was extremely concerned about a prophecy which seemed to indicate that Harry would destroy the very stars in heaven. His concern is made manifest when Voldemort kills Hermoine, which Voldemort discovers has set Harry on a path that would destroy the world as he knew it.  He therefore resurrects Hermione, imbuing her with the regenerative powers of a troll, the healing powers of a unicorn, and creating a horcrux on her behalf. He places Harry under an unbreakable curse to try and prevent him from taking any action which would potentially endanger the continued existence of humanity. Harry manages to escape the situation by transfiguring nanotubes which kill the surrounding death eaters and incapacitating Voldemort, who Harry then transfigures into a jewel which he keeps in a ring on his person at all times.  He takes the stone of permanent transfiguration, and vows to conquer death.   There, HPMOR summed up sufficiently so people can read Significant Digits :)  (The reason I was thinking of this, is because I was wondering whether it would be possible to rewrite the story as a work separate from the Harry Potter universe, which I think would be pretty cool.)"
HPMOR,3cxxf4,Coadie,5,Sun Jul 12 08:36:46 2015 UTC,"Do you mind if I use most of that?  I can put it down with the glossary, and it might help."

HPMOR,3cxxf4,pizzahedron,8,Sun Jul 12 13:36:27 2015 UTC,"I changed it a bit.  The Boy-Who-Lived was raised by Petunia Evans and her husband, Oxford professor of physics Michael Verres.  He grew up in a loving home and was raised to revere the scientific method and its results.  When he discovered he was a wizard, Harry Potter-Evans-Verres was shocked at the backwards world he found -- a society that was almost feudal, a school hardly worthy of the name, and a distinct lack of optimization.  Harry's quest to rectify these flaws was quickly derailed by the plotting of his mentor Professor Quirrell, a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who was actually the Dark Lord Voldemort, and who seeks the Philosopher's Stone.  Working with Hermione Granger and (separately and secretly) with Draco Malfoy, Harry did his best to navigate the challenges of his first year: fighting in mock battles in Defense class, inventing partial Transfiguration, denouncing the abusive Professor Snape, devising a new Patronus that can destroy Dementors, breaking an innocent out of Azkaban, and angrily pointing out the flaws of Quidditch.  But his worst fears are realized when Hermione is murdered.  Harry vows that he will keep to the old words of the Potter family... ""the last enemy that shall be defeated is death.""  At the climax of the story, Voldemort's plot to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone succeeds.  In the process, Dumbledore is defeated and banished beyond time, while Hermione is resurrected and imbued with the regenerative powers of a troll and a unicorn to keep her alive.  Voldemort reveals that the Philosopher's Stone's power is actually to make any Transfiguration permanent, even a human one, and that his overriding concern is to prevent a prophecy that predicts Harry will destroy the very stars in heaven in his vain questing to optimize the world.  He further reveals that the Killing Curse he cast on Harry as a child left an imprint of Voldemort's own thinking on the child, explaining some of Harry's mysterious ""dark side.""  Harry is surrounded by Death Eaters, and Voldemort demands any secrets he might possess,  Calling upon all his ingenuity, Harry uses partial Transfiguration to kill all of his enemies at a blow, except Voldemort, whom he captures.  He takes up the Stone of Permanency, and returns to school to take control: to discover the source of magic, to end the injustices in the world, and to destroy death."

HPMOR,3cxxf4,imyourfoot,3,Sun Jul 12 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if you want to publish online for free, the typical way to do that kind of web-serial is to have a regular update schedule that's fairly slow, and offer to do additional chapters each month that various donation goals are met.  Wildbow, Drew Hayes, and Alexander Wales are pretty good examples to look at - I'm not sure how much writing you'd prefer to do, but your quality is definitely up there with theirs, and you do a great job of keeping lots of rational actors in play (that's a rarity - even most 'rational' fiction authors can only actually think through the actions of 2-5 actors consistently).  You might do better trying to actually publish a book though; I'd certainly buy it."

HPMOR,3cxxf4,quantumsheepery,10,Mon Jul 13 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"She's an enemy spy.   Harry Potter had then gone into further and considerable detail: Draco was to pretend to be a Death Eater who was posing as the editor of a scientific journal, Dr. Malfoy, who wanted to reject his enemy Dr. Potter's paper ""On the Heritability of Magical Ability"", and if the Death Eater didn't act like a real scientist would, he would be revealed as a Death Eater and executed, while Dr. Malfoy was also being watched by his own rivals and needed to appear to reject Dr. Potter's paper for neutral scientific reasons or he would lose his position as journal editor.  It was a wonder the Sorting Hat wasn't gibbering madly in St. Mungo's.  It was also the most complicated thing anyone had ever asked Draco to pretend and there was no possible way he could have refused the challenge.  Right now they were, as Harry Potter had put it, getting in the mood.  ""I'm afraid, Dr. Potter, that you wrote this in the wrong color of ink,"" Draco said. ""Next!""  Dr. Potter's face did an excellent job of crumpling in despair, and Draco couldn't help but feel a flash of Dr. Malfoy's glee, even though the Death Eater was only pretending to be Dr. Malfoy.  This part was fun. He could have done this all day long."

The errors seem obvious enough that I can't imagine he'd be unaware of them, and I'm having a hard time imagining what would be worth executing them anyway, or what's stopping him from implementing better solutions. Unless this fic is positing Narcissa as an unexpectedly genius Game player, and really, even if that were the case, the Malfoys getting from where they were at the end of canon to here given Harry's amount of power in the interim strikes me as so unlikely that I have to assume he either  (Lord knows how) somehow messed up on the scale of ""blithely reveal secret of Deathly Hallows"" again or had a very clever hand in their ""rise."""

HPMOR,3cxxf4,qbsmd,10,Sun Jul 12 20:09:39 2015 UTC,What obvious errors do you see?
HPMOR,3cxxf4,quantumsheepery,6,Sun Jul 12 01:30:16 2015 UTC,"I'm suddenly reminded of the first part of Chp. 89, where Harry spends a lot of time blithely coming up with flawed to completely wrong conclusions about Voldemort and all the Whys of the proceedings of the Wizarding War, mostly due to a very bad set of assumptions which he didn't try nearly hard enough to justify or verify. The difference being that simply asking someone who knows how things actually went down (you) would be cheating on my part.  Of course, something that Harry didn't turn out to be wrong about was that for someone of his intelligence + Voldemort's magical power - ethics, taking over Magical Britain/the world couldn't even rightly be called a challenge, and taking ten years to do so would just be ludicrous, if a timely takeover was the actual goal. Ethics are of course a constraint which is difficult to overstate the severity of, but I feel like having literally unlimited resources, Hogwarts, the Line of Merlin, the Order of the Phoenix, two of the three Hallows, a magical immortal unicorn princess etc. etc. all ought to more than compensate. HPMoR canon left Harry extraordinarily well off, in one of the most politically advantageous positions possible, and with all of his known enemies either dead or totally under his power.  Of course, one of the best parts of this fic is that the wizarding world has been expanded to be much, much larger and more dangerous than either original canons even hinted at, and the situation is clearly far more complex than I can fairly judge at present level of exposition. So while noting the discrepancy between the progress I would expect Harry to have made and where he seems to be right now, I can't really come to a safe conclusion about what that means or why it exists, or why it ought not to.    That said, there are a few obvious things that I don't really get at all (although of course they may simply be yet to be addressed), in no particular order:   The apparent failure to milk his unlimited access to the Magical World's ""supersaturated"" level of cheats. Of the top of my head, mass-produced Felix Felicis, with Stone healing to counter-act the toxicity of overuse and careful testing to determine safety standards strike me as a very, very good idea, as does the use of a Foe-Glass for any and all visiting dignitaries, which would have let Hermione be far more prepared for her American adventure.   Abusing the ""permanently transfer nature of magical creature to person"" ritual he has evidently learned for all it's worth. The potential benefits of various different creatures could be enormous, and if Hermione's experience is anything to go by, the only known drawbacks are a certain level of conspicuousness that can be remedied in any number of ways. Even if other creatures (like dragons, or perhaps even Lovegood Leaf...that would be interesting) are for some reason unusable, I see no reason to give the Troll-upgrade to all mission critical personnel. It couldn't be much harder to sell than rejuvenation. At the very least, Harry ought to do it to himself. Malfoy's existence as an actual threat. Of course, it's possible that it's just one massive false flag operation designed to condense all of Harry's potential opposition into one place. That's actually my leading theory, because as I said, the sequence of events that would need to transpire for them to actually outmaneuver Harry in that manner strike me as highly unlikely, barring help from an unforeseen source. How do they even hide? Nevermind their organizational footprint. The only thing I can recall from canon that allows one to hide from Patronuses is the Cloak, which I'm relatively sure Draco doesn't have. Patronuses may or may not be able to report on their surroundings, but they've shown that they can find and teleport to people basically anywhere, even in the depths of Azkaban. If Harry wants to find him, could he not simply get three Apparate-capable people to grab some maps and compasses, cast Patronuses, tell them to take them to Draco, then send some time porting about and doing some triangulation? As an extension of this, Harry's apparent failure to even properly engage on the PR front. I suspect this perhaps more than any other point may just simply be down to story focus, but the Tower and the Returned seem remarkably unpopular, relatively speaking. I don't think we've really seen much of any effort on the Tower's part to sell itself or its endeavors to the populace, but we have seen surprisingly frequent fearful attitudes towards it, and of course, Draco's writings. I don't think we've seen any particularly creative or effective attempts at teaching rational thinking or anti-speciest/anti blood-purist attitudes to the general wizarding populace. (Not counting optional? rationality/science courses in Hogwarts). ((I'd be really interested to get a glimpse of what life is like for students there now, for that matter)). The Goblins. Obviously what's been done to them needs to be remedied as holistically and quickly as possible, but re-arming them with wands before mollifying them or pacifying them or otherwise taking some discreet measures to prevent another rebellion (in any way that I can see) strikes me as a rather ill-advised order in which to do things. Security protocols for the Tower. The arrangements they have for it strike me as not nearly paranoid enough. The staffing situation as Pip described it in the latest chapter, with guards drastically overworked, inefficient scheduling, subbing in MLEP personnel for actual Aurors for the rush, all strike me as symptoms of a security system designed far from optimally, and incapable of handling the rushes that really ought to have been anticipated. Good people are obviously hard to find, but keeping the Tower secure is a Priority One matter, and I can't think of a sensible reason why Harry would let obvious flaws like this slide. As an extension of that, the Receiving Room itself, which strikes me as a horrifically horrible idea which I fully expect to be fully exploited at some point in the story. A room adjacent to your perpetually open front door designed to allow anybody with a mass-produced Safety Stick (great name, btw) to teleport in? A recipe for disaster. If what's been described by Pip really is the extent of the security procedures, horrific terrorist attacks would be ludicrously easy, and getting a small strike-team or army through only slightly less so. Nevermind simply sending a small legion of Pixies fitted with high-yield pipe bombs, or a few enhanced trolls (or both), through during a rush period. They could simply teleport in a number of adult mandrakes, or simply one bomb attached to a hostage large enough to clear the room, and then start teleporting in their properly protected selves, with some sort of time-delayed Innervate effect to get them back on their feet for the raid that would immediately follow. The latter isn't even strictly necessary, they could just send a friendly werewolf or half-giant through first. Minor point, but Pip is confusing me somewhat. He doesn't seem to be representative of the quality of guards that Harry is taking on (I really hope he's not) but sending him as an envoy to Magical Beings he's no doubt clearly uncomfortable with strikes me as an odd decision, as does placing him so highly period. Maybe his mysterious dead father has something to do with it? The way Harry spoke to him seemed to imply that there's some sort of advantage in having him in particular run that errand, but I can't really tell what it is, that sending an apparently dumb but actually observant person wouldn't accomplish. Or just using a bloody owl, for that matter. It almost feels like he's deliberately putting Pip in place so close to him and then sending him blithely trawling about in public in the hopes that someone will try to exploit the opening.  That ponytail. Damnit Harry, why?   That ridiculous wall of text is it for now, I think, although I have no doubt I could come up with more if I tried. To be perfectly clear, I am very much enjoying the story so far, and am greatly anticipating reading more. These are queries, not complaints. Even if there aren't actually good explanations, I wouldn't really mind.  Actually, while I'm asking questions that may or may not be able to be answered satisfactorily, I am curious about dueling power-levels. Just how strong/knowledgeable has Harry gotten, at this point? Would he be able to beat Hermione? McGonagall? Last any length of time against Moody? Dumbledore? Riddle?"
HPMOR,3cxxf4,dastram,4,Mon Jul 13 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"I understand your position, I think.  On the one hand, you don't know just how clever I might be, what I've anticipated, or even just what small mistakes have slipped by.  So you see glaring errors and mistakes, and you have to wonder: is this part of some larger plan of Harry's or mine, or are these just... well, problems in my planning?  All that said, you also know that I know that if I just tell you the answers to things, this might spoil a larger plot, while at the same time you have to suspect that I am not going to want to admit to rank stupidity when it comes to a pivotal plot point.  If I did a bad job thinking through the Tower's security protocols, which are clearly really important to the story and its status as a rational fic, then I am strongly incentivized to just bluff about it or explain it away or argue about it or somehow fix it, later.  So, there we are.  Levels and levels.   Now then, a few things I can directly address.  Felix Felicis does not exist in this story.  If it did, then everyone would be on it as much as possible, and it would be boring -- like everyone was battery-powered. Dark Detectors like Foe Glasses are used frequently, and I've mentioned them often -- but they are not hard to fool, and unreliable. Some of your suggestions have really clear ethical problems.  Trolls are sentient creatures, and murdering them to provide power-ups to minions is not a good thing.  Hermione has addressed this briefly, and we will see a lot more of this.  Likewise, the goblins.  It took some years to gradually restore their rights, and I think it's really hard to look at an oppressed people and argue that their oppression should be relieved slowly so that you stay popular with them.  And really, the available evidence should suggest to you that the Tower is pretty well-regarded by goblins -- they're making weapons for him!  We saw the reverence with which they hold their work. I admit we haven't seen much of the Tower's side of the propaganda war, but it's definitely going on.  The shape of the next plot arc will lead to us spending a lot of time on that, actually -- hearts and minds and all that. The ponytail was probably a bad decision of Harry's, and I think we can all agree on that. Harry has become significantly better at dueling, but every single one of the people you name would beat him, more often than not, if he was not prepared.   Those things are all I believe I can safely address in direct terms.  Let me say that I am delighted by how carefully you're thinking and assessing, and this is exactly what I have hoped to inspire.  But beyond that, I cannot confirm or deny anything.  Reading a story like this -- any story of wits and plans -- is ultimately an exercise in trust.  You trust that the writer has thought ahead and planned ahead and so on, while at the same time (and this is vital) you know that they aren't perfect and might be mistaken about things or failed to consider a possibility, and still further that they want you to guess ahead and so they are actively planning for your guessing.  So then: some or all or none of the remaining things you have identified may or may not be terrible mistakes or deliberate traps or clever planning or simple omissions.  Which are which?  All or none or some?  Let's find out, together."
HPMOR,3cxxf4,Hendr1k,3,Mon Jul 13 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"Hm. Interesting, and persuasive. Let's.  I do wish to clarify a point or two, though. In terms of sacrificing creatures, I was working on the assumption that Harry's willingness to sacrifice a unicorn to buy Quirrell time in canon and his apparent willingness to re-enhance Hermione during the resurrection you've had her go through (not to mention, unless I've completely forgotten the detail, his lack of vegetarianism) would imply he's willing to sacrifice non-sapients, if the benefits are great enough, which in this case they certainly would be. ((I've also been wondering if his Vow will eventually start forcing him to take unethical actions (such as sacrificing a troll to make himself much harder to kill, pursuing his own horcruxes, etc.) in the name of global safety.)) A firm (deontological?) ethical stance against sacrificing sentient creatures with Hermione as a necessary exception would be a sufficiently reasonable stance against such sacrifices, I suppose. I'm not sure exactly how practical or consistent such an attitude would be in a proper Consequentialist sense given the importance of their work, especially when paired with a meat-eating diet, the apparent implication of Hermione's in chapter 6 that she's killed a number of Dark creatures that could have been used for experimentation/enhancement instead, or lack of any especial efforts towards, say, ending the cattle industry, but meh, fair enough. I can appreciate it wouldn't necessarily be a suitable angle dramatically, having everybody hopped up on dragon spell-resistance and such.  In terms of the Goblins; I'm not so much worried about them attacking the Tower as I am some other sort of act of violence against the wizarding population at large, perhaps in an effort to reclaim territory or something of the kind, something that would make public support for their equal rights cause very difficult to sustain while retaining the popular opinion. I also very much appreciate how problematic anything less than the pursuing of immediate and total restitution for them is, and wasn't suggesting that pacification efforts take priority over that in any sense, simply that they be implemented in tandem, so that the restitution doesn't wind up being handicapped. Something as simple as a very clear, careful, and vetted understanding with Goblin community leaders that progress is being made as quickly as possible and any bloodshed would be very very bad for everyone, for example.

Bear in mind that there is a distinct advantage in terms of op-sec in having only Hermione have the unicorn enhancement, since it maintains her image and makes it effective.  I will say that Hermione is a vegetarian, although it hasn't come up.  Frankly, there's already so much navel-gazing, I haven't had very many ethical discussions.  Obviously that's going to be changing, now that Hig and H&H seem to be working together at least in some part.  On the goblins, I may have just been remiss in not showing more of the Tower's own diplomacy, beyond his efforts with Hig.  We've been spending a lot of time in the field, after all, and there's only so many tidbits I can plop in front of chapters.  Sorry about that...

One of the possible flaws that was frequently asked about in the comments was that one test was not enough to narrow down the pool of possibly terrorists to actual terrorists. So how many tests would it take, and how quickly could they narrow things down that way? Some other people in the comments section said that each new test would have to be independent of the ones before it and after it, which would apparently mean gathering all the data and putting all the profiles together a second time from scratch, rather than just adding to the profiles and data in the first test.  If they're right and mass surveillance hurts innocent people more than terrorists, then do the people in the US government who make and run these algorithms know that?"
HPMOR,3cvzxo,Sailor_Vulcan,13,Sat Jul 11 12:21:11 2015 UTC,"Even if they do, the public perception of the value of the system is more important to them then the actual effect. This is a consequence of the election cycle.  More people standing at the polls will think 'Did X Program by this candidate make me feel safe?' then will think 'Did X Program statistically accomplish the goal of lowering the odds I am killed by a terrorist?'.   Effectiveness is secondary to appearance of effectiveness, though the ratio you need to hit between those varies as you approach an election and everything gets put under a fine toothed comb.   There are exceptions. The variable shitsGiven tends to asymptotically drop to 0 after an election for a significant time until the build up begins for the next one. That's the point when most actual work gets done.  And this is why politics is spiders."

So if I post on /r/TopGear occasionally, so I'm more likely to be implicated regarding car bombs?  I thought at least part of mass surveillance is keeping data so, if they discover have a lead, they already have historical data to corroborate or disprove the hypothesis and, if their is one, follow the thread.  I admit I'm pretty ignorant to how this really works.  Please correct my ignorance."
HPMOR,3cvzxo,jgf1123,3,Sat Jul 11 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"No, you're correct; half of the reason for mass surveillance is so that you have a huge amount of data to comb through in order to find connections after the fact. For example, if you identify a man who was responsible for a suicide bombing, you can go looking through his phone records, travel plans, credit card statements, etc. in order to find clues. (The enemy is smart, so they have ways around a lot of this ... but the enemy isn't always that smart, especially when the enemy routinely engages in acts of terrorism. There are also significant questions of whether it's ""worth it"" in terms of abuses of surveillance, general right to privacy, etc.)"

Specifically, it said that he'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to the best of Harry's knowledge, Hermione was the only non-Hufflepuff who worried about bothering house elves.   So long as we're talking about the Sorting of the Marauders, two things: (1) Were they all in Gryffindor as in canon? (2) If so, how did Sirius Black stay out of Slytherin? Just that he's more brave than clever? Are we to understand that all the Gryffindor bullies are as evil as Sirius? Does Gryffindor get its good-guy reputation entirely unrightfully?  I previously protested that Sirius turning out evil showed kind of a bitterness about bullies — no bully in HPMoR redeems themselves, to my recollection — which, I was bullied massively and used to have that attitude, too.  But I realized that Sirius's trying to get Snape in front of Werewolf-Lupin clearly puts him past the moral event horizon, and Eliezer reshaped the character around that event instead of the contradictory ""good guy"" persona Rowling wrote elsewhere.

For example, here's a recent example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44  Note that neural nets are not general intelligences that learn to reason about the world.  It's not like it can learn to read, browse wikipedia, and start banging concepts together to generate hypotheses.

I don't think it's rational or rationalist, but I am by no means an expert in such judgements.

However, I'm fairly sure that it used to be very divisive in the Harry Potter fandom, before its abandonment: lots of people decry the harem shenanigans that the author inserts into all his stories (though I think that this story has a lot less of them, in comparison to his other super-famous story, Chunin Exam Day), and the rather blatant Islamophobia near the end of the story (see the events and author's note in this chapter) tarnishes it a little."

For non-fiction, Thinking: Fast and Slow was already mentioned, but it's definitely worth checking out. Give it a go. I've really enjoyed reading Freakonomics (and the spin-offs) for this purpose. They stretch the ability of pure statistics sometimes, and not everything in the books is true, but it does give you a whole new toolbox for looking at the world (unless you're already highly knowledgeable about statistics and economy).

A hen is only an egg's way of making another egg.  None are so empty as those who are full of themselves.  In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.  Patriotism is the ultimate form of narcissism. It is the belief that your country is superior to all other countries, just because you were born in it.  I have better things to do than look for better things to do.  The problem with a modicum of talent is that it can be mistaken for the tip of an iceberg.

HPMOR,3cf3ji,QuixoticTendencies,2,Wed Jul 8 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"The patriotism one is a logical fallacy resting on a syntactic ambiguity: It confuses ""You believe your being born in a country causes it to be superior"", which is evidence the person is narcissistic, and ""Your being born in a country causes you to believe it is superior"", which is not but is a much more plausible statement.  Perhaps the first interpretation could still be defended, since many patriots directly attribute their love to their country to them being born in it, and this love can cause them to think the country is superior. However, to the extent that these thoughts are not value judgements but rather are factual claims about the country as a whole, people do not believe their being born to the country is the cause for these claims being true. So I'd say the first interpretation is very false."

The same aphorism could be reworked to apply to religious people (""My religion is right because it's the one I was born into"").  The truth does not care that that a sentiment is absolute or uncharitable, or that it's rhetorically effective. The fact that it's worded in a rhetorically effective manner is what makes it an aphorism, which is what I said.

Historical and philosophical context is vital, though.  I would recommend:  Analects by Confucius.  Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.  Books that are embarrassingly bad at insightfulness are also something I find useful.  Looking at something that you know is massively wrong-headed, and thinking about how the ideas are problematic or fallacious can be really rewarding.  The most reliable and brief example of this practice uses The Alchemist by Paulo Coehlo.

Part 1: in which Harry/Simon/Horus becomes depressed and experiments with Quantum Suicide.  Part 1 (ret-con): in which Harry/Simon/Horus reasons that he continues to live because he would never try Quantum Suicide, therefore he is the least-unlikely immortal consciousness.

HPMOR,3c7w5y,axelofthekey,4,Sun Jul 5 21:37:15 2015 UTC,"Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality 40K would be some sort of Rational!TTGL with 40k things like the color red and Orcs and Lordgenome as the God-Emperor, but I don't think it would be set in Hogwarts and Wizarding Britain.  The story I want to write is a plain Gurren Lagann x HPMOR crossover, with Gurren Lagann characters in the HPMOR setting. Of course Simon will be cast as Harry, and Lordgenome as Quirrell, but things like Spiral Energy and the Anti-Spiral would change to fit the settings. Characters would gain new backstories, etc."

Dumbledore = Kamina (Still an old man, still assumed insane by nearly everyone, still falls heroically due to Harry's failings but with a smile on his face. You could probably write a crackfic with only this change and still have hpmor make sense.)    Hermione = Nia (Unicorn-beastwoman given life by Lord Genome)    Voldermort = Lord Genome, obviously.

Daphne Greengrass = Ryuko Matoi (Is clearly reading a different script from everybody else, joke character)    Main changes: Harry would be a lot more withdrawn and lacking in confidence.  Draco would be more bloodthirsty. Voldemort would be even more blatantly villainous. Dumbledore would act differantly but provoke the exact same reactions. McGonagall would act the same as always and provoke wildly different reactions. Everyone would be more prone to MANLY COMBAT. Everyone (or just the main characters) wear a lot less.

Barely made a dent in the collection. Every bit of wall space that wasn't a door or window was a bookshelf. Then my mother's cousin bought the lot next to his house and built his own library and we moved most of the collection there. It's great, rows and rows and rows of books and at the far side of the structure is a sitting area with a full bar. It's like an intellectual oasis in southern Alabama."
HPMOR,3c8fvt,RanoseValcross,6,Mon Jul 6 00:31:06 2015 UTC,Same here for me. I miss my fathers library a lot; he always jokes about it being able to rebuild civilisation in case of a catastrophe.

Think of how much you read online and imagine that the easiest way to get text is to buy a book.  Also, if you want to say ""hey, here's this cool thing I read"" to a friend, you can't send them a link.  You can either tell them to spend money or lend them a book.  Also also, this isn't just Harry's accumulation - it's his parents and possibly their parents, if they passed on libraries to their children.  I can't imagine Professor Verres throwing away his parents' books."
HPMOR,3c8fvt,yomikoma,7,Mon Jul 6 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"From the series, the family seems to have a wide variety of interests, which is enough to give our protagonist at least a college education's worth of studies in physics, psychology, ethics, a smattering of sociology, and a healthy love for science fiction.  Assuming they bought everything they wanted to read, that adds up to quite the substantial library.  Keeping well-read could quite reasonably add up to cover all available wall space in a reasonably sized home in Oxford.  Also, consider that Prof. E-V's job is teaching biochemistry, a subject Harry doesn't really touch during the series, save for a brief foray into Mandellian genetics.  Prof. E-V keeping current in his field would require it's own load of books in the pre-ereader darkness that was the early 90s.  Having moved the library of a professor before, journal copies alone could easily fill a room or two."

When I buy a book, I tend to keep it. Sometimes to look up a quote at some point, sometimes to reread, sometimes to reference, so a friend can borrow it... If you read (and reread) a lot, you'll end up with tons of books.  Books are their own reward."

HPMOR,3c8fvt,malgalad,8,Sun Jul 5 22:05:22 2015 UTC,"This is hoarding behavior. they fear they cannot hold all the information they want in their brain, and so keep it stored in texts. they are correct- they cannot memorize every book they own, however much they tried.   They, like people in other forms of hoarding, go- 'but what if i need it later,' and similar things. however, there is a line between reasonable hoarding and unreasonable, and i do not know if they crossed it. Information, after all, is so much more useful. either way, there's a distinct love of knowledge. I do not believe the third one listed is true- harry, for all his love of science, has not been driven to it at the exclusion of all else.   He knows how to make friends, and his family almost seem to be, or have been, trying to push him away from overspecializing and burnout. he reads fiction, and his parents encourage this. he has no hobbies, for he is content without them, but he is, if he has a ""defect"" reflected by this state, these are more plausible:    his is a hoarding in the delusional hope that with just the right handful of information, he can cheat death, and exist for all eternity, that the information already exists and he just has to put it together right. He hoards books, because they treat him like his true age- he hoards an excessive stockpile, because harry of hpmor is a adult mind's thought patterns, and perhaps the more instinctive information, stuffed in a child's body and brain. This both leaves him more mature, and more isolated. He isn't a child, isn't an adult, certainly isn't the take both extremes twice and give a little extra for a tip that is teenagerhood. only books treat him like an adult, for they are for all ages who know enough to comprehend, and harry does. if it were a person, this would lead to idolization, as the only one who'll treat him with this respect. as a object? he collects them, hoards them, gathers them. both parents treat him like a precocious child, which isn't the only way he wants to be treated. his books treat him like an adult instead, and he loves them every bit as much as his parents.   This is not to say i feel the house is that extreme or reflects a disorder, but if it is, i feel this hypothesis for harry fits better.  I would also change the professor to wishes he had achieved more- that feels like it fits professor verres more than wishes he were more famous."

So you are correct. Although as I just learned the basic concept (although it used microfilm) was introduced in the manifesto The Readies by Bob Brown in 1930."
HPMOR,3c8fvt,RanoseValcross,2,Mon Jul 6 00:39:27 2015 UTC,"My grandparents used to have something like 80 feet of 8 foot tall bookshelves full of books--mostly technical writings. Broken down by subject, that was probably about 80 books on mathematics, 60 on computer science and between 20 and 30 apiece from a host of other subjects... and probably about 1000 works of science fiction and fantasy. About the only books which hadn't been read repeatedly in the collection were the shelf of ""American Classics"" grandma had bought for my dad and his siblings. It turns out that if you have a few different people with different tastes in literature and different interests, it's really easy to amass a vast collection of books. When my wife and I first were married, we filled an entire wall in our office with our combined collections. That would be much larger now except that I joined the Army and we didn't feel like hauling our collection around the country, so we digitized it. I probably have about 4 million pages of media and literature now... (assuming about 500 pages per work--many of them are much larger though) and have either read or am in the process of reading all of it. I wouldn't even hazard to guess how much my wife has, but our interests are divergent enough that there is very little duplication between the two collections.   It turns out that Descartes was right in observing that knowledge is power. Collecting and making appropriate use of power is not a behavioral disorder. Making use of power is simply something which beings in perpetual competition do. Your strategy may be different, but this one can be highly effective. What characterizes behavioral disorder is whether the strategy a being employs is effective or not toward the being's purposes. Any other possible measure is simply one person interjecting his own sensibilities onto others' actions, and should in fact be frowned upon except insofar as the person's actions cause direct harm to others or society."

Unfortunately, newer research is more pessimistic:  http://news.sciencemag.org/economics/2014/09/experts-be-damned-world-population-will-continue-rise   birth rates in most African countries have remained stagnant or declined only slightly. This can be explained partially by smaller jumps in contraception and education than predicted, though most scientists don’t fully know why the rates have stalled so much.

I'm gonna grant you a bunch of crazy concessions, like assuming the earth's mass can ALL be converted via atomic reorganization into atomic micro processors and 100% efficient solar panels.    According to a test on a japanese supercomputer in 2014, an artificial human brain required about 1.4 pentabytes of RAM and 705,025 processor cores for 40 minutes to simulate 1 second of human mental activity.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10567942/Supercomputer-models-one-second-of-human-brain-activity.html  The human brain apparently runs at a speed around 20*1015 operations per second, which is right in line with that ram value.   Margolus–Levitin theorem sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 × 1033 operations per second per joule.  for power, we were going to plaster the earth with 100% efficient solar panels. ok.   That's about 1014 kw of power.   some quick conversions:  J = 1000 x kw x s, so for one second of time we get 10 ^ 17 joules.  (6x1033)/(20x1015) = 3x1017 people per joule, if we are opporating at the theoretical maximum for energy efficiency of information.   3x1017 people per joule x 1017 joules = 1.155 x 10 ^ 34 human minds powered by the sun.    Sweet!  As a quick check, lets make sure we have enough raw materials for all that.   Lets give you one atom per byte, because why the fuck not. Nanotech!   at ~1050 atoms on earth, and ~ 1 pentabypte of RAM (1015) we could have solid state memory for 1035 minds, about what we got for the power limit.    That's a pretty big number. Not infinite, and probably fucking horrifying for most of the minds involved, and may or may not be actually conscious... but hey, sure beats the extinction of all intelligence from the universe!   How long would it take to hit that level, though?  with today's 1.4% growth rate, in 1000 years we'd be at 7x1015  in 2000 years we'd hit 8X1021  in 4000 years we hit ~1034, our limit.   of course, the system would have to be set up long, long before that. ;)"
HPMOR,3bvk2e,Dudesan,5,Thu Jul 2 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"The human brain apparently runs at a speed around 20*1015 operations per second   Nitpick: a supercomputer running a poorly optimized, first generation, synapse-by-synapse emulation of a human brain requires quadrillions of operations per second.

Yes, there is a limited amount of matter/energy on the Earth and thus some kind of hard limit on what you can do with the Earth's resources.   The key about previous growth predictions, though, is that we've been bad at estimating what we'd be able to do given a certain amount of resources because we underestimated innovation.   You can see this going on in recent years with estimates on the cost of solar power and its adoption rate. Cost of solar power has come down faster than predicted and is going below what was expected for 2020. (For a reference, see Ramez Naam's FB feed.)  I don't think it's all that useful to stress that finite resources are finite.  It seems more useful to observe that past predictions of limits have been far too pessimistic, and to work on better predictive models. That doesn't mean we're claiming that resources suddenly became infinite. The world's not black & white.   (Edit: spelling)"

We cannot continue to grow at our current rate for even a few hundred years, even if we were to plaster the earth in solar panels.   Growth in energy consumption WILL slow in the forseeable future.  That means reduction in either total population or per capita energy use.

But I wanted to emphasize that the RESPONSE of humanity is no where near pessimistic enough (note: our response, not the models).  That is why my reply above was about.   Most people recognize that there are limits on growth, but they assume it is some distant future, thousands of years away, and that technology will eventually address all those issues.   The point of my post is that the limits are much closer than most people think.  Few hundred years at the outside, even WITH improvements in efficiency and technology.  There's just only so much sunlight to go around.     You can see this going on in recent years with estimates on the cost of solar power and its adoption rate. Cost of solar power has come down faster than predicted and is going below what was expected for 2020.    This is exactly the over-optimism I'm referring to (and that HPEV would likely deplore.)  Cost of solar power coming down is not NEARLY enough.   We would need to construct a solar farm the size of SPAIN to meet our projected global power needs for 2030.  I'm pretty sure I know what's NOT going to happen in the next 15 years.   Do we need better models?  YES.  ABSOLUTELY.

If you have a uniform prior with respect to complexity, it is also unbounded, because there are exponentially many models of complexity n (this would be like integrating 2n from n=0 to infinity).  Thus, the only probability function which lets us get anything done is one that decreases (exponentially, in fact) in the limit as complexity goes to infinity.

HPMOR,3bw8kp,quantumsheepery,2,Fri Jul 3 16:58:58 2015 UTC,Good points. How can Harry develop a whole new ritual in the time available?
HPMOR,3bw8kp,earnestadmission,2,Fri Jul 3 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with asking questions like this is that we have a far from complete picture of how ritual magic works (or magic in general, for that matter) so any plan along those lines that we come up with will be founded largely in speculation by necessity.   That said, it occurs to me that Monroe evidently didn't put up up wards against Time Turner use, and as far as we know, nobody has taken the time to throw any up since the fight started. That could certainly prove useful for something."
HPMOR,3bw8kp,quantumsheepery,2,Sun Jul 5 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"While I am aware of the difficulties that Quirrel reports regarding ritual development in MOR canon, I feel as though this is one arena in which Harry's thought processes may give him an advantage. One line of argument might be that most rituals are difficult to engineer because they need to be ""magically efficient"" (ch 74) rather than because their success criteria are too narrow.  It might be that enacting a ritual is easy, and Harry will do so inadvertently but inefficiently. (Without access to any in-universe magic theory and having gotten some details of Monroe's identity mixed up with other fanfics, I am having trouble speculating further.)"
HPMOR,3bw8kp,quantumsheepery,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"It also occurs to me that the magical resonance still ought to be triggering between all three Riddles and any implementation of their magic, and that this presents an odd and potentially abusable state of affairs, especially given that canon Harry managed to guess that it effects those with more powerful magic more strongly, and he's willing to endure the required pain/risk/self-sacrifice at this point. The resonance strikes me as the only thing that could potentially perma-kill (i.e. destroy the actual soul) of any of the networked Riddles at this point. It certainly seemed to pose such a threat to canon Quirrellmort even when he was inside Quirrell's body, and the only known countermeasure is to transform into an Animagus form, which I would assume works because it effectively cuts you off from your magic (evidently tied to your soul) and thus ends the feedback loop. Hermione doesn't have an Animagus form, and even if Voldie's has transferred over with his magic, transforming would leave him vulnerable to capture.  As to ways for Harry to actually trigger the resonance...hard to say. Harry and Voldie are moving around in Monroe's shed just fine, and Harry was even before it got trashed, so apparently none of Monroe's area-wide spells or wards effect either of them if they simply move about within their radius. The circle has been made ""non-magic"" with the Stone, and thus can be touched safely by Harry and presumably Voldie as is. If it's possible for Harry to ""charge"" it as it is, using it as a conduit to channel his magic, he may be able to create a circle that would trap Voldie in a resonance zone? Or at least create a barrier that Voldie would have to bull through or somehow otherwise circumnavigate, potentially giving Dumbledore a much needed opening?  No, wait. Something obvious just occurred to me. Patronuses are (I think) basically unblockable, as fast as thought, and definitely trigger the resonance. Harry could simply ""re-do"" the resurrection, generating his patronus inside Hermione's body to perform an exorcism. If the resonance works how I think and canon Harry suspected it does, it will either force Voldie out of Hermione's body or destroy him before it kills Harry, if only by a slim margin.  Of course, I don't see why Voldie or Baba Yaga couldn't just fire off a quick AoE curse to take Harry out, but they haven't thought to try it yet, so who knows."
HPMOR,3bw8kp,LiteralHeadCannon,2,Sun Jul 5 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"Except, wait, no, Monroe and Voldie were dueling just fine. I've apparently forgotten some aspect of how the resonance works in this fic."

HPMOR,3bw8kp,tp488,2,Fri Jul 3 01:02:50 2015 UTC,"Wait. So what is Harry's plan? Is the fact that Voldemort is possessing Hermione relevant to the fact that Harry is using a sacrificial circle, or is it simply that Harry doesn't want Hermione to die?"

HPMOR,3bw8kp,user1444,2,Sun Jul 5 08:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'm even more curious then Harry was in the last chapter how this ""Power Ladder"" works.  Quirrell was an unstoppable force against a bank of ancient lore in the last chapter, and now he has to flee from a ""Renewed Voldemort"" who apparently is making sport of him, and slapping around Dumbledore after. I'm not making any kind of complaint, I truly find this all interesting.  There was a time I thought about making my own Meta-Fic about the interdict and what could be done once you get around it."
HPMOR,3bw8kp,user1444,3,Fri Jul 3 21:54:56 2015 UTC,"OK, I have actually thought about this quite a bit.    Ancient lore isn't everything; you have to be good at applying it. This is Dumbledore and Voldemort's main skill: Perenelle might know more ancient lore than Dumbledore, but she couldn't take him down because he's much better at applying and using it.    That's not explicitly part of HPMOR-canon, but it does explain why Perenelle bothered training Dumbledore to fight Grindelwald instead of doing it herself.  Hence, Quirrell can hold off Baba Yaga and Perenelle, even though they know more than him, because he's just better at that skill of applying his knowledge.   Voldemort started out with less knowledge than Dumbledore, so Dumbledore mopped the floor with him in the war (if Voldemort could stand up to Dumbledore in an even fight, he wouldn't have had much fun ""playing"" the war).    Now, however, Voldemort has all the Flamels' lore (they've been keeping secrets from Dumbledore), and his brilliance at applying it, so he's leapfrogged over Dumbledore.  My current ""power ladder"" looks a bit like this. "">"" means ""defeats x in a duel most of the time""; "">>"" means ""can't lose against x barring extraordinary circumstances, luck, strategy etc.""; "">>>"" means ""curbstomp""  Voldemort (resurrected, with Flamels' lore) >>  Dumbledore >>  Modern Monromort>  Voldemort (war-era)>  Baba Yaga=Perenelle>  David Monroe (war-era)>>  Sirius Black=Severus Snape>  Amelia Bones=Mad-Eye Moody>  Minerva McGonagall>>  Senior Auror>>  Average Auror>>  Average Seventh-Year"

HPMOR,3bw8kp,pizzahedron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:59:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I just wanted to clarify a little bit here for my understanding.  Your explanation of ""how you apply"" the ancient magic, is what makes you powerful. Would it be fair to say, in your universe, if one of the interdicted spells would have the power to control the wind.  An average wizard could use that to blow down his enemy's house or something.  However Voldemort, with his knowledge and skill of spell casting could use that same spell to form an intense tornado to drill into the ground and tunnel into a fortress with shock and awe, or something like that, of much greater effect?"
HPMOR,3bw8kp,pizzahedron,3,Fri Jul 3 23:05:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're absolutely right.  Part of that is that Voldemort has more raw power available than our average wizard: he can put more into the spell. Raw power is a function of age, practise, intelligence and body of knowledge - the Source of Magic or whatever assigns you a ""magic pool"" based on these factors.   However, another factor, in many cases more important, is that Voldemort's skill, acumen and knowledge allows him to cast the spell more efficiently.  Say Perenelle and Voldemort both cast the same spell, and they have identical knowledge of ancient lore. Voldemort is simply more skilful and more practised at ""connecting the dots"", and using what he knows to make his magic more powerful."
HPMOR,3bw8kp,pizzahedron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:44:40 2015 UTC,So where does HJPEV fall here?

HPMOR,3bw8kp,melmonella,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"wait wait wait, a linear ladder?  no rock-paper-scissors ro-sham-bo action ?!1   i would figure it appropriate to apply our specialized magical weapon lesson here. in a certain type of wizard's fighting methodology (as the specialized weapon) is particularly effective against certain other wizards' fighting styles, even though the first wizard's fighting peers are typically stomped by the second wizard.  so moody gets the edge over perenelle, but not baba yaga, because perenelle, say,  really likes to use (or relies upon) magical objects and artefacts whose magical auras are just plain visible to moody. i suppose we just saw it with minerva professor mcgonagall and her use of transfiguration so maybe you've got it.   edit: wizard here is gender neutral."
HPMOR,3bw8kp,melmonella,2,Sat Jul 4 17:27:39 2015 UTC,"That's not an ironclad ladder, and it's not linear.  Dumbledore vs. Voldemort isn't as mismatched as Monroe vs. Bones, etc., and no number of first-years could really slow down Dumbledore.  What you say would also apply, of course (in-story, Monroe has some success against Baba Yaga and Perenelle simultaneously because he has the edge in mobility, martial artistry etc.). The above ""ladder"" is a very rough approximation of fighting talent."

HPMOR,3btuto,SpareLiver,7,Fri Jul 3 00:02:20 2015 UTC,Didn't WoG state that Harry was wrong about how the genetics of magic worked due to not knowing genetics very well?
HPMOR,3btuto,wren42,3,Thu Jul 2 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly found the entire genetic argument odd.  The blood purists are concerned with the STRENGTH of magic, not the frequency of its occurrence in a given population.   We see repeatedly that an individuals ""magic"" acts as a reservoir that can be larger or smaller based on the individual.  The very fact that Lucius gives up some of his magic for the unbreakable vow, or that Harry gave up some of his to resurrect Hermione shows that Magic is not binary -- it is a variable.   An individual's power level is thus limited by two variables: knowledge/skill, and inherent magical strength, their reservoir of energy.   Given this, it seems impossible that magic should be limited to a single binary genetic switch.  That's like saying that Musical Talent, or Athleticism is controlled the same way.  It takes some combination of genes, plus some amount of practice to become strong.  Even if the ""Magical Gene"" exists, Strength must rely on some combination of other factors, and THESE factors are what blood purists are referring to."
HPMOR,3btuto,Tommy2255,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"WoG stated that Harry could be wrong. Moreover, and I'll have to look this up, I believe it stated that the degeneration of the magic allele could be indicative of genetic manipulation (ie, the people of Atlantis inserted it intentionally into their genetic line before the fall of their empire)."
HPMOR,3btuto,Neosovereign,5,Thu Jul 2 07:43:13 2015 UTC,"Harry is wrong, confirmed by WoG."
HPMOR,3btuto,EliezerYudkowsky,7,Thu Jul 2 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"There is indeed one critical location, as the Mendelian pattern shows pretty strongly - from a Bayesian perspective, it's significantly more likely to show up if there's a single critical location, and that's by far the simplest explanation for what shows up.  Harry thought the Squibs were being caused by witches Imperiusing Muggles and sleeping with them.  The possibility Harry didn't think of is this: there isn't a ""wizard gene"", there's a Muggle gene.  Damaged Muggle genes create wizards; sometimes two wizards mate and one of the damaged Muggle genes ends up repaired via chromosomal crossover.  Since recent Muggleborns tend to have less damaged Muggle genes compared to old wizard families, the chromosomal repair is much more likely to happen among wizarding lines which recently accepted Muggleborns into their ancestry.  I didn't find any good way to work this into the story before the end, unfortunately."
HPMOR,3btuto,protagnostic,3,Sat Jul 4 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"But... Why would there be a Muggle gene? If some one/thing constructed magic to respond to particular genetic lineage, it would make more sense to respond to some specific marker of that lineage (and maybe use a DNA polymerase with a better error rate than standard human). Does this, then, imply that magic was the default state of the world, and that someone at or around the time of Atlantis enacted a sort of earlier Interdict to create a magicless peasant class?"
HPMOR,3btuto,AlcherBlack,2,Sat Jul 4 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what's implied in the latter chapters of hpmor, yes."

HPMOR,3br2ab,thetimujin,14,Wed Jul 1 13:38:33 2015 UTC,"Probably my least favorite chapter in the entire work, primarily because of the ham-fisted conversation between Dumbledore and Harry. Getting told about Harry's experience with ghosts and his research into their nature long after the fact robs the paragraph of all its emotional resonance, which in turn deflates all future arguments that are made over the course of this chapter.  The decision to introduce Harry's experience with ghosts post facto was made for narrative considerations - there wasn't really a logical place for it to fit in earlier. Yet the cost is that we're getting the payoff for a scene that never happened (which can't be said to be a payoff at all), and it throws everything else out of balance.  This is also one of the only places in HPMOR where it being fanfiction is a negative instead of a positive; there are aspects of Rowling's worldbuilding which need to be flatly undone instead of tweaked or recontextualized, and this is the chapter where they happen. Normally canon is something that HPMOR deals with fairly deftly, but here ... here it feels like an anchor tied to the foot. The Veil has to be addressed, because it's in canon, but bringing it up here does nothing good for the story."
HPMOR,3br2ab,alexanderwales,9,Wed Jul 1 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"Probably my least favorite chapter in the entire work   And yet.    The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud, and said: ""There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion.

It comes after some not-terribly-elegant alterations to Rowling's world, and some not-terribly-scientific dismissals of evidence (on the basis of those pieces of evidence not fitting the null hypothesis). And it also comes after Harry being particularly angsty and melodramatic for reasons that I don't think are earned by the text. So at least to me, the quoted section comes off far worse than it otherwise would.  (And I do realize that this is largely a matter of taste.)"

The sad, the really sad, the really truly sad thing was that he did seem to be getting himself under control again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least a day. Maybe a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.   And then this:   As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he'd met so far, Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a ghost. From what Hermione had said about ghosts, it didn't seem likely that they were fully self-aware. There were no famous discoveries made by ghosts, or much of any original work, no matter who they'd been in life. Ghosts tended to have trouble remembering the current century. Hermione had said they were like accidental portraits, impressed into the surrounding matter by a burst of psychic energy accompanying a wizard's sudden death.   And then nothing more. Which is not an adequate setup to this angst-filled conversation, and in my opinion just serves to undercut some of its impact."

HPMOR,3bonmg,Uncaffeinated,6,Wed Jul 1 08:02:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd also been writing for a over a month before I published the first chapter. So it's taking longer than it looks, although I still have a buffer for the following chapters.   As I mentioned before try free-writing, where you just focus putting words on paper (computer, etc) and don't go back and correct anything. Just write for 10-15 minutes. If you cant think of a next line, write that. Diverge. Then save what you can. Don't worry about forcing the plot (HPMOR is one of the most tightly plotted pieces I've ever read, and the fact that it was published one chapter at a time makes it very impressive. Harlan Ellison used to do this, write in a bookstore, then tape each page on a wall as he finished it. That was for a short story, and it was considered an impressive display).   I kept tinkering with things, then decided publishing was a feature and being completely happy with it didn't appear to be a goal I could achieve in a realistic time. So now instead of being ecstatic with the 15k words, I'm reasonably happy with 60k.   And I spent a decade trying to write something and not getting more than a chapter. I took this on as a side project. I find once an idea takes hold, it's really easy to write, but if I don't feel it, it's nigh impossible.

The system you refer to isn't assigning zero utility to those situations, it's recognizing that pre-committing to certain actions will change your probabilities of getting higher utility.

I don't know if that's the only factor, at least in this case. There's also the factor of agency - assuming your own or leaving it entirely to someone else.  Say, in the world with self-driving cars that somehow have to strictly choose between hitting and killing pedestrians and evading and killing their drivers, you have a sufficiently large number of pedestrians run onto a highway.  At this point, someone's gonna die. And you can say the car programmers/programming chooses who's gonna die. But they aren't the only ones with agency in the scenario: the pedestrians got on the road in the first place, after all.  The world where we actually have to choose like that isn't likely. But we can see something like it if we have cars weigh pedestrian safety too lightly, such that pedestrians no longer have to be careful around the giant hunks of metal and plastic hurling along our roads, and the car programmers aren't the only influence on how often this could be a problem - pedestrian behavior is also important."

But it doesn't say that, because that would make no sense in a world where most cars are driven by their owners, like for example the world we live in and in which those laws were written. Vehicle law focuses far more on the idea of who is at fault, and in general it is very hard to be found at fault if you are proven to have followed all relevant rules of the road. If you swerve out of your lane into someone, you are almost 100% certain to be found guilty for their deaths. If you instead collide head on with someone who was driving the wrong direction and do not swerve, even if the total number of deaths ends up being greater, the driver of the vehicle headed the wrong direction will almost certainly be found at fault. The least number of lawsuits (or rather, of lost lawsuits, a costly legal battle that results in a win is not as much of a disincentive to a company that keeps a legal team on retainer as it is to a private citizen) can be obtained more easily by following the existing rules of the road with computerized perfection rather than performing calculations beyond the expectations of a law written for humans and on the premise that humans cannot be blamed for factors beyond their capabilities to prevent.  Swerving into a small number of pedestrians rather than colliding with a vehicle containing a larger number of individuals while the other driver is in the wrong as determined by present law would by no means reduce lawsuits. Pulling the lever to kill the one guy instead of the 5 people would make you guilty of murder, while not pulling it would at best make you guilty of manslaughter, if that.

Following the existing legal traffic guidelines is. The situation in the actual article is stupid, a computer that's fast enough to steer the car left or right in the event of a blown tire is also fast enough to calculate how to steer in order to prevent swerving either way. But even there the same logic applies; a human driver would not be held responsible for casualties caused by mechanical failure, and so there is no reason that a machine driver would, and therefore no profit incentive to including any kind of ethical calculations.

Leaving aside that in the situation you describe, there would be many more alternatives (e.g. take out healthy organs from dying patients), let us assume that there is really absolutely no way to save them other than forcefully kill someone else and extract their organs. And also assume that that any person's organs are usable for transplantation, and so on.  Indeed, your dilemma seems buch less immediately solvable. I think this is due to the fact that there are many people available from the street, and I would have to pick one. This way the ""victim"" is no longer unidentified. It would be necessary to consider how much utility the abducted person could bring to the humanity as compared to the 5 people in need of transplantation, and that is not something that I can quickly estimate. An easy special case would be if these 5 people's combined value obviously exceeds my own (e.g. one of them is a prominent scientist, or at least two of them are pretty much as valuable as I am), in which case the rational thing to do would be to sacrifice myself (leaving aside the question if I would have the nerve to do this).  But yes, this seems to be a different kind of dilemma, where you really need to judge the people.  Also, I wonder what the legal side of such dilemmas is. Obviously going out on the street to kidnap and kill people for greater good is not legal. But what of the train situation, especially in case you are the one responsible for directing the trains?"

HPMOR,3bq3mx,SleeplessinRedditle,2,Wed Jul 1 18:17:36 2015 UTC,Now what if the other person is the only one following traffic laws and the 5 people in the way are only there because they ignored the gates and flashing red lights and such?
HPMOR,3bq3mx,gvsmirnov,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:00:21 2015 UTC,"That gives additional information on the people in question, making a split-second decision much harder. So many things to consider, actually.  Wouldn't it be similar to the Sunk Cost Fallacy to take this into account? Because what they did in the past is not relevant, we want to calculate the future utility we would get by saving these people. On the other hand, the fact that they ignored the traffic rules is weak evidence of that they may be prone to doing selfish things, but is it enough to condemn them to death? Would letting people off without any consequences of their actions be detrimental to the future mindset of the humanity? But it wouldn't be without consequences, because they must be extremely frightened by now. Oh, maybe they will be in time to leave their car and run? Oh, shit, the train is almost past the point of no re... HIT THE SWITCH.  If I were this other person, and even if the only thing I knew about the other five was that they violated a traffic law, I would find it rational to save them. Because really, I do not think myself to be more valuable than five randomly selected people. One, I'd not be so sure. Two, probably already more valuable than me. Three and more are very likely to be more valuable than me."
HPMOR,3bq3mx,SleeplessinRedditle,2,Wed Jul 1 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"All I meant was that you have five people that knowingly accepted the risk of illegally crossing the tracks and one that didn't. Should the only person to die be the only one that didn't accept that risk? It muddies the water a bit. I'd still go for greater number saved. Or I like to think I would. My reflexes are shit.

HPMOR,3bq3mx,koppeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to whether you want to save people who, willingly or unwillingly, put themselves into this situation that would require the car to sacrifice the driver to save them.

HPMOR,3bq3mx,LeifCarrotson,3,Wed Jul 1 10:19:06 2015 UTC,"While this could briefly be a problem, I don't think it's really a big deal.   The Russians have this problem already with insurance fraud, and they've largely solved it with dashcams (and given us lots of YouTube videos to boot).    A group of people jumps in front of a car intentionally, the car's sensors detect them, and the car kills the driver? In the ensuing investigation, the perpetrators would be visible in high-definition, three-dimensional video, and charged with murder.  People still try insurance fraud because there is a relatively low chance of being caught, a chance that there isn't a dashcam, and a high payoff for success. People won't keep trying murder-by-ai because all the cars have sensors and the investigation and penalties are much more intense."

While the idea of this feature may be repulsive, the probability of an event where the car cannot stop in time and has to kill you instead is much, much lower than the probability that your drunken friend will hit someone or something hard enough to kill himself or others."
HPMOR,3bq3mx,RhysDeAnno,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"The probability the car can't stop in time and has to kill you is modified by everyone knowing how the car will react to certain situations.

He settled into his ejection seat as if into his favorite armchair at home, not looking like he had a care in the world.

Chapter 100: I'm not completely sure, but my guess would be that some research with EY decided Harry would've read suggests that, when the brain records a memory, it doesn't record all the different sensations - lets say sight, hearing, and emotions - in the same piece of memory. Rather, there is one memory of how you felt, one of what you saw, one of what you heard, etc. So with the False Memory Charm, your options are either to construct each of those pieces of memory one at a time, or to life the person's life in your head so that you are constructing all of them at the same time. Just a guess, though - I don't know if there is actually any research suggesting that."

In order to create a convincing false memory, you have to craft not only the thing the person was consciously thinking about, but also the thread running through the back of their mind, the tune stuck in their head, the words on the sign that they read and understood without really noticing, so on and so on.

He didn't just transfigure it so well it stayed transfigured for months.  And McGonagall is absolutely rigid about transfiguration safety.

HPMOR,3bbrtx,riparia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"I do not recall the line that says Harry had to keep the rock touching him. I believe HPMOR canon has implied transfigurations can held at some distance. But I'll admit it's debatable.  I think the point that MM would comment/warn on the transfiguration and warn Draco is reasonable, I'll update the chapter.

I can have a ring forged for you with a setting for a jewel, a small jewel, in contact with your skin, and you can practice sustaining a safe subject, like a marshmallow. When you have kept it up successfully, even in your sleep, for a full month, I will allow you to Transfigure, ah, your father's rock..."" Professor McGonagall's voice trailed off. ""Did the Headmaster really -""   He maintained the transfiguration on the unicorn the same way:   Harry reached out, touched the white pebble lying within the kerchief, renewing the Transfiguration on it. ""It should last for one hour and fifty-three minutes after this,"" Harry said.   Given that the stick didn't change shape or substance that much, it's credible that Draco could keep it transfigured for a longer period, maybe half a day or more at a time."

HPMOR,3b7al1,TwelvePointFive,14,Sun Jun 28 10:10:14 2015 UTC,"Jarvis Jarslberg broke out into full laughter, and several others in Muggle Studies turned to stare at him.  It was really common to giggle or roll your eyes at the more ludicrous aspects of the Muggle world -- I mean, honestly, their economy of imaginary money was so ridiculous -- but it was surprisingly rude to interrupt the class.  Professor Youngblood was tolerant, but not deaf.  The professor turned around from where he'd been pointing to various points on the map, trying to explain the battle of Verdun.  ""Mr. Jarlsberg... you have a comment to make?""  His voice was cool.  ""I'm sorry, Professor.  But this is just ridiculous!  You're saying that the Muggles developed a kind of weapon that can give you transfiguration sickness from a distance, but that they just stopped using it after this Great War?  Like everyone just agreed not to use their best weapon?""  Professor Youngblood removed his glasses, folding them up gently.  He didn't actually need them; he wore them so that he could dramatically remove them.  ""Mr. Jarlsberg, the Muggles have weapons that are far worse than mustard gas.  Nerve gas, sarin gas, nuclear weapons, weaponized anthrax... there are a dozen horrors sitting in a bottle somewhere, unused.""  Jarvis shook his head.  ""Professor, that doesn't make any sense.  If one side didn't use those things, they'd be more vulnerable to the other side.  If you're already attacking someone, you would do it in the most efficient manner.  You wouldn't just... all agree not to fight as hard as you can!""  ""Young man, there are norms of war in every culture.  And there are things that are considered to be ethical or wise in every culture.  There are Muggles who do use chemical weapons or biological ones, but they are few and far between... and almost never legitimate states.  And that is because once the war is over, we must all go on living, and only true monsters or the utterly depraved want to tear down their society in the course of defending it.  Even the forces of You-Know-Who were not invariably lethal in war... consider that, before you scorn a people for declining to be as murderous as possible.""  The classroom fell into silence.  Note:  That scene didn't actually happen, because epistemic closure ensures that there's never been a decent Muggle Studies professor."

DADA teachers must teach certain subjects, by definition, so key the curse to those subjects.  Make it a building component, so that ""confronting boggarts"", ""casting a patronus"", ""dodging AK"" etc each add a point and when you reach a threshold, apply an anti-felix effect.  The attack to this one would be to genuinely end the class and spread out the subject among other teachers - Hagrid teaches about boggarts, McGonagall teaches the patronus, etc.  This would either avoid the curse or bring down the entire faculty.  You could also use a ""leading in DADA points"" heuristic instead of a threshold which would punish whoever was doing the most DADA teaching."

HPMOR,3b6mwd,maxuel271,42,Fri Jun 26 14:05:14 2015 UTC,"Remember, harry had horrible luck that year- not lethal levels, but horrible nevertheless- Factor in that he only taught one year's worth of DADA, and it sounds reasonable that he didn't get hit as bad- especially if it's a lot of individual spells, each giving a little bad luck, rather than a single, horrible luck curse (which would also make sense- splitting the curse if multiple teachers happen.)   also note- harry didn't teach next year. the curse worked, though at one of the lesser levels, as per remus lupin."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,NotAHeroYet,14,Fri Jun 26 14:11:06 2015 UTC,"'Leading in DADA points' would result in keeping Lockheart around to teach one class ahead of the real DADA Professor... If they knew how the system worked, of course."

DADA teachers must teach certain subjects, by definition, so key the curse to those subjects.   I also considered that possibility (well, more precisely, I thought of the person closest to most ""defensive magic"", although that one could be countered by putting someone you don't like very much near the practice area for the students) but it has the downside that an incompetent teacher, who doesn't teach those things, doesn't get hit.  Now, this could fairly be considered a feature rather than a bug. :P  But in HP-canon, both Lockhart and Umbridge do get hit by the curse, despite not teaching anything defense-worthy. Less horrible teachers, such as those who tell the students to just read their books and do the spells, might also not reach the threshold. And you would need a very powerful spell to get the professor who teaches using a mirror.  I suspect there are many more possible ways to fashion the curse which avoid these counterattacks. But if I were in Voldemort's shoes, I think I'd go for the House Elf, because it's outside people's natural hypothesis span: it both avoids all the obvious counterattacks, and even the most powerful wizard alive isn't going to find it when he's looking for curses."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,NotAHeroYet,5,Fri Jun 26 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"If you cover stuff that every teacher will inevitably cover, and make the misfortune merely compound with each point- incompetent people don't need much bad luck to self-destruct.  now, just telling you to read the books and do the spells would work, but even lockhart didn't do that- he covered spells, and taught about the dangers of species. not well, but he did it, so he got some points of misfortune. so, he had less bad luck, but he needed less to get horribly hurt, since he was incompetent. even umbridge taught, in a way, and she had harry's group working against her as well, possibly giving a false positive."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,yomikoma,3,Fri Jun 26 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"I think even telling someone to read a book about defense spells would count as teaching.  But the House Elf solution gives you a sentient agent that can wreak all sorts of havoc, which avoids the targeting problem.  Can a House Elf realistically cause the problems that hit the DADA teachers?"
HPMOR,3b6mwd,yomikoma,7,Fri Jun 26 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"Can a House Elf realistically cause the problems that hit the DADA teachers?   Well... In all fairness, I just realised I should not have argued about Lockhart and Umbridge, because canon Voldemort would not come up with the House Elf solution -- it's just the kind of thing HPMOR-Voldemort would totally do.  What we know from the curse in HPMOR is that a professor managed to completely fail as an educator, which could be a consequence of a slight confunding charm applied over the course of months, and another got caught in a compromising position with three fifth-years, which could easily be the result of the Elf making sure that someone stumbled upon them.  Looking at the canon events, though, the Elf hypothesis could still explain a bit.  Note that the Elf wouldn't have needed to do much in any case, because after 40 years of unfortunate things happening to Defense Professors, only people with nefarious(-seeming) plans (Quirrell, Crouch, Snape), or those who are either crazy (Lockhart, Moody, Umbridge) or desperate (Lupin) would agree to teach. :P   Quirrell: Elf hypothesis not applicable, as Voldemort would have ordered the Elf to back off (especially knowing something curse-worthy was going to happen to him anyway) Lockhart: the Elf delayed him when he was trying to flee the school, long enough for his escape attempt to be discovered. With a monster on the loose and killing people, and Lockhart just having been made responsible for dealing with it, something interesting was bound to happen, and at the very least it should have been possible to get him exposed as a fraud. Lupin: the Elf slipped Snape a potion to encourage impulsive behaviour, which combined with his frustrated state to make him out Lupin (which he had thus far managed to refrain from doing, even after the Boggart incident) Crouch: acted very rashly on the day Voldemort returned (which directly led to his capture); the Elf might have lowered his judgement using a potion (he only drank from his hipflask, but he did eat in the castle) or perhaps an Elf-spell -- not sure what they can do Umbridge: it would not have been hard to alert the centaurs to intruders in their territory, and then to free the giant to come over as well just to be sure Snape: was hired only because it was certain that he would do something seemingly horrible during the year; he left before the Elf executed its plot.   Of course, none of these measures were certain to work. But they wouldn't need to be: Hogwarts is a dangerous place, and a few nudges here and there (like wit-dulling, confunding, misplacing items so that others may find them, etc.) might be enough to turn a medium situation into something potentially lethal or highly compromising, and to put the Defense Professor in the middle of everything that happens. Repeat such nudges several times during the last three months of their teaching, and there is a high chance that some accident will happen. If not, the Elf can always poison them on the last day of school."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,Tommy2255,3,Fri Jun 26 20:33:20 2015 UTC,Most of these are just making sure terrible people are found out.  Is attracting terrible people to the position part of the curse?

There is no hint as to what happened to the first few Defense Professors after Riddle cursed the position; presumably they were a lot more competent, so a bit more effort would be required."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,p2p_editor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"Is attracting terrible people to the position part of the curse?   It doesn't need to be, it's a natural consequence of even a rumored curse. But it does mean that, at least after the first few are gone and the curse is well established, the entire plot is substantially easier, because the targets are in general quite a lot easier to fool."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,itisike,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:27:56 2015 UTC,"Well, a bad luck curse is more sustainable- and lord voldemort seems the type for a permanent curse.   Yes, reading the book would count, but not much- if he can curse the position, then he could have killed everyone in hogwarts that way. either he failed to do that, or he had no desire to do that at the time of casting- and therefore designed it to primarily target actual teachers. a spell split into lots of little bad luck hexes on whoever does x would be an easy thing.   maybe the curse was actually set up before he ever asked for the position, in the hpmor version- instead, he was going to ask once, if rejected, activate it, wait two or three years while the curse took out defense professors, ask again.   it didn't work that well, but it worked.  in hpmor, house elf is viable, but not too much, because you're dependent on that elf. a spell that fails at a random time and place, without warning, is far worse than a spell that will gradually wear out at a specific point, unless broken first. If you care enough to try to curse the position for even your first century of life- a complex spell, modified for durabillity, has more long-term viability in some ways. if you have time to waste, and expect to lose access to hogwarts in the future? make a reverse felixus that will meet the criteria. if you exppect to maintain hogwarts, or are okay with a patch job? elf will do.  both versions of voldemort, though, have enjoy making complex plots. it isn't that absurd that this would bleed into other things, like how they go about cursing things."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,yomikoma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:45:34 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but I'm not sure it adequately explains Lockhart and Umbridge, neither of which did much actual DADA teaching.

HPMOR,3b6mwd,VioletCrow,6,Tue Jun 30 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"There are interesting speculations about it at Red Hen Publications, but the article is rambly and actually focuses on Snape, so I'm going to summarise the relevant bits here.  The argument goes like this:  1) In order to be competent DADA teacher, you need to be good Dark Wizard, at least potentially. This should be non-controversial.  2) Dark Wizards do their thing via channeling some sort of demonic force or destructive energy (""Dark Arts are fueled by the powers of Chaos"", as Red Hen put it).   3) Careers of Dark Wizards tend to end badly, because the demonic force they control escapes and causes havoc (or at least gradually turns them into mentally unstable human-snake hybrid with glowing red eyes).   So, Voldemort's curse just locates the individual having the most amount of dormant Dark powers and make them erupt.  This is consistent with canon: the only dead DADA teachers (Crouch and Quirrell) are powerful Dark Wizards.  However, it gets heavy complexity penalty (because it postualtes ""Chaos"", some sort of quasi-intelligent entity) and sort-of-incompatible with the laws of magic as present in HPMOR.   Also, if this sort of trick was possible, Alastor Moody should have made a killing with it (well, or not: I think competent Dark Wizards must protect themselves from Chaos somehow).  The second interesting hypothesis by Red Hen:   And yet, the curse itself does not seem to show any signs of serving Lord Voldemort’s interests. Quite the opposite, if anything. It almost seems to be calibrated to do its greatest damage to those who are the greatest threat to Hogwarts. It was the agents which Voldemort had placed there himself (apart from Snape) who were the ones most deeply “bitten” by it.   So, imagine you have an access to the castle wards via Salazar's lore. What if you send it's ""immune system"" into overdrive, making every competent DADA teacher (who already resembles a Dark Wizard in some aspects) a false positive? This looks plausible; it's my headcanon so far (EDIT: on a closer reflection, it doesn't seem like a Voldemort's style, more like Harry's.).   Or if wards of Hogwarts work more like ""target all good people, protect them from harmful accidents, so nothing bad ever happens inside"", then you just could tweak the definition of ""good"" to leave DADA teachers on their own."

HPMOR,3b6mwd,PhantomX129,3,Fri Jun 26 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"Why did it have to be the curse that eliminated him? He most certainly wasn't a competent DADA teacher, heck he wasn't much of a competent wizard besides his use of the memory charm.

HPMOR,3b6mwd,sir_pirriplin,2,Sat Jun 27 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"The reason the curse needs to have eliminated it is because we don't know of any holes during which the curse didn't act.

Voldemort is extremely talented with magic, and has made a point to study, and rework every little piece of lore he comes across.  We can make logical guesses that make sense, but I have a feeling the real answer is just, ""Voldemort preformed some powerful, obscure ritual or piece of magic, perhaps using some powerful device as well, to put a ""blanket"" curse over the job that covers anything we can think of."
HPMOR,3b6mwd,Igigigif,3,Fri Jun 26 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Given that the discussion about how a house elf might implement the curse has occurred elsewhere in the thread, how about a combination?  No house-elves need to be Imperioused. The 'curse' is a spell which can passively read minds - either house-elves', or perhaps squibs like Filch who wouldn't be able to detect it. It might not even be instantiated at Hogwarts; Filch presumably visits places like Hogsmeade on occasion. Or the spell might reside in an innocuous item in Filch's office, and remain passive in the presence of wizards/witches. It may also be extremely low-powered to avoid detection, building up a picture of the current DADA teacher from multiple passive scans over time.  Then, once a target has been established, the detector passes that information onto a spell or network of spells which cast low-level, slow, difficult-to-detect spells of misfortune, rashness, overconfidence, clumsiness, immune-suppression, chaos, self-sabotage, ill health, and so on. Each spell may only last a short time, so that magical scans on the DADA teacher would not reveal a cumulative build-up of malicious spells. However, while any one given spell may only have a tiny chance of resulting in a career-ending disaster, those chances add up.  The spells could also be specifically designed to cause nonmagical effects and then erase themselves and their magic signature. A spell which upset the balance of T-cells in the body, for instance, could erase itself without the number of T-cells returning to normal. A spell which added a minor physical fault to the target's wand, slightly interfering with magic flow/control, could erase itself while leaving the wand damaged. An illusion could cause a target to take a very slight diversion and walk through a more dangerous location, without actually affecting that location or the target themselves, and so on. Heck, you could even spell a long strand of hair to animate and tie a wizard's bootlaces to each other, then leave and incinerate itself, leaving no trace of magic on the actual boots."

HPMOR,3b6dcq,Valkurich,2,Thu Jul 2 10:15:34 2015 UTC,"Well, basically, if we use fanfic terms, HPMOR ships Harry and Quirrell pretty hard. Not in any romantic sense, naturally, but their relationship, their friendship and their mentor-student roles - that's the core of the book to me. Harry has a relationship with Draco, but it doesn't run as deep, and gets frozen mid-book. Harry has a friendship with Hermione, but (I'm biased) it doesn't ring as true for me, and I love SPHEW arc only because of Professor Quirrell's excellent moments(sorry, Hermione). And the best of books are always about character relationships, so... yeah. For me, Harry and Quirrell it is.  Chapter 37 nails the relationship beautifully, it's the crowning moment. Professor Quirrell shows empathy; Harry gets the sense of an exciting adventure and flirts with the dark side as he lets his parents sleep(basically, treats them like objects) - they cross several boundaries in the chapter, I think. It's both very ""Witch and the Wardroob""-y and a little reminiscent of young Anakin and the Senator Palpatine, or mentor-Snape and Harry at the same time. Again, that's just my impression.  (last arc spoilers)  And the last arc, from Chapter 104 onward - it changes things. Quirrell suddenly holds a multitude of Idiot Balls(his complicated plan instead of ""Let's steal the Stone!""; suddenly being unable to do such a simple thing as ""test the Horcruxes on someone else"", while he predicts other people and their desires and motivations to the letter - see Weasley twins and their preferred gifts; leaving Harry his wand), but that's not what's important - his emotional narrative changes. He was capable of deep feelings and empathy throughout the book - now he suddenly isn't. He plays a very narrow, very simplistic role, tailor-made for a dumb Dark Lord to be defeated by The Chosen One - that's why I was unable to let of the theory ""It's all designed by Quirrell, even the Dark Lord's downfall"" until late in Ch.115. And when the reader(me, just me here) doesn't believe the character anymore, the story is... well, dead. Because I can't imagine Ch.37 Professor Quirrell ever doing any of that.  Back to Harry in Ch.37 - there's another thing. I'm one of these people who like to side with the villains and have more sympathy for Tom than for Jerry(for the Wolf more so than for the Rabbit, for those who watched Russian cartoons instead). Harry in the first half of the book is a villain rather than a hero, if I may say so. He is interesting. He dismisses people like Ron and Hagrid, he manipulates Draco like no tomorrow, he flings Neville's feelings aside and he is quite interested in becoming a Light Lord(heheh). He's one of us - one of those kids who adore Darth Vader and like thinking up uniforms for our goons and are firmly of the side of Interesting Evil as opposed to the Boring Good - even though we actually don't want to torture people, we'd rather save the world.  (And in the end of the book, even though Harry keeps his manipulative ways, he's firmly on the side of the Boring Good, alas. It's the Philosopher Stone, canonic ending).  By Ch.37, Harry firmly sides with Professor Quirrell rather than with Professor Dumbledore. It may be a precipice, and Harry might be leaning too far into the darkness, farther than good-aligned readers like to admit - but I like him there, watching the stars and being a vill... okay, an antihero in league with Professor Quirrell, another antihero who is quite possibly a villain. And the picture of them two from Ch.37 will always stand in my mind.  Sorry for the long-winded ramble. I'm not good at discussions, but I do like to hear myself talk. (That, and I just read an excellent chapter of Minds, Names and Faces which just reminded me why I love Harry's dark side and Professor Quirrell so much)."

It may be possible to mass produce them, since the circumstances leading to their birth are unlikely but nonmagical, but in that case surely Gringotts would have some as guards alongside their dragons, or they would be used as wand parts or something. If Salazar had multiple Basilisks, then they were farmed and the method of their cultivation was not passed down at all (since the basilisk itself was the intended method of passing down secrets).   Basilisk farming is not difficult (chicken coop and some pet snakes then switch the eggs, cockatrices as a byproduct if desired), but seems unintuitive for wizards, especially since there's no magic involved. Plus it requires that he distrust his heir, which contradicts the point of the chamber and of Parseltounges (from the fact that they can't lie to each other, it seems Salazar had the same hope for his descendents that Voldemort had for Harry, another him to play against with a mutual vulnerability to prevent seriously destructive plans just like the curse keeping Tom Riddles from killing each other)."

It's also possible that creation of a Basilisk requires some sort of magic either instead of or in addition to the commonly circulated story. Or perhaps basilisks are easy to create but require magical sustenance to grow. Or you can make them easily but you need special magic to control them, making it too dangerous for normal wizards."
HPMOR,3b3686,Uncaffeinated,2,Fri Jun 26 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but it's also possible that basilisks are actually from the planet Krypton and Salazar's monster was found in Kansas. The point is, everything we know or have been led to believe about basilisks suggests that they are naturally very rare, such that multiple within the chamber is unlikely, while cultivation would be too easy for them to remain rare if it had been attempted. It isn't impossible that there are multiple basilisks in the Chamber of Secrets, but there doesn't seem to be sufficient evidence to outweigh the complications and unlikely circumstances that hypothesis requires.  Obviously the chamber is still worth finding and it's still worth every reasonable precaution when first searching it, but neither is it reasonable to act as if the existence of other basilisks were likely, not when there are many more credible threats and more promising avenues of magical inquiry."
HPMOR,3b3686,Tommy2255,2,Fri Jun 26 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"However, I don't think Voldemort would kill the basilisk at least until he was sure the Horcrux 2.0 worked. After all, the Horcrux 1.0 would lose all that knowledge."

HPMOR,3b3686,ae_der,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:56:19 2015 UTC,"Well we know he intended to make additional v1.0 Horcruxes anyway, which would have retained that knowledge. But moreover, we also know that putting too much trust in his Horcruxes is a mistake that Voldemort has historically made, on the night he died the first time. To young Tom Riddle, fresh from killing Myrtle and opening the Chamber, I can't imagine how he could have considered dying before he could manage to make another Horcrux a more immediate threat than someone else acquiring his arcane secrets to use against him.  Absolute worst case scenario, if the secrets were so incredibly important that their loss cannot be risked under any circumstances, he could just kill someone else (maybe in Hogsmeade over the weekend) to make another Horcrux (which would retain his memory of whatever secrets were in the chamber), and then kill the snake. There's no set of circumstances where letting the serpent live serves his purposes."
HPMOR,3b3686,Tommy2255,2,Fri Jun 26 05:51:24 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it explicitly stated that you can't pass magical secrets through horcruxes, since they aren't alive minds?"

But if he had been forced to use the Horcrux 1.0, then it's also questionable whether he could have learned the spells anyway in that state, regardless of whether the serpent was alive or dead. He would essentially have been a contained ghost. He could cast while possessing Quirrel, but that was a Horcrux 2.0 feature."
HPMOR,3b3686,Tommy2255,2,Fri Jun 26 14:25:56 2015 UTC,The whole point is that the Horcrux 1.0 can't retain the secrets because of the Interdict.

HPMOR,3azeig,galileotheweirdo,41,Wed Jun 24 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"I see some fairly significant flaws in the methodology here.  The questions asking ""less benefit now or more benefit later"" fail to account for the possibility that you could have very rational reasons to get money sooner rather than later. For example, if you are currently experiencing temporary economic hardship, failing to accept the money in the short term may result in long-term consequences of greater cost than the deferred benefit. Alternatively, you might be unable to collect the benefit at a later time (e.g. you might die, or the giver might die) or the benefit may no longer be valuable to you (e.g. you might have a reasonable expectation of a raise at work that reduces the marginal utility of extra money).  It also assumes a false equivalence between the train scenario and the do-it-fast machine. I would be willing to spend more money on using the do-it-fast machine than on the express train because I can do other things on the slower train (e.g. play video games) whereas if I have a task that must be done on the weekend it is something that would require my attention and prevent multitasking. (Edit: Retracted due to misremembering, however child comments illustrate other problems.)  It also penalizes for honesty. I occasionally make mistakes. I won't lie on a personality test and say that I'm perfect even if I reasonably expect that my strategies ought not to result in failures.   Similarly it presents a false dilemma for the sunk cost fallacy. I have, indeed, spent time on a project that I would have otherwise abandoned because I have sunk costs. But making decisions based on the presence of sunk costs is not, in and of itself, fallacious. It is only fallacious when you pursue the task to the detriment of things that you rationally would place greater value on.  Et cetera."

Also unless I skim-read over the top of it, the train scenario didn't give any concrete numbers for exactly how much time it saves, so drawing any conclusion about the consistency of our valuation of time seems suspect. My experience of trains suggests that the difference is generally not quite so stark as 30 seconds vs an hour, so I was assuming a much smaller time-saving.   Also eliminating an hour-long routine task from my weekend opens up significantly more options (i.e. the difference between ""Can't go too far afield, I've got this task to deal with"" and ""I've got the whole day pretty much free; we can go anywhere and do anything"") whereas a shorter train journey leaves the overall character of the day essentially unchanged."

Of course, I live in Los Angeles, and I can tell you with certainty that no such express train exists. If it did, I would be riding it on a daily basis.  Another point of note with the train scenario is that it's comparing ""I'm on vacation"" vs. ""I've got something I have to do"". I value an hour of a vacation less than I value an hour of regularly-scheduled non-work time. In the former case, I'm just having fun, and I don't feel bad about getting an hour less fun. In the latter case, I've got things that need done, and getting one of those things out of the way may well open up some quality time."

HPMOR,3aqmf9,writingathing,2,Mon Jun 22 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"The First World thing bothers me a bit, even if I understand it's just common parlance. The First World consists of the United States and its allies, the Second World consists of the Soviets and their allies, and the Third World is everyone that's unaligned or neutral. It's not a ranking of worlds (though the language was certainly chosen to be suggestive of that). Under the three-world model, Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland were in the Third World.  And it's Christmas of 1991, which means that the Soviet Union is still in the process of falling, so while common parlance now is First World good and Third World bad, I don't really think that would have been so common then. (The more I think of it, the more I think it's weird that with all the talk of the Cold War and muggle nuclear weapons, there doesn't seem to be any note made of historical events. But maybe we're in alternate history land where none of that is happening because of wizards.)  This sort of feels like pointless nit-picking; it's something I'll have to chalk up to being an in-character mistake made by an eleven-year-old who doesn't actually care or know about international politics."

But perhaps I am remembering wrong, or was using it wrong at the time, but the thought never even entered my mind until you pointed this out."

HPMOR,3altss,raymestalez,6,Sun Jun 21 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"Cool!  I have said before that fanfiction.net needs a replacement, so here are some of my thoughts on what that would be:   No ads.  Doesn't bother me because I use an adblocker but IIRC one reason hpmor.com was created was because it was off-putting to link an ad-riddled site to potential readers.  Raises questions of financing, of course.  Donation based? No silly ""DRM"" like preventing copy-paste.  Or at least, make it opt-in.  But it's a bad idea anyway. Atom feed for story updates.  Could be per story or per account with a subscription feature in the site (you seem to have something already, duno how it works).  Maybe email updates as an alternative, duno. ePub exports. Automatic send-to-kindle for story updates. Awesome typography; it's a site for reading after all.  What you have is already good and certainly much better than fanfiction.net. Preferably the whole thing is open source.   You may already have some of these down or in the works, and it's a random list of personal ideals; I don't mean to dictate how you should do anything.  :-)  Thanks!"
HPMOR,3altss,donri,9,Sun Jun 21 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great comment.   Yes, absolutely, rationalfiction will never have ads. I think ads are dumb and offer no value to anybody. I'm not planning to monetize the website in the near future, but later it might have a store where authors can sell their works. Links to patreon or internal patreon-like system is also possible.  Either way - we will brainstorm it and come up with a system that is both profitable to authors and convenient to readers. Yes, no DRM. Right now the community is small, and any copyright is based on people being nice to each other =) Some authors requested a way to choose a license, but I haven't thought about the legal things too much yet. If it will be necessary in the future - it will be done in an elegant and intelligent way that is convenient for everybody. Definitely no dumb copy-paste prevention. Yes, subscription system is already exactly as you are describing. There are story feeds and possibility to subscribe to an author. Email updates functionality is coming. Yes, I will implement ePub and PDF export in the near future. This is the only thing on your list I'm not sure about, simply because I haven't used kindle and didn't know that it's a thing. I'll check it out, and if it's useful - it will be implemented. Thanks, I put a lot of thought into the design. Every time I have an idea on how to improve it - I will implement it. Already open source =) Here's the repo:   https://github.com/raymestalez/fictionhub  Feel free to fork/contribute/submit bugs.  Fair warning - code is a little messy right now, as I was focusing on design and features and such. Cleanup and refactoring  is my next top priority.

I'll check it out, and if it's useful - it will be implemented.   I think all you need for that is to send an email with a Mobipocket attachment.  You can convert ePub to MOBI with ebook-convert from Calibre.  The user will have to provide their @[free.]kindle.com address and add your sender address to an approval list in their Amazon account.  Actually I'm not sure you even need to bother with creating an ebook since it supports HTML, but then I'm not sure we'd get proper support for chapters and a table of contents.  I'll happily help beta test this.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email  Of course, if other devices could be supported as well that'd be great.  But I don't know for sure if any others have a similar feature to automatically push content to the device.

HPMOR,3ajnbx,codahighland,5,Thu Jun 25 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think the restriction is that you can't pass information back more than six hours by time-turner. It should be obvious that this six-hour restriction isn't fully generalized, because prophecies can speak of events decades in the future. And if you have information from decades in the future due to knowing a prophecy, you can still use a time-turner, as Harry time-turns quite often while knowing that he is prophesied to tear apart the stars.  Experiment: Comed-tea is far too limiting. It only operates over a fairly short span of time. So what about trying to time-turn after hearing a prophecy?  First, we already know that you can pass back information that you acquired DURING the six hours between your departure from the future and your arrival in the past. If you couldn't, then time-turners wouldn't work at all. So a question to be asked is if prophecies (including comed-tea) count as information FROM the future, or if they are information ABOUT the future, from the PRESENT. Perhaps if it's the former, then it might block time-turner use, but if it's the latter, then a time-turner would work fine.  A third possible outcome might be that prophecies only conflict with time-turner use if the use of the time-turner would result in that information being passed to an earlier point in the timeline than said information first became available. This would mean that you wouldn't be able to time-turn after feeling the urge to drink comed-tea, or after hearing a prophecy, making these a sort of temporal barrier. It would also explain why you couldn't pass information back by chaining time-turners: the first time-turner use is effectively a form of prophecy. Your arrival is the point at which the information from the future enters the timeline, and you can't cross that.  And THAT brings up a MUCH easier experiment: If you time-turn back an hour and then wait half an hour, can you time-turn back another hour?"
HPMOR,3ajnbx,Hpfm2,2,Sun Jun 21 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"Chapter 61, talking about the incident in Azkaban:   There was another pause, and then Madam Bones's voice said, ""I have information which I learned four hours into the future, Albus. Do you still want it?""  Albus paused -  (weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to go back more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn't send information further back in time than six hours, not through any chain of Time-Turners)  - and finally said, ""Yes, please.""   And then Dumbledore went on to retrieve Harry, knowing that Bones arrived four hours from the future. (even though he got a ""paradox error"" afterwards).  And even McGonagall knew about the ""any chain of Time-Turners"" part - implying the experiment has been already done."

HPMOR helped me realize how much I love fiction(and comedy), how much I want it to be in my life, and how badly I want to learn to write as well as Eliezer. So now I'm back to being serious about getting good at writing."

HPMOR,3af0a8,Yxoque,6,Fri Jun 19 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"There are several things, but I've used the technique of splitting up your brain in the four Houses when thinking and found it to be useful (although it's not a habit yet). It doesn't need to be the Houses, but they were something easy to try this with. The reason it helps (I think) is that it forces you to look at a problem from different angles, including angles you wouldn't have otherwise considered. (I'm a Ravenclaw and I'm not used to thinking like a Hufflepuff or Slytherin.)  And there's this quote, of course:   But Father had once told her that the trouble with passing up opportunities was that it was habit-forming."

HPMOR,3af0a8,cloudmarsh,4,Fri Jun 19 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"I started reading the story basically for the funny parts and intriguing plot, but the phrase ""why do I believe what I believe"" ended up getting stuck in my mind; I grew up in an atmosphere that often felt more like ""we believe this stuff because that's just who we are"", and HPMOR basically wrenched me out of that ""beliefs = identity"" box and made me feel morally obligated to question everything. It was a very life-altering paradigm shift."
HPMOR,3af0a8,newhere_,2,Sun Jun 21 05:19:18 2015 UTC,"What do I think I know and how do I think I know it? Is slowly but steadily becoming a common thought pattern. Also, the idea that if you can explain any outcome equally well, if you are never confused, that means you have no knowledge.    That, and taking responsibility. I've started going grey since reading it, I feel personally responsible for solving a few global issues. That's high stress, but if more people felt that way, more global issues would be solved."

HPMOR,3aewxj,xingxingzf,8,Fri Jun 19 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"Quirrel claims people pretend to care more than they do. The opposite is pretending to care less than they do. He is saying that people do not pretend to care less. Wronged in this context means to have caused harm. I think this is at least partly an analogy. He's saying that there are sixteen kinds of input that go into a memory - the five primary senses, plus secondary senses, and your own thoughts and introspection as you do it. He's saying that you can create these separate ""tracks"" one after another, like a musician creating one track after another of a song on a synthesizer, and then mixing them into a single thread of memory. The alternative is to model the person so well that your imagination is filled in by the model as you ""lived their life in your head""."
HPMOR,3aewxj,ArgentStonecutter,4,Fri Jun 19 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think ""wronged"" is a bit more specific than ""caused harm"". If you shot someone with a gun and they survived, they wouldn't say ""You wronged me.""  I think that to ""wrong"" someone implies deceit/dishonesty or injustice. Note that what Harry did to Draco probably actually helped Draco have a better frame of mind in the end, but because he did it deceitfully instead of honestly, it still counts as a ""wrong"".  On (3), this is basically what you said, but it's saying that there's False Memory Charm Easy Version that takes sixteen times as long as False Memory Charm Hard Version, and Quirrell is doing Hard Version.    EDIT and while I'm at it let me offer an English rephrasing of (1):   Harry couldn't help himself. He looked over again, despite knowing it would be futile, and saw only more stars. ""Let me guess: from this you deduce that... people pretend to care about their friends more than they really do.""  A brief laugh. ""Well, it's not like they would ever pretend to care less than they really do."""
HPMOR,3aewxj,75thTrombone,4,Fri Jun 19 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"Slightly disagree with both ""wronged""  I agree that ""wronged"" has a stronger meaning than 'caused harm.' If I accidentally crash my car into you, I have injured you, but not wronged you. If I shot you, I may have wronged you. Depends on why I shot you / motivations.  One dictionary definition of wronged is ""treat unjustly or unfairly"" with the implication that the treatment resulted in harm.   ""Wronged"" has a moral/judgemental implication.  Draco is saying ""I have suffered an injury through a deliberate, morally deficient action made by you."" (In this case, Harry's deception). [Which is not to say I agree with Draco, but that's what the line means, IMO]."

HPMOR,3acpcz,MadScientist14159,3,Fri Jun 19 20:25:16 2015 UTC,List of Potential Dark Lords/Ladies (and my estimated probabilities for Slughorn meaning them if it wasn't a mindgame):  Harry (90%)  Draco (40%)  Hermione (70%)  Tracy (10%)  Ginny (30%)  Blaise (30%)  Other-Unknown (30%)
HPMOR,3acpcz,VaqueroGalactico,3,Fri Jun 19 15:53:19 2015 UTC,"Why, with Lord Voldemort dead I can only think of three future dark lords, and you've managed to annoy them all during the last few weeks   How have they annoyed Ginny, Blase, and Tracey, though? Ginny doesn't have any reason to care about Draco, I don't think. Blaise dislikes Draco. Tracey seems interested but not annoyed.  Draco's pausing after saying ""of our generation"" suggested that he thought Slughorn might mean someone of a different generation. Thinking of people they've annoyed:   McGonagall? Seems highly unlikely, but they have annoyed her, I would think. Slughorn himself? Could be interpreted as an extremely subtle hint that he's going to become a Dark Lord. Seems unlikely, but less so than McGonagall. Professor Asimov? I suppose it's possible Slughorn could be skeptical of his lack of magic and think there's something deeper at work, though. Seems extremely unlikely."
HPMOR,3acpcz,MadScientist14159,5,Fri Jun 19 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"Everyone on the list has the potential to have been annoyed by them.  For example, perhaps Blaise is fed up with people interrupting his study time to tell him the latest unimportant gossip about this drama. Ginny might view it as an attack on one of Harry's minions so an attack on Harry, so (in her mind) an attack on her. It's a bit of a stretch, I'll grant you, but stranger things than bystanders getting annoyed at teenage drama have happened."
HPMOR,3acpcz,VaqueroGalactico,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, but assuming Slughorn is telling the truth, he knows about it, so mild annoyance at being interrupted seems highly unlikely. I mean, it's not impossible, but I wouldn't give them probabilities anywhere near 30% given that you have to hand-wave the annoyance."
HPMOR,3acpcz,MadScientist14159,4,Fri Jun 19 16:56:19 2015 UTC,I suppose it depends on how closely Slughorn is paying attention to people's reactions to the drama then.  He might be paying enough attention to remember specific people's attitudes towards it (and given that he's head of Slytherin I think he probably is paying attention to the attitudes of people he sees potential in) but I can easily see why you might disagree.
HPMOR,3acpcz,_casaubon_,2,Fri Jun 19 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that he's paying attention to their reactions. But something as small as Blaise being annoyed at an interruption? It seems unlikely that:   Blaise would feel that way. He seems to dislike Draco, even if he's not actively working against him. I think he would be interested in what's happening but not annoyed. that Slughorn would notice Blaise's potential annoyance. that Slughorn thinks Blaise is the potential next Dark Lord.   I would call a single one of these around a 30% probability... all three? Less than a 5% probability."
HPMOR,3acpcz,alexeyr,3,Fri Jun 19 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"1) Alright. On this point you've changed my mind. Blaise isn't likely to be annoyed by updates on Draco's troubles.  2) Blaise was a key figure in the battles last year, Slughorn will be paying close attention to him. I'd give it good odds that an experienced Slytherin like Slughorn can keep tabs on Blaise's attitudes towards current events.  3) Again, Blaise was a key figure in the battles. He showed good ability to outplot the generals (well, actually he was probably being fed tactics by Hat&Mort, but Slughorn doesn't know that) and showed enjoyment in subverting the outcome of the battles with an attitude which resembles Voldemort's (probably because Voldemort was directly responsible for it, but again, Slughorn doesn't know that).  I revise my estimate on Blaise down to 10%."

HPMoR continuations / alternate universe branches:   Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality (Year 2 from Draco's perspective, lots of scheming and social maneuvering) Significant Digits (further into the future, from a variety of perspectives, set in a world where Harry's done some serious optimising but hasn't totally taken over) Minds, Names and Faces (branch from the latter chapters of MoR with some different ideas about how Harry/Quirrel's final confrontation goes) HPMoR: The Missing but Necessary Chapters (having some fun by picking up on events referred to in MoR but not explicitly described and filling in the blanks)   Other Harry Potter fics:   Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (the war goes really badly so future-Harry has another go via time travel) Blindness (Harry's forehead-scar is more of a ""whole face"" affair, leaving him blind... despite this he ends up monstrously over-powered to the point of defeating all narrative tension, but it's somehow still sort of fun to read)   Rational!Pokemon stories:   Pokemon: The Origin of Species (focus on making the world of Pokemon make more good sense, and Red's efforts to comprehend it while adventuring with Blue) Pokemon: The Line (so far more focussed on the character interactions, especially Red/Oak, and with only 2 chapters out I'm still rapidly getting hooked)   Original works:    Wildbow's trio: Worm, Pact and Twig (superheroes/villains, modern fantasy, and biopunk, respectively).

It's a fanfiction of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, but you don't need to necessarily watch the source material, since it's set hundreds of years in the future and most of the relevant parts are explained early on.  Premise of Madoka Magica: a cat-like creature offers girls magical powers in exchange for signing a contract and fighting against witches.  Premise of To the Stars: the girls form the globe-spanning secret conglomerate MSY in order to carry out their duties and later influence the course of human events so that aging is defeated, Friendly AI is developed, FTL travel is invented, and humanity is united under an AI-human collective, Governance. However, when a far more advanced alien race attacks, the magical girl superstructure underpinning humanity is forced to bring their collective powers into the open to save civilization.   The story follows a girl who finds herself suddenly cast into the middle of the madhouses that are MSY, Governance, and war. If you like the idea of massive space battles whose outcomes are determined by the actions of organized teams of magical girls creatively using their powers, advanced technology, and AI in a universe where the fate of humanity is resting somewhere hidden behind the layered secrets of centenarian-run MSY black-ops divisions, hidden failures in Governance's total control, and the magical girl system itself... then you'll like this story."

Some people claim that it has a slow start, so you might have to give it a bit of a chance (though I liked it at once).

It's well thought out (although I don't agree with everything) and has some nice touches.  There's also one story I can strongly recommend is Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation. It's about the rebuilding effort after the Second Wizarding War from the perspective of Hermione and borrows from the actual history of World War II, which makes it feel pretty real. It does feature some scenes with people drinking polyjuice potion so they can have sex with people they're not supposed to, but they aren't really part of the core experience.

Anyway, this isn't a problem, because, at one point, you reach a point where you will attain a time-turner somehow. This is the origin of the time-turner, and it is fixed.  Once you have the time-turner, whatever the source, you will go back in time, give it to your past self, and get shot in the face. This is a paradox-enforced fact.  If you wanted to mess with time by shooting someone, you'd have to commit suicide (and not of the 'mefromthefuture' variety. You. Gun in your mouth, pull trigger.). But 'Don't mess with time' means that you wouldn't be able to pull it, even then.  Interestingly, the 6-hour limit on information means that you can stop people from changing what has already passed by handing them information from six hours into the future. This doesn't stop them from time-turning within those six hours, so I think it's a tactic of limited value."

HPMOR,3abhrk,noggin-scratcher,6,Tue Jun 23 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the DO NOT MESS WITH TIME note had no origin - in that Harry only wrote it because he read that same note in the first place. So clearly Time is willing to have some level of degredation be reversed by ""coincidences"" (Harry somehow wrote out a perfect atom-for-atom copy of a note by hand.)  But under the rules for the Time-Turner given in the Final Exam, you can only receive help from the future if that would be the simplest, most probable timeline timeline. I think the odds of an item spontaneously de-aging by an hour are extremely low - although there might be spells that could do that, they probably wouldn't reset most magical properties.  (In fact, the only thing I can think of that might de-age a timeturner like that is ... a broken time-turner. Or maybe a Potion of Time-Reversal, whatever the heck that would be made from. Quantum noise doing it is so low-probability as to be essentially zero.)  By far the most likely outcome is that you don't receive the time-turner from the future, and when you try to go back, some coincidence prevents you."
HPMOR,3abhrk,MugaSofer,3,Thu Jun 18 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"somehow wrote out a perfect atom-for-atom copy of a note by hand   Well... it's not like he was studying it and using it as a template, and he wouldn't be able to produce an atomic copy of anything else.   Just another artefact of the backwards causal arrows you get as soon as you introduce a time-turner into the mix. The note received was predestined to be a perfect copy of whatever note he wrote, because it was the note he wrote, and it wasn't degraded because it wasn't sent through a loop - it only ever existed once, in a single self-consistent sweep."
HPMOR,3abhrk,MugaSofer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"Right. I just meant that usually, if you were copying something, the information would degrade over time - if this were a timeloop scenario, as OP seems to be implicitly imagining, that ""message"" would be zillions of years old and have experienced tons of random drift by now, and Harry's copy would be a bit different."
HPMOR,3abhrk,MugaSofer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:20:47 2015 UTC,"the original do not mess with time not is not zillions of years old, it's one hour old.  it just loops once and continues on its merry way.    the time turner loop I posed is MUCH more concerning.  there the same object is involved in the loop every time.   this would be like if harry didn't write the do not mess with time note, but just picked it up and sent it back to himself."
HPMOR,3abhrk,MugaSofer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, the physical note is only an hour old. But the information it represents - and timeturners count physical objects, including people, as ""information"" - is born out of the timeloop, and manages to avoid degrading when copied because of handy coincidences.  Presumably a physical object could also be ""coincidentally"" protected from the effects of aging an hour, but it seems more likely that you would just die."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Hpfm2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:23:41 2015 UTC,I can't make any sense of anything you are saying.   the case of the note is simple.  harry writes note.  harry goes back an hour and gives himself note.  the note then continues to exist normally afterward.   The note does not loop infinitely.  it does not appear spontaneously. it has a very straightforward timeline.    The scenario I raised with a looping time turner is completely different.  in that case an object is in fact traveling the same hour infinitely.
HPMOR,3abhrk,Hpfm2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"The trick with the note is that - for the timeline to be self-consistent - Harry had to make a copy of the note that was atom-for-atom identical to the copy he received. Which is usually very unusual, but which he did - obviously - because that level of ""coincidence"" is smaller than the alternatives.  Similarly, it's possible for a time-turner to be turned into an atom-for-atom copy of itself-from-one-hour-ago, complete with an extra hour of time-turning. It might fall into an experimental potion of time-reversal, or come under the time-loop effects of a broken time-turner (which are implied to be the same as in canon),  or destroyed and rebuilt, or even secretly swapped for another time-turner by your enemies (in which case this is pretty much the same situation as the note.)  However, since all these possibilities are staggeringly unlikely - probably less likely than your death in some freak accident - it is therefore extremely unlikely that the events you described in the OP would actually happen; and it is more likely that, if you tried it, you would simply die or become incapacitated before you had a chance."
HPMOR,3abhrk,LogicDragon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"Harry had to make a copy of the note that was atom-for-atom identical to the copy he received.   sigh.  NO, he didn't.  he had ALREADY MADE THE NOTE, it's the SAME NOTE, not a copy.    that's the point of time travel."
HPMOR,3abhrk,LogicDragon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"OK. Look, the note doesn't matter, it's just an example.  The point is that events always conspire to make everything self-consistent, and the most probable timeline happens.  So either the time-turner would have to somehow become the version you received (which would require it being de-aged somehow, since the version you received is an hour younger), or you would not receive it."
HPMOR,3abhrk,TwelvePointFive,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"hm I wouldn't say the do not mess with time note had no origin... it was written by harry, then traveled back in time.  it has a pretty stable one loop existence.  it also shouldn't be surprising the notes are identical-- they are the same object, just has harry is the same person when he travels back.    the main paradox of the gifted time turner scenario is the ""number of uses"" -- does the time turner itself keep track of how many times it has been used, or can it just not go back six hours?"
HPMOR,3abhrk,ZAKMagnus,4,Fri Jun 19 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"That's what we in the business call a ""Bootstrap paradox"". Either way, this specific case seems to be made purely with the intent of messing with time, which the timeline usually avoids, so I'm not sure how you would cause it since you didn't had a time turner to begin with"
HPMOR,3abhrk,zedzed9,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:44:51 2015 UTC,"even if you get rid of the problem of the origin of the time turner, the question about ""charges"" remains.   say you have a time turner, you go back and give it to yourself.  That self has 2.  when he gets to your point in time, he goes back and gives away the one you gave him, keeping the other one.  origin problem solved, but the ""6 use limit"" remains."
HPMOR,3abhrk,zedzed9,2,Fri Jun 19 15:14:53 2015 UTC,"I guess Time simply wouldn't allow something like that to happen in order to correct it, then."

HPMOR,3abhrk,zedzed9,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:51:17 2015 UTC,"ok, say you already have a time turner.  a future self comes back and gives you their time turner. now you have two.  an hour later, you use the one you were given by your future self to go back, and hand it to yourself.  you are back down to 1 time turner, and continue on your merry way.   however, the time turner is still caught in a loop, and is cycling an infinite number of times.   So, how many charges does it have?"
HPMOR,3abhrk,gridpoint,2,Fri Jun 19 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"My headcanon answer is that it can't happen. It would break Time.   Therefore, if you try, you spontaneously collapse/the Time-Turner breaks/you get Obliviated/etc. before you can make the infinite loop."
HPMOR,3abhrk,-Mountain-King-,2,Fri Jun 19 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"There's a place in the azkaban arc where it's revealed that information can only travel back six hours, and will stop people from time-turning if they have information from the future.  An example: Madam Bones finds out that Grindlewald has escaped at 14:00 pm. She immediately time-turns to 8:00 AM, and tells Dumbles. Dumbles is now unable to time-turn, because he has information from six hours into the future, but still gets a head start on chasing Grindlewald down.  As I understand it, the bit of your possessions(information, tag-along snakes, clothes, time-turners and knowledge) that has currently time-traveled the furthest sets the bar for how many charges you have left."
HPMOR,3abhrk,-Mountain-King-,2,Sat Jun 20 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"right, but information isn't traveling 6 hours back in this scenario. it's only traveling one hour back, over and over."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Geminii27,3,Sat Jun 20 03:40:58 2015 UTC,"I believe the scenario is impossible. Here is how I understand it:  At time 0, Harry has an unused time turner, when suddenly Future Harry appears with a time turner that has been used X times. (X > 0, since Future Harry is from the Future.)  Future Harry gives Harry his X-used time turner. Harry now has an unused time turner and an X-used time turner.  Harry and Future Harry discuss causality for an hour.  It's now time 0 + 1 hour and Harry needs to go back in time to be Future Harry. When Future Harry appeared at time 0, he had with him a time turner which had been used X times; therefore, when Harry goes back from t0+1h, he must use a time turner which has been used X - 1 times. Must. This is a known fact because its effect has already been observed.  Therefore, Harry can't use the X-used time turner for this; X != X - 1.  The reason, once again, is that we have already observed him not doing so. (Well, not directly observed; but we can deduce.)  So what happens if he tries to do so? I'm not sure.  But! This is exactly analogous to the situation that Harry encounters his future self, hears something from his future self, then decides to go back in time and say something different than he had heard from his future self. This scenario is also impossible, for the exact same reason. Again, I'm not sure what exactly would happen if Harry tried to do that, but I think it's a bit easier to think about that case, and exactly as instructive. I think that adding additional time turner messing-about to the scenario just obscures the core issue and makes it harder to see and to think about."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Geminii27,2,Sat Jun 20 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"Aside from the bootstrapped time-turner paradox, to answer your second question: it won't hit the 6 hour limit. It has already been used when it delivered to you, and you use it again: but that's the same use, just from the other end. One use, one cycle, one hour."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Geminii27,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"so when you use it, it doesn't trigger a use, or when you get it, it hasn't been used?"
HPMOR,3abhrk,Geminii27,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"No, neither of those things.   Let's imagine the scenario starts at noon. Future-self (you from 1pm) arrives with a time-turner that has now been used once, to go from 1pm to noon. Future self gives you the time turner. At 1pm, you are now the self formerly known as Future-self: the self who has lived noon-to-1 exactly once.   As Future-self, you go back in time from 1pm to noon. Note this is exactly the same journey that you have already seen the time turner make. Not different objects/selves taking the same ""route"", but exactly the same journey. Same use of the time turner.  You hand it over to Past self, wait an hour again, and then watch Past self go back on the exact same journey again. You have done a single loop, and you're the only time turner user, therefore the time turner has only done a single loop."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Avis57,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"yes, the person does only one loop.  however, the same time turner is being handed to yourself and used again.    So you are handed a time turner with one use.  when you use it at 1pm, how many charges does it have? does the ""counter"" just not go up, since the trip has ""already happened""?    the human's timeline is straightforward, but the time turner's timeline is a continuous loop, as it actually never continues past the moment that you time turn back.  the person continues without it.    You could create the same problem with a simple sheet of paper, on which you put a dot then hand to yourself.  how many dots are on the paper?"
HPMOR,3abhrk,Deenreka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"The time turner is being handed to yourself and used for the first time. It's only subjectively 'again'.   An outside observer sees a time turner come into existence at noon, persist until 1, and then go back to the start again. But there's only the one timeline - time turning doesn't cause alternate universes - so the time turner only exists for that one hour. How many times can it go back an hour when it only exists for an hour: one.  I guess that is equivalent to saying the counter doesn't go up further because the trip is the same trip.  The paper example is harder to work out. I imagine the stable loop is for the paper to have a single dot on it throughout it's hour of life, and the fact that there's no obvious moment when a dot is removed to counteract the one that is created is just a symptom of the fact that uncaused objects can't exist under the time-turner model of time travel, so this whole scenario is internally inconsistent."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Deenreka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"the time turner scenario is identical to the paper, and they are both impossible by the rules of HPMOR as far as I can tell.  each has a mechanism for tracking the number of times it is being sent back, and create a loop wherein that tracker's value is undefined (as in n/0.)   neither scenario can in fact occur, or it would create a paradox; by HPMOR, somehow the universe must conspire to prevent it from happening."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Deenreka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that neither can occur. That was literally the first thing I noted in this thread. But it sounds like you're saying that neither can occur because it makes the counter undefined. I'm saying that the causality is the other way: the counter is undefined because the situation cannot occur.  Also, I don't think it counts as conspiring to act like a perfectly normal universe and not let objects spontaneously appear. Maintaining a causal graph seems like a really basic thing for a universe to do."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Deenreka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"The ""counter"" problem is the only real paradox in the situation.  if not for that, everything that occurs should be completely possible within the laws of physics + time turners.    what physical law prevents you from handing yourself an object, any object?   what law of time turners prevents you from traveling back with this object?  if these two things are allowed, this scenario is allowed.   it is only the fact that the paper will have infinite dots on it that creates the paradox."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Deenreka,2,Fri Jun 26 14:55:25 2015 UTC,Step 3. would be receiving (after an hour) another time turner from a McGonagall (or whatever the original source is) before you travel back in time to hand it over to yourself.
HPMOR,3abhrk,Sagebrysh,2,Fri Jun 19 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"Iirc, the limits on time turners in HPMoR are the following:   time turners only operate in discrete, one hour chunks. time turners can only send one person at a time. time turners cannot send information back more than six hours, even with more than one time turner. time turners cannot be used more than six times a day, even with multiple users.   Therefore, this infinite loop wouldn't work, as it would require the turner to be used more than six times."
HPMOR,3abhrk,HotspurJr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:29:20 2015 UTC,right...but what would happen?  could you just not give yourself the time turner?
HPMOR,3abhrk,epicwisdom,2,Fri Jun 19 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"Well, if you did this (which you probably couldn't, because it would cause a paradox rather than a stable time loop), the turner wouldn't work. Then there'd be two of you, since there's no time turner to take one back. Since no one could go back, the older you wouldn't exist. So I think that the most likely scenario, if you tried to precommit to doing this (I'll time travel back to there, give myself the time turner, and time travel back to give myself the time turner) is that no one shows up, which is the only stable timeline that follows the rules."
HPMOR,3abhrk,Sagebrysh,2,Fri Jun 19 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but it would be far more likely that you started off with an external time turner and forced the probability landscape into this loop. While it'd be possible for a time turner to spontaneously appear out of nowhere to allow this to happen, the chances are far smaller.  So yeah, while you might be able to make it happen (and keep it as a stable spacetime knot through carefully culling possibilities which lead to other results), it's a pretty good indicator that you're deliberately dicking with time to pull it off."

HPMOR,3a4ihn,Roxolan,6,Wed Jun 17 07:03:25 2015 UTC,That would have been a lot more satisfying. Rather than using a secret artifact that dropped into Harry's lap and few if any other students have access to. This really is cheating.
HPMOR,3a4ihn,Uncaffeinated,8,Wed Jun 17 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"The annoying part about this solution isn't just that Harry cheated, it's that winning in this method doesn't prove his point about the Snitch being a detrimental gameplay element (even though he's completely right about that), because if you're going to cheat and use a time turner, you can win by using it to manipulate the Quaffle too - no need to go after the Snitch specifically (although of course that's the faster way to win since it's worth stupidly many points).

HPMOR,3a4ihn,Rangi42,19,Wed Jun 17 07:39:31 2015 UTC,"That seems underhanded even for Harry. Quidditch isn't like Quirrel's army battles, it's a game with rules, like card games or roulette, and if Time-Turners aren't explicitly prohibited it's only because nobody has tried them yet.  When Harry didn't reveal some trick at the start of the game, I thought he might just rely on his natural Seeking talent to beat Cedric to the Snitch—which would just emphasize his point that the Seeker makes the other players irrelevant."
HPMOR,3a4ihn,Roxolan,13,Wed Jun 17 07:18:52 2015 UTC,"I thought he might just rely on his natural Seeking talent to beat Cedric to the Snitch   Canon!Harry is a good seeker with a good broom, but he still couldn't reliably find the Snitch in the first few minutes of the match. If that was how Quidditch games usually went, even wizards would have noticed the problem. And with a team this outmatched (and HPMOR!Harry, who did not spend his weekends on Quidditch practice), he might catch the Snitch but lose the match. Which would be seen as evidence against his claim that the Snitch matters too much.  I expect that Time-Turners are explicitly prohibited in Quidditch though. If nothing else, someone must have written a school rule forbidding their use in exams, and it's not hard to remember to add ""and other school competitions"". But it's not cheating unless you get caught, right?"

HPMOR,3a4ihn,wren42,6,Wed Jun 17 07:51:44 2015 UTC,"""Do Not Mess With Time"" happens when you try and use time-turners to solve hard problems in linear, ahem, time."
HPMOR,3a4ihn,codahighland,2,Wed Jun 17 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"exactly, this seems similar to that recusion problem.  He can tell himself where the snitch is because he found the snitch because he told himself where the snitch was...  I think it would run into the same issue.   OP, if you have more sneaky stuff planned, should probably just start with that =)  Honestly, the simple solution would probably be to ignore the quaffle and aggressively harass the enemy seeker, or he could run team aerial formations to assist with zoning cedric out of certain areas and allow himself free movement.  If quiddich were a real world game this is the kind of strategy that would likely come up quickly in pro play."
HPMOR,3a4ihn,wren42,3,Wed Jun 17 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, time seems ok with it to some degree. Look back to the events just before Harry got the time turner in the first place."
HPMOR,3a4ihn,codahighland,3,Wed Jun 17 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the time turner doesn't mind sending messages back and guiding earlier behavior; the problems arose specifically when he tried to use a recursion.    ""For problem space E, attempt X.  If this desired result occurs, then I send a message back telling myself X is correct; else I don't send a message back.""  Finding the snitch feels a bit like this to me; it's trying to reduce a large search space by sending back the correct answer at the onset.   I suppose you could say that he actually just got lucky -- he happened to find the snitch, and then sent a message back telling himself where to look.  if he HADN'T found it, he would just not have gotten a message at all.  So the time turner didn't actually cause the result.   if the time turner could cause results like this, he could do nearly anything involving information just by determining to send a message back about it.   ""I'm going to win this game of chess then send a message back with the details of the move order.""  ""I'm going to find the entrance to the chamber of secrets then send myself a message where it's located, along with the passwords.""   Why should the latter fail when the snitch succeeds?"
HPMOR,3a4ihn,itisike,2,Wed Jun 17 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"Winning the game of chess doesn't work because observing how the game plays out doesn't give you the winning strategy. Any changes you make will influence all subsequent decisions made in the game. This produces the kind of nondeterministic time loop computation that triggered the ""do not mess with time"" scenario in the first place -- possibly, the fact that you can't get a stable outcome within a single iteration is what triggers it, but that's just speculation on my part. (EDIT: And actually, chess may be worse than primality factoring, depending on the specific rule details used; chess is at least PSPACE-hard, which means that it's at least as hard as the hardest problem you could solve with time-loop computation.)  The Chamber of Secrets part is theoretically possible -- IF it's possible for Harry to actually do that. If Harry can't find the Chamber and its passwords, there's no message for him to send backwards in time, and therefore past!Harry doesn't find a message and will have to search for it manually. He then fails to do so, and therefore doesn't send himself a message, and sanity is preserved. (A variant of this where Harry receives a message containing places where the chamber is NOT located, such that he can optimize his search pattern, might prompt a ""do not mess with time"" scenario.)  The location of the Snitch can be determined in a single iteration: Even if Cedric had caught the snitch on a hypothetical first iteration, Harry would still have known where the snitch was -- the information that Cedric is the one who caught it is unnecessary (and in fact, including it DOES produce a paradox that can only be resolved by ""Harry can't catch it even with foreknowledge"")."
HPMOR,3a4ihn,wren42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"cedric could have caught it at a later time, meaning the information about it's location would be useless.  honestly, I find the whole idea of an ""iteration"" preposterous. there is no evidence that there is an alternate universe where cedric found the snitch, harry got the info, and them time turned back to tell himself from another reality where it would be.  these are just hypothetical constructs to help rationalize how time optimizes for the least complex scenario -- the simplest of which is, harry just can't find the snitch, and so doesn't bother to send a message back."
HPMOR,3a4ihn,itisike,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, you're definitely right. I explained this in a comment on another thread but essentially, discussing ""iterations"" is simply a means of reasoning about the computation that is effectively being done in terms of deterministic, serial logic. It's not literally what's happening, but it is mathematically equivalent to it.  Edit: Meanwhile -- Just because Cedric caught the snitch in a hypothetical branch of the timestream in which Harry did not pass the message to himself doesn't actually matter. The information being passed is information that can be acquired directly instead of being materialized out of nothingness, fully-formed. (The extreme example of the opposite scenario is receiving a time machine from your future self, which you later go on to deliver to your past self. The time machine has no origin.)"

"" even 'had' he not, in the future, found the snitch, he would, in the future past, know where it would be/had been, so it was inevitable that he would/had known it's location.""

The equivalent in math would be ""check if the numbers are the correct factors, if yes, send them back, if not, find the actual factors by asking whoever multiplied them or using a calculator, then send those numbers back"". That only requires one ""loop"", and in my model it works.  In this case as well, he's not brute-forcing the search space, he's finding out the solution at the end of the loop through non-time-related methods, then sending that back, perfectly consistent with other time travel examples in HPMOR.   if you need to think about it intuitively, consider that the case where harry DOESN'T get the snitch first is more probable, so he doesn't bother sending back a message at all.   Harry resolves to send back the position of the Snitch regardless of who gets it. That makes your example inconsistent.

Oh, and Harry trusts here, but Harry doesn't trust Riddlemort.  From a system safety perspective, Harry and Riddle are too similar to count as different safty strategies; if one of them has a cognitive bias that makes the overlook a certain flaw in a plan, chanes are that the other has the same flaw."

Voldemort wants to minimize him personally being in the way of that, because he doesn't want to inadvertently fulfill the prophecy again.  Unfortunately, he was still trying to stop the prophecy, so as clever as he was he couldn't prevent that fact."
