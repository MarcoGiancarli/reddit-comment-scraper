AmateurPhotography,3dxzwc,Sasmas1545,2,Mon Jul 20 13:34:50 2015 UTC,"I like the second to last one myself.    If you wanted any comments about this, I would say that I would have put the car flat on the paper, or tilted it the other way.  By having the car on the right side of the photo, for some reason I think it is moving to the left.  So the tilt seems odd to me.  NOrmally a drifting car is flat anyway.    I would have made pencil marks that were just two marks comign from the wheels themselves.  I asusme the multiple marks were meant to show that the car was doing drifts around and around, but its not obvious enough to notice.  To me anyway, maybe I am just slow lol.    There isn't enough to make it appear to be in motion unfortunately, not sure what could be done to give it that effect."
AmateurPhotography,3dxzwc,Delet3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"not sure what could be done to give it that effect   Actually roll the car forward. If it's a longer exposure, the forward movement will be easily captured. Just like the accidental bump and how you can see lateral movement to the side, if the car is actually moving, you would capture that as well."
AmateurPhotography,3dxzwc,hucksterme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:45 2015 UTC,"I agree it would have looked nice further left in the frame.  The marks (done with sharpie not pencil) were really just there because we were using the table like a spirograph.  And to be entirely honest, the goal wasn't to make it seem like the car was in motion, but to see if we could highlight certain lines on the car. I don't think we did a great job capturing what I was looking for, but some of the images do it better than others."

AmateurPhotography,3dtke0,BrentBlend,2,Sun Jul 19 10:57:14 2015 UTC,Part of the major appeal is the shallow dof you can achieve. You should try one where there is a large distance between the subject and the background. Putting yourself closer to the subject can also maximize this effect.
AmateurPhotography,3dtke0,BrentBlend,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"I wanted to see if it would work with the jpegs. I shoot in RAW and was unsure what would happen.  Also, would it be much different DoF than shooting a 210mm 2.8 on a crop? I get some pretty shallow DoF with that. Here is an example. It's a 70-210 2.8 on a t2i.   What do I gain from this method?"
AmateurPhotography,3dtke0,BrentBlend,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"Focal length, aperture, and hyperfocal distance all come into play with dof. Shooting at 210mm 2.8, as close to the subject as you can focus, and having a very distant background will maximize the shallow depth of field look. Which will blur the background more as well."

Analog doesn't mean ""not digital"", it refers to technologies using an analog electrical signal to do their job. Film is a physical/chemical thing. There is no analog electronics needed to record the image, apart from maybe the light meter if you are using that. In comparison, traditional radio is analog. Audio amplifiers and speakers are analog. Television and a VHS camcorder are analog. Film pre-dates analog technology."

AmateurPhotography,3di9pg,fivemanship,2,Thu Jul 16 14:18:53 2015 UTC,Personally when I was starting to learn photography I bought a Sony nex-5n and I got some adapters that allowed me to buy and use old lenses. Most old lenses are far more affordable and it forces you to learn how to control your camera manually. With the old lenses you manually change the aperture and focus slowing you down and making you really take time and learn to frame the picture. Which I find is perfect for landscape/city scape photos.
AmateurPhotography,3di9pg,chiliDAWG122,2,Thu Jul 16 15:13:11 2015 UTC,"Older lenses is a good way to start- especially in instances such as this where you may be doing landscape type stuff where you dont necessarily need fast autofocus, etc (hell even some newer lenses that cost a lot are manual focus). And in many instances, the glass of some of the older lenses hold their own against some of the newer ones with added technology."

AmateurPhotography,3di9pg,Delet3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:35 2015 UTC,"Here's a link to my instagram to give you a sense of the type of photos i'm taking -- keep in mind though a lot of these are heavily edited with instagram and afterlight.  Basically I want a cheap camera that delivers more high quality photos, perhaps with better contrast -- my phone takes good photos, but struggles under low light and sometimes the pics come out a bit pixelated.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""real photography"" -- I don't plan becoming a professional by any means, it's just a hobby I enjoy.  At the same time, I feel I have a better understanding of photography than the average camera owner.  By tight budget, I mean I really don't wanna go over a couple hundred bucks -- ideally something under $100, but I know that's asking a lot so I'd be willing to take it used or whatever in order to get a lower price."
AmateurPhotography,3di9pg,Delet3r,2,Thu Jul 16 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"Most of the money in photography is to get low light photos, and short depth of fields.  It looks like you dont need a low depth of field, so you want to get outdoor shots later at night?    Almost any camera today will take pretty nice outdoor shots.  Any camera that lets you set the shutter speed manually, with a tripod, will let you get low light landscape shots (although it will blur out people or cars or anything in the photo, if you use a low shutter speed).    The hard part about a phone camera is that you cant set the shutter speed to be really slow, to get more light.  It seems after some looking around that cheaper cameras dont offer manual controls anymore.  But if you look for an older model, you can definitely get one for a couple hundred dollars that will take GREAT photos.    No camera under $1000 is really great in low light.  My dslr, unfortunately, was not much better than my point and shoot in low light, until I got a lens that had a wide aperture.  Those lens are usually expensive, except for a few exceptions, which are the lenses almost everyone owns. :)  Heres a canon for $200  http://www.techhive.com/article/256012/canon_powershot_sx260_hs_review_another_top_notch_canon_pocket_zoom.html  I found it by looking up 'point and shoot with manual controls'.  If you have control over the shutter speed and aperture, etc.  then with a tripod you can take good photos even at night... as long as you are doing landscape shots.  If you want a great photo in a dark bar of a band that is playing... youre going to have to spend thousands of dollars, unfortunately."
AmateurPhotography,3di9pg,Gockel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that knowledge!  Taking photos in low-light isn't a high priority for me, but if I can manage something that takes it better than my phone, I'd like that.  Would cheaper cameras have an adjustable shutter speed?"
AmateurPhotography,3di9pg,SpetsnazCyclist,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"Some do, you have to look for a camera that has manual controls.  You should definitely be able to get one for under $300 though.  I stick with nikon or canon myself.  Unfortunately you cant really filter on amazon or other sites by 'manual controls' so your best bet might be going to a Best Buy or whatever store that sells cameras and asking for the cheapest one that has manual controls.  Generally, if it has manual controls it will take pretty nice cameras, because people looking for those things are also looking to take nice photos.    Also, the reason your photo gets pixels is because it increases the ISO (this was originally the 'speed' of the film) to compensate for the low light.  It does that to keep the shutter speed fast enough that your hands naturally shaking dont make the camera blurry.  Make sense?    So to keep the ISO fairly low, you have to have a slower shutter speed.  The logner the shutter is open (slow speed) the more light gets through the lens.  So with manual controls you can keep the ISO low by using a slow shutter speed, and you can eliminate the blur from your hands shaking by using a $30 tripod.  With a $100 camera and a tripod, you can get VERY nice landscape shots, even later at night."

AmateurPhotography,3dgl8i,Delet3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I think I manually put the camera at a lower aperture. I have no idea if this actually does anything since the lens only does f/4-f/5.6, but I may have had it at a f/2-f/4, can't remember for sure. And I feel the same way about the grass, but it was a ""lucky"" shot which I didn't think would turn out."
AmateurPhotography,3dgl8i,Delet3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"Well if the lens says f/5.6-f/8 then it should mean that its f5.6 at 35mm, and f/8 (at best) at 80mm.  F/2 would have definitely given you this depth of field, maybe even shallower.    It can happen if the background is far away from the cat, and you were fairly far from it when you took the photo.  Either way, it doesnt really matter, i was just curious.  :)    I have only done a little B&W photography, how did you take this?  I use Lightroom and downloaded a preset for making photos black and white, but i have read that its the colored filters, paradoxically, that make black and white photos stand out so much.  You noted 'no filter', if so, how do you take black and white photos?"

If you're going to shoot at the ISO and aperture you're posting, your exposure needs to be much longer than 30 seconds... which will require a remote shutter release and your camera being in bulb mode."

Budget: <$200 Purpose: Travel photos Specifics: - Something good for a beginner - Something that will theoretically deliver home-display worthy photographs.  To the OP, in that,price range, I would look at the Nikon Coolpix L830, Canon Powershot sx520, and Sony DSC H300 (slightly over that budget). Watch some tutorial videos on Youtube from the likes of BH Photovideo or Adorama and others to learn about basic composition and the relationship between shutter speed, aperture (f-stop) and ISO (gain). Then make sure the cameras you look at have the capability to do the job you want, such as the ability to manually set aperture or shutter speed if you hope to have control over depth of field (bokeh) or motion blur.   It's not as overwhelming as it sounds at first, but there is more to it than ""point and click"" to get great ""display worthy"" images. Even if you're shooting with your smartphone, knowing these basics will help you achieve solid results."

AmateurPhotography,3d2zp2,maakuz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:10:57 2015 UTC,"The second one is pretty good, the exposure is just too long. Crop sensor can get you far though! Here's one I got at 15s, F3.5 ISO 2000. It's oversharpened as it was for FB."
AmateurPhotography,3d2zp2,ohbearded1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:15:55 2015 UTC,Nice! The stars are a nice trade off with the sharpening. I didn't really have enough time to even focus unfortunately (setup shot in about 2 minutes) the clouds started to roll in after a bit as well. I definitely should have done a shorter exposure and higher sensitivity with the f/3.5

AmateurPhotography,3cs801,BallinHonky,9,Fri Jul 10 10:19:19 2015 UTC,Nice tones!  Love the vibrant red.  I only suggest you straighten the horizon line so that the bridge doesn't look like it's falling over to the side.

AmateurPhotography,3cs801,therealvulrath,5,Fri Jul 10 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"Got Photoshop or Lightroom?  It should be fairly easy to fix the horizon using the crop tool and a line coming off the horizontal ruler (turn the rulers on in the view menu, then grab the horizontal ruler and drag it down) assuming it's a JPEG (protip: you can rotate the photo using the crop tool).  You have a little bit more freedom if it's a RAW image (Adobe's Camera RAW tool has a straighten tool that straightens and autocrops the image).  This is all for PS; I have no idea how to do it in LR as I never use it.  This is the best I've found in the way of explaining the rule of thirds.  It's not exactly the simplest description, but the images illustrate it well enough.  If your camera has the option, I found that turning on the grid in the viewfinder really helps with composition."
AmateurPhotography,3cs801,blitzangel,2,Fri Jul 10 16:54:49 2015 UTC,Rotate the image slightly clockwise until the line that separates the water and land in the background is perfectly horizontal.  Any basic image editor should have a rotation tool.

Nikons, in my experience, have always oversaturated the greens; thus, it's a little distracting, despite the narrow DOF. I've been shooting Nikons for quite a while, and I still find myself reigning the greens in for some shots.  If this were my shot, I'd maybe desaturate the greens all-around in LR, then use a brush to add them back in around the subject area. Again, that's just me.  Finally, I may have aimed my shot upwards just a bit more, so that more distant trees/foliage appeared even more out of focus to give the scene a sense of depth. That would've placed the subject more in line with the rule of thirds and added some context.   Still, nice! :)"

They are hardy cameras and will last a long time if you take care of them.

AmateurPhotography,3cph14,PoniesNotBronies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"Nikon D3300, I think it is the best DSLR for the price. If you want something cheaper, but still a great camera, get the older version; the D3200. It is basicly the same thing, except older, with only a few aspects that have been improved with the D3300, like higher ISO maximum and 60 fps video shooting."
AmateurPhotography,3cph14,Verletzt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"Go mirrorless-- you'll get the same image quality as a DSLR at a fraction of the size. She won't want to carry a huge camera around all the time, unless she's really interested in photography (in which case you may want to reconsider choosing a camera for her.) That said, it doesn't have the impressive look of a DSLR so there's less wow when she opens the box.   The Sony a5100 is a little more expensive than the one you listed, and it doesn't come with all that extra crap, but it has the same size sensor and everything you need to take excellent photos.   I'd also recommend against getting a super huge bundle like that. A regular 18-55mm kit lens is all you need for everyday photography; the fisheye adapters and the 75-300mm lenses are something that you don't need unless you know you need them. The only important accessories are an SD card or two, and maybe a battery or two. If she has a desire to learn to use it, get her a flash as well.   Edit: The sony a5000 is the same price as what you listed, and is nearly as good. You could also go for a micro 4/3 camera, which won't quite get the high ISO low light performance of a sony mirrorless (because it has a smaller sensor), but they're cheaper and there are some seriously cool ones out there."

The only thing that I personally would do in with this image is a bit of light photoshop.  This is just what I came up with, i just applied a camera raw filter (slight adjustments to general settings, not white balance, and a bit of dehaze), and then I applied a high pass filter to accentuate some of the edges. Other than those little things, it is a great image, and I hope to see more stuff from you soon."

You want a cheap hotshoe flash like a Yongnuo YN-560 III, and a way to trigger it off camera like an RF-603 ii or a 560-TX. You'll also need a light stand, an umbrella swivel, and an umbrella. It will cost more than that, but that setup is going to be complete crap, break very quickly, and not put out even close to enough light. Oh, and you'll need to be plugged into a wall socket to use it-speedlights are battery powered, so that's another plus."

AmateurPhotography,3bfoby,i_can_karma_whore,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"Well I'm renting it, so the versatility in the long run isn't as important as having some cool pictures instead.   But I think I may go with a wide angle lense because then I'll be able to take more good pictures, instead of having to constantly switch lenses to take good pictures vs. distorted ones."
AmateurPhotography,3bfoby,kylesuo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend the Nikon 18-200 (or 18-300 if you really think you need that extra zoom). Relatively cheap to rent, and one lens will take care of everything you need. It's not a bad piece of glass either."

AmateurPhotography,3b921a,eternalfrost,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"i get this problem with a lot of my photos-- the subject looks ok, but the background is completely washed out. it's just white nothing. how do you set up the camera to get good detail in the background as well as up close?"
AmateurPhotography,3b921a,solsangraal,2,Sat Jun 27 14:03:58 2015 UTC,You have to do one of 2 things:  Brighten the foreground or use multiple exposures.  Ideally you use a flash or light bounce to get the subject as bright (or nearly so) as the background.  Then you can use local contrast enhancement or manual manipulation to balance out the picture.
AmateurPhotography,3b921a,gregm12,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:19:37 2015 UTC,"Drop the exposure so the background looks a little bright(but not as bright as it is), then use the flash. It will drop the background lighting a lot, and lighten the foreground that would have been lost because of the lower exposure."
AmateurPhotography,3b921a,devoidz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:56:34 2015 UTC,Do you know how aperture works? How do you use it?
AmateurPhotography,3b921a,Pelvic_beard,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:41:47 2015 UTC,This could be a lighting issue too.  I.E. Use a flash to make the subject as bright as the background so the exposure is the same.

AmateurPhotography,3aadwd,talmi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:24:57 2015 UTC,I like the one of the coffee. I would play around with different angles of the food other than a top down. Do some up close shots. Take several shots in weird angles is what I do. Never know what might actually look cool :)
AmateurPhotography,3a5u3k,Jwagen,2,Wed Jun 17 13:40:02 2015 UTC,"Cool shot, these are fun.   In the future, it's best to keep your iso as low as possible. So instead of shooting at f14 iso 800 you could do f5.6 iso 200 or so. It will result in much crisper pictures with less noise."

AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,MissGeorgiaGore,2,Tue Jun 16 16:36:08 2015 UTC,"Good soft, flattering and directional light, which is a start. Girls looking off camera is kind of played out, though. Not sure why you've cropped off the other arm. Posing hands is not easy at first.  A good initial exposure but again not sure why you've posted without any editing at all. Composition could be improved with removing some of the excess negative space at the top."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,unsolicited_critique,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:42:37 2015 UTC,My camera is sort of hard to look through so i have alot of space at the top and cut her hand off by mistake. There were two other professional people with me (learning experience) and they were telling her to keep looking off and away and other things. I just wanted to see what people actually thought of this cause it was her favorite out of the set.
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,unsolicited_critique,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:50:33 2015 UTC,"Assuming DSLR because I'm not finding indication either way in flair or post history. Do you wear glasses? Plenty of bespectacled photographers remove the eyecup to get their eye within the eye relief of the viewfinder. If not, there are eye point extenders. The only one I'm finding right now is the Canon EP-EX15 II; I swore other manufacturers had them too.  There are some technique methods to reduce the effects: First, you can always shoot a bit wide to give more margin for error. Second, you can shift the relative position of the camera and eye to see each frame edge. I do this a lot almost subconsciously. Third, with enough practice you get a feel for how far your field of view extends out from the center, then you can estimate where the edges are. This can be extended to having a feel of the angle of view. One exercise you can try is at a given focal length, look through the viewfinder, take a photo, and then hold your fingers out at arm's length to match that frame size.  For better images and more hands-on learning you probably want to try to get your friend off solo so her attention can be focused on you and your direction. Put those new lessons to use and practice.  To extend on another top-level comment, this is indeed quite soft at 100%, but at smaller sizes perhaps the reduction in detail will render this exposure close enough. Depends on the needs. If your friend has this as her favorite (and puts it a profile image on social media), that is great! That means you have a willing accomplice in improving your portrait work. This also includes post processing, which I mentioned (more name-dropped) in my original comment."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,SCphotog,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:17:31 2015 UTC,"It's out of focus. Delete, move to the next image.  I don't mean to be harsh, but an OOF photo isn't worth keeping IMO."

AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,FemaleAngst,2,Thu Jun 18 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"Don't delete. Keep and share it.  Your subject will love the photo, make it their profile pic, and keep it for a very long time.  Stuff like that makes photography fun and worth our time."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,Mysta02,0,Fri Jun 19 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's a nice picture but I would have edited out her self harm scars. It seems to glorify it a bit, imo."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,tw33kz0r,8,Tue Jun 16 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate: does it glorify it, or does it simply show her as she is, including her past mistakes?  I don't know, but I think it's worth thinking about, at the least."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,Mysta02,2,Tue Jun 16 23:50:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're trying to achieve...if this was a purely fashion shoot, we're perfection is usually the order of the day then yes it should be removed.  They are very distracting and not many reasons to leave them in."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,Mysta02,4,Wed Jun 17 01:07:55 2015 UTC,"If this is a fashion shoot for a business, the scars should absolutely be edited out, as they would detract from the purpose of the shoot  If this is a portrait shoot for the girl, she is the purpose of the photo, and I'd inquire as to her personal choice, but be inclined to leave them in if she's not opposed.  Regarding ""flaws"", IMO (feel free to disagree) portraits should generally portray the person in their best light, without removing who they are.  Acne goes, scars stay; out of place hair goes, wrinkles stay.  Obviously, if the model has something else in mind, they have final say, but offering some gentle, but heartfelt advice (you are beautiful and may not want to hide something you worked so hard to beat) is your right/responsibility.  These rules (again, IMO) go out the window when doing anything for commercial or advertisement purposes, and there is almost no limit to the extent you can go to meet the client's needs."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,FemaleAngst,6,Wed Jun 17 01:17:13 2015 UTC,"this was simply for her, she embraces her scars and wouldn't of wanted me to remove them. She says they are her past and show how much stronger she is as a person."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,urban_,2,Wed Jun 17 01:47:51 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Glad to hear she's worked through her past and has come to terms with her scars.
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,FemaleAngst,0,Wed Jun 17 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe it it was a series of other people that had similar scars, I could see it have more merit than just the single photo."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,Mysta02,7,Wed Jun 17 04:14:06 2015 UTC,Why would you change her image? I think it's powerful to have her marks on there. It tells a story.
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,FemaleAngst,0,Wed Jun 17 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"Like another user already mentioned, it does glorify it a bit. I don't think things of that nature are too interesting or worth presenting. This is totally just my opinion, but I feel it isn't any different than showing a person neglecting their kid because of their bipolar symptoms or their drug or alcohol addiction. I just don't think there is anything special in mental illness."
AmateurPhotography,3a1ziu,xxTheGoDxx,3,Wed Jun 17 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"OP mentioned elsewhere in the thread that this was a personal portrait of and for the model herself.  Including the scars wasn't to glorify them, but simply there because they are a part of her, who she was, and who she's become."

AmateurPhotography,3a0v5d,pdgrizzles,2,Mon Jun 22 06:07:01 2015 UTC,"What's your budget? It all depends on how much you want to spend. Usually, you want to buy refurbished, as it is much cheaper. I personally own a Canon Rebel T3, a great camera for the price. It goes for around $350 on the Canon website. If you have a bit more to spend, you should look at the Canon Rebel T3i, which is about $480. Both of these cameras come with a decent lens."

AmateurPhotography,39l63z,MrJezzaaah,3,Fri Jun 12 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"Eh what...? Those settings are odd, to say the least... Why did you go all the way up to f/18, and then have a 127.6 sec exposure? That doesn't make sense to me, could you explain those settings please?  Other than that, the parts of the building with the lights on them can't even be seen because of the amount of light, so they need less exposure.  Symmetry is a big thing in photography, and this would have been a good opportunity to use that, but you're not standing in the middle of the staircase, which is a bit of a shame i think."
AmateurPhotography,39l63z,MrJezzaaah,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:05:48 2015 UTC,I had that longer shutter speed recommended to me as a way to experiment with Bulb. I adjusted the aperture down down until my camera said the image was exposed correctly then shot
AmateurPhotography,39l63z,MrJezzaaah,3,Fri Jun 12 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"I was expecting Bulb yes, the only way to get that kind of exposure.  The thing is, it doesn't have to be 127 seconds to be a long exposure. Raising your aperture to f/22 will have an effect called 'Diffraction' which will result in your image being less sharp than it can be.  Keeping the aperture at f/8 would have been just fine, and would have still given you an exposure of about 15 seconds, which can be achieved with Bulb as well."
AmateurPhotography,39l63z,wolfman86,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't aware of the change in sharpness. Thanks for the tip!"
AmateurPhotography,39l63z,VillyCool,2,Fri Jun 12 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"It's something that's often forgotten.   That's what ND-filters were invented for, to be able to keep that aperture open while doing long exposures."
AmateurPhotography,39kozb,ParadoxAssault,4,Fri Jun 12 12:01:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if you don't have a tripod, it doesn't mean you can't set the camera down onto something. Bean bags are often used to stablize a camera on a table or chair... or even a rock or whatever if you're careful. I often carry a smallish towel to put down under my camera, keeps it clean and offers stability and vibration absorption.  There's not much in this image to be interested in. There's no specific subject. Those light trails look cool and all, but not so much as to really hold my interest."

You could Google to see other shots of the moon, or fill the frame more if you want but you did something a bit different.  I really like the flare and I think overexposing the bright portion gives this a surreal feel. Also being able to see the stars is interesting, you don't normally get that in a moon shot. There's something ephemeral you've captured and I like it overall. Definitely keep experimenting to see what you like but I think this is a good start."

But I would call this more a test shot than an actual attempt at composition. So my main suggestion would be to try to find ways to make your next attempt more dynamic. Look at good examples of night photography that you like. They usually make use of things like camera placement, and unique subject matter. Light streaks are fun, and what you have here seems like a good first attempt at finding balance with an image, but for me, the orange light that dominates the right half of the image kind of eliminates the purpose of doing a night photo at all. Oh. And this being Reddit, I would encourage critique, not criticism."

AmateurPhotography,38296x,orange9035,3,Thu Jun 18 08:38:01 2015 UTC,"OP, buy an slr camera please because if you can take photos this good but decide to completely bottleneck and limit yourself with point and shoots or smartphones then, your photos will never really be useable (other than for posting them on social media lol).  The benfits you would gain by shooting in RAW format with a proper camera are invaluable and worth every dollar you spend. Landscape photos especially should be shot in RAW format since they are only properly displayed in high-res. I would go insane if I was stuck with your camera as a landscape photographer. Also your missing out on crucial factors for this kind of photography like being able to shoot at very long exposures and being able to use lens filters for a massive amount of uses.   People who tell you that you should hide from the tools that will help you realize your potential as a photographer are idiots plane and simple, probably with the delusion that smartphones and instagram will somehow do away with the need for professional photography equipment which isn't going to happen. Spend some money now to really start your dive into photography."

AmateurPhotography,38296x,davidindigitaland,2,Tue Jun 2 06:04:12 2015 UTC,Even more impressive that it's a phone
AmateurPhotography,38296x,pdgrizzles,2,Tue Jun 2 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"It's a great picture and as others have said, the photographer is the one who put the image together and you did a great job. Maybe lift or lower the division in the middle?    Of course, a high mega pixel DSLR would've given you a better dynamic range etc, tone range in color and so forth but it wouldn't have changed the greatness of the motif!"
AmateurPhotography,38296x,wubwubDJ,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:59:44 2015 UTC,I took a few pictures in different light and focus that was the best one with what i had. But thank you i will play around with it and make it as good as i can :)

AmateurPhotography,38101j,tbuddah,2,Mon Jun 1 14:19:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! We didn't think it would work as well as it did.
AmateurPhotography,37z176,gator_bites,2,Sun May 31 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"I think this photo would be great without the bird - the focus on the cat, and the contrast, are so perfect that the bird is distracting than adding.  I really like the colours and what you've done with them.  The picture feels a bit noisy although it was shot in daylight - could it be an ISO issue?"
AmateurPhotography,37z176,weboide,1 point,Sun May 31 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"possibly, I was fiddling with the shutter speed while trying to snap a good pic of the cat and bird. I was quickly changing settings while still in the learning process."
AmateurPhotography,37z176,weboide,1 point,Sun May 31 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"I hear you, those days happen. You could create a variant of this shot by framing the cat by himself."
AmateurPhotography,37z176,W00ster,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:47:23 2015 UTC,Good idea. I might do that when I get some free time this afternoon.
AmateurPhotography,37zhd0,MidWestJoke,5,Sun May 31 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"I think it could be improved if you just stuck with natural colour curves - there is little consistency and it feels like it could have been an album thrown together from 23 different events.  It certainly is fun to play around with the creative elements and filters, but unless the client specifically asked for a particular look e.g. faded, low contrast, raised shadows curve - they won't really understand it.  Find your style and stick to it. An occasional black-and-white photo can add a nice touch, but I feel like 90% of these photos should be naturally colour graded.  What I think you have done well is make people feel comfortable around you - the smiles don't feel forced, and although some poses feel a bit awkward, people seem to be comfortable with you behind the camera, which is very important!"
AmateurPhotography,37zhd0,pantoponrosey,1 point,Sun May 31 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I do like to play around, but I usually only do these as fun extras. Any client I've worked with has gotten natural color curve pictures, and some of these thrown in.  I'm still pretty fresh in the editing department, so I do A LOT of experimenting. I'm still trying to find my style, and I am even still exploring and finding styles."
AmateurPhotography,37xmaf,hall714,1 point,Sun May 31 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"Your depth of field looks perfect. I wish you were a little more zoomed in on the butterfly. I can't say love the leaf/branch in the background. However, I think you did an amazing job. There is a great amount of detail of the butterfly that it helps take away from the background. Fantastic"
AmateurPhotography,37xmaf,PhotoJulie,0,Tue Jun 9 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Focus is good, dof is nice, colours are great. Its a bit of a boring subject, I'm sure we all have macro photos of butterflies doing nothing, but regardless, the photo is technically very good."

AmateurPhotography,37uuib,papatonepictures,1 point,Sat May 30 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"yeah, That was mostly from Photoshop, however I found the clarity in that picture to be really good, especially for my camera."
AmateurPhotography,37uuib,spiderpig08,1 point,Sat May 30 22:55:51 2015 UTC,Did you use artificial blur?
AmateurPhotography,37uuib,spiderpig08,1 point,Sun May 31 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"Usually, my camera has no Manual focus, so I have to fabricate it with PS."
AmateurPhotography,37uuib,aleeysan,1 point,Sun May 31 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"I suggest making sure the blur is all on the same plane, if it has a curve around the subject it throws the viewer off a bit, or at least that's what happens when I see that in a photo."
AmateurPhotography,37uuib,aleeysan,0,Sun May 31 04:46:14 2015 UTC,Where do you go for possibilities like this?...
AmateurPhotography,37u7js,aleeysan,3,Sat May 30 12:48:13 2015 UTC,"There's not a whole lot of point in putting your subject on one of the thirds intersections if there's nothing else in the picture of interest. Here there's just plenty of distracting clutter in the background. I'm pretty sure you would've gotten a better picture if you had moved about half a meter to the left and focused more closely on her face, you would maybe have gotten rid of some of the clutter in the background and instead filled the picture with what is actually your subject."
AmateurPhotography,37u7js,Jeraz0l,2,Sat May 30 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"While I see the balance you got, I'm being distracted by something about the image. Maybe the pipes in the background? She doesn't quite seem to be the focal point of the shot for me.  Perhaps her stance is confusing? I'm not quite sure what's throwing off my view on this one, those are my guesses."
AmateurPhotography,37u7js,GoLightLady,2,Sat May 30 13:27:26 2015 UTC,Its a busy background i admit... Its tricky to get her even interested in standing still haha
AmateurPhotography,37u7js,HateEgo,2,Sat May 30 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"Empty space on the right.  I say ""empty"" because it's not adding depth or a setting.  In this particular situation focusing on her with a tighter focal length or zoom with one eye placed at the upper corner of the center box could help.  From there, sharp focus on the eyes with a shallow depth to single her out from the background.   Kids aren't the easiest to work with but with enough patience you'll make great shots."
AmateurPhotography,37u7js,Colored_Infinity,1 point,Sat May 30 23:29:42 2015 UTC,The way i was always taught and kinda stuck with me is that simple is better.   Portraits and cars always look well taking up the full frame especially with bokeh.   Now that doesn't me you can be artistic and try odd angles or follow other basic rules like the 1/3 2/3 rule.   As far as your shot everything looks good minus the background being distracting.
AmateurPhotography,37u7js,wayouw,0,Sun May 31 06:10:31 2015 UTC,I think the background is too distracting coz it's kinda clustered
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,mooper_,2,Thu May 28 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"Raise your F-Stop to lengthen your depth of field to get a more solid focus from nose to ears.  There's an app called F-Stop that will help you calculate your depth of field.  Raising the F-Stop will darken your photo but taking your ISO to 200 shouldn't be that noticeable.  From the look of your photos, your FPS is good.  Try this and hope it helps."
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,HateEgo,1 point,Thu May 28 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I do have to play with the F-stop a little more, especially with the frenchie portrait the ears are way out of focus. Thanks for the tip!"
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,devcoder,2,Fri May 29 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"Also attend to shutter speed, some of the pictures (especially the last one) look like you moved the slightest amount. 1/30 is probably the longest exposure you should do handheld to get a clear picture, but faster will always be less blurry"
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,aleeysan,2,Fri May 29 01:56:12 2015 UTC,I usually don't have my shutter under 100 unless I'm inside and have no natural light. I figured out that I have this little meter (I think it's the exposure meter) and when I start going into the faster shutter speeds it starts to show a lower exposure. But I was shooting at the faster shutter possible the other day and I was still getting fuzzyish pictures :(. I'm not sure why. There wasn't a noticeable difference between 1/4000 and 1/160. Not even in exposure.
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,ke7ofi,1 point,Fri May 29 02:14:32 2015 UTC,I really like your pictures especially the first one. I have A D40X and quality is not an issue here is an example But yes i really like your pics...

AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,ke7ofi,1 point,Fri May 29 01:31:44 2015 UTC,"They look focussed to me. If you’re just concerned about depth of field, you can take your aperture size down, but I don’t see much wrong with them.  Regarding photo editing, have your tried darktable?"
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,hollywood_jazz,1 point,Thu May 28 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Ooh I will have to try that, thank you! I might be able to download it on my boyfriend's laptop, right now I'm pretty much solely using a work laptop which I need admin permission to install stuff on."
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,hollywood_jazz,2,Fri May 29 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"If you have a television or similar, I’d recommend getting a RasPi or C.H.I.P. Even with the limited power, it’s really important to have root access to your computer. Better yet, find a cheap used computer and salvage parts to make it faster."
AmateurPhotography,37mqvq,hollywood_jazz,1 point,Fri May 29 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"Haha I didn't know you could do that with computers until about a month ago! I always knew you could build a computer (my mom is actually an IT/engineer thing) but for some reason it didn't occur to me that you could build one with better specs. Which is weird because I'm pretty good at building other things the way I want.

AmateurPhotography,357apv,texaskiwi,1 point,Thu May 7 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"I am an amateur photographer. I have been playing around with photography for quite a few years, but still very much an amateur. I have a Canon Rebel Ti DSLR and I have fun trying out the settings. My favorite types of photography are mostly landscapes, macro (flowers), urban, cemeteries and nighttime. Plus, of course, family photos and events.  Anyway, I’m an American living in New Zealand, a photographers dream. I see so many gorgeous photos online yet have been unable to create those amazing shots that really get noticed.  I’ve read loads of info about landscape photography and most info states the best time to take photos is morning/evening.  Midday being the worst. OK, I get that.  However, sometimes while travelling you don’t always get a choice as to what time of day you’ll be at a particular location.  Recently, we were planning a road trip to show our kids a bit of New Zealand.  With this all in mind I posted some questions on a facebook group trying to get some advice.  I was mostly looking for any info that would help me create some good photos DESPITE the fact it might be at midday.  I believe there is some great beauty with the sun shining high and hoped to get some tips. Unfortunately, all I got were some pretentious comments telling me not to even bother.  In my explanation I explained that you don’t always get a choice of time of day and mentioned that not only do I not get a choice of time of day, but often I’m lucky if my hubby stops the car long enough for me to even take a photo. The two or so comments I got were unhelpful and a bit condescending.   My post here is to tell many of those just starting out and other fellow amateurs to take heart.  I think a really good photographer is one who can create a nice image working with all the limitations they have. Yes it takes patience and perseverance to wait out the perfect time and hike to the perfect location to get that awesome shot.  But it also takes talent to take a really good shot with limited resources and accessibility. Also keeping in mind that we all have digital cameras and it doesn’t hurt anything or cost anything to just snap away. If they’re not good, delete. You just might get lucky and learn some things in the process.  So, I’m sharing my series that I’ve begun creating (I’ve got dozens, this is just a sample) called “New Zealand From A Car Window”.  All of these photos were taken through the window of a MOVING car. Some, I think, are not too bad.  But I am curious what others think. No, they’re not perfect, but nice all the same."
AmateurPhotography,3548rt,rayzard,2,Wed May 6 23:44:05 2015 UTC,"I thought the first three images were especially strong. Good use of symmetry, and getting up early in the morning. Both of these skills are necessary for good photography. :(  DSLR photography is fun. I have a big huge bulky Canon 5D Mark III. I love it. But remember the old saying: the best camera is the one you have with you. Looks like you do well with the camera that has a small form factor. So you also may want to consider a mirror-less set-up."
AmateurPhotography,3548rt,papatonepictures,2,Thu May 7 00:24:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know what OP's budget looks like, but I wouldn't recommend shelling out three grand for their first camera. They'd probably be better off with a T3i or something similar. Or a mirrorless, as you mentioned."
AmateurPhotography,3548rt,cazlewn156,2,Thu May 7 08:50:45 2015 UTC,"I bought my 5D mk iii for 2k used on eBay. Not pennies, I know. But I wish I had just jumped in and gone full-frame from the beginning. I spent about $800 total on my t2i setup. In the end, it just felt like wasted dough. The only reason I think this photographer might want to start with something more advanced is because I think the work exhibited is solid enough to start with a solid, serious camera."
AmateurPhotography,3548rt,papatonepictures,1 point,Thu May 7 18:49:25 2015 UTC,Thanks man :). I would start with something cheaper and sell it later if I want something better. I don't think DSLRs depreciate too fast so it shouldn't be too much of a waste.
AmateurPhotography,3548rt,crappyboy,1 point,Thu May 7 22:44:52 2015 UTC,I was thinking a Canon100D it's one of the cheapest DSLRs. And a 50mm f1.8 lens. It comes with a 18-55mm lens.

AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,glitter-octopus,2,Tue May 5 02:43:13 2015 UTC,Nice set! Two little things but definitely a solid start.   Second photo it looks like focus is on the nose or mouth when it probably should be on the right eye.  Use a fill flash or a reflector to brighten  your subject when they are in shadow - otherwise great use of the sun as a hair light. It seems like the background is overpowering the subject but i might just hate that style. pop up flash is more than adequate to start out with. Also a light source will give you catch lights in the eyes! Here is the best not very good example I can find at work of fill flash: https://www.flickr.com/photos/ericoak/16460443574/
AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,ambiguouslysizedhawk,1 point,Tue May 5 14:01:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, that is really helpful. I always seem have an issue with focus, I don't know why but I suspect it has something to do with my needing to update my Rx for my glasses Haha! :)   Great suggestion about the pop-up flash, I'll have to give that a try. I didn't want to blow out the natural light so I try to avoid using a flash but it might be worth experimenting with, to your point."
AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,ambiguouslysizedhawk,2,Tue May 5 16:13:14 2015 UTC,Don't worry - I do the same thing with focus all the time. It always seems harder with dynamic shots like that.   Use your flash compensation to avoid over flashing. When I want a natural look I start at -1 then adjust from there. All the flash comp is doing is changing flash power!
AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,papatonepictures,2,Tue May 5 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"I do think the first photo is the best. I would have cropped out that tree trunk upper left, or maybe used content aware fill to get rid of it. It's always good to clear your frame of distractions on the edges when you're actually shooting. In this case, getting your subject to take one small step to her left would have gotten the same image with no extra gunk around the edges.   Definitely start working with reflectors and diffusers and scrims. There's a book called ""Shooting in Shitty Light"" that lays out a lot of these basics. My own photography is very similar to yours...trying to use natural light to good effect. What I'm learning is that hard shadows are the real killers in this kind of photography. In the last backlit photo especially, bouncing just a little bit of light back at her would bring her out and help us see her and put that magical evening golden hour light to work for you.   Photo two is definitely out of focus. Are you using your manual focus points yet? That's a really good thing to know about when you're doing portraiture. Especially when you're shooting at wide apertures.   So. Keep at it. Learn to shape the light. All of my sins are on display here: Papatone Pictures on Flickr. I don't use anything but natural light or small flash, bouncing off walls and reflectors and such."
AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,papatonepictures,1 point,Tue May 5 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is great. Thanks so much, I really appreciate the feedback and the book recommendation!   I probably have to learn a bit more about the manual focus points and how to use them effectively, and I definitely will have to play with the light and shadows more in the future for the best effect.   Your work is great too, thanks for sharing. :)"
AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,papatonepictures,2,Tue May 5 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Of course. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask."
AmateurPhotography,34wdvq,AlGoreLikesHandjobs,2,Tue May 5 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"Oh...and the best illustration of the shadows thing in my own studies so far:  Open sunlight, probably about 3pm.   Open shade, under tree, about 11:30am  Now, these photos were both shot RAW, which helped me make the exposure a little brighter, and were both worked on a bit in Photoshop, which is something no one told me when I was getting started. I would look at people's photos and think, ""Why isn't the skin in my photos softer? Why aren't the colors very good?"" For me, a lot of that comes in post. Some people say they use almost no post at all. But I think, in a lot of cases, they're fibbing."

I would have personally tried knocking down the highlights a bit to see if that revealed some richer colors (if that's your thing, I totally dig how the brighter bits give off a ""Spring"" vibe).   Is it cropped? I know rule of thirds isn't the end-all-be-all, but I'm wondering if there's another way you could have composed it - my eye is drawn to that thin-to-flat blade of grass in the upper left.

AmateurPhotography,34k7ue,captainduncan,1 point,Tue May 5 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is after a pass through Lightroom. Went a bit further than lowering the highlights and tried to sharpen the rain drops since those seem to be what you were focusing on. As far as cropping goes, there wasn't much else you could to with the original that wouldn't remove some interesting content, so I stuck with what you had in the OP. Again, I really like the image you posted. It seems ""fresher"" and more in-line with the season than my edits."
AmateurPhotography,34knjv,CannibalisticZebra87,3,Fri May 1 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"I've learned a cool little trick. Dont' try to shoot the perfect picture in the first place. It is ok if it is tilted a bit or your subject is not perfect in the middle. Shoot your subject with a bit more space around them so you can crop and align them like you want in Light Room, Darktable or any other software.  Oh yea another tip, start editing your RAW files :). It is really helpful to tweak the exposure a bit. Like the second picture. IMO it is a bit to bright. But everyone likes pictures different.  Apart from that, i like your pictures :)"

AmateurPhotography,34knjv,Basanites,2,Sat May 2 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"You could try moving the subjects further away from the background, this generally leads to a smoother background.  Also zooming in a lot will give you a smoother background.  I can only say /u/endless90's tip about RAW proceeding is really good, Lightroom is a beast and can often greatly improve shots.

AmateurPhotography,32z6gh,Colored_Infinity,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a fairly new photographer so whether or not this holds any weight is entirely up to you! In my opinion, the composition and framing of the piece seem fine. I think that more than anything, the editing is what needs work. I like the warmth in this picture, but it seems that the editing may be a little bit heavy - handed. Past a certain point, editing can cause the image to lose finer details, which generally lowers the overall quality of the image. This is especially the case when increasing the contrast in the image. Are you shooting in the RAW or JPEG format? When editing a JPEG, the data that makes up the image does not actually change.  Instead, you're adding filters over top of the original image. If you are shooting in JPEG, my final suggestion would be to switch over to RAW, where the data in the image can truly be manipulated, which helps to maintain image quality and a natural feel. As a whole, I like the photo quite a bit - hope this helps!!"
AmateurPhotography,32z6gh,MyBoyCamus,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:39:44 2015 UTC,I think the saturation is over done. Especially around the bright areas. Increasing saturation and vibrance is always tempting as it instantly looks a bit more eye catching but you end up having unrealistically luminous colours. Try to be a bit more subtle in your edits. It something I often overdo as well.  Looks pretty nice though!
AmateurPhotography,32ze40,forzafreak089,3,Sat Apr 18 00:25:29 2015 UTC,"These are good photgraphs, but just not that interesting. Try to fill the frame more or commit harder to negative space. Also a few of the horizon lines seem off - run these through some simple post processing as next steps."

AmateurPhotography,30lenp,Jeraz0l,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"Well, this could happen but it doesn't mean Flickr sold the pic. A more likely scenario is that some ad company just stole the pic off of Flickr and used it illegally. Happens all the time and if you upload your pics anywhere on the Internet, it's difficult to prevent it. It doesn't have anything to do with Flickr though."

I tried it for a while and preferred Zen' but I think it does come down to personal preference between the two.  I'm pretty sure cost is about the same.  If you only need storage, Amazon's cloud storage is the least expensive for what is basically unlimited space, for which the competition, usually stops at 1TB."

AmateurPhotography,3070cv,gabe2252,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:00:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm was always interested in macro shots but nikon's macro lens are way out of my price range. I'm using some cheap macro tubes i got on amazon and attached them to the 18-55mm Nikon lens kit that came with my camera. With the tubes I can get as close as an inch to my subject and still be able to focus. I didn't use any special technique. Depending on which tubes I use it gives a different focus depth. If I use all three tubes it's very sensitive and a slight depth change things get blurred.

AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,PandaTanner,3,Sat Mar 21 07:00:22 2015 UTC,"My major complaint for many of these is simply sharpness or  a lack of anything interesting in the photo. But, I really like how you regularly have a good foreground to back transition with the right focus and aperture to give the photo depth while still getting detail in all parts of the frame. Keep up and make sure you are checking your images while shooting so you know if they are coming out sharp. Alot of these had stationary subjects that you could have reshot if you gave the picture a good look before moving on. Just keep shooting and enjoying yourself and the photos will improve."
AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,mcopper89,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:51:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I usually tend to keep my F-Stop around 5.6 and my depth of field as far back as it can go, though I've recently heard that it doesn't yield the best results. My aperture can only go up to 8 though, so will I still be able to take sharp shots with that, or should I invest in a camera with a higher aperture?"
AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,mcopper89,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"A dslr is usually the best way to learn photography. A DSLR has interchangeable lens. Each lens has different properties. The lens has the aperture built in the it. The focal length or ""zoom"" is also a property of the lens. If you have the money and you really enjoying photography, a DSLR is a good investment. Brand new they start at about $500, but you can often find gently used ones for cheap on craigslist. A DSLR camera will allow you a lot more control and creativity. Your camera is nice, but it is really meant for someone who just wants to press a button and get a photo."
AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,mcopper89,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:41:27 2015 UTC,"I am using a DSLR, but it's very limited when it comes to manual mode, which is what I always shoot in."

AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,mcopper89,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just using the old dslr that we got about 5 years ago. I wasn't really into photography back then, and I didn't really have a say in the camera anyways. Right now I'm making due with it."
AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,couper_angus,2,Sun Mar 22 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"I would wait till you have the money to get exactly what you want. I got the Canon Rebel T3 before moving to Alaska and it is great, but I wish I would have saved for the Canon 70d so I can take more pictures per second for wildlife photos. I do well with my inexpensive camera and lenses, but the additional frame rate would be a big advantage. That said if you go with Canon or Nikon, they should be comparable, and the differences between cheap and expensive are there and they are important, but just having a dslr is a huge step up from point and shoot and all other steps from there are small in comparison.   Here is my flickr page if you want to have a look at what I shoot. My wildlife set is my pride and joy though. I am an outdoorsy person and I love tracking and watching animals and their behavior."

AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,cobylockkills,2,Sat Mar 21 10:41:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of your horizon lines are crooked. They could easily be straightened in post, or better yet, in camera if you have anything as a reference point to line them up with.  Your colors and white balance look nice. I think your ""meh"" feelings about the black and white are from the values and contrast. The values seem mainly in the middle with little contrast.   What are you shooting with (in regards to your other comment about aperture)?"
AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,peteroh9,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"When I first started I usually adjusted aperture the most and tried to avoid ISO so the photos wouldn't look grainy. I didn't realize that the aperture affected the sharpness when I first started shooting.  I usually try to keep my aperture at 5.6 through 8, my depth of field at about 1/3 of the way down, my shutter speed (for most normal shots outside) between 30 and 100, and my ISO around 100 through 500.  I try to adjust my shutter speed and most commonly my ISO nowadays to compensate for the lighting.  I always used spot metering for my shots, but I didn't really start using it right until those last pictures at Boeing creek park. I try to take a reading off of a neutral subject (such as a patch of grass exposed to sun, not the bright white foamy water) and compensate from there.  I sometimes underexpose my photos a little bit to make it look a bit more saturated too.  White balance is usually on auto but I set it to cloudy to give the Boeing creek park photos a bit warmer of a feel.    If you want me to get the specific specs for a certain photo I can do that.  Edit: Formatting (easier to read, not a big block"
AmateurPhotography,2zsbni,N0T_WH0_Y0U_THINK,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"Ok. I was more wondering about your gear since I was on mobile, but I see now. What was said about waiting, definitely wait and get a camera that will do what you want it to do for a few years before you out grow it. I'm gonna go through your bullet points in order.   I'm assuming by now you understand how aperture changes sharpness/depth of field, etc as well as what the shutter speed and ISO change. You're playing around and trying different things. This is good. Why is the shallow depth of field so important with most of your images? Especially if you're out during the day, f/16 is probably going to do you well.  I think you need to focus more on the balance between the aperture, exposure, and ISO. Certain scenes will call for more specific settings but they all work together. With an older, lower level camera, you're going to lose quality faster the more you increase your ISO. On newer pro cameras, you can crank your ISO up to ungodly levels and still have a salvageable image haha. It seems you're starting to really learn the camera and how the meter can help guide you but isn't your answer. :) Honestly, I would go for a well exposed image, as long as you aren't blowing out the high lights, because then you can save that in post, and just add contrast to really pop the vibrancy. I'm not sure how many different white balance presets your camera has, but I'd try messing around with them one day in different settings to get an understanding of how they change the scene. Same thing with aperture and ISO and then go back and compare them side by side on your computer. Set up a tripod and just go through a bunch of different settings and see what changes? I don't know.   I think the most important thing is to just keep shooting. You'll start to develop your technique with time and practice. There are always good challenges you can give yourself (like pretending that you're shooting film and only have so many shots that you can take (24-36) and within those, really focus on getting the exposure and composition right the first time. Don't delete. Just 24 shots in a row.) Things like that can really help you critically think before shooting.   Sorry for such a long reply lol. I can give more direction if you have questions about specific things."

What dial modes are you using, the scene modes or the P, Av, Tv, M group?  For this photo, it's hard to tell what the original orientation was. Was your cat's head tilted or was that camera tilt?  At 100%, it's clear that the nose is in focus. Are you having your camera automatically select the focus points? The image as a whole appears underexposed; the white looks more gray.

Choose your focal point and put the center dot on it, press halfway, reframe your camera, then shoot.   It's gets faster with time, and cats are great to practice on with them being so twitchy. Use Aperture Priority (Av) mode and set the lowest number you can. Low number = less area in focus. Practice on hard mode."

This looks like it has been taken outside with an artificial light setting.  Difficult subject. By exposing for the cloud, the hills in front of you have been underexposed. Does the hill do anything for the photo? Could you crop off the bottom third or even the bottom half and make the subject the clouds below? Just because thats how you saw it when you took it, doesn't mean you can't crop it and manipulate it in the computer to give it something extra.   Keep up the good work, and keep learning."

AmateurPhotography,2wfyzg,glitter-octopus,6,Thu Feb 19 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"Looks like your white balance is a bit off. May want to cool it down a touch.  Looks like your focus just missed the eye (slightly in front). When shooting at f/2.8, the DOF is so shallow that its really tricky to get  the eye in focus properly.   Composition could be better. You're including a bunch of empty space on the right but you have cut off the cat's ears. Maybe go portrait and fit it all in? If you are gonna leave empty space it should be on the other side. The subject is looking to the left, drawing your eye that way. If the subject isn't looking/moving into the empty space, there isn't a lot of point having it there."

However there is something that doesn't sit right with me about the cloud(ish) thing below him. It seems to have come out TOO faint, which almost makes it look like a blemish instead of something that is supposed to be there.   Possibly you could buff that up some in post. Even then, it's only a minuscule thing that bugs me and I doubt anyone else cares."

AmateurPhotography,2vgl4t,glitter-octopus,4,Tue Feb 10 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, so I spot three things that could be improved / experimented with.  Firstly, that thin perfectly vertical line 'cutting' into the top of your husbands skull. That particular line interacts too much with the subject for:           a. it is differnent from all the other black lines,  making it stand out           b. it greatly intersects your subject (more so than the other two curved lines that also intersect), messing with the natural 'flow' of the image  The other lines around him, especially the rounded ones around the left side of his face and collar, really outline and frame him well adding greatly to the flow.  Secondly the actual pose isn't very interesting, a slight turn of the head or twist of the upper body could make him seem like he belongs in the environment around him and not so much him just looking at the camera. Although having a straight pose like this can work well in plenty of portraits, you should always mess with some variations.  Finally, I think the lighting on his face is a little too even, this may be slightly more of my personal opinion, but making sure that natural shadows are cast upon a subjects face really adds depth, which I feel there could be more of here. Using an angled flash might not be a bad idea to get some shadows going and if you don't have a flash then simply try taking photos with differing angles or times of the day.  Anyway, kinda nit-picky but hopefully helpful, the off-centering of the subject works perfectly for this portrait, I would wonder what a vertical orientation might look like with a background such as this.  Cheers!  Edit: Also try messing around with blurring the background with the subject in focus, I think your choice to have them both in perfect focus works really well, but again experimentation is always a good thing."
AmateurPhotography,2vgl4t,Manofzelego,3,Tue Feb 10 22:42:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thoughtful critique. I will definitely take all of this into consideration next time - now that you mention it I totally see what you mean. Great points. Really appreciate it. :)
AmateurPhotography,2vgl4t,bluzeee,2,Wed Feb 11 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"In addition to other suggestions,  If your husband is the main subject and you don't want background highlighted you can certainly center your husband in the picture.  If you want background too then slight shoulder twist towards the background would look good IMHO.  When shoulder twisted try not to keep too much space on subject behind.   Just a few points I learnt as the beginner I am..."
AmateurPhotography,2vfmau,moooooooots,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:06:30 2015 UTC,Why such a long exposure?
AmateurPhotography,2vfmau,thegianttaco,2,Wed Mar 4 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"For lighting, I was using some regular clamp lights with an incandescent bulb (the kind you can find at home depot). My light meter kept reading that I had to adjust my settings for exposure. At an 8 second shutter speed it was even. I didn't want to adjust the ISO because I wanted minimal noise. Looking back I probably should have just adjusted the aperture.."

AmateurPhotography,2vcqy4,MyBoyCamus,2,Mon Feb 9 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"First off, nice set up (Studio) there. Pics look good. I would have decreased the shutter speed to 1/2000 or so to 'stop' all motion, and make the picture crisp. Also, there is a technique with an external flash that allows you to leave the camera shutter open (bulb) and use the flash as a shutter (as this is the only time light is exposed) if you are in a totally dark room. This gives a new set of problems for photography, but can have awesome results. Though I have not tried it, and can not actually give you guidance as I am a total noob, check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjFfxnMPXU&list=PLD78DF1BFEAAE0C1B&index=1  They do a lot of other interesting vids too, I found."
AmateurPhotography,2vcqy4,Thawp,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I did want to increase the shutter speed, but I feared that I would lose too much of the image quality with the raised ISO. Thanks so much for the feedback though, the video is great!"

AmateurPhotography,2v4fn8,Coyote-Morado,2,Sat Feb 7 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, I am a pretty new photographer so take what I say with a grain of salt. From what I can see, in the second picture there seems to be some slight motion blur. Keep an eye and that and bump the shutter speed up a notch if need be to ensure that the image is frozen. Also, it looks like all of the images were taken from approximately the same angle. So to make things more interesting, it would be great to see some interesting framing or shots taken from various points around the room to capture all of the scene. Finally, they are all taken at the same distance or with the same focal length it seems, so try getting close ups, full bodied shots, etc. Messing with the depth of field could make the shots more interesting. Overall, nice photos! think that mixing things up a little bit more could create a little bit more interest. Keep up the good work my friend, I'd be interested to see future albums of this stuff. Hope I could be of some help!!"

AmateurPhotography,2v4fn8,derGraf_,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:31:35 2015 UTC,All three pictures crop out the guitar's heads. Is that the correct term in English? The part where you tune the guitar is what I mean. The bass player's knee is also weirdly cropped.   The pictures all look kind of cluttered with equipment and odd shadows. Both obviously not your fault but maybe you could have worked around that a little better.  I think experimenting with different angles and focal lengths to put the artists more into the focus of your pictures would improve them quite a bit.

AmateurPhotography,2rul8r,creekj,1 point,Fri Jan 9 11:51:25 2015 UTC,I think I should lower the blacks to add some more contrast between sky and foreground. Any CC would be much appreciated!
AmateurPhotography,2rul8r,ikidu,1 point,Fri Jan 9 12:17:16 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Just discovered this sub. I know your post is a bit older but I figured why not give some CC. First thing I noticed is: love the colors in the sky and the reflection on the ground. Second thing: the horizon is tilted - should be an easy fix in Lightroom (or whatever you use). I did not get what you mean by lowering the blacks to add contrast? I think, the contrast is fine.   I think what you should work on the most is composition. (Same goes for myself actually...) I think the photo lacks a subject. I am not sure what you wanted to show."

AmateurPhotography,2rq8jj,newdoctah,2,Thu Jan 8 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"If you get the chance, I’d recommend that you try taking #3 again without the person; it seems a bit distracting. I’m curious to see what #7 would look like with higher contrast (and maybe lower exposure/brightness), and stuff like #8 is a great place for HDR (if you have a tripod).  edit: I played around with #7 and got this, which is interesting, if not very good."
AmateurPhotography,2rq8jj,ke7ofi,2,Thu Jan 8 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"The original was better, yours look more like a threshold effect with a lot of banding. Maybe you should look into your monitor settings."

AmateurPhotography,2rn9ie,walrusrage1,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:53:25 2015 UTC,It was actually a 10.5mm f/2.8 fisheye. It's grainy because unfortunately I was taking handheld shots earlier and had my ISO cranked up and forgot to take it back down...

Just my two cents"
AmateurPhotography,2rlos4,glitter-octopus,3,Wed Jan 7 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"What was your ISO at? The image seems overexposed and I think I see some noise from a possibly high ISO, so you may have wanted to use a lower ISO to fix both problems. The framing is a good start, as many people like to center things too much when they first start off (though don't be afraid to try centering stuff; sometimes it works!)  The bag on the left provides for a good ""counter-weight"" making neither side of the image seem ""unbalanced"" but the bag isn't all too interesting, which wouldn't be much of a problem if one's eyes' didn't gravitate towards it, mine are.   If you changed the ISO I think you'd have a pretty good one here. I do love the expression you managed to capture on the dane. Keep it up!"

AmateurPhotography,2r2ps0,mjolnr2113,0,Fri Jan 2 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"Tones are good. Composition has major problems. Look at the geometry and lines. You have a corner of the hammock cut off on the right side of the frame. The pillow is too close to the left side of the frame. With a stationary subject, an exercise to try: walk around the subject without looking through the viewfinder (yet). Watch how different objects go in and out of alignment relative to each other in space. See how it looks when you line yourself up square to things. How might this hammock look right down the center?  One book to try is Bryan Peterson's Understanding Composition Field Guide, though loads of other books have been written on just composition in visual arts.  Overall, this is good experimentation."
AmateurPhotography,2r2pxx,mjolnr2113,1 point,Fri Jan 2 05:36:42 2015 UTC,Good time of day for the shot.
AmateurPhotography,2r2pxx,PandaTanner,0,Fri Jan 2 07:59:00 2015 UTC,"Good light and time of day. Compositionally, the roof line is distracting, as it leads out of the frame to the left. The top of the spire is cut off. Trees haphazardly included.  When shooting, pay more attention to the edges of the frame. This would have worked much better as a vertical. For stronger geometry, lining yourself up to the corner would align more of the angular and linear elements in the steeple.  Was this processed at all to bring up the tones in the shadowed side? A S-shaped tone curve could help with this: http://digital-photography-school.com/lightrooms-tone-curve-explained/  Overall, color and light elements are good but composition and vantage point could use work."

AmateurPhotography,2r1jrq,kippa2001,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:33:53 2015 UTC,What was your focal length for this?
AmateurPhotography,2r1jrq,DiversityOfThoughts,1 point,Fri Jan 2 08:12:16 2015 UTC,"It was 10mm, I used the Canon EF-S 10 to 22mm lens.  My camera is a cropped APS-C camera (Canon EOS 7D MK I) and the lens that I used was an EF-S one which is specifically for cropped sensor cameras.  With Canon APS-C cameras you need to multiply the focal length by 1.6 to get the full frame equivalent, so even though I was shooting at a focal length of 10mm,  it would be the equivalent of shooting on a lens with a focal length of  16mm on a full frame camera like the Canon EOS 5D MK III (10mm x 1.6)."

Not overexposed, per se, but it seems a bit flat, lacking depth, because the HDR merge has lost nearly all the shadows. I would have probably tried to keep some areas a bit darker. Not so black that you can't make out details, otherwise what's the point of HDR, but something that gives a bit more differentiation between the different parts of the image still."

AmateurPhotography,2nbk7i,trees138,1 point,Tue Nov 25 01:28:18 2014 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! This was shot with a Canon T3i w/kit lens so I did my best with the DOF. Thanks again!
AmateurPhotography,2nbk7i,Koenigss15,1 point,Tue Nov 25 01:37:15 2014 UTC,Kit lens has nothing to do with it. Others want more DOF. To do this put the dial in Av (aperture priority autoexposure) mode and set it to f11-f22. This will give you more DOF. the higher this number the more light you will need as the hole letting light in will be smaller.
AmateurPhotography,2nbk7i,create_destroy,0,Tue Nov 25 11:55:58 2014 UTC,Think you've got it backwards. Smaller f-number (wider aperture) - more DOF.  http://damienfournier.co/dof-and-aperture/
AmateurPhotography,2nbk7i,Koenigss15,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:31:17 2014 UTC,"I did not say the bigger the aperture. I said the higher the f stop number, the smaller the hole and more dof. f22 is a bigger number  than f2.8. Said it in a way to make it more understandable. Your link shows it nicely."

AmateurPhotography,2nbk7i,bloodyblister,1 point,Tue Nov 25 01:48:18 2014 UTC,"It really depends what sort of photo you were going for.. was it for the bolt and the wood? or were  you trying to do a landscapey type pic?  To be critical (constructive criticism only, not trying to diss on your pic) : the fact that the focal point in so close to the front of the frame, it doesnt draw you into the photo. Shooting it in Aperture priority mode may have give you more detail in the back ground which draws the eye into the photo. If you use Aperture and focus 1/3 into the shot, eg: the next set of bolts in the track, it may have given the rest of the photo more detail and drawn the eye into it.  I shot this one in aperture mode and as you can see it gives a longer depth of field in the foreground but also allows some detail of the background to come through. https://www.flickr.com/photos/121422802@N04/13415742225/in/set-72157642929179224   As stated at the top of comment, it really depends on what you were going for with the shot. I usually try a couple different methods when taking shots and some work and some dont, its all about getting out there and trying the different modes your camera has."
AmateurPhotography,2nbk7i,Gilead262,1 point,Tue Nov 25 03:38:21 2014 UTC,"Please be aware that I am not, in any way, trying to suggest that I know what I'm talking about! I am just going to try to give you my feedback as it occurs to me.   The TL;DR would be: I like the image for several reasons but the blues off to the left hurt the image in the long run.   A more detailed analysis:  Looking at this picture, my knee-jerk reaction is that I like it mostly because of the colors. There is a consistent palette of dark browns, reds, and golds. The counterpoint of the colors in this photo is the whiteness of the sky leading to the vanishing point. However, I think that may be what's bothering me about this picture, too. I see two very different skies in this photo. There is the the white sky that is a part of the vanishing point, but there's also a lot of blue peeking out among the trees to the left of the frame. I find that the blues off to the left of the frame upset the palette a little. Now, I'm pretty sure that is a result of the exposure. The dark colors of the subject and lighting played a role in blowing out the exposure for the sky, I get that, I am not saying that it's your fault for getting something like this perfect but that does stick out to me more simply because of that smattering of blues to the left.  The subject and framing of this photo is great. You've given great balance on both sides of the image with contrasting elements. The railroad tie and the rail itself give weight to the right of frame while the trees to the left offset the subject very well. I, for one, like the DoF because it gives the trees solidarity to offset the subject to the right. I like the idea that the trees look to be a solid mass of greens, browns, and yellows rather than individual leaves and branches a deeper DoF may have given you. Furthermore, I like the way the trees directly above the rail on the right of the frame contribute more of the browns and reds of the railroad and oppose the greens to the left. The white gravel off to the side of the railroad fits in nicely within the image, too.  That said, your composition of this image is very well done. Building on that idea, I really like how nearly every part of this image lends itself to establishing the vanishing point. The lines of the trees, the edges of the railroad ties, the rails themselves, all lead to the same point. I think that the ultimate strength of this image is its composition. Even if you were to remove the colors (which I think are great), you would still have a good image because you took a good subject, framed it well, then used its surroundings to enhance what you perceived as a photo-worthy scene."

AmateurPhotography,2n8cvr,ChefBS,1 point,Sun Nov 30 03:23:59 2014 UTC,"Cloudy, windy day and I was standing on an uneven surface so I needed the fastest shutter that I could pull without upping the ISO any higher to negate camera shake.

AmateurPhotography,2n6ome,Guy_From_Canadia,2,Sun Nov 23 18:44:54 2014 UTC,One rule I always use is the rule of thirds. Where you but the horizon at 1/3 or 2/3 in the vertical of the frame. Also works on the horizontal for objects/subject of pictures. link: http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/  Also having something in the foreground to draw people into the photo is helpful for landscapes. There is a lot of resources online for photography tips with some good explanations/examples.  Google is your friend!

AmateurPhotography,2m4684,blkframejoshua,1 point,Thu Nov 13 12:23:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Camera wise I used the Canon EOS 7D MK I and the lens that I used was the EF-S 10-22mm.  For getting the hdr shots I put the camera in aperture priority mode and did bracketed set of 7 exposures going from -3 stops to +3 stops.  HDR wise I did it post in Photoshop CS5 for two reasons, the first reason is that my old camera doesn't do HDR imaging in the camera and even if it could I would still do it in Photoshop and manually process the image as each hdr shot is different and needs manual tweeking to get the most of it."
AmateurPhotography,2m4684,blkframejoshua,1 point,Thu Nov 13 12:45:24 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the reply.

AmateurPhotography,2ll92b,kippa2001,2,Fri Nov 7 16:22:41 2014 UTC,"I've always wanted to shoot a pic like this. It is the perfect cliche place to play with HDR.     But that white balance. It's way off. If you did all of this work on a computer monitor, you need to calibrate it. I had a similar issue using light room on a laptop. Everything looked great until I shared it on Facebook and saw it on my tablet, phone, and other monitor. I'm assuming you did this all with one machine because you are leaned so heavily into blue that the papers in the pews are blue. This would be a whole new image if you warmed it up to be more natural."
AmateurPhotography,2ll92b,Devildadeo,1 point,Sat Nov 8 05:55:36 2014 UTC,"The problem that I had was that half the place was lit with strong tungsten lights which gave a strong yellow cast and other parts weren't.  I had to choose which direction that I wanted to go so choose a cooler blue over strong yellows.    Cutting a long story short, I have been brushing up on my photoshop skills and have managed to change the cool blue lit areas and make them neutral as possible.  Any chance you could have another look at the re edited photograph and give some possible feedback?"
AmateurPhotography,2ll92b,Devildadeo,1 point,Sat Nov 8 06:48:11 2014 UTC,"That certainly helps. Now that you've got me pixel peeping it, the shadows of the pews on the row accentuate the unevenness of the lighting. You've gone well to get the ceiling as even as you have. Are those columns really that blue? Are the cushions in the pews that color? Play with it all you want. Be careful not to get it all HDRy in the process. Still a neat shot as it is."

Following the theme of Dad’s mantra, ‘Life changes fast, so Make Each Day Count’, my Mom, sister, and I spent the 6 months between diagnosis and death ensuring that all possible laughter, love, energy, and light was made available to him, every day. Along with his enormous network of friends and supporters, we packed every last picogram of life’s marrow into Dad’s last days — he remaining blazingly positive and enthusiastic all the while.  When Dad shifted phases from the physical to the ethereal this summer, my Mom, sister, and I decided to continue living in Dad’s adventurous, ever-shining, ever-grinning spirit. We decided to make a grand adventure of the North American continent, reflecting on a spectacular life while dancing along the roads of a remarkable land mass.   17,000km over 55 days — the 27-foot Winnebago hummed along our circuitous route from Toronto to Calgary by way of Manitoba, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, and British Columbia.

AmateurPhotography,2k1n1u,OM3N1R,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:51:11 2014 UTC,"In the hall to the left there are massive huge windows which let a lot of natural light come in and bounces around the hall, as a result there really aren't any very dark areas.  The reason why I used hdr in this image was that with a standard exposure the windows in the background were blown out.  Out of a single raw you might be able to push details plus or minus 1 stop but not realistically 2 stops.  I needed the under exposed -2 stop exposure to capture the detail in the windows which I couldn't get in a single exposure or even in a -1 stop exposure.  If it weren't for the windows, I wouldn't have used hdr at all.  I have created an image which shows you the difference between the standard exposure and the -2 stops exposure to give you an idea what the difference was and why I used hdr in this instance : http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/296/0/2/underexposure_by_kippa2001-d83ud87.jpg"

AmateurPhotography,2jcs1f,TevoKJ,2,Wed Oct 15 21:04:05 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, there hasnt been a noticeable increase in image quality at low iso since the t2i, so going out and getting the newest rebel, the t5i, doesnt make an enormous difference. I would look more towards a used 60d or 7d. Not the newest or most expensive, but definitely high image and build quality. Spend your money on lenses, not bodies. Look at the 50mm f1.8 or 'nifty fifty' as a good walk around lense, or the 28mm f1.8 for that matter. Both have great image quality and good low light performance, which alleviates the need for stellar high iso performance. Couple those prime lenses with a a telephoto zoom and a wide zoom and youve got everything you need. But if it were up to me, id take my old kit, the t2i and the 28mm f1.8. Ive since upgraded to a 6d and some L glass and honestly from a quality stand point my images havent vastly improved. Im just a little bit of a gear whore."

Some people would use speed lights in different areas and expose for the windows. Some use HDR.  If you have light room, look into exposure fusion. Its like Hdr, but without that weird look.  Photomnatrix is another program to check out.  When I shoot homes,  I use a tripod with a shutter release and exposure bracketing. A wireless flash generally pointed at the ceiling \wall joint, and then ran through the exposure fusion add on in light room."

AmateurPhotography,2j18k7,Bananabob132,1 point,Sun Oct 12 15:57:37 2014 UTC,Not sure if i overdid the coloring on the middle box. Any (constructive) criticism would be really helpful.
AmateurPhotography,2j18i4,donownsyou,7,Sun Oct 12 15:56:59 2014 UTC,"Dude, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much saturation"
AmateurPhotography,2j18i4,AWildAnonHasAppeared,3,Sun Oct 12 18:35:55 2014 UTC,"Well first off, I'm sorry you got hurt. Hope you're okay. Second, I'm sorry, but Jesus your saturation is insane. Its like a bad acid trip. Tone it down a bit."
AmateurPhotography,2j18i4,ender323,1 point,Sun Oct 12 16:26:02 2014 UTC,Saturation is killer. Looks like you have over applied other effects too as all details are lost. The sky also looks blown on the right.

AmateurPhotography,2ixh2h,InCalgary,1 point,Sat Oct 11 07:19:27 2014 UTC,I'd love to get some feedback on this one.
AmateurPhotography,2it914,gmc3101,1 point,Fri Oct 10 00:41:43 2014 UTC,Kind of surreal looking because the Orange/red foliage is not muted while everything else is muted as if seen through a haze. I don't know if the effect was intentional or not.
AmateurPhotography,2it914,Chazzzor,1 point,Fri Oct 10 01:46:13 2014 UTC,Yes it was intentional. I idea was to emphasize the colorful leaves.
AmateurPhotography,2it914,phr0ze,1 point,Fri Oct 10 02:41:43 2014 UTC,I like it. 3 of the corners are dark. I'd apply a little darkening to the last corner just to reenforce the subject.
AmateurPhotography,2im36x,BluePhilly1,2,Wed Oct 8 00:27:15 2014 UTC,"Good start... you need to drop the exposure down, be sure to shoot with a tripod, and always level your photo with the horizon unless you have a creative reason to do otherwise.  Shots of moving water are 'generally' more impressive with long exposures.  For a shot like this, I'd have made two to three bracketed exposures so that I could have both the dark foreground and the bright background exposed properly. Takes work, but the results are worth while."
AmateurPhotography,2im36x,SCphotog,1 point,Wed Oct 8 13:11:29 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Right now I'm currently using a cheap camera but I do plan on saving up for a better one as well as a tripod.
AmateurPhotography,2im36x,SCphotog,1 point,Thu Oct 9 03:36:34 2014 UTC,"Right on. Cheap isn't a big deal. As long as the camera has manual control, you can really learn how to operate any camera.  ISO, Shutter speed and Aperture.  Get a grip on those three things, and you've begun."
AmateurPhotography,2ij9ej,InCalgary,5,Tue Oct 7 06:34:13 2014 UTC,"Too much HDR, be very subtle if you are to add an HDR treatment to your pictures."
AmateurPhotography,2ij9ej,maakuz,2,Tue Oct 7 11:13:44 2014 UTC,Maybe a little too much clarity too. You can see haloing around the sign.
AmateurPhotography,2ij9ej,IGrowAcorns,1 point,Tue Oct 7 23:16:08 2014 UTC,Well it's the haloing that's giving the bad HDR away.

AmateurPhotography,2hkbs7,gmc3101,1 point,Fri Sep 26 21:27:35 2014 UTC,i like the contraposition of the cloud/water/sidewalk textures - maybe bump up the contrast slightly to enhance the texture of the cloud?
AmateurPhotography,2hkbs7,tsultrim,1 point,Sat Sep 27 15:15:39 2014 UTC,Thanks for the input.
AmateurPhotography,2hkbs7,juscallmejjay,1 point,Sat Sep 27 15:57:29 2014 UTC,very awesome nice find
AmateurPhotography,2hiju8,vmax77,1 point,Fri Sep 26 09:55:32 2014 UTC,"Very nice! There's a nice, relaxing mood in the photo. The only thing that bothers me is that there's too much of ""nothing"" in the photo. I would have considered taking this photo in portrait mode. Just my two cents :)"
AmateurPhotography,2hiju8,hardypart,1 point,Fri Sep 26 12:54:58 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Now that I look at it, I have to agree with you. There is too much blurring on the background. The background is actually a quite nice stone wall with lot more texture. I might give another shot at it :)"
AmateurPhotography,2hib3y,InCalgary,1 point,Fri Sep 26 07:05:47 2014 UTC,"Dunno why you got down voted... I like it,  although I would crop out the blue framing on the left to make it more even."
AmateurPhotography,2hib3y,OM3N1R,1 point,Fri Sep 26 14:48:55 2014 UTC,Hey thanks! and yeah I agree with you on that count now that I've had time to think about it.
AmateurPhotography,2h5e1e,en2ropy,1 point,Mon Sep 22 18:26:26 2014 UTC,"Taken last Friday (22nd Sept.) at around 3.30am whilst I was camping in West Witterings, near Chichester, UK.  I'm a very amateur photographer, usually only taking pictures when I go abroad on holiday. This took my completely by surprise, considering I propped the camera up using the neck of a tequila bottle and forgot to use the timer (hence the slight blur, which is really annoying).  Details:  Nikon D3100  f/3.5  30 second exposure  18mm focal length  Shot in Fine (JPEG)  Small post processing on paint.net - hue increase, increased saturation, sharpening and slight brightness reduction."
AmateurPhotography,2h5e1e,Manofzelego,1 point,Mon Sep 22 18:30:22 2014 UTC,"The composition isn't bad and the color gradients are nice, but what was your ISO setting? To me, It looks like you had a very high ISO sensitivity when you took the photo causing lots of noise in the darker regions and then when you increased the saturation / sharpness you only made the noise more predominate. I would suggest setting your ISO to something below 1600 and either widening your aperture (if your lens supports it) or just use a longer shutter speed (or both)."
AmateurPhotography,2h5e1e,derGraf_,1 point,Tue Sep 23 13:41:11 2014 UTC,"My aperture was as wide as I could get it, and my shutter speed was as long as I could make it without a bulb (30 seconds). ISO had to be high - this was taken with a d3100, very much an entry level camera and as such the sensor is quite small. I think ISO was around 1600, can't remember off the top of my head. Any lower and I lost the detail as it was too dark. For the camera that it was I'm happy, but I agree with the ISO comment."
AmateurPhotography,2h5e1e,derGraf_,0,Tue Sep 23 13:50:20 2014 UTC,This hurts my eyes.
AmateurPhotography,2h5e1e,BlueEyed_Devil,2,Tue Sep 23 12:10:10 2014 UTC,"As I said, I'm as amateur as you can get with photography. Perhaps you can offer some constructive criticism instead?"

AmateurPhotography,2gu3rm,Coyote-Morado,1 point,Fri Sep 19 05:27:52 2014 UTC,I was bored the other evening so I went out to play with extended exposures. I was using a cheap dinky table top tripod. I didn't think I would get anything usable but came up with a few nice shots.
AmateurPhotography,2gi726,Coyote-Morado,1 point,Mon Sep 15 22:50:35 2014 UTC,Nice use of DOF but the subject is rather bland.
AmateurPhotography,2gi726,OM3N1R,1 point,Tue Sep 16 03:36:41 2014 UTC,"I really like this photo, partially because lately I've had an obsession with triangles, and this photo has plenty! I also like the texturing on the rocks, the focus seems really good on those the only weird thing is the foremost shadow seems a bit unnatural, but that's pretty nitpicky of me."

AmateurPhotography,2gfv6f,ender323,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:26:22 2014 UTC,"Its not bad, but composing the foreground better (with leading lines towards the sun, for example) would have improved it. If you want a DSLR, just start with a used T3i or something from the D3000 series and a kit lens."

AmateurPhotography,2gboky,Andhareall,1 point,Sun Sep 14 15:24:07 2014 UTC,No retouching at all. Its due to the angle of the sun and the milkweed seeds reflecting the light off of their fluffs
