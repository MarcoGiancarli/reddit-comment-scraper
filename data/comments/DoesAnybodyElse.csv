So, I called my gyno, thinking it was a common thing but, they had never heard of such a thing and did an ultra sound just to be sure everything was copacetic, which it was.  Eventually, the vibrations became too much and I insisted the IUD be removed.  Unfortunately, that was not the end of the vibrations and I eventually had to have a new IUD put in (I have a bleeding condition)...I still get them, just not as bad now.

I think the reason may romanticize the old eras is because it's simply something new. It's so old it's new again. We are used to the things we have today so we sometimes don't see them as fascinating.   Tell someone 60 years ago that we are on the brink of having cars drive themselves. Or that consumers can buy cars that don't use gas at all. Sure the first electric car was made in 1890 and many since but nowhere near as widespread and advanced as the ones we have today. Electric cars are a common thought when looking at cars now' days.   Tell someone in 1950's that we have people flying to space like it ain't no thang. Then tell them that when it does happen in the future peoples reactions to sending a man in space is ""... Again?"" as if it bores or disinterests them.   Tell someone just 30 years ago that in their pocket, in one device they can store every album they ever wanted, make phone calls, plan meetings, video chat and text and game with anyone in the world. You can strike up a convo with a fellow in China on a whim. The fact that I'm typing this on my phone and yet here you are reading it while sitting somewhere else in the world. You can play a movie on your computer and stream it to any TV in yopur house with a $30 device. In YOUR mind you go ""Oh yea a chromecast... Whatevs"" but 30 years ago this would have blown fucking minds.   That's just tech advancement. What about historical events?  9/11. Most of us on this site were around to witness the events of 9/11. Sure it was a tragedy %100. But so was WWI and WWII yet people still romanticise how cool it would have been to be alive then for all the events that happened. If you are old enough to witness 9/11 attacks then you witnessed a global historical event that your grandchildren will be learning about in history books then coming home to ask you about what it was like to be alive then.   The first black president. Just hop in your time machine, stroll the fuck out into any region of the US lets say... pre-1980 (The further you go back the more stunned the response) and say ""I'm from the future"". When they ask ""What's the future like"" you say ""Black dude is president man!"" Then just watch. Wear a raincoat because it will be like a Gallagher show and their heads will literally  explode (Head explosion only applies to 1800's and further).  I find this era FASCINATING.

Wipe once from back to front and fold in half. Second wipe is more of a pinch. I use my fingers to begin wiping back to front but stop just over anus, then use my thumb to wipe front to back, pinching much of the remainder. The pinch naturally folds the tp in half again. The final wipe is all thumb from front to back. I repeat only if the final wipe shows any residue, but majority of the time it is clean.  I don't try this if the first wipe is heavy or too moist. So use discretion. Also, folding can be scary. I adjust folds by the tips of the tp to ensure no dirty sections re-contact my bottom. I also wash my hands EVERY TIME I USE THE WASHROOM, so even if a fleck of shit ever did graze a finger, I'd happily scrub it clean with soap and water til it bleeds.  I have found this to be exceptionally efficient in both clean up and use of tp. This is also the first I have ever divulged my cleaning process...I hope it helps any of you reading this to save  a few trees while also saving you some money.

Identify broad areas you are interested in and start consuming content (books, videos, documentaries, articles) You will begin to identify what you are interested in and the more you consume the more it makes sense. But remember to be critical about everything you consume - I think it is important to work with your own hypothesis, even though they are wrong, they act as a scaffold for your knowledge.  Then find people you can discuss with, remember discussion should not be about big dick, it should be about verbalising arguments, defend them until you realize you are wrong and cherish that you have just become more enlightened!

DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,4dicus,2,Sun Jul 19 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"I assume this is what people with (too) many friends do: they don't realize that an individual friendship is suffering, because they are kept busy by a larger pool that picks up the slack."
DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,nullibicity,15,Mon Jul 20 10:43:22 2015 UTC,"As somebody who values his alone time a lot more than others, I don't message my friends as often as others might, but this isn't because I don't like them. I do enjoy hanging out with them, but I find solace being alone and I'm just not willing to allocate the same amount of time they are to hanging out. I know that can come off as somewhat selfish, but that's totally not the intention. Maybe your friends are in the same situation (you can kind of tell whether they're 'ignoring' you or they just like being alone by talking to mutual friends/following their fb activity and whatnot). So don't always assume the worst!"
DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,SimplyPure,4,Sun Jul 19 05:44:31 2015 UTC,"I'm with you here, I'm worried my friends hate that I almost never initiate. It isn't that I hate my friends, it's just that I'm an introvert by nature. By the time I feel the urge to hang out with my friends again after a get-together, there's a real high change that the other party will feel that urge first."
DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,Vitefish,2,Sun Jul 19 06:28:53 2015 UTC,I'm an introvert with anxiety.. I often worry about how to respond to my friends' invitations so much that days will go by before I get back to them. Reciprocating friendly gestures can be difficult for some. Op's frustration is understandable though. It's easy to mistake the silence for lack of care.
DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,nutmegpancake,10,Sun Jul 19 09:00:21 2015 UTC,"This is pretty normal. Nobody ever wants to be the first to plan anything, or be the first to reach out, and then months and years go by. This is how friendships die. But passive neglect feels better than active betrayal, so there's that."
DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,nullibicity,4,Sun Jul 19 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what happened with me and my best friend. We're both rather introverted. Well he wasn't always like that. In high school he was so outgoing, it's the only reason we became friends in the first place, but for whatever reason I was the only friend he kept. We used to hangout all the time at first. Then it became every weekend, then every other weekend, and then once a month. Moving an hour away was pretty much the nail in the coffin. At first I made the effort to drive down their and hangout, I don't do well with change so the hour drive was worth going back to what I still considered home. Eventually I became accustomed to my new surroundings and made some new friends. I tried to get him to come to me instead for a change but to no avail, only empty promises. I was a little fed up with him and tried giving him the cold shoulder for a while but he continuously tried keeping up with me through txt, which is our preferred method of communication by the way since we both hate talking over the phone, and eventually I just got over it. I went down to visit him a few more times after that but it just didn't feel worth it anymore, wasting all that gas and time just so I could sit around his house, watch videos, and play videogames. I could do that with friends that lived much closer to me after all. I suppose he might have realized that himself and stopped inviting me over or maybe he was just bored with me, Idk. Eventually we just stopped keeping up with each other. I think its been about 7 months now. Last time I heard from him he had broken up with his girlfriend and was hanging out with his high school crush, who has a boyfriend. He told me how he was going on a month long trip to Japan with her and invited me but I just couldn't come up that much money by then. I don't remember exactly what I said to him but it was something along the lines of me thinking he dumped his gf for his old crush and that he was just gonna end up hurt, which I'm sure didn't at all help our dying friendship. I believe this was the month they were to go on their trip. I kinda want to know how the trip is going or if he even went, but something is keeping me from contacting him...  Man I gotta say it feels good actually typing down a reply instead of just spending like ten minutes thinking it for a change, or typing it and then hitting cancel. I'm sure my grammar is atrocious, my punctuation to be precise. I was never good at writing unfortunately. :/  Thanks for reading to anyone that bothered tho. :)"

DoesAnybodyElse,3dsfmh,nullibicity,2,Mon Jul 20 10:52:43 2015 UTC,"Very well said. A friendship takes work just like a marriage. The other person could be thinking the same exact thing on the other end. If no one initiates, the friendship slowly dies."

But if you're always the one initiating the conversations and meet ups, then you're ""not important enough"" to that friend to make an effort to keep in contact with. I have friends in my phone that I haven't spoken to in a very long time cause they never text me (without me texting first), and after I while, I just delete their numbers.

I'm the ""glue"" type person of my social groups, but my friends actually call and text to see what I'm up to. Not everyone is good at making plans; I am.

But yup, there are those people who never, ever contact you and won't talk to your for months unless you text them first. Funny, but one of my old best friends was like that, and I only noticed her behavior after I found other friends (I was kind of a loser with no friends lol). I let our friendship die but she randomly contacts me every year or so, and asks my friends how I'm doing. I guess I was a ""backburner"" friend, a friend she needed for when she was bored and her other friends were busy. Sorry, just ranting now, haha! But people show their true colors eventually. Just gotta be aware enough to see them."

This happened right when I divorced, she had no idea the dark place I was in and has been there for me ever since.   But other than her, no ones been real loyal.

Others just blamed her for problems reddit has had since the beginning. A lot of it was also just flat out sexism. Before I was hesitant to recommend reddit to friends...now I'm really hesitant."

The best way I find in dealing with the sometimes crippling anxiety, is to always remember that no one goes home thinking about you, they do not care about you or what you have done or the decisions you have made. you are not present in peoples mind as much as you think you are. You are one fragment in one huge fractured piece of glass.  Of course there are times where this mind frame is not relevant, when you have really fucked up and you should plan recourse. But most of the time your feelings are completely the object of your own mind. I like to meditate for about 10 minutes on a subject I am feeling anxious about and realize these things are completely nonsense and the next passer by does not give one single fuck about you or the actions you take in your day to day life.  This way of thinking has allowed me to get over my fears and start my own business which is going great!  Dont be worried about the small things and use the time worrying and turn in into a positive experience for yourself."

DoesAnybodyElse,3djlvj,C_IsForCookie,28,Fri Jul 17 06:05:51 2015 UTC,"I wish I could comment individually to everyone in this thread. I have severe OCD (it runs in my family) and when I was younger anxiety pretty much controlled my life. Medicine helped ""dial back"" the anxiety enough for me to re-engage in work and school and start taking control of my anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (1 on 1) helped me overcome the severity of my OCD and reinforce new, more adaptive connections in my brain whilst letting the maladaptive pathways grow old and dusty from disuse. Surrounding myself with supportive friends and family has meant that minor relapses don't seem so catastrophic, and I have the safety net I need but am not overly coddled to the point of regressing.   Finally, life circumstances completely beyond my control (or anyone else's) have taught me some pretty dramatic lessons about what is really catastrophic in life and what isn't, which has helped me relax more than anything else. To summarize it briefly, the thing that so many people with severe anxiety fear actually happened to me: I became suddenly and very severely ill. For the first couple of years I was bounced from specialist to specialist and had dozens of tests (and even a couple of surgeries) because no one could figure out exactly what was going wrong. Here I am almost a decade later, with a feeding tube, a central IV line, a wheelchair, a medical alert service dog, nurses visiting me at home one to three times a day, ... and probably the happiest I've been in my entire life, overall. That's really what I want to share with all of you. I hope you can take it to heart. Life is beautiful and amazing. Even when scary, awful, horrible things happen and it feels like the sky is falling, it really really is true that it will all be okay in the end. We are phenomenally adaptive creatures and you CAN find a way to be happy no matter what obstacles come along.   Anxiety sucks. Get help. Talk to your doctor. If they don't listen, fire them and get a new doctor. Keep looking for help. Tirelessly pursue a better life that isn't controlled by anxiety, because that life is out there and YOU DESERVE IT!   I'm bedridden so I'm online a LOT, haha. PM me anytime. <3"

The other day I realized that a bill was trying to withdraw from my bank account 3 days earlier than I planned. I found it after it had tried to withdraw for two days straight. That was 50 dollars in NSF fees, plus the fact that this payment kept bouncing. It was 9:00pm at night when I finally saw it. Old me would go into a straight up panic attack that wouldn't stop for hours. And to be honest? I still did for a moment. I had my moment to panic. Holy shit that's a lot of NSF fees. Oh my god are they going to call the dealership I bought the car from and tell them I'm not making my payments? Fuck fuck fuck.  But after that moment... That horrible, panic stricken moment, I breathed. It's 9:00pm. What can I do right now? Nothing. There's nothing I can do at the moment. What can I do? I can go to the bank tomorrow morning and deposit some cash. I can call the bank I have the loan with and deal with the situation. I can do that. But can I do it now? No. So I can't panic now. There's no point in panicking now.   So I calmed down, and I went to sleep. The next morning I dealt with it.  I feel like such a grown up, but really it just took me a long time to get a handle on my anxiety. There's no use in panicking over something that cannot be fixed in that moment."

There is a certain pride when your child does everything you have and more, and did it better. You've given them better than you had and their success is a light to your own. To many parents feel threatened by their kids or held down, when in reality our only real mark in this world will be our children.

So your posts says more about where you do your shopping than it does about general prices for t-shirts in Sweden. You may not buy the expensive stuff, but you certainly don't buy the cheap stuff.  But that is also a point, Sweden is generally a lot more fashionable than most other countries. So it might be more common that people buy things a bit more expensive clothes here."

I usually do my shopping at NK (Which is expensive compared to regular places) but now and then i find some good quality t-shirts at normal stores too. Actually buy T-shirts and shirts from MQ now and then and the t-shirts are from 200kr (22usd) and up if you want some kind of brand and design.

I'm Pro Guns, pro choice, pro gay marriage, anti Obamacare, I'm all for isolationism, I think we should get out of the Middle East and work on our own country. I'm anti large welfare, I'm against illegal aliens but all for making citizenship easier to attain. I think we should end the war on drugs. I mean I'm all for your own choice, I get called heartless sometimes. For instance if you want to go do drugs that's perfectly fine with me, you do you, but don't expect my sympathy when you overdose. If you want to go 100mph down an empty road then go ahead but when you crash into a telephone phone don't  expect my sympathy. If you want to smoke and you get sick from it don't expect my sympathy. I'm against banning things because one other person did something stupid. My views vary I believe both republicans and democrats have it wrong.   The true nature of the U.S. Was to be set up to have the states be self sufficient and make their own laws based off what THEIR citizens vote for. The Federal Governments job was to make sure the nation was safe from outside forces, and to make sure the states are keeping things constitutional. The Feds were supposed to be nothing but a checks an balance type of system for state law. This is actually what the real reason for the Civil War was. People these days are brainwashed by the media (both sides) and can't think for themselves they'd rather align themselves with a specific party and vote based on their party line which is sad.

I'll make ""the move"" to swim, but then by the time I can make it again, my legs are already falling to the ground and I'm suddenly standing.

I never had an outtie and then I had a tubal ligation.  After it healed I was an outtie.  I didn't really mind, but I also didn't know it was a hernia.  I was putting heavy boxes away at work one day and felt a gross popping sensation.  Went to the ER they scheduled me for surgery the next day.  They put like a mesh inside your stomach and the muscle wall grows around it like a trellis and then your guts stay inside.    edit: fixed ""any"" to ""an"" cause that's actually what I'd meant to say."

When I lifted that box that caused the ""pop"" it wasn't pain really, it was more so extra discomfort and very gross sensation.  Like if you've ever had a joint pop funny and it doesn't hurt but you know it's not right or it's weird and not normal.    Sorry I wish I could explain better, all I remember is being grossed out and wanting to vomit at the sensation.

To  avert the horrors of corrievorrie (q.v.)  corriecravie  is  usually employed.  This is  the cowardly  but  highly skilled process by  which both protagonists continue to  approach while keeping up the  pretence that  they haven't noticed each  other - by staring furiously at  their feet, grimacing into  a notebook, or studying the  walls  closely  as if  in a mood of  deep irritation.  CORRIEDOO (n.)  The crucial moment of false  recognition in a long passageway encouter. Though  both people  are perfectly well aware that the other is approaching, they must eventually pretend  sudden  recognition. They now look up  with  a glassy smile, as if having spotted  each other for the  firt  time, (and are particulary  delighted to have done so) shouting  out 'Haaaaaallllloooo!' as if to say 'Good grief!!

The dreadful sinking sensation in a long passageway encounter when both protagonists immediately realise they  have plumped for the corriedoo (q.v.) mutch too  early  as  they  are  still a good thirty yards apart.  They were embarrased by the pretence of corriecravie (q.v.) and decided to make use of the corriedoo because  they felt silly.  This was a mistake as  corrievorrie (q.v.) will make them seem far sillier.  CORRIEVORRIE (n.)  Corridor  etiquette  demans  that  one  a  corriedoo  (q.v.)  has  been declared,  corrievorrie  must  be  employed.   Both  protagonists  must  now embellish  their  approach  with  an  embarrassing  combination  of  waving, grinning, making  idiot faces, doing  pirate  impressions,  and waggling the head from side to side while  holding the other person's  eyes  as the smile drips off their face, until with great relief, they pass each other.

Each restaurant has a reverse osmosis filter providing some of the best water available. McDonald‚Äôs sells a lot of Coke. They sell so much coke that they don‚Äôt need to buy the syrup in the small bag box, like many coke retailers. McDonald‚Äôs restaurants get syrup delivered from a tanker truck and store it in a stainless steel cylinder. Because they sell a lot, it doesn‚Äôt sit around as long. Thus, the Coke syrup at McDonald‚Äôs is fresher than their competitors. McDonalds controls freshness by cleaning everything daily. Letting syrup sit in hoses and machines allows it to chemically degrade and for bacteria to grow."

That hurt in the days of cd wallets lovingly schlepped from classroom to classroom and cd players that just startedplaying track one automatically. I guess kids these days don't know the joy of knowing exactly what the first second of the album sounds like (and nothing more) until the song of their choice. I remember the very beginning of Siamese Dream and Garbage and Seal's album, and Floored, and Mellow Gold, and Marcy Playground, and Natalie Imbruglia's album to this day because the hit songs were not track 1."

The Unraveling (sic) was also amazing. I was so happy to fill that void in my angsty teenage years. This was just after RPM was released so it was a while until they released Siren Songs. When they released it, I had it on pre-order. As soon as it turned up, I chucked that shit straight into my CD player to bask in more venomous, angry punk songs.

The rest of ""Oracular Spectacular"" was dope so I bought ""Congratulations"" when it came out. This album sounded completely different and I didn't like it at first. Then I had an ever growing fixation with the song ""Siberian Breaks"" and the rest of the album just clicked for me.   Then I bought their self titled album and AGAIN I'm like ""wtf MGMT just when I thought I had you figured out!"" But I learned my lesson from ""Congratulations"" and forced my self to re listen and fell in love with the song ""A Good Sadness"". God damn such a good song, and the rest of the album clicked for me AGAIN.  Funny thing is, now I don't even like ""Kids"" like I used to... or OS as an album. I actually find it subpar to their new stuff. OS also brings up old memories, both good and bad for me. When the album came out and I was rocking it nonstop; I was young and alive and wild, living in a foreign country, but also went through what I thought was an everlasting relationship but it ended horribly and abruptly. Bad times come with the good, I guess that's how life is.  Even funnier, nowadays anytime I have friends in the car my phone is on shuffle. If an OS song hits the speakers they're all ""ooh I know this song! MGMT right? I like them!"" But when a song from any of their other albums comes up next they have never heard it. I feel bad for them because I went through such an amazing journey listening to this band throughout the years and I feel like a fucking hipster for thinking OS is too mainstream for this awesome band.  I challenge all of you to dig into this band, they bring a unique sound to every one of their albums and invoke all kinds of feels."

Especially since at first one of them tried to be oh so funny.

When I was a kid and into my teens, I used to sleep all rolled and wrapped up like a burrito in an old quilt my grandmother made, nothing else.   Then in my early 20's I took a two week trip and stayed in a hotel for those two weeks. That spoiled me to a nicely made bed complete with top sheet. I discovered I actually really liked the top sheet and not being all wrapped up like a burrito. So when I got home, I busted out the top sheet and began to make my bed with that and that old trusty quilt.   Then we moved and my bedroom was horribly drafty, especially during the winter. I live in Mississippi where our summers could choke you and our winters can be bitter and freezing. I began piling blankets on my bed during the winter. The top sheet, old trusty quilt, then an afghan my mother had crochet me some years ago, and when that wasn't enough, when I learned to crochet, I crocheted myself this huge heavy blanket.   Now I sleep under all of that because it's freezing in here in the winter and the air conditioning unit blows right across my bed in the summer. Besides, I enjoy that weight when I sleep.   For me to sleep well, I need all those layers - the weight of them - and while my bed doesn't need to be made to perfection, when I cover up, the blankets and sheet needs to be straight. The top sheet needs to be tucked in at the bottom.   I'm a monster, I know."

Back in the day when you sewed your quilts out of feed sacks and old clothes, and money was rare, you hand made quilts. Hand sewn quilts were precious and could not be washed easily, whereas a top sheet could. The top sheet provided needed protection for the quilt from dirty feet, bodies and sharp toe nails. The sheet also provided more comfort as the quilt may have been scratchy or stiff depending on the material you used. The top sheet still provides comfort or protection to the quilt, but most of us sleep under blankets or comforters that can be cleaned easier than hand made quilts, therefore a top sheet may not be needed."

Simple, functional, doesn't get wrapped up all over the place... it just makes more sense. You stick an apendage or two out from under the blanket to regulate temperature. Right now I sleep in a cold weather sleeping bag, and I just stick things out after the sun starts beating down in the morning. Works fine. I will say if it's super hot and also humid where you live, first off you should move, but in those cases I use just a top sheet instead of a blanket to give me the illusion of protection and soak up some of my sweat."

She'd found out quite early on and seemingly rushed to make a status, not considering most people hadn't even found out yet. She wasn't even family, to his family she was just a girl he worked with, and she was the first person to put something on his page about his death.

And typing comments on my keyboard is way faster than my god damn onscreen keyboard. At least 300% faster for me and more accurate. I only browse mobile when I'm on the can and I rarely comment in that mode. Although if you look at the length of some of my comments you might realize why I need desktop editor...

Have you actually tried the app? my friend did and instantly agreed with me.  I've used the browser version and I find the text too small, navigating to a particular sub long winded (compared to app) and most of all, its just plain awkward having to zoom in everytime I want to click something.  tl;dr My phone makes the browser site hard to use when compared with an app."

The only feature I miss from BaconReader is how it was only possible to have one comment's alternatives showing at any given time. While I am at it I also feel as though the cards display option could be a bit slimmer, inbox should be quicker to get to and it should be a swiping gesture to hide posts.   It is, however, overall better than BaconReader and can become even more so if they add more options for customisation Thank you for referring me, my life has ended and I am reborn.   Edit: I am just now noticing that it does not come with a widget. This is kind of disappointing as I used BaconReader's widget to always show new posts in a certain sub and will now have to maintain usage of both apps so that I can keep this widget. Hopefully they will get an accompanying widget soon."

Should have been dead, and it keeps happening...   I make a point of doing things and going places I really can't afford to see and do things i really can't afford cause I just expect most tomorrow's to be my last tomorrow.  I've setup a poor man's will,  (mailed it to myself. The stamp can act as a legal seal. Sometimes. I keep it in a fire and waterproof safe. I have some valuable things, but my family is relaxed and wont kill and eat each other for my junk), with all my wishes for my financial possessions and sentimental keepsakes, as well as plans for organs, leftover body, and memorial.  My mother and sister will get my life insurance if i die. They'll pretty much split up the money between my nephew and neice, and maybe my brother, as needed. They won't fuck around with that money, which gives me peace of mind.   I've setup an ifidie.org account to pass messages and pertinent information to loved ones. I've written incredible messages to my loved ones telling them all the things I want to make sure they know, and the few things I just don't have the gonads to tell them yet. I've even written notes for a few ""enemies"" to let them know I forgive them any trespasses, even if I really don't.   I've kept journals for years with my thoughts and photos and GPS points and drawings and memories and all the information you'd need to backtrack all the amazing (and totally mundane) places I've been. That's mostly for my Father. He's the one I know will want to make a trip out of those journalings just to be that much closer to dead me. He'll need that to heal. And I enjoy knowing he will go on such a trip.  I leave for a month long trip through parts of the South Pacific in... 29 days, (just cause). I have genuine fears that I won't won't live to make the plane flight... And if I do, then that I won't survive at leat one of the plane flights...

What I did was deleted every single person I don't consider at least a acquaintance and kept people that I've at least talked to once.  I sit at 200 friends or so currently.  I then proceeded to remove any kind of notifications from facebook that I get via email or my phone or anything else.  I removed as much stupid 'teenage blunder year' photos and posts as possible and deleted all of my cookies of facebook.  And then proceeded to become addicted to reddit so I easily forget about it.  I hop on there every couple months just to look around and shit.  I think this is one of the best methods of using it.

DoesAnybodyElse,3cpjyh,JorusC,-3,Fri Jul 10 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"Here's my reason: I visited a couple of suggested profiles to see if I knew the person, or at least see about the mutual friends it claimed we had. When I went to one profile, it turned out to be a bunch of risque pictures, so I closed it without clicking anything.  I got a text from a friend ~15 minutes later asking what was up with my account. I checked my profile, and my account had started posting and commenting on porn pictures.  There was no permission given, nothing clicked to hand of my account control to this other user. Facebook simply sold control over my account of an advertiser. That's why it always pops up with like Tide Pods and tells you how all your friends Liked them; Tide bought the rights to control their accounts.  I've worked with children a lot in the past, so I have a bunch of kids on my account. Even if I did deliberately go look at porn, Facebook does NOT have the right to publish that fact all over my front page where kids can see.  The only reason I haven't 100% removed Facebook from my life is because I'm a member of a couple private groups that I need to keep track of. But I only visit every few days to see if those have been updated. I can't stand Facebook's dishonest practices, and I won't give them the chance to abuse me again."

DoesAnybodyElse,3cpjyh,JorusC,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"Bull. I don't give up control, I don't give out my passwords, I don't visit shady sites of any sort, and I don't have any Facebook apps at all. I did absolutely nothing that could jeopardize my control of my account, yet my account posted words on my wall that were visible to other people. Words that I did not type.  I had to go into View Activity Log to even see that anything was done, because it somehow didn't show up on my own profile.  If you don't know anything, just say, ""I'm sorry, I have no idea how that happened,"" and go on your way. Saying that you don't know and therefore if must not have happened doesn't put you in the most flattering light.  Edit: I looked around my account controls, and under Activity Log, there's a sidebar called All Apps. When you click on it, it gives you a list of accounts that Facebook has given permission to post on your behalf. It literally says, ""This app can post on your behalf to: [Dropdown List]"" The spammers must have set up their profile so it automatically gets added to that list. So I guess it didn't turn out to be a huge story that this is allowed. You should probably check yours. Oh, and for extra Orwellian goodness, it doesn't give you the option to remove anything from the list. The best you can do is make the puppet account's posts visible to only yourself."
DoesAnybodyElse,3cpjyh,FlarkingSmoo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:35 2015 UTC,I don't dispute that apps can post on your behalf. I just doubt you didn't accidentally do something to allow it.  Maybe they need bigger warnings.

For example every now and then a Sony advertisement  will pop-up in my newsfeed. It's not a real advertisement, it's just a post on the Sony fan page. But why am I seeing posts from that page if I don't have that page 'liked'? It's because if you look at the top of the post it will say ""x,y, and z friend like Sony"". So facebook's justification for showing you advertisements is that they're not advertisements, but just things your friend likes, so you should like them too!

DoesAnybodyElse,3cpjyh,chaoticpix93,2,Fri Jul 10 06:19:49 2015 UTC,"To the shared pages: That's actually an algorithm of your Facebook newsfeed. The more you like pages the more they show up on your newsfeed, blocking you from seeing some people that should be on your newsfeed instead. On that note, you can fiddle with the algorithm a bit by using the top right buttons of ""I don't want to see stuff like this"". Also, go into your settings and unlike a lot of pages and you'll see your newsfeed again. Another thing is to make sure that your settings are set to ""Most recent"" and not ""Top Stories""  TO the idea that something better should come along: I agree. I miss the days when sites could have the same layout and there wasn't any butthurt ""I'm going to sue you for copyright infringement!"" bullshit by all these people becoming corporate entities. I don't think any owner of a website should become corporate (re: google, facebook, etc.) While it's good and dandy to have a corporate structure the bigger your site gets, it shouldn't become like a commodity for something that is purely digital. Microsoft, Apple, I understand. They have actual products you can touch and hold.   I see a lot of people jumping the Facebook Ship, I just don't know if that's going to be everybody."

Obviously many people enjoy using the site and feel positively about it, but it was such a negative thing for me that it was better to leave it entirely.  A lot of people justify having it by saying that it helps them communicate with other people, but honestly, the important people in your life are easily contactable through other means.

About three years ago I deleted my facebook because I was just sick of seeing what my classmates were posting and not being on facebook was making it easier for me to get out of events I wasn't interested in going to, since no facebook meant no invitation.  But then during the time that I didn't have facebook (so about 2 years) I seemed to have a disadvantage. People often wouldn't contact me about things because a lot of them acted like facebook is the only way to communicate (since you know, texts cost fortune), if there was some school related stuff we were supposed to spread around us they would just put it on facebook and I had no idea that there even was something that I was supposed to download and read/bring to school. So this really sucked, but I managed to pull through the last two years of high school without it.  But then I decided to create a new account to be able to talk to some of my high school friends and also to be able to be in contact with my new college classmates. And it really does help when you can contact a bunch of people about school stuff without texting them separately (since I don't even have their phone numbers) but otherwise I'm still not a big fan of FB."

DoesAnybodyElse,3cnyq2,Jumpingoffthewalls,2,Thu Jul 9 14:37:34 2015 UTC,Hmm I haven't thought of it that way. Because it's usually my parents' nervousness that rubs off on me. In situations when I think they're being ridiculous to stress about something.
DoesAnybodyElse,3cnyq2,katielady125,3,Thu Jul 9 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yup. I have a lot of empathy for the people around me. I get really stressed out if I think someone else is upset. I also grew up in a high stress environment with my parents. They were always turning little things into huge deals that often resulted in screaming and crying. I started distancing myself from it. If I sensed a blow-up coming I'd go hide in my room or just leave once I had a car. My mom was the worst offender and my dad is too much like me and hates seeing her upset so he tries to step in and ""fix"" whatever the problem is and gets even more frustrated  when he can't.   They are good people who love each other and me, but they just seem to thrive on stress. They also get frustrated that I don't stick around and join in on the family freak-out. To them it means I don't care that the ""world is ending"" and they are upset. I know that  they expect me to jump in and ""help"" but I'm not a miracle worker. I can't magically inflate a tire or make more spaghetti sauce appear in the pantry. I realize now that what they really wanted was moral support but that's difficult to do when I'm being assaulted by their negative emotions and attitudes, and when I was younger I just didn't understand how my standing there while the screamed about how they can't find a wrench was ""helping"".  It is an extremely unpleasant feeling to have to sit and watch people I care about being upset and not being able to do anything productive to help.   I tend to avoid those situations as much as possible. I don't do well with ""drama"" prone people or people with mood swings or low self esteem. I feel like I am personally responsible for their emotional state and if they are upset I get so anxious and stressed out which doesn't help them at all. Usually better if I keep my distance."

I like to think of myself as a nice guy, and while I do often suffer anxiety - i never deal with it on dates, only when it comes to first approaching a girl. Time and time again have I approached girls, made nice and had good conversations with them only to have them ALL turn around and go after one of my douche bag friends - who, as a close personal friend of these people - can attest to their douchebaggery. I've watched these guys go through girls like hotcakes and they always wind up crying to me about ""he's such an asshole, he did this he did that."" Type bullshit.  What I'm really trying to say here is, at least within my generation - it has nothing to do with confidence, and everything to do with nice guys finishing last.  Some redeeming words for fellow nice guys out there - remember this.. The girl who turns you away for a self loathing douchebag probably wasn't going to be much of a keeper for yourself anyways. Continue to be yourself and simply make an effort to meet more girls - you WILL find a girl who WILL appreciate your kind nature, as well as be easier to associate with for yourself. So really, its not that nice guys finish last - its that nice guys get nice girls and douchebags get shitty dates.  Much Love fellow Beta Nice Guys :)  Tl;Dr: first hand experience says this phenomena exists. But my antithesis is that douches will get their shitty women, and the nice guys will get their nice girls.

If thats the attitude you approach women with, you're no better than the ""douchebags"" that they might snub you for. And as disheartening as it might be to face rejection so many times, if you're honestly having that much trouble successfully socializing with women it might be time for some inward reflection and improvement rather than blaming all women for your woes."

Calling yourself a Beta just makes me want to treat you like a Beta, and that's not a good thing.  You can't make the argument that confidence has nothing to do with your personal experience, and then follow it up by labelling yourself as someone who has little confidence. A confident asshole can definitely be more attractive than a shy nice guy, especially when they don't actually KNOW the person well enough to know his level of assholiness.  But yes, once a girl gets to know the asshole, they typically move on. The difference between nice guys and assholes is that assholes start out attractive and go downhill from there, whereas nice guys start out unattractive but climb the hill the more they become more familiar."

Confidence may overlap with louder, jockier, fratty personalities, for the simple reason that those people weren't bullied in school and are thus more confident, but it doesn't have to. I'm an enormously nerdy introvert with INTENSELY uncool interests and hobbies, a fact I've always been tried my best to be confident in and upfront about. And yes, this resulted in several first dates that did not lead to second dates, and possibly even me being made fun of later by some of said first dates behind my back. And that's totally cool. But then I found a girl who dug my dorky shit (dug enough of it, anyway), and we've been together four years and are getting married next year.  Be decent to people, don't be a stereotype of ""nice,"" don't be an asshole either, just be confident in who you are, and eventually someone will be into it.

They're ""so amazing"" because they can do things at a moments notice from the girl and pay for everything. I could see how that would be convenient and appealing.

You meet people, some of them you get on with, some of them you get on really well with, some of them are the right age/gender/sexuality, some of them are not seeing someone, some of them you get on especially well with, and in that tiny slither of remaining population, there is a non-guaranteed opportunity for relationship potential."

I read on solipsisim, nihilism, existialism, anything I could find to validate my own theories - but the rabbit hole I wandered down just magnified already festering serious issues. I too didn't believe anything was real, I was convinced the world was in my head. That lead to damaging myself mentally and physically over many years wandering that rabbit hole. Unfortunately it turned into a serious ""self medicating"" problem to which i now will always be a person ""in recovery""...do. not. go. down. that. hole.  To this day (sober in my 30s) I still grapple with my existence & reality, I have bad days, i wonder what the point of life & why I'm still standing here. Fuck i wonder why i stay sober even but I guess as you age, your perspective broadens. Now I think of my family, fiancee, friends...they aren't fake and their realities are the same as ours, my choices will affect them thusly things do matter! Only time will lessen/quiet these feelings, the life and family you eventually make for yourself as an adult seems to have validated reality and existence, or at least make make it easier to accept that we won't ever have proof any of this is real.  Because no one told me this and i as well as you need to hear it: i want you to know your existence, in whatever capacity or space our earthly forms manifest, is true and valid and meaningful because it is yours, and the energy (spirit/soul/whatever the fuck it is) that powers your brain is real and it is very, very meaningful. It's hard to wrap your brain around it but I promise you, I have seen many friends lose their light, lose sight of meaning and it's hard to believe that there's anything meaningful inside til you lose people you care about too soon and you can feel that loss of spirit deep in your soul. Losing those you love unfortunately can make you feel very alive but not in a good way.  best of  luck to you I have been there and I'm still here so I hope you find your clarity.   (Sorry its a wall of text, TLDR-existence/reality  are confusing and scary concepts but might be easier to contemplate as you build your own meaning and reality. Don't abuse drugs & alcohol to quell your thoughts. Tell your parents/friends you love them; validate your existence by validating those you care for )"
DoesAnybodyElse,3clvxd,mralexbrett,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:23:30 2015 UTC,This feels very familiar! It's important to realise that you are not alone. When I was younger I had simliar thoughts and feelings and as definitely_a_jerk says it comes and goes.  From my own experience when my first son was born it helped me figure some stuff out. I felt (and sometimes still do with the pressure of modern life) disconnected and isolated but by simply closing my eyes and thinking of my wife and kids and the connection I have with them makes me feel better. If nothing else the feeling I get when my kids smile or hug me is real.  Reddit and other social media can help as it makes you feel connected to other like minded people. I suppose thats the real beauty of the internet... in our darkest time a stranger on the other side of the planet can help you feel part of the real world.

I don't know what to suggest but I can only tell you to look at the positives in life as much as possible.  I sometimes laugh out loud like a wailing banshee at how insane life can be.

It ticks me off because I didn't grow up with this shit and I never had a problem with focusing on what I was reading. I used to completely lose myself in a book (not even necessarily a good book, either) to the point where my husband would have to call my name a few times before I'd snap out of the book.

Commas have a dedicated key, which I appreciate, and it adds a space after commas, question marks, and things like that.
