tabled,38szp6,tabledresser,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's fascinating. That guy is pretty smart at suicide and he realizes what should be done and how should he do it."
tabled,38szp6,ekliptik,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. I hate when people say suicide is selfish. It's not his job to keep other people happy. It's actually selfish of all the friends to make him suffer through life just so they don't have to deal with his death. Of course it will be sad for the people that know him, but I would be much happier to know he went when he wanted."
tabled,38szp6,Bread_Design,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it is said that suicide is selfish, because most suicides are based on being short-sighted, not realizing who they're hurting and generally not giving a fuck, which if not caused by depression is a dick move. If you jump down a bridge and go splat next to a children's playground, that's a selfish dick move. There are four types of suicides and the most common one is egocentric (=selfish) suicide - it's you who's sad, you who can't find a better way out. You are hurting people and don't care. That's being selfish. This guy however wants to commit a new kind of suicide - planned end of life. No sad surprises, no regret, just get over the fact that there can be a date of your death and that you can choose it. You can get prepared, you can end your relationships, it definitely will soften the blow if people around you can realize that they're losing you together with you. Unless they don't understand, then they'd take you for a fool, which would hurt a lot. TL;DR: There are selfish suicides and then there's this awesome guy."
tabled,38szp6,ekliptik,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"it's you who's sad, you who can't find a better way out. You are hurting people and don't care. That's being selfish.   This is the exact reason most people DO commit suicide. I've read that many people that do it because they believe they are helping others by removing themselves from others lives. They are tired of being depressed and dragging everyone else down with them. I personally believe this is not selfish because they are doing it to help, even if the end result is not that. If I want to commit suicide, it is my life and my choice. No one else should get to say otherwise. It's the same as marrying who I want. If my parents don't like who I'm marrying, should I not marry them either? I believe this is a good example because it leads to a life of suffering too, if you marry someone just because your family said to.   I see it like standing at the 30th story window when the room behind you is on fire. Would you not want them to jump and die quickly instead of burning to death in a slow and painful way? Why should they suffer through life the same then?   I completely agree about the cleanup of suicide though. Jumping on to a playground is selfish. A gun to your face in your house is selfish because someone has to clean it up. How the OP is doing it is the most selfless way possibly and I support this method 100%. Sadly though society prevents people from doing this. I feel the stigma surrounding suicide though in this culture is horrendous. I can't even talk about this publicly, let alone with my family because all it takes is 2 family member's signatures to lock me up. I feel like if we could openly talk about suicide and not just say automatically assume it's wrong without knowing the reasons behind it, it could help everyone involved.   I'm sorry if I'm coming off as brash on this too. It's something I've spent many years thinking about. After a close family friend and then a close friend of my own committed suicide I wanted to understand their viewpoint. Of course I'm extremely sad they are not in my life anymore. It fucking sucks and I miss them terribly, but I would not wish for them to continue in life suffering.   I guess I'm also thinking about adults here, not people under 18 years old. People whose brains have finished growing, lived life, and are of sound mind."
tabled,38szp6,Bread_Design,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Heh, I'm 16 and I went through suicidal thoughts, no depressions thankfully, just some existential ennui. I'd like to focus on your first point: Yes, most suicidal people think they are doing it to ease other people's lives, that they're making stuff easier for them, but see an example: at /r/offmychest a dude with a throwaway account announced that he's gonna commit suicide, that he has no job, no skills, and that since his family cares so much about him, he wants to stop being a liability to them. He wanted to help his family, but what he didn't realize is that since they care so much, he's gonna emotionally devastate them. I tried to tell him in the comments that he'd do the exact opposite (hurting his family) by his actions, but OP didn't respond. I hope he got over the thoughts and lived to another day and found some point to living he didn't know earlier... TL;DR: suicidal people may do it for others but mostly end up fking others up emotionally."
tabled,38szp6,ekliptik,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:38:09 2015 UTC,"First let me say that I'm extremely happy that you made it through your rough times and that you are here. It takes a strong person to do that. As for the guy you had replied too, I hope he's still around and is getting help.   Now on a more callus note though.  I understand he's going to hurt a lot of people, but why is that his responsibility? Why is it more acceptable for someone with no friends or family to commit suicide than for someone who does have them? This just doesn't seem right to me. It's almost like people are fine with suicide as long as you have no friends or family which sounds so wrong."
tabled,38szp6,Bread_Design,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound wrong to me at all - imagine blowing yourself up in the desert. Now imagine blowing yourself up in a train station. The only difference in this simile is the kind of damage - physical, not emotional."
tabled,38szp6,ekliptik,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:18:32 2015 UTC,"I guess this doesn't sound right to me because in the example the guy chose to go to the train station and blow himself up. In life we don't choose to be born, we're forced in to this world. I think everyone should get to choose how they die, even if they have friends or not. Everyone should be treated equal.  It also sounds bad that if you want to kill yourself, just go ruin all your friendships and relationships with family. Make everyone hate you first. Why can't people go with everyone loving them?"
tabled,38szp6,Bread_Design,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"I do agree that anyone should have the option to kill himself. It is your choice to kill yourself in a selfish way. The guy did choose to go to a train station and blow himself up. He could've said his goodbyes. He could've decided not to blow himself up. His family members and the guy had relationships and every relationship is a commitment and to do this is just a bit cruel. I'm not saying you should make people hate you, I'm saying that if there are people who truly care about you, you should talk to them about it, make them understand, not just leave... Well, these are my moral standards. If a person wants to die and doesn't care about anyone, yeah, the person willl kill themselves, but if the person cares at least a bit about anyone or anything, they won't. I'm of the second kind."
tabled,38szp6,ekliptik,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"If their family and friends cared even just a little bit, they wouldn't make them continue to suffer in this world just so they don't have to feel sad."

tabled,30bggj,tabledresser,2,Thu Mar 26 00:29:01 2015 UTC,Hi! First of all I saw the pic of one of you guys on the front page and YOU LOOK BADASS!  what inspired you to become a part of this initiative?  What do you think it says about the role of women in military?  Fears about the job and/or the initiative as a whole?

Second ""thank you""  to your family for the sacrifices they made, then and now, that allow men like you to get the job done, cheers.    My question: When you need to smile or get motivated to do something tough or unpleasant,  do you remember situations in the war that were less than desirable but the camaraderie of your friends made it bearable? if yes to that question what is the moment or  memory that makes you smile and feel most proud of your crew mates?"
