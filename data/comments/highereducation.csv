highereducation,3e2tju,rellotscire,4,Tue Jul 21 15:02:45 2015 UTC,Its not the Universities job to hold a trial AT ALL!
highereducation,3e2tju,kckaaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"A trial, no.  But it is the university's job and responsibility to have a process and procedures in place to govern their students' behavior."
highereducation,3e2tju,suburbanpride,2,Wed Jul 22 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"Not really.  This was a criminal charge.  The University should have no authority in criminal matters.  If there was evidence, they should turn it over to authorities.  If there wasn't evidence, they should drop it."
highereducation,3e203e,rellotscire,2,Tue Jul 21 10:02:11 2015 UTC,The real story is the unprecedented wealth of the families sending their young to elite privates and the ever-more privatized state flagships. Schools are doing what they must to compete for wealthy students.

highereducation,3dyais,RegionalPublic,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"College grads are great with ambiguity.  ""Salary commensurate with experience"" for entry level positions that all require 2-4 years experience but also a college degree.  So they want a person with a college degree, but they're not going to pay a premium for that attribute. They want someone with experience, but they're going to pay you as if you have none. Sure. Okay, sign me up!"
highereducation,3dv6e2,JohnKimble111,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"Clearly, despite being student president, Jeremy Hornsby never really understood UCL. The university was founded on the principle of education for all. It is the entire ethos of the foundation, and a cursory glance at the UCL website shows the pride the university has in this history. The first women were admitted eighty years before Jeremy became president, Kathleen Lonsdale was already a professor before he joined as a student. Perhaps Sir Tim Hunt's comments could have been ignored at some other institute, as foolish as they were, but there was no way UCL could have reacted differently to the way they did."
highereducation,3dv6e2,tom_the_red,2,Mon Jul 20 08:18:13 2015 UTC,"Now seriously, I’m impressed by the economic development of Korea. And women scientists played, without doubt an important role in it. Science needs women and you should do science despite all the obstacles, and despite monsters like me.   Was it that comment that UCL didn't like? Funny how it was conveniently omitted in all the media reports and social media raging."
highereducation,3dnxgm,RedditGreenit,2,Fri Jul 17 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think this is really cool.  As a historian, it is also interesting in terms of labor history.  Adjuncts are in somewhat of a pretty similar situation as those of American factory workers of the early 20th Century (fortunately though, we aren't usually subject to workplace dismemberment)."
highereducation,3dmllr,gAlienLifeform,6,Fri Jul 17 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a lot of sense. Even if you look at purely economically without any emotion: The benefit of a college degree, both for the individual and the society, are that much higher on average for an ex-felon than they are for a non-ex-felon."
highereducation,3dmkaz,rellotscire,2,Fri Jul 17 14:14:41 2015 UTC,If only there were more parents like the Stigmores... lol :)
highereducation,3dnnxs,Ambr_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it is possible to answer your question. There are probably hundreds of colleges and universities that you could apply to.  Try getting on the Internet or visiting a library to find a school that would suit your needs. There are a lot of books and web sites that rank colleges based on majors and give you information about admissions. You could also try contacting your closest American consulate. They may have an American center which distributes information on scholarships and admissions for foreign students.
highereducation,3dnnxs,ProfAbroad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"Collegeboard.org has a cool college finder/search function. You should not base your entire search on the results but it can narrow down schools based on your different preferences like school size, major, location, extra-curriculars, etc. Do research beyond that but it could give you a nice starting point."
highereducation,3dnnxs,blahhhkit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"Simply from my experience and where I live, Virginia Tech, NC State, and Georgia Tech all might be worth looking into.  All large public schools with good engineering schools and industry connections in DC, Raleigh, and Atlanta.  But I agree with the other comments, look at websites like collegeboard.org to get the best idea of schools to apply to."
highereducation,3dk12m,RegionalPublic,6,Thu Jul 16 22:06:42 2015 UTC,Her approach was wrong but good for her for speaking out.  Higher Ed in WI is going to give the nation a glimpse at what could happen when you rattle tradition. This needs to have open dialogue from ALL sides.
highereducation,3dk12m,wizardofo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:18:06 2015 UTC,I agree with you.
highereducation,3dk12m,jnetelle,4,Fri Jul 17 22:55:35 2015 UTC,Reddit should hire her as a PR person. She has the kind of deft touch they really need.
highereducation,3dk12m,Unicormfarts,5,Fri Jul 17 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"I feel bad that she could very well be used as an example during Walker's campaign, but Birch has a point about her engaging with young people who are not even enrolled and on campus yet. Killing their enthusiasm by pulling them into a conflict between faculty and administration just doesn't seem like a responsible thing to do. The students' early impressions of college are sullied. The focus is not on the interests, hopes, and journey of the student. Instead, they are exposed to this power struggle that they have no real control over and may even feel like they are being used like pawns in some strategic move by one side against the other. Talk about inhibiting a student's sense of agency from the start. It's a different story once a student is a Badger, he or she is a part of the community and system, so this Twitter dialogue would be a fine way to provoke discussion and exercise critical thinking skills. But these were just kids who were excited about the next chapter of their lives - college - and some random person online spammed them and was a buzz kill.  I can't get with that."
highereducation,3dk12m,jnetelle,2,Fri Jul 17 02:21:36 2015 UTC,How is this not more discussed on Reddit?
highereducation,3dk12m,day9-made-me-do-it,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:14:32 2015 UTC,"I love the downvote brigade around here, consistently forgetting what an educator is supposed to do, and perpetuating what has been allowed.  We are supposed to educate, without bias, and present facts where possible, and where not, give equal defference to all sides of an issue, allowing the students to then critically think about which choice they would take.  Continuing to allow bias on either side only diminishes further the quality of education we are providing and is a massive disservice to our students."
highereducation,3dk12m,absentminded_adjunct,-6,Fri Jul 17 14:47:09 2015 UTC,"Put her ass to the curb, and blacklist her.  She has no place in academia with that kind of attitude."
highereducation,3djau2,JWPopeCenter,2,Thu Jul 16 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"To anyone who read the article linked above: What kind of Title IX training have you had from your institution? I am going through an online training from Workplace Answers, which I think lays out the information in a very comprehensible manner."
highereducation,3djba9,KeithHampson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"Most people are familiar with economies of scale, which we discussed in a recent post. The Network Effect, sometimes called “Metcalfe’s Law”, is less well-known, but equally relevant if we want to understand how the unique economics of the Internet are influencing higher education.  Economies of scale is concerned with the impact of increases in volume on cost – specifically, cost per unit. Network Effects, on the other hand, concerns the impact of volume on the perceived value of the good or product. When the Network Effect is present and positive, the value of the good or product increases as more people use it. Social media is the clearest example: the value of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and other peer-to-peer technologies increases as more people participate. As participation rises, the volume of interactions, possibilities for new connections, and the range of available content increases – in turn, so does the value to each participant."
