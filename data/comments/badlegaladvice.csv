badlegaladvice,3e5xsq,adminbeast,5,Wed Jul 22 05:22:40 2015 UTC,"This is my first post here, but I think I get the idea.  This is bad legal from an actual legal professional. The article itself states that a man's home burned down, and the insurance company wanted to ask him some questions regarding what happened. He got a lawyer to go with him to the meeting with the insurance company, and the lawyer advised him to ""plead the fifth"" rather than answer the insurance company's questions. Insurance company determines he is not cooperating with their investigation, and refuses to pay his claim.   Now, I am no lawyer, but I am pretty darn sure the 5th amendment only applies to criminal investigations, and certainly doesn't apply to an insurance company's claim investigation. This seems like some horribly bad advice from a legal ""professional"".  Also, the comments section is pretty rough when it comes to legal understanding."

While the jail did violate several rules and regulations concerning supervision, it does appear she took her own life, so I fail to see how, in any way, anyone could have any liability for her death that would not be immediately offset by her intentional conduct.

It's got to do with an obscure clause in federal law about how juries are formed. The assertion is that if you commit a murder in the part of Yellowstone that lies within the borders of Idaho, you'd be in federal jurisdiction and would have to be tried by jury in a federal court. But the law says that federal juries have to be made up of residents of the state and district in which the crime was committed, a legal principle called vicinage. The court would be unable to impanel a jury for your trial because there are no residents of that part of Idaho. So you could not be prosecuted, and you'd literally get away with murder.  Of course, in reality the judicial system of the United States is not peopled entirely by idiots, so a bizarre quirk of the law would not result in a court throwing up its hands and setting an accused murderer free without trial. Nobody knows exactly what the workaround would be because it's never come up — no crime has ever been committed in that part of the country — but we can all be darned sure that if it ever came up it would take about ten seconds for a real court to interpret the vicinage clause to mean something other than ""Whelp, our hands are tied, release the accused with our apologies."""

badlegaladvice,3dzwgw,jrwn,3,Tue Jul 21 10:29:48 2015 UTC,"The Delaware thing is kind of funny. Something like half of all corporations in America are incorporated in Delaware, but it's not for tax reasons. (In truth, unless you happen to be doing business in Delaware, you end up paying more tax because you have to pay franchise tax in Delaware as well as in the state where you do business.)  No, the reason so many corporations incorporate in Delaware is because … so many corporations incorporate in Delaware. It's a total feedback-loop thing.  For starters, Delaware's Court of Chancery (their civil court) is two hundred-odd years old, having been founded like minutes after the Revolutionary War. So there's this vast history of case law in Delaware, specifically related to doing business and to incorporation. Delaware has a vast and specific civil code that pertains to business and incorporation, and those laws are really useful to businesses, chiefly because they're predictable. If you incorporate in Delaware, you know what to expect.  Delaware civil law is a feedback loop of its own, really. It's said — I cannot attest to this firsthand, but I can attest to it secondhand — that lawyers who specialize in corporate law acquire a working familiarity with Delaware law because that's the lingua franca of business law in the United States. So your in-house or outside counsel understand Delaware law … and so do the guys representing companies you'll partner with or solicit investment from. Again, if you incorporated in Delaware you — and everybody you do business with — know what to expect.  And then there's just the practical side of it. The business of Delaware is business. The Secretary of State's office has like a 24/7 toll-free number (or something very similar to that). They process paperwork fast. It takes like an hour to incorporate in Delaware. Last I heard there were more corporations in Delaware than actual people, so the machinery of state is highly tuned to handle the volume. It's just easier to have your business incorporated in Delaware than in any other state.  But it's not about gaming the tax code. I mean, it is in the sense that every corporation uses every legal means available to reduce its tax burden; duh. But incorporating in Delaware does not mean you automatically pay less business tax. Like I said up top, it almost always means you end up paying a little more. People do it anyway because it's convenient and dependable."

Code § 18.2-108, appear to be: 1. The property was stolen. 2. The defendant possessed the stolen property. 3. The defendant knew it was stolen. 4. The defendant had a dishonest intent.  Now, let's go through them one by one.   First of all, the prosecutor can succeed on this without actually convicting anyone of the direct theft. I suppose it's possible that the money was not stolen but merely misplaced and mistaken as chicken. I don't know enough about fast food joints to know whether they typically disguise their deposits as food, but it seems stupid. It seems more likely to me that an employee stole the cash and mistakenly gave it to Mr. Minor. This is a no-brainer. (The delicious meat of the argument.) If you're an idiot, you might be thinking, ""But wait, can't I just say that I thought it was a gift to me from Mr. Bo Chicken Jangles himself? You can't prove I didn't think that, and that's what the law requires."" Ethics notwithstanding, the just play dumb legal strategy requires that your lie is believable. No one will believe you when you say, ""I opened the bag, which I expected to contain less than $20 worth of chicken, only to find a gift of over $4,000 from the establishment. Since everyone knows it's gauche to acknowledge such large gifts of cash, especially in front of other customers who might've received less, I left hurriedly and without thanks. Later, to my surprise, I was informed that this was an accident."" You'd have as much luck stealing something from a store and declaring that you honestly believed that everything was free. Essentially the same as number 3. Good luck attempting to prove that you had no intent to keep something that wasn't yours.   Assuming that the money was truly accidentally given to Mr. Minor, I think Va. Code § 18.2-95, i.e. larceny, would apply. I'm not sure, though. I don't doubt that it's illegal for someone to keep the cash, but I wouldn't be shocked if this situation was covered by some other statute that I overlooked."

Having said that: the honey badgers are idiots, this guy is an idiot, and the gamergaters that sent them $30 are idiots and I can't wait for the popcorn to start going off. Can't. Fucking. Wait."
badlegaladvice,3dr7qn,Puppy_Spymaster,8,Sat Jul 18 23:36:13 2015 UTC,Why was he disbarred?
badlegaladvice,3dr7qn,Quouar,14,Sun Jul 19 13:31:51 2015 UTC,"It seems like he was disbarred because he defrauded Legal Aid.  He allegedly over-billed them by close to $150,000.00.  First he said that it was all legitimate.  Then he backtracked saying he simply couldn't account for all the total money billed saying his logs were pieced together from recollection since he didn't record his time properly and he rounded to what he thought was close to appropriate.  However it seemed in some cases (according to wikipedia, which cites the Toronto Star) that the billings exceeded the hours in the day.    He was disbarred (although the decision was not unanimous and one bencher wrote a dissenting opinion (which is apparently rare) and then started practicing as a paralegal in Ontario (before they were regulated, so anyone could call themselves a paralegal).  When paralegals became regulated he tried to obtain a license but was denied.  But allegedly he has continued to practice anyways, disregarding the order for him not to practice.  This led to a lot of ire from the LSUC.  He's been kicked out of courtrooms a number of times and his name is somewhat of a running joke amongst legal professionals in Ontario."
badlegaladvice,3dr7qn,Dose_of_Reality,3,Sun Jul 19 15:07:34 2015 UTC,What can paralegals do in Canada?
badlegaladvice,3dr7qn,dedtired,5,Sun Jul 19 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"So there is two answers to that.  Paralegals in every province but Ontario are not regulated or licensed in any way.  So basically they can do whatever they want.  They are kind of like psychotherapists in the sense that because they are not regulated, anyone can call themselves a psychotherapist and start offering their services.  For court matters, they would be appearing as an agent on their client's behalf.  This has created a sort of 'wild-west' atmosphere where you have a wide range of services being offered with the quality of service varying greatly across so-called practitioners and very little accountability.  This has led to quite a bit of impropriety and unethical behaviour, which has also created a need for regulation.  In comes Ontario.....    In 2007, Ontario introduced legislation requiring that paralegals by licensed and regulated by the Law Society of Upper Canada (which regulates lawyers in Ontario).  Stemming from that legislation is the limitations on scope of areas that paralegals can provide legal service.  Paralegals can be sole-practitioners in the following areas:  summary conviction offences, small claims ($25,000 and under), anything under the Provincial Offences Act, administrative tribunals and regulatory agencies (Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, Labour Relations Board, Financial Services Comission of Ontario, Liquor Licensing Board and the other hundred or so admin tribunals that exist.)  Paralegals can draft legal documents and file paperwork related to a proceeding.  Paralegals can also work and assist on matters outside of the scope mentioned above if they are under direct supervision of a licensed lawyer (so family law, indictable offences, civil court (above $25000), etc.)"

badlegaladvice,3dr7qn,adminbeast,43,Sun Jul 19 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"R2: Well, incredible vagueness, unclear overall purpose of the document, lack of establishing details like dates and who was party to what, failure to actually cite or quote the relevant contract or the supposedly defamatory statements, and to explain how the contract was broken... but let's gloss over that and get to the core of their claim.  They seem to be claiming breach of contract (it would be the contract on page 9 of this PDF, although they never cite it lol,) while relying on Alberta's Fair Trading Act to magically nullify all of the parts of the contract that mean they have no actual case. The most obvious being:   The [Expo] shall have the full power in the interpretation and enforcement of all contract regulations contained herein, and the power to make such amendments thereto, and such further rules and regulations as shall be considered necessary and proper. [...] The Comic & Entertainment Expo Committee reserves the right to remove any person(s) who does not comply with the rules and regulations outlined in the Exhibitor Agreement, and the policies and procedures outlined on the website. No refund shall be given to exhibitors who are removed from the show.   The Fair Trading Act doesn't apply to them at all. The definitions under Section 1 limit its applicability to consumer transactions, and they were vendors.  And they're relying on a the Act's provision that ambiguities in contracts are resolved in favor of the consumer. The Expo's regulation of exhibitors is broad and sweeping; see their ""bullying"" policies as of convention start; but that doesn't make them ambiguous.  They try to overcome ""boilerplate provisions reflecting the unequal bargaining power positions of the parties"" which are ""oppressive and abusive in nature,"" because apparently ""boilerplate provisions"" have no legal force and Alberta courts are run on late Medieval Chancery principles. They even cite ""unfair practices"" as if ""unfair"" is decided by rules of equity and not an enumerated list of highly specific ""unfair practices""  in s 6(2-4).  Ultimately the question here is not whether this document is a steaming load of bullshit – it's whether it reflects simple incompetence or a cynical effort to convince GamerGate rubes that donating money to this cause wasn't / isn't a bad idea."

Rule 2:  Criminal contempt of court is defined as conduct calculated to embarrass, hinder or obstruct a court in its administration of justice or to derogate from its authority or dignity, thereby bringing the administration of law into disrepute.  People v. Simac, 161 Ill.2d 297, 204 Ill.Dec. 192, 641 N.E.2d 416 (1994).   Direct criminal contempt results when the contemptuous conduct occurs in the presence of the trial judge.  People v. Whitlock, 167 Ill.App.3d 984, 118 Ill.Dec. 645, 522 N.E.2d 100 (1988).   Before citing a person with contempt, the court must find that the conduct was willful.   People v. Ernest, 141 Ill.2d 412, 152 Ill.Dec. 544, 566 N.E.2d 231 (1990).   Direct criminal contempt may be found and punished summarily if all elements, including willfulness, are before the court and within the judge's knowledge.  Simac, 161 Ill.2d 297, 204 Ill.Dec. 192, 641 N.E.2d 416.       Seems pretty straightforward to me. It certainly did so to the IL Supreme Court as well."

The point that the OP is missing is that not all forms of speech are protected by the First Amendment. Things like obscenity, defamation, or (most importantly) words inciting imminent lawless action are not protected by the First Amendment.  For a content restriction on free speech like this to be valid, it must be shown that imminent illegal conduct is likely and that the speaker intended to cause it. Here, discussing illegal activities over a phone satisfies both elements. Calling or texting someone to set up a drug deal provides that the illegal conduct is imminent, and intent can pretty much be inferred from the words alone.   Also, while I'm not entirely sure about this, the law seems to simply restrict the use of communication devices (i.e. the law says you can't use phones to conduct illegal activities). It doesn't necessarily act as a prior restraint on the speech as much it it acts as a restraint on how you can use a telephone. And you don't really have a constitutional right to use a telephone. This is a bit of a nuanced reading of the law, though, but either way it's silly to assume that the law is unconstitutional."

badlegaladvice,3d2n8s,ccmulligan,10,Mon Jul 13 02:01:48 2015 UTC,"I briefly considered going there, but it seemed sort of odd to interpret it as a conduct restriction to begin with since the law appears to primarily be a restriction of speech that incites imminent illegal activity. It does seem to cut either way, though.   So if the statute is interpreted to regulate how you can use a phone, then yeah the type of forum would absolutely be a relevant point. The law would still be valid under the nonpublic forum analysis, since the time, place and manner restriction is viewpoint neutral and reasonably related to a legitimate government purpose.

It also seems like misguided policy--surely we want criminals to be using cell phones so that it's that much easier to track them. Adding punishment for using phones seems to push them into channels law enforcement can't easily (and safely) access."
badlegaladvice,3d2n8s,TuckerMcG,5,Mon Jul 13 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"I mean there's Due Process, which protects you from all sorts of frivolous government actions and laws. It doesn't protect you from validly enacted legislature created pursuant to the enumerated or unenumerated powers of Congress, though. And like I said, there's no constitutional protection allowing you to use a telephone to commit crimes. So it's pretty ridiculous to assert that this is unconstitutional.  Edit: Also being sentenced is different from being charged. The 8th Amendment applies to the former, not the latter. Cruel and unusual punishment doesn't apply to a situation where you're charged with an absurd number of crimes at once. It applies to the form of the punishment, not the basis of the punishment.  Edit 2: There's also no protection from ineffective laws either. Even if it were more effective to not have this law so that criminals are less hesitant to use phones and this easier to catch, that doesn't make a law unconstitutional. There are lots of validly existing laws that simply aren't enforced or that simply don't serve the purpose for which they were enacted. That doesn't invalidate those laws."

If you can't charge a guy with a number of crimes that add up to 70 years, you can't really pressure him into a deal to waive his right to a trial.  So you offer him a deal, and he accepts - even if he didn't really do the crime, it's still sometimes better to accept a relatively small sentence instead of having a chance at serving what is essentially life in prison. And then everyone wins - the prosecutor gets another conviction on his record, and the people profiting from prisoners get slightly more profit.

badlegaladvice,3cyowi,psuedopseudo,4,Sat Jul 11 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"Undocumented entry is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. Reentry after a deportation can be prosecuted as a federal crime, but that's a pretty particular set of circumstances.   This is one of the more out-there ones I have found in some time. As the term suggests, of course it is a crime to illegally immigrate to the US.  For example, 8 U.S.C. § 1325 says it is a crime if ""Any alien enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers... [or] attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact.""  I have no idea where the part about it only being a civil matter is coming from."
badlegaladvice,3cyowi,futureblap,20,Sun Jul 12 00:03:10 2015 UTC,"It is not a crime to be in the US without legal status. How one enters is the key to understanding the distinction in the context of the statute you are speaking of. For example, it is estimated that 40% of the undocumented population are persons who overstayed a visa or otherwise some other temporary status has expired. They entered legally although their current presence is considered unlawful. Those statutes you cited do not apply to this group and they have not broken any criminal laws by remaining in the US. However, there would be civil legal penalties for one's overstay that would apply to them.   Immigration law is a civil body of law, although that is not to say that there aren't some immigration-related violations of law that are also considered criminal and have criminal penalties. The vast majority, however, are/do not."
badlegaladvice,3cyowi,ANewMachine615,2,Sun Jul 12 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is a criminal matter, albeit not explicitly. In fact, in 1990 the section in question was amended to remove references to conviction, guilt, felonies, and misdemeanors.   Despite that change, the courts consistently describe violation of 1325(a) as a crime.   ""Suppose also that the officer who makes the stop subsequently acquires reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver entered the country illegally, which is a federal crime. See 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a).""    Arizona v. United States, 576 U.S. ____, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2528 (2012) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).    The United States then charged Flores with two predicate crimes, namely, entering the United States without inspection, 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), and misusing immigration documents, 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a).    Flores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U.S. 646, 649 (2009).  While you're correct that generally immigration is a non-criminal process (though I'd argue it's more administrative than civil) the specific claim was that ""Undocumented entry is . . . not a criminal matter."" I think it's clear that, regardless of how most unlawful residents come to be here, ""undocumented entry"" itself is in fact a crime."
badlegaladvice,3cyowi,futureblap,9,Sun Jul 12 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"That is correct although nothing you wrote negates what I said. Unlawful entry is a crime but it is not necessarily the case that ""illegally immigrating"", to paraphrase OP's words, is a crime.  I explained to him a distinction between two different classes of undocumented immigrants and how it applies to the statute he mentioned. Hence, not all of those who illegally immigrate are criminals. He is correct, as I mentioned in my reply to him, that unlawful entry is a criminal offense, but I also provided him with context for why it could have been confusing and also what the person he quoted could have meant to imply.   And yes, immigration law is administrative law which is civil in nature. Like most administrative bodies of law, they are predominantly civil (vs. criminal) legal matters."

The example I mentioned and pointing out the civil nature of the body of law as a whole could help in ameliorating the misunderstanding.    It is also worth mentioning that the rate of arrest and prosecution for unlawful entry is extremely low, while a crime of unlawful re-entry is more commonly pursued. Hence (and I believe this is what the person whose comment you referenced was trying to get at), those who have entered unlawfully mostly face the civil penalties for someone who has entered without inspection.    Yes, you are correct it is a criminal offense, but this could provide some context into what the person meant."

badlegaladvice,3cxnh8,HumanMilkshake,6,Sat Jul 11 19:33:21 2015 UTC,"IIRC abandonment requires both loss of possession, and intent to abandon. Intent to abandon is usually shown by an overt act. For example, if you left your couch out on the curb, you both would no longer have possession of it, and your overt act would be strong evidence of your intent to abandon it.   Your example with the wallet is missing the overt act. The whole thing about a certain time period (if it even exists) is probably based on a statute that says lost property is deemed abandoned after a certain amount of time.   As applied to the mistaken paycheck, the employer has not performed an overt act showing an intent to abandon the money, hence it isn't abandonment."

badlegaladvice,3cxnh8,HumanMilkshake,3,Mon Jul 13 05:47:50 2015 UTC,"Under those facts I'd say the intent to abandon is pretty clear. Why else would someone obviously intentionally leave their wallet in the middle of the sidewalk? Given that, the wallet no longer belongs to the person who left it, so there would be no crime whether you kept it for a day or forever. Larceny-type crimes require that you take someone else's property.  However, if it were a crime, the police's conduct would not be entrapment."

While this belief is widely held among American legal professionals, some studies have suggested that crime shows are unlikely to cause such an effect, although frequent CSI viewers may place a lower value on circumstantial evidence.

badlegaladvice,3cd9d7,Igggg,3,Wed Jul 8 08:12:08 2015 UTC,"Volksverhetzung:       Volksverhetzung (German: ""incitement of popular hatred"") is a concept in German criminal law that bans the incitement of hatred against a segment of the population. It often applies in, though it is not limited to, trials relating to Holocaust denial in Germany. The German penal code (Strafgesetzbuch) establishes that someone is guilty of Volksverhetzung if the person:   in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace:   incites hatred against segments of the population or calls for violent or arbitrary measures against them; or assaults the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously maligning, or defaming segments of the population   There are also special provisions for Holocaust denial (added in the 1990s) and speech justifying or glorifying the Nazi government 1933–1945 (recently added).  Although freedom of speech is mentioned by Article 5 of the Grundgesetz (Germany's constitution), said article basically protects any non-outlawed speech. Restrictions exist, e.g. against personal insults, use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations, or Volksverhetzung. It is a common misconception that Volksverhetzung includes any spreading of Nazism, racist, or other discriminatory ideas. For any hate speech to be punishable as Volksverhetzung, the law requires that said speech be ""qualified for disturbing public peace"" either by inciting ""hatred against parts of the populace"" or calling for ""acts of violence or despotism against them"", or by attacking ""the human dignity of others by reviling, maliciously making contemptible or slandering parts of the populace"".  Volksverhetzung is a punishable offense under Section 130 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Germany's criminal code) and can lead to up to five years imprisonment. Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if the incitement of hatred takes effect on German territory—that is, the seditious sentiment was expressed in written or spoken German and disseminated in Germany (German criminal code's Principle of Ubiquity, Section 9 Paragraph 1 Alternatives 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch).   Historically, the ""Karlsbader Beschlüsse"" of the German Confederation under Austria and led by Metternich included democratic ideals as well as agitation for one, unified German state as Volksverhetzung.

badlegaladvice,3brj91,ANewMachine615,3,Thu Jul 2 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"IANAL either, but I might be able to offer some insight here. And I also might be wrong, so don't bank on any of this.   gun licenses have to be equal across state lines   This kind of reciprocity currently does not exist, and so far no federal court has ruled that it must. A 'gun license' in one state may or may not have any meaning or effect in any other, and so far no federal law dictates that it must. What constitutes a 'gun license' may vary considerably from state to state.   everyone has the right to own a gun   This is also more complicated than many people presume. The right to keep and bear arms affirmed under the Second Amendment is not without limit, the same as the right of free speech under the First is not without limit. In both cases (and also in respect to other constitutional rights), public welfare can and may lawfully infringe those rights, to the extent that it's found necessary to do so in order to protect other people's rights.  It's surely undisputed that plenty of U.S. citizens do not have an innate right to keep and bear arms, nor should they. People under four years old, for example, people with a history of shooting other people, people who are not capable of reason, and plenty more. No less than the NRA stands behind those very reasonable restrictions on this constitutional right, and I can't imagine that any reasonable people wouldn't.  So-called 'states' rights' are predicated on the provision of 'reserved powers' in the U.S. Constitution, which maintains that those powers not delegated to the federal government under the Constitution belong to the States instead. (Definition of marriage, for example, is a state power the federal government doesn't have.)  A certain subset of the national gun rights lobby (I want to try to avoid painting with overly broad strokes here) argues that because the Supreme Court found a right to marry under the Fourteenth Amendment which prevails over states' power to define marriage in a way that infringes on that, that the same must be true for states' limitations on gun ownership and use, because of the Second Amendment.  In fact, however, an enormous amount of the debate in all the federal cases leading up to Obergefell v. Hodges (the gay marriage case ruled 26 June) was about how far states could go in advancing their own goals in the abridgement of marriage rights already presumed under the Constitution. (Per Loving v. Virginia, 1967) The argument was that while such a right might or might not exist (plenty of defendant states argued that it does not, though it's hard to take that seriously), states' desire to advance their own definitions constituted a lawful infringement.  Key to that argument is that such definitions advance a public purpose sufficient to justify the infringement. The majority of the high court (and most others) found that the public doesn't need to be protected from gay marriage, as gay marriage poses no credible threat to anything or anyone beyond the smug arrogance of bigots. (Which class of self-styled victims happens to include four of the currently sitting Justices on the high court, but that's a discussion for historians and scholars of the future.) With no defensible public purpose to justify the infringement, and having established that DOMAs constitute an infringement, the court ruled that DOMAs cannot stand against Fourteenth Amendment protections.  In the case of gun control, the same balance is argued, but an important difference is that there is little dispute (even by many gun rights' advocates) that reasonable restrictions on firearms advance a necessary public purpose. For that reason, some regulation is appropriate, and remains defensible as necessary infringement of Second Amendment rights. To argue otherwise would be to argue that two-year-olds have the same right as (most but not all) twenty-year-olds to keep and bear arms, and very few people would agree with that, as the public purpose in preventing that is obvious. The reasonable argument is therefore not whether any such restrictions are appropriate and lawful, but which are, and to what extent."

badlegaladvice,3brj91,BereanLanders,-1,Wed Jul 1 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"The ""conservative justices"" usually subscribe to the idea of legal formalism. That is to say, our country is based on rule of law, not rule of men.  So they believe SCOTUS is bound to only interpret the text of the law as it had meaning when it was written. If justices are free to interpret the text in their own personal vision, then they could make up whatever they wanted.   Roberts was arguing that: Do really want effectively only 5 people who are unelected and unaccountable deciding ""what's the best for the nation""? Same-sex marriage was steadily being adopted across the country state-by-state by the people, it was inevitable it was going to be for the whole country anyway.  Most people were really happy with the same-sex decision today, but the next set of justices could just as easily decide they personally think the 4th amendment doesn't protect against looking into your email or phone records. And there'd be no democratic recourse to overturn that. Even if an amendment was passed, they can simply interpret it to the opposite of what it actually said. (Eg, in declaring ""legislature"" doesn't mean ""legislature"" but ""any group of people"")"
badlegaladvice,3brj91,PvtSherlockObvious,6,Wed Jul 1 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"The reasoning itself isn't weak, it's the application that is poor (in the dissenting opinion).  The letter of the law on marriage only speaks to hard, legal benefits and status conferred to married individuals, and the neutral interpretation, setting all moral and personal values aside, is to protect those benefits according to equal protection.  To do otherwise is to endorse a moral interpretation of history, which is what Roberts explicitly says he is inclined to do.  He even quotes William Faulkner; ""The past is never dead.  It is not even past.""  He seems to realize the subjectivity inherent in any interpretation of past definitions, yet he fails to see how subjective the traditional definition of marriage actually is.  In other words, the form of the law lies in the equal protection, not in the inherently subjective definition of marriage.  In this sense, SCOTUS did not try to unilaterally define marriage, they merely applied equal protection according to the letter of the Constitution."
badlegaladvice,3brj91,ANewMachine615,2,Wed Jul 1 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Robert directly addresses this in his opinion. He really picks it apart on page 62, but Scalia had a more concise rebuttal on page 72:   We have no basis for striking down a practice that is not expressly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and that bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use dating back to the Amendment’s ratification. Since there is no doubt whatever that the People never decided to prohibit the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples, the public debate over same-sex marriage must be allowed to continue.   No matter what it was the People ratified, the Fourteenth Amendment protects those rights that the Judiciary, in its “reasoned judgment,” thinks the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect. That is so because “[t]he generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions . . . . ” One would think that sentence would continue: “. . . and therefore they provided for a means by which the People could amend the Constitution,” or perhaps “. . . and therefore they left the creation of additional liberties, such as the freedom to marry someone of the same sex, to the People, through the never-ending process of legislation.” But no. What logically follows, in the majority’s judge-empowering estimation, is: “and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.” The “we,” needless to say, is the nine of us.   The majority is quoted as explicitly stating the 14th Amendment authors had no idea what liberty really meant, and so it's up to SCOTUS to determine it based on ""what they've learned"".  To make an analogy, those that subscribe to legal formalism would insist there must be a 13th Amendment to ban slavery and a 19th Amendment to allow women to vote. The Supreme Court can't simply start interpreting ""Persons"" throughout the Constitution to include everyone when it clearly didn't mean that at the time of passage.  Likewise, at the time the 14th Amendment was passed, they did not intend it to include same-sex marriages, so it's not relevant in this case."
badlegaladvice,3brj91,PvtSherlockObvious,3,Thu Jul 2 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"In addition, one of the reasons there won't be a big change on the polygamy front is that polyamorous people aren't a protected class.  As such, there's a much lower standard of review, and no real constitutional issues arise from the prohibition.  It could be overturned by the legislature, but as it stands, there's no real push to do so, nor any particular objections to the current situation."

badlegaladvice,3brj91,sylban,3,Wed Jul 1 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"It's not explicitly stated, but Obergefell did have an equal protection component, and while the Court didn't specifically declare a standard of review, it was clearly more than rational basis.  Based on my reading, it looked to be Intermediate w/Teeth, but only later litigation will tell for certain.

badlegaladvice,3brj91,psycoee,8,Thu Jul 2 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending the cogency of the poster's argument, but there is an argument out there, based in the legal process school, that if you're okay with the idea that same sex marriage is a fundamental right, you should be okay with the Court arguably stretching the second amendment to prevent, say, Chicago from banning handguns.  The idea is that, whether you support same sex marriage or not (I do), anyone HAS to acknowledge that the Court isn't just applying settled doctrine when it expands the right to marriage, the right to have homosexual sex, and, most recently, the right to same sex marriage.  It is clear that the Court is doing something more. So the argument goes, if you're okay with the Court doing more in one context, you can't really complain when it does more in the other.  That said, this is exactly the problem (or one problem at least) with the dissents in is Obergefell—they all voted for gun rights in McDonald and Heller, and then objected to Obergefell on legal process grounds.  So whatever. Make what you will of that."
badlegaladvice,3brj91,Frothyleet,6,Wed Jul 1 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that that argument has any merit. You are talking about different parts of the constitution being applied in different ways. It's not at all disingenuous for the Obergefell minority to say that the 14th amendment wasn't intended to apply to same-sex marriage but to believe that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms, those are just very different concepts.  Even if I am misunderstanding your argument and you are saying that it is hypocritical for the court to change a constitutional interpretation in one area (2nd amendment jurisprudence) and not in another (equal protection standards), that's a pretty weak argument in this case specifically - the question of whether the 2nd amendment protected an individual right hadn't been settled before Heller."
badlegaladvice,3brj91,veritas12345,2,Thu Jul 2 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that if the court is free to interpret the constitution with complete disregard to the original intent of the drafters (as it did in Heller), you can't really complain about the Obergefell decision, either."
badlegaladvice,3brj91,veritas12345,2,Fri Jul 3 19:22:06 2015 UTC,I'm fairly confident that the authors of Heller felt they were respecting the original intent of the 2nd amendment.
badlegaladvice,3brj91,Frothyleet,2,Fri Jul 3 19:28:09 2015 UTC,Right. But it raises the same question in a different form. Is their reading of the intent of the framers the cause or effect of their view on the substantive issue?
badlegaladvice,3brj91,veritas12345,0,Sat Jul 4 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, I suppose I'm making a couple of points.  The main one being that in both Heller/McDonald and Obergefell, the Court obviously saw its role as requiring a countermajoritarian defense of rights.  My point is that if you believe in a broad, some would say ""activist,"" role for the Court, you should at least arguably be happy with both decisions.  My secondary observation was that when the Justices like a certain right (e.g. the right wing justices and gun rights and the left wing justices and same sex marriage), they tend to talk about substantive law.  When they don't like a certain right, they talk about legal process.  No doubt, there is a way to reconcile most anything a particular group of justices does, but there are also ways to NOT reconcile what the justices do.    This is all a long way of saying that although the poster's argument sucks, it's not completely fair to say that same sex marriage and gun rights have nothing to do with each other.  They are related in that both areas raise controversial issues about how to interpret the constitution."

badlegaladvice,3brj91,SherlockBrolmes,6,Wed Jul 1 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't RTFA, but I've seen this arguments before.   However, I don't think it's gay marriage = no gun control.  The argument I'm hearing is that since the due process clause was used in McDonald, this recent decision strengthens the idea of using it to mandate CCW reciprocity.  As I understand, a CCW is legal now US wide.  Most states are 'shall issue', I think NY and CA are only 'may issue' left.  Could be wrong.   My current state has been shall issue for 55 years, and only one major shooting.  Not perfect, but...  Using the drivers license example, as I understand, SCOTUS cannot mandate nationwide CCW, because it hasn't been recognized as a right.  In fact, considering Miller, I think it could be argued the opposite, since I believe concealed is against either Geneva or Hauge.  However they can mandate that states accept licenses from each other, especially since the NHSTA financially supports the DLA.  What is needed is an equivalent for CCW.  Right now to carry in 'most' states requires three to four (Utah, Florida,  and Arizona plus your state).  Standardization is already partway there.  Now, you want to talk gun control and BadLaw, how about Miller?  From [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Miller](Wakapedia):   District Court Judge Heartsill Ragon accepted the claim and dismissed the indictment[.] … Judge Ragon provided no further explanation of his reasons. In reality, Ragon was in favor of the gun control law and ruled the law unconstitutional because he knew that Miller … would not pay a lawyer to argue the case at the Supreme Court and would simply disappear. Therefore, the government's appeal to the Supreme Court would be a sure win because Miller and his attorney would not even be present at the argument.  Neither the defendants nor their legal counsel appeared at the Supreme Court. A lack of financial support and procedural irregularities prevented counsel from traveling.   The fact the case was initiated knowing the defendant would most likely not appear, bringing a default judgement, to me smells.    And thats ignoring both the fact the weapons listed in the NFA had been used by military (They didn't say the military didn't use any short barrelled shotguns, just they never used the kind Miller possessed.), nor the argument that the NFA was in retaliation to the Bonus Army.  Edit:  also, if we were to get federal level CCW, expect similar procedures as qualifying for a NFA permit, i.e., a six month FBI background check."

There seems to be some confusion here between civil pleading practice (where failure to raise an affirmative defense at the proper stage may indeed waive it) and 5th amendment law, perhaps.  I say this because the next paragraph appears to conflate prosecutors with regular plaintiffs (i.e., saying they have the same burden of proof)."

Here in the UK, the statement read by police I believe is along the lines of 'you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be taken down and used against you in court. If you neglect to mention anything now that you subsequently rely on in court, it may harm your case'.   Basically, you don't waive your right to raise a defence, but if you are caught holding a bloodied knife over a corpse, refuse to say anything, and then later claim that there was a man in the house who committed the murder, the jury may draw their own conclusions on whether you have fabricated that story after the fact, considering your refusal to tell anyone about this other person until later."

Regardless, in neither country do you waive your right to raise an affirmative defense, you can just be impeached on your failure to raise the defense prior to trial (with the argument of ""if it was self-defense, why didn't you say it sooner?"").  The finder of fact doesn't need to accept the argument that it would naturally have been raised sooner, but they are permitted.  I'll comment briefly in more detail about the US:  Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, allowed the prosecution to use the defendant's failure to raise this defense to impeach a defendant who chose to testify.  Salinas v. Texas, 133 S. Ct. 2174, allows the use of silence as incriminating evidence whenever the defendant not subject to a custodial interrogation fails to affirmatively invoke his right to remain silent subject to a direct question.  So there are times you arguably can't be impeached by your failure to raise the argument, but there are times you can.  You don't waive the right to present the defense, though."

My guess is that, unlike driving or marrying, states have very different rules on handgun carrying. If a state does not recognize other states' marriages or driver's licenses, it essentially amounts to not acknowledging the judgment of other states in issuing the licenses (because the prerequisites to drive or marry are essentially the same everywhere). The Constitution does not allow that.  My guess is that the laws about carrying, the training required to be licensed, and the requirements about registering firearms varies so much from state-to-state that one state might have a legitimate reason for requiring people to get its licence - namely, we want to make sure you go through all of our particular steps because this is something with a lot of legal intricacies and dangerous consequences if there is a problem.

The argument goes that there isn't categorization based on race because people can still marry within their own race so you aren't denying a right to any race of people.   Runner up goes to the guy saying that courts are going to start ordering churches to perform gay weddings.   I think this also is based on suspect class reasoning confused with statutorily protected classes. I think the worry that many religious minded people have is that anti-discrimination statutes covering public accommodations will eventually force pastors not to discriminate based on sexual orientation. It stems from the wedding photographer and bakery cases that have been in the media.  This is wholly different from the Obergefell reasoning. Obergefell was the acknowledgement that marriage is a fundamental right protected by the Due Process clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.   For some very different Fourteenth Amendment reasoning that fits with the reasoning in this case I suggest people read articles by Steven Calabresi and particularly this one about discrimination based on sexual orientation. I saw a draft of that paper and it is absolutely fascinating if you like constitutional law.  I really hope he writes something about this case. I suspect he would think that the court was using the wrong part of the 14th Amendment to protect gay marriage. Either way, I had a class with the guy and he is an absolutely fascinating legal scholar. He was a founder of the eeeeeevil Federalist Society and clerked for Robert Bork and Scalia and also believes that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't allow sexual orientation discrimination, just not in the way the court decided."

badlegaladvice,3bb8i7,sylban,2,Sun Jul 5 14:26:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see how. What part of the ruling appears to dent any of the separation clauses? Can a Jewish couple demand to be married in a Baptist church now? Can a divorced man demand a Roman Catholic marriage?  Churches (more particularly, in respect to marriage, pastors) have always been fully insulated from these things by the First Amendment. That didn't change in 1967, and it's not going to change now.  You should not equate churches and pastors with main street businesses, which are places of public accommodation not mainly devoted to worship and religious practice. More, the right of businesses to turn away gays has nothing to do with this ruling; that's still legal in much of the country, as it's covered under an entirely different area of law. This ruling only says that states may not refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because they're same-sex couples.  It only intersects with public accommodation in situations where marital status is protected by law. However, that is not a federally protected status. (Unless you're a federal employee, and then only in respect to your employment.)"

Rather, it makes you liable for any deaths caused by your offending even if they wouldn't otherwise be criminal at all.  As in, if someone dies from a heart attack because they are frightened during a bank robbery you commit, you are on the hook for felony murder.

badlegaladvice,3b3i5v,LatinLover69,7,Fri Jun 26 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"I usually like the parts where Glass is not talking; I can't stand him.  The debacle is that TAL ran a breathless piece narrated almost entirely by a man who'd claimed to have gone to China and investigated working conditions at the Foxconn (sorry, misspelled above) plant where iPads are made. It was harrowing. And because it was TAL 'revealing' all this horror, a scandal erupted (and is still going on, because as Twain said, a lie can run around the earth while the truth is still getting its shoes on). Apple was embarrassed, and of course their denials only fed the cynical presumption that they just didn't give a shit and were trying to deny it or sweep it under the carpet.  A bit later, it was revealed by third-party investigators that TAL's informer was not a journalist of any kind, but some kind of performance artist, who embellished more than a little; put another way, more than a little of what he 'reported' was pretty much just made up, or cobbled together from equally vague and unsubstantiated things he'd heard or read somewhere. It was a big, sexy bag of rumours and charges, but with little to back it up.  Foxconn went so far as to bring Apple officials over to see their operations for themselves. Some of it was true, in that sense that factory work in China is not unionised, and it's often hard work with long hours. But by Chinese and South Asian standards, these are actually pretty good jobs, and it was nowhere near as bad as depicted. It was in fact pretty typical for what experts would expect to see, and not even close to what had been described in the show.  For their part, TAL suffered through the embarrassment in typical snake people fashion, humbly accepting the blame they had to, while foisting as much off as possible. And then moving on, as if that's probably not typical of that show's content. But the reality is that we can never really know how much of what's on that show is similar in its veracity.  This seems to be part of a trend in newer NPR programming. RadioLab, a show I can tolerate for only a few seconds at a time, routinely dishes out complete bullshit as perfect fact, and gets away with it because they do it in a very 'stylish' (I would say extremely irritating) way that appeals to the snake people who contribute to NPR, which at the end of the day is all that really matters from their and NPR's point of view.  Likewise, the newish live storytelling show The Moth quietly changed the wording of their (mercifully) short outro to now include a kind of flabby disclaimer. I won't take credit for that, but the change did happen after I wrote them about how my own investigation of one of the stories told on an earlier show revealed no evidence whatsoever to back it up. (The storyteller had included enough details to enable this investigation. Most do not, so we are left to take their word for it.) Why does it matter? Because they used to say that the stories were 'true,' without other qualification. Now they say, 'true, as remembered by the storytellers' (or something very similar to that; I won't claim that's exactly right). Meaning, if you bother to parse it, ""We really can't say if any of it's true, or if it's complete bullshit.¯(ツ)/¯""  The change has happened so slowly and gradually that many have not noticed, but over the last 20 years NPR has been evolving into children's programming."
badlegaladvice,3b3i5v,sylban,2,Fri Jun 26 17:32:06 2015 UTC,Glad I'm not the only one that can't stand radio lab's style.  The constant sound effects and jumbled flow are insanely grating.
badlegaladvice,3b3i5v,LatinLover69,3,Thu Jul 2 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"I worked in radio for years (still do, sort of), and used to train DJs and teach production. The traditional public radio method (used by NPR, Pacifica, etc.) is very sensible: Because listeners can't see who's speaking, you need to provide adequate cues to avoid confusion.  RadioLab throws that completely out the window, which probably seems hip and edgy to them, but the first time I heard it, I turned to someone and said, ""This must be what schizophrenia is like."" I still feel that way about it. It's extremely full of itself, and one very annoying habit of theirs (of the many) seems to be spreading across NPR: chop cuts. Chop cuts are when two (or sometimes more people) are speaking, and their bits are 'chopped' together, in a single stream. It's annoying enough on TV, when you can see who's speaking, but on radio I find it extremely annoying. Not just because it's very precious and trying to clever or cute, and distracting. Also because it's inherently disruptive to flow anytime the listener has to pause even for an instant to suss what's going on.  It's one thing if it's purely for entertainment, and that's actually characteristic of an audio style that's been its own artistic realm for decades, with some excellent examples such as Ken Nordine's cerebral and authentically clever 'Word Jazz,' or the legendary Firesign Theatre, drawing from the rich history of radio theatre.  But when mixed with informational programming, it's either educational for children (and other immature people), or just plain irritating. For a lot of us, it's the latter.

Ho, ho, ho. Someone seems to be forgetting about administrative agency hearings!  Though, you did say ""court-based."" I am wondering if that is what Our Linked Friend is thinking of in that scenario. I don't know enough about civil forfeiture to say, but perhaps there is a hearing before the agency taking the property first? Obviously you are going to have the right to appeal but agency hearings are not always before a judge, in the traditional sense."

And yes, I realize that ALJ isn't a ""real"" judge in the constitutional sense, but they're still empowered with the judge's role within their particular fiefdom.   And an interesting factoid on our friends the ALJ's:  They are the only federal judges whose positions are based entirely on merit. I have a buddy who's been working toward an SSI ALJ position for the last couple of years, and what he's shared has been really interesting. It's a totally different world."
badlegaladvice,3actm5,DaSilence,5,Fri Jun 19 03:06:18 2015 UTC,"In the federal scheme, which I know much less about, you usually get an ALJ, but you can have hearings before administrators as well.  In state agencies it is all over the map. You have zoning boards, liquor licensing boards, environmental agency boards, etc., etc. Sometimes they are a town council, sometimes they are professional environmental regulators. They may have a legal background, they may be whoever happened to be elected to the town council. Then you have things like municipal court or housing court, whose decisions get treated like judicial agency decisions, but, of course, that varies by jurisdiction."

Sure, there's a legal(ish) component (vibe?), but it's not really a legal proceeding.   As an example, an elected body can take testimony, then vote to condemn and exercise eminent domain, but all that's doing is authorizing the city attorney to file the requisite paperwork with the court holding jurisdiction.   The owner can lose at the panel level but prevail in court."
badlegaladvice,3actm5,DaSilence,2,Fri Jun 19 06:28:52 2015 UTC,"No you can have a legal proceeding that is random agency members. Just one example is unemployment benefits. If they are denied (at least in my law school jurisdiction) you get a hearing before a board. The board is just made up of administrators from the Department of Labor and Training, not an ALJ or judge. Liquor licensing is similar. You get a hearing before the liquor board which is just a few members of the town counsel. It's a ""judicial"" proceeding and you can submit evidence and be represented by counsel etc. but the board is just a few members of the town counsel."
badlegaladvice,3actm5,CupBeEmpty,2,Fri Jun 19 09:45:25 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that the administrative procedure act authorizes this exact procedure in every administrative case unless an organic statute says otherwise.  So it's not just random states that have administrative hearings in front of agency heads rather than independent ALJs.  The default rule is that every federal agency can adjudicate that way.  Further, even there is a hearing in front of an ALJ, the agency itself can choose to review all findings of fact and conclusions of law de novo.  So essentially, ALJ rulings only stand when the agency heads agree with them."

No. I'm not sure how you're having issues comprehending what I'm writing, so let me try to break it down for you:  Person A says ""the death penalty is unconstitutional.""  Person B says ""I think the death penalty is unconstitutional.""  Person C says ""I want to make the death penalty unconstitutional.""  A and C are badlegal. A is a misstatement of law (defining law as what the person WANTS it to be as opposed to what it ACTUALLY is), and C is a misunderstanding of how the law works.  B is not badlegal, because it's sharing an opinion or belief.   The poster I highlighted is both A and C. He's not sharing a belief or desire that civil forfeiture be amended or made illegal. He's stating that it is unconstitutional. Or (presumably based on his extensive study and learned opinion) should be so.  Well, the Supreme Court disagrees."

Unless the OP is actually perpetuating a theory that says that civil forfeiture would be overruled in court if you ""make this secret constitutional argument that district attorneys don't want you to know"" they are clearly sharing an opinion. What should and shouldn't be constitutional is often discussed casually in American political discourse. This attitude is even furthered by the fact the Supreme Court makes media-worthy new precedents on a fairly regular basis.  Also, your Person C could mean that she wants a constitutional amendment or that she wants to load the court with justices who agree with her opinions."

But he did say it was a potentially legitimate argument that the government can make, so here it is for your enjoyment.  Rule 2: I don't want to get hyper-theoretical and talk about what money signifies, but as far as I understand it essentially signifies a debt owed to the holder by the Federal Reserve Banks. So the value of the money itself is not the property of the Treasury, otherwise it would be worthless paper. A debt owned by someone qualifies as property.  Practically speaking though, paper money is of course the property of the holder. If you steal paper money from someone, it is theft against that person - the Fed/Treasury has no claim against you. The paper itself has value, regardless of who issues it. For the government to take paper money from someone requires due process* as would taking any other tangible thing or thing of value.  *Civil forfeiture is obviously the thing at issue here, but that is an entirely separate issue. It is not justified by claiming that there is no property interest in paper money or that the government already owns it anyway. Civil forfeiture can also be used on land, cars, jewelry, etc. - clearly things not owned by the Treasury."

But yes, having taken Legal Profession, this would be a violation of Client Attorney Privilege. But there's not actually a client, so CAP wouldn't be violated here."
badlegaladvice,3a6go8,SherlockBrolmes,6,Wed Jun 17 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"The elements of establishing a civil RICO violation are: (1) operation and management of an enterprise, (2) through a pattern of racketeering activity that (3) leads to plaintiff's injuries.  It's not a ""criminal organization"" per se, but since the racketeering activities are crimes and you have to prove an enterprise, ""criminal organization"" could be a rhetorical way of putting it.  Still, usually a ""criminal organization"" means the organization is primarily pursuing criminal activities, but RICO doesn't require that.  ""Racketeering activity"" is defined in 18 USC 1961, and is the ""predicate act"" I was referring to.  But CFAA violations are not listed there (there have been some attempts to get it added, though).  (By the way, establishing a predicate act in a civil RICO lawsuit does not require an underlying criminal investigation or conviction.)  But if you want to go after some sort of computer hacking activity, you could use wire fraud (18 USC 1343), for example.  One of the more difficult aspects of civil RICO (from a policy perspective) is that ""enterprise"" is defined really broadly: ""any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.""  A shallow analysis could pretty easily establish that reddit and its admins are an ""enterprise,"" although that would apply to any corporation.  During the 1980s, plaintiffs' attorneys would often bring civil RICO actions against corporations that had committed ""run-of-the-mill"" securities fraud (because you get treble damages), and that got really out of hand, so Congress put an exception to securities fraud as a predicate act for private RICO actions (see 18 USC 1964(c)).  Still, courts are a little wary of letting private parties bring RICO claims just because an organization happened to violate one of the predicate acts.  There usually needs to be something egregious (to establish a ""pattern of racketeering activity."")."

However, in this Pao case there was some law, which I can't find the details of, that required her to pay litigation costs because the defendant won on all counts and had offered a settlement.

badlegaladvice,3aap74,maestro876,15,Thu Jun 18 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"I'm the person who gave the ""bad legal advice."" Gotta defend myself. This is not bad legal advice. It's not even legal advice, but that's a whole other thing.  Prevailing parties get their costs paid by the non-prevailing party in my state and in federal court. Far as I can tell, that's also the case in California under CAL. CCP. CODE § 1032. The prevailing party ""includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.""  I haven't been following the Pao case super closely, but I don't think she won on any claim. So the plaintiff didn't obtain any relief and defendant is the prevailing party here.   I think the ""some law"" you're referring to is an Offer of Judgment. I'm not 100% on California Civil Procedure, but in my state and federal court a defendant can make a formal offer to the plaintiff more than fourteen days before trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 68. If the plaintiff rejects the offer, goes to trial, and fails to get a verdict better than the defendant's offer of judgment, then the defendant is entitled to their costs from the time the offer was made.  Like I said, haven't really been following this case. But if Pao lost entirely ($0) judgment, defendant gets all of their costs. I think that's what happened here. If Pao got some small judgment that did not beat the defendant's offer of judgment, she would have been the prevailing party. But defendant would still get their costs from the point they made the offer of judgment on."

""Costs"" for the ""prevailing party"" are the law, but it's often extremely difficult for the plaintiff to not be a ""prevailing party"" under the law.  As for costs - to my knowledge, costs typically include expert witnesses (subject to a cap). I know that's the case in federal court and the state where I practice.

'Disbursements' are monies paid to the court or other entities that usually comprise of administrative costs (like filing fees, paying witnesses, paying experts, ordering transcripts, paying for paper copies of judgements etc.)  Both are paid by the client and itemized on their invoices.  But fees are charged directly by the attorney, while disbursements that are charged to a client are usually done so to reimburse the attorney for the admin costs that he/she probably preemptively paid as a matter of course during and throughout the trial process.

In common law systems, it is rarely formalized in statutes which would bring the penalty of law down upon those who fail to rescue. This does not necessarily obviate a moral duty to rescue: though law is binding and carries government-authorized sanctions, there are also separate ethical arguments for a duty to rescue that may prevail even where law does not punish failure to rescue.

The first two aspects constitute sexual assault, the third makes a very strong base for rape / abuse and this case should have been treated as such.    I mean, what can you say? Breaking a contract does not fall under rape. Frozen embryos are treated here the same way as a pet, i.e., personal property. Regardless of whether you think the ex-girlfriend should win ownership of them, it's in no way, shape, or form an act of her raping or otherwise sexually assaulting her ex-boyfriend if she impregnates herself or a surrogate with the frozen embryo.   Also:   This was pointed out by the higher court when they handed the resolution saying that essentially, if this “oral contract” was to be viable, then both side’s hearsay had to be equally viable – but even this flies in the face of the US legal system.   Testimony about oral contracts is not even an exception to hearsay: it's not hearsay to begin with. The terms of an oral contract are offered as operative fact, that is, not to prove that the contract was made, but rather what the terms are.

badlegaladvice,39mdv3,weredawitewimenat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite quotes from Learned Hand (though, unfortunately, the Second Circuit then went on to the exact wrong result):  Nevertheless, it is unquestionably true that from the very outset the courts have at least kept in reserve the possibility that the origin of a monopoly may be critical in determining its legality; and for this they had warrant in some of the congressional debates which accompanied the passage of the Act. In Re Greene, C.C. Ohio, 52 F. 104, 116, 117; United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, 8 Cir., 58 F. 58, 82, 24 L.R.A. 73. This notion has usually been expressed by saying that size does not determine guilt; that there must be some ‘exclusion’ of competitors; that the growth must be something else than ‘natural’ or ‘normal’; that there must be a ‘wrongful intent,’ or some other specific intent; or that some ‘unduly’ coercive means must be used. At times there has been emphasis upon the use of the active verb, ‘monopolize,’ as the judge noted in the case at bar. United States v. Standard Oil Co., C.C. Mos., 173 F. 466, 478; Patterson v. United States, 6 Cir., 222 F. 599, 619; National Biscuit Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 299 F. 733, 738. What engendered these compunctions is reasonably plain; persons may unwittingly find themselves in possession of a monopoly, automatically so to say: that is, without having intended either to put an end to existing competition, or to prevent  *430 competition from arising when none had existed; they may become monopolists by force of accident. Since the Act makes ‘monopolizing’ a crime, as well as a civil wrong, it would be not only unfair, but presumably contrary to the intent of Congress, to include such instances. A market may, for example, be so limited that it is impossible to produce at all and meet the cost of production except by a plant large enough to supply the whole demand. Or there may be changes in taste or in cost which drive out all but one purveyor. A single producer may be the survivor out of a group of active competitors, merely by virtue of his superior skill, foresight and industry. In such cases a strong argument can be made that, although the result may expose the public to the evils of monopoly, the Act does not mean to condemn the resultant of those very forces which it is its prime object to foster: finis opus coronat. The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.  United States v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 148 F.2d 416, 429-30 (2d Cir. 1945) (Hand, J.)"

Even there, there is no law about a private entity removing content being ""unlawful censorship of legitimate journalism.""  Whether or not a state could do so, consistent with the First Amendment, is an unsettled matter.   Full comment, in reference to why it would be illegal for Google to comply with France's order to apply the ""right to be forgotten"" worldwide:   Anti-censorship laws. In some US states, removing links to articles about an event (because a person linked to that event is demanding their removal in France) could constitute unlawful censorship of legitimate journalism, or even of protected free speech. This could not only lead to much bigger fines than whatever France might try to ""impose"" on Google, but could lead to the complete and irrevocable termination of the company and legal consequences for its leadership.  Meanwhile, the very worst that could reasonably happen if Google both ignores the ""sanctions"" and continues to operate in France is a demand to the US that Google leadership be deported to France for trial... which would bring its own international shitstorm and would almost certainly resolve in Google's leaders' favor -- not to mention the whole legal maze about other nations holding leadership accountable for the actions of an american legal person."

If you're talking about /r/asksciencefiction, then no, it's not like /r/shittyaskscience. It's about giving in-universe explanations to questions. So, for instance, ""why does Gandalf come back to life?"" isn't explained as ""Tolkien really needed Gandalf around to deus ex machina the plot in the second and third books,"" but with an explanation of divine nature and angelic spirits and all that.

Even before that, it had no profit and survived solely on the good graces and money of its CEO. So your claims, while likely meritorious, are not going to be worth anything.   How about that?"
badlegaladvice,39lkre,ANewMachine615,3,Fri Jun 12 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"Jumping in here to defend my point: InGen is apparently the parent company of JW, but JW has a ton of independence in terms of its projects, access to its projects, use of its assets, and control of the island. I doubt highly they're joint venturers. I'd wager InGen licensed whatever genetic tech it needed to to JW -- but much of it is JW's, as shown by InGen clandestinely extracting JW lab assets just to get access to it.  I don't think they're joint venturers, and if the level of independence demonstrated by the park in the crisis is universal, I'm not so sure you pierce the corporate veil to get at InGen, either.   seeing as how the Park wouldn't exist without InGen's dinosaurs   The lead scientist was apparently hiding his collaboration with InGen from the park. I think the park owned the dinosaurs.   InGen likely has some profit-sharing agreement with the Park   Unlikely. They were desperate to get their hands on the practical outcome (trained dinosaurs), and didn't seem to care if the park itself was profitable -- but even then, they had no direct access to the park's assets. They were only able to commandeer the raptors after the death of the park's CEO, in a state of emergency."
badlegaladvice,39lkre,ANewMachine615,5,Fri Jun 12 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS BELOW - Read at your own risk.   So unless the attack was due to some negligence or recklessness of the Park employees, InGen would probably have to indemnify the Park. Especially if InGen is the parent corp to the Park.   Well, the breach at the aviary was because the CEO of Jurassic World decided to, without his license, fly a helicopter which had been armed with military-grade firepower. He crashed into the aviary, releasing the animals within, who caused pretty much every death or injury during the crisis (with the exception of one person killed by a combination of the aviary animals and the mososaurus). Of course, the super-dino only made it that far because they refused to authorize lethal force against something designed to be basically a bigger, badder predator than anything else going. And because they failed to share containment-relevant information about super-dino's capabilities with, y'know, the people charged with containing it. And... and and and. The list of shit JW staff screwed up goes on for a while.

Poster may have meant battery, which is a harmful or offensive contact with a person without their consent. Offensive is an objective standard (act would offend a reasonable person).  Either way, no reasonable person would find high-fiving to be offensive, and it is certainly not harmful. Suing this person for assault would be a good way to waste however much a filing fee costs."

It wouldn't apply to everyone in the video, but every person who saw the high five coming would have a claim for assault as well as the battery (except for folks who dodged, who would only be able to claim assault). Again, that's in a world where high fives were likely to be actionable.  I would note also that it's not impossible for a high five to be the basis for a claim for assault or battery. While generally the basic test is whether contact is objectively offensive, there is an exception of the tortfeasor knows or has reason to know that the plaintiff is particularly susceptible. So, e.g., if a person obviously has an injured hand, or is talking loudly about how they absolutely cannot stand it when others touch their hands (and the tortfeasor overhears), than the otherwise objectively inoffensive contact can still be actionable."

I guess so, but that is a really big assumption that I don't think could ever hold weight. High fives are pretty universally considered non-offensive (except for cases like below).  I agree completely with your second paragraph. If you have any reason to know it will be particularly offensive to an individual - such as them telling you they don't want you to do it - you would get assault/battery."

A person is guilty of theft if that person:   Knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over the property of another, with intent to deprive the owner of his or her property   Successfully making it out the door with what you've stolen isn't what makes it theft, ""exerting unauthorized control (yanking the phone off the display) with intent to deprive the owner of his or her property (running for the door with it)"" is what makes it theft.  Also the claim is ""Technically he didn't commit a crime."" Even if this guy finds a lawyer to argue there was no intent to deprive and a jury dumb enough to believe it this is still clear-cut vandalism, he tears the phone stand off the wall while trying to steal the phone."

badlegaladvice,38v4m3,nagato-yuki,2,Sun Jun 7 12:47:02 2015 UTC,"The right of a private firm to self-censor is not necessarily protected by freedom of speech. Your example of a bakery is not necessarily correct, as in states where sexual orientation is a protected class, such suits against bakeries (as well as other businesses, such as florists) have been successful. Even if other states choose not to prohibit that conduct, it is not protected under freedom of speech. For another example of censorship by a private firm not being protected by freedom of speech, and in fact being barred by it, see the Pruneyard case in California."
badlegaladvice,38v4m3,nagato-yuki,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"I thought that Pruneyard was based on California's grant of an affirmative right to free speech rather than the First Amendment, and the Supreme Court upheld based on California's ability to grant rights more expansive than those guaranteed by the constitution."
badlegaladvice,38v4m3,abk006,3,Mon Jun 8 20:13:18 2015 UTC,"It's not identical to the bakery example, but it's still sort of relevant. California's state constitution was held to provide an affirmative right to free speech, which could limit censorship by private individuals in some circumstances. States are only free to grant more expansive rights than those provided in the US constitution if those rights do not violate other protections in the US constitution. The shopping center argued that California prohibiting them from engaging in censorship violated the US constitution, but that argument was rejected by the Supreme Court. Censorship by private individuals is not automatically protected by freedom of speech at either the federal or state level and may be prohibited by law under at least some circumstances."
badlegaladvice,38v4m3,abk006,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"Sure, I get that a state might affirmatively grant the right to speak on someone's property and call it free speech, but the fact that the majority of states have language mirroring Caifornia's and only like two others follow California's interpretation is kind of instructive. I don't think the argument is necessarily that a private business is entitled under the First Amendment to bar all speakers from its property, but that their doing so doesn't infringe on any prevalent notion of free speech, and certainly not the right of free speech embodied in the First Amendment.   Good discussion."

Honestly, though, I wish people would stop citing that quote from Tinker as meaningful precedent.  Because the Court left the door open with the ""substantial disruption"" standard, every time since that I'm aware of the Supreme Court has heard a case about free speech in schools, the Court has ruled against the students.  Some notable examples:   Bethel School District v. Frazier (school could discipline student for speech containing sexual innuendo but not obscenity) Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier (school could censor student-run newsletter: ""[a] school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with 'its basic educational mission'...even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school"") Of course Morse, where a school could censor speech off campus because the school happened to have an event there too   So while students technically maintain First Amendment rights in school, the Supreme Court has carved out exceptions that apply any meaningful time that those rights would be cited.  In other words, anytime the speech from the student is provocative enough so as to actually need First Amendment protection, the First Amendment probably doesn't apply.  This of course doesn't make OP's statement true if it's as broad as how /u/dedtired quoted them.  For example, the Fourth Amendment actually does still apply in abrogated form, requiring reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause for a search on school grounds (per New Jersey v. T. L. O.), recently applied in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (strip search of 14-year-old was, in that case at least, unconstitutional)."

You can't force Facebook to approve or support your opinion any more than Illinois Nazis could force the Anti-Defamation League to put up a poster praising Adolf Hitler.    No one's stopping anyone's free expression; in fact, it's the opposite.  The law allows any person or organization to freely express themselves, which includes putting out opposing opinions, supporting opinions, or no opinion at all.

That said, and if I recall correctly, your view has some very limited support in the caselaw regarding speech at shopping malls.

Well, you do know that this kind of argument has been going on for a long time... not just regarding the internet either. Unless you want to remove control from the owner of a private forum that is made available to the public, you don't have an argument to make."

badlegaladvice,38mvah,sylban,5,Fri Jun 5 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"You want to utterly violate the 1st Amendment, you want to FORCE a private party to provide a platform for things they don't like, you want to ensure that the Gov will shit all over various rights...  And all because people do not have the right to shit all over the place without exception...   I don't want to change the first amendment   Remember saying that? I guess you do want to change it... you want to make sure that some people have the right to free expression violated by the Gov so that others can shit all over private property. It being the internet means nothing... it is private property, paid for and funded by a private party. Just because it is made available to the public doesn't mean it is a Public Forum. It's still private.  It's like if you hosted a meeting in your house... you do not at all have to provide a platform for everyone, and that is the exact criteria you need to apply to places like Reddit. Their house, their rules... if they don't want you spewing crap, you get kicked out. To insist otherwise is to insist that the very Free Expression you are so concerned about is just a phrase used to crowbar your unwanted speech in...  Like I said... this argument has been going on ever since we got radio... hell, in it's own way it's been around since mass-printing took off and we got newspapers. Every time the conclusion is that forcing a private party to provide a platform for something they do not agree with is violating their free expression... and the ones who want the platform? They can provide their own, or find one that will accept them.  Oh, and you know this Internet thing? The only reason it's so free is because it's hardly limited by the Gov at all. What you propose will stifle everyone's free expression... a ""solution"" that is worse than the problem.  :edit: and before I forget... if you are indeed taking control of the forum from the owner, who will be paying for it from then on? Don't even consider saying the one who you just wrested control from..."
badlegaladvice,38imyj,foofus,12,Thu Jun 4 13:45:33 2015 UTC,"My first post to /r/badlegaladvice, so I hope I'm doing it right.  R2: it's not 100% awful, but there are lots of incomplete statements masquerading as comprehensive answers. Some examples:   Workers' comp is generally the exclusive remedy for an injury sustained within the scope of employment, but there are often exceptions (e.g., for extra-hazardous conditions, recklessness on the part of the employer, etc.) Declining workers' compensation benefits doesn't create a right to sue   There's plenty of worse legal advice on reddit, but I thought this one was interesting because it had sort of overlapping misstatements of the law."

badlegaladvice,38imyj,swankandahalf,4,Thu Jun 4 17:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Most people understand better if you flip the hypothetical. WC has to protect against the catastrophically expensive, the stuff that puts the employer out of business. In large part, that's why he has it, just like you carry medical insurance to cover the million dollar surgery when a drunk runs you over. If an injured employee could go outside WC whenever his plaintiff's lawyer deemed their chances better at trial, it would be pretty poor insurance."

If by ""a lot"", you mean ""two"", then I guess so.  Not a law-talkin' dude here, but I can say that it's not nearly as complicated as most people think, assuming you haven't sat on it so long that the logs no longer exist.   Start by getting Reddit to cough up the IP address of the poster along with the date and time of the posting - they will surely have it, at least for some period of time.  Once you have that, a simple lookup will tell you who the owner of that netblock is - i.e., which ISP controls that particular range of IP addresses.  Subpoena that ISP for the name/account information of the person who was assigned that IP address at the time of the post - again, the ISP will surely have it, at least for some period of time.  Hell, if you're the cops, big ISPs like Comcast and Verizon have a private number and a private helpdesk just for you to service your warrant requests, of which they get a lot.    This doesn't mean that the exercise will necessarily be productive.  It's possible to hide behind an anonymous proxy or use something like Tor to keep your identity hidden - realistically, almost no one does, though.  And of course, if the netblock lookup indicates that the poster is in the Ukraine or Nigeria or some such...well, good luck with that.  But technically speaking, it's really not that hard to do.  It probably takes longer to type up the subpoena than it does to do the actual lookups.  That being said, I would imagine you'll run into the usual semi-retarded ""defenses"" people would likely put up.  ""You can't prove it wasn't my grandmother/toddler/dog who posted that from my computer!"" Or, ""someone must have hacked my wi-fi!""  or whatever.

badlegaladvice,389gtw,basilect,15,Tue Jun 2 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"R2: Even though the majority of states and federal law are ""one-party"" states, where eavesdropping laws only require the consent of one party, there's a reason why every customer service hotline notifies you that they're recording the call beforehand. California, for example, is an ""all-party"" state (requiring consent from all parties to a private conversation) that has found jurisdiction if any party to the call is in California. So even if you're a New Yorker calling a collections agency, you're criminally liable if the employee at the other end of the line is in a call center in Burbank (Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc.).  As for the claim that you can record them back after they notify you that they're recording without telling them, I haven't seen any exception like that in law, or in the opinions of CA lawyers and legal organizations. There may be something in case law that I haven't found. But in any case it's far from prudent to tell someone to ""go ahead and record"".  Moving on to the East Coast, Connecticut (another all-party state) makes my R2 much easier by delineating criteria for what constitutes an appropriate notification of recording:   52-570d. Action for illegal recording of private telephonic communications. (a) No person shall use any instrument, device or equipment to record an oral private telephonic communication unless the use of such instrument, device or equipment (1) is preceded by consent of all parties to the communication and such prior consent either is obtained in writing or is part of, and obtained at the start of, the recording, or (2) is preceded by verbal notification which is recorded at the beginning and is part of the communication by the recording party, or (3) is accompanied by an automatic tone warning device which automatically produces a distinct signal that is repeated at intervals of approximately fifteen seconds during the communication while such instrument, device or equipment is in use.   If you're doing what /u/DStoo recommends here  and repeating a message back to a recorded voice, do you think that would constitute consent? Do you even know if the recording device activates at that point? Why would you do something like that if you weren't trying to avoid actually telling a person that you were recording them?"

In most jurisdictions there will be a mix of both. What you're getting hung up on the difference between mens rea (which is subjective and personal to the defendant) and the mental state of the victim of the crime. For example, in Texas's ""stalking"" law, there are two distinct mental states regarding the fear of bodily injury induced by a threat: (1) the victim's subjective state of fear and (2) the ""reasonable person"" standard for determining whether that subjective state of fear is reasonable.   For example, let's say that Vinny Victim is a person diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. When Mulligan and Assoc. law firm sends him a friendly letter reminding him of his court date, he could subjectively perceive that as an attempt to lure him into a booby trap. He would have a subjective state of fear, but it's not one an ordinary person of reasonable caution would have.

Interpretation? Take your pick.  The opinion itself merely states that the government cannot create a ""strict liability"" threat offense where a reasonable person, in the same circumstances as the victim, perceives the conduct as threatening. There must additionally be some other component (a mens rea or guilty mental state of the defendant) that the defendant intended the statement to be taken as a threat, or was at least aware that the other person might regard it as such.  So, if I jokingly say to you, ""/u/jpflathead, I'm going to beat your ass!"", I have to understand that you might not know I'm joking and could interpret my statement as a threat, and that a reasonable person also could interpret my statement as a threat. But if I were to say instead, ""/u/jpflathead, you deserve a kick in the nuts!"" I might have a mens rea defense (assuming I could convince the judge or jury) that I did not know a reasonable person might consider that a threat.   KiA misunderstood the point of the opinion. Whether the listener or a reasonable person would find the statement threatening does not make a threat ""credible."" As the statute at issue was written, there was no mens rea requirement that the person making the threat intend to make a threat or know that a reasonable person might consider the statement threatening. And when the OP states:   is also an indicator of how cases like LWu's will be handled going forward (assuming a police report is filed in the first place).   they are talking out of their ass, because there's no guarantee that all future prosecutions would be under the same statute at issue in Elonis, and the case is not dismissed against Elonis -- it will be remanded to the intermediate appellate court to determine whether the evidence supports a knowing, or even potentially a reckless, mental state on Elonis's behalf.  Any reader of KiA who, quite unbeknownst to the OP, would take this as free license to send harassing texts and later attempt to claim ""IT WAS JUST A PRANK, BRO!

OK, that's fine, seems like basic 1L Crim Law to me.  The Court further explains that ""negligence"" is not the proper standard, while implying that a mental state below ""knowledge"" might suffice.  That is, under the interstate threat statute, if you make a threat with the knowledge that someone would reasonably perceive it as a threat, then that can be criminally culpable under the statute (without addressing whether this meets constitutional standards under the First Amendment.)  As this would apply to dickwheels who threaten people with rape on the internet, it probably doesn't exculpate their behavior, particularly when they ""dox"" the targets of their online threats.

For obvious chilling effect reasons, they've consistently held that just providing the platform is insufficient.  Most of the time, the admin has to be actively involved in the wrongdoing, or so judicious about monitoring the site that their failure to remove the content acts as a tacit approval.  The fact that those ""how rude can you be?""-style sites weren't found liable for defamation speaks to how involved they have to be.  Even with those revenge porn sites, the owners were mostly liable because their business practices were so extortionate.  All that having been said, there is definite precedent for applying criminal guilt for operating a website.  The two big reasons are because the website owner either set up the website almost explicitly as an outlet for illegal activity (see torrent websites or Megaupload) and when the owner is profiting from illegal activity (see again revenge porn websites and their use of extortion).  Ulbricht falls smack into both, with a heaping helping of personal involvement in specific illegal activity as well.

The response letter also clearly explained that speculation is only a part of my activities on MKM, since a lot of the cards in my stock come from redeemed complete sets, i.e. winnings on Magic Online.   And incidentally, that's also where the Bonus R2 comes in, which I find especially amusing. No OP, just because you're losing money it doesn't mean you're not running a business, it just means you're running a bad business.  Aside from that, thank you for the summary!"

badlegaladvice,37wghc,Kanthes,1 point,Sun May 31 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Well, at least with a patent, there is a cause of action (someone is infringing your patent).  The main problem there is just that patent lawsuits are inordinately expensive for no good reason.  But generally you can't sue someone without a cause of action.  For example, I couldn't sue someone for not paying their taxes, I could only report them to the authorities and wait for them to investigate."
badlegaladvice,37wghc,psycoee,2,Sun May 31 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"Does your jurisdiction have an unfair competition law? California has Business and Professions Code 17200, which allows standing for a plaintiff against another business who violates a law that gives them an unfair business advantage.   The big hurdle for standing is that the plaintiff needs to show they lost some money somehow because of the defendant's broke (pretty much) any law. Saying that someone can undercut them on price because they're not paying their taxes would be sufficient.  My understanding is that most states had similar legislation, though I'd bet they handle the standing differently."
badlegaladvice,37wghc,IWasElectrocuted,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's crazy that a private party can file suit to enforce a law without any other cause of action.   Don't you guys have private prosecutions?  I'm in Australia, and it's still perfectly possible (even if not terribly often done) for a private party to bring a prosecution in respect of a criminal offence.  And a lot of our consumer protection laws can be enforced by private parties who aren't direct ""victims"" too.  So if you run misleading ads your competitor is welcome to sue you over it."
badlegaladvice,37wghc,iamplasma,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:29:16 2015 UTC,"Most likely, Germany's unfair competition law is the basis for this.    The Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb (UWG) is supposed to both protect consumers and competitors against unfair practices such as false advertising. In general, it allows for recovery of damages as well as demanding others to cease and desist those practices (even without losses, this is also often used by consumer protection organizations).  It prohibits generally misleading statements, but a particular part of the appendix (which lists some specific prohibited things) stands out. It prohibits   (23) die unwahre Angabe oder das Erwecken des unzutreffenden Eindrucks, der Unternehmer sei Verbraucher oder nicht für Zwecke seines Geschäfts, Handels, Gewerbes oder Berufs tätig;      (23) falsely stating or creating the impression that the entrepreneur [official translation for lack of a better word, basically the business] is a consumer or not acting for purposes relating to his business, trade, craft or profession;     So, this would hinge on whether OP's card sales make him a businessman. What defines that exactly? Let's go on a trip through German law:   Unternehmer ist eine natürliche oder juristische Person oder eine rechtsfähige Personengesellschaft, die bei Abschluss eines Rechtsgeschäfts in Ausübung ihrer gewerblichen oder selbständigen beruflichen Tätigkeit handelt      An entrepreneur means a natural or legal person or a partnership with legal personality who or which, when entering into a legal transaction, acts in exercise of his or its trade, business or profession.   (§ 14 Abs. 1 BGB, see also § 2 UWG)    Now that isn't very helpful, is it? Usually, this ends up being a case-by-case determination. Let's have a look at case law, in particular at judgment 6 W 27/07 at the OLG Frankfurt (the standards will vary a little across the country, but this is a very good representation). Some highlights (I'm not going to translate them directly, because I'm lazy):   Eine gewerbliche Tätigkeit setzt ein selbständiges und planmäßiges, auf eine gewisse Dauer angelegtes Anbieten entgeltlicher Leistungen am Markt voraus, wobei eine Gewinnerzielungsabsicht nicht erforderlich ist   Basically, you need to be doing it for some time, but you don't need to actually want to make money.   die Tätigkeit des Unternehmers [ist] von vornherein auf die Vornahme einer Vielzahl von Geschäften ausgerichtet   Also, you need to want to make quite a few sales (in that case, there were 484 sales within a year, so OP with some 2200 sales over 5 years would likely also qualify).   Richtig ist allerdings, dass das Merkmal des Weiterverkaufs in der Abgrenzung zu privaten Gelegenheitsverkäufen für eine gewerbliche Tätigkeit spricht, während Verkäufe aus einem privaten Bestand eher dem nicht unternehmerischen Bereich zuzuordnen sein werden.   If you buy things to resell them, it is much more likely you fall under ""business"" rather than ""consumer"" than when you sell your private property. OP did resell things.    TL;DR: OP probably counts as a business. Him claiming he was just a consumer was likely illegal (because it might mislead consumers) and will probably backfire. Why might it mislead consumers, you ask: There is quite a few consumer protection laws that apply to business-to-consumer sales, but not to consumer-to-consumer sales, so people may have been misinformed about their rights regarding warranties required by law and others. Oh, and then I also have no clue about sales tax, VAT and the likes (there might be something in there too).  Hope I brought some clarity into this...

If there's a right way, it's negotiating with the seller.

I doubt a seller is going to get specific performance on these facts, simply because we're assuming a financing contingency and the buyer is only losing financing because he's disclosing a material fact to the lender.

Edit: not badlaw, but an interesting aside: the physical paper's headline reads ""California bill would sanction lane-splitting,"" which, despite being momentarily confusing to someone used to the ""penalty"" meaning, is actually a much more accurate choice of words than ""legalize."""
badlegaladvice,37lari,green_and_yellow,9,Thu May 28 13:29:19 2015 UTC,"That's generally the way it works. It often leads to confusion where things seem like they should be illegal, or are illegal in other states, but there is no law on the books in your state.  For example, in Ohio, ""No person shall operate a motor vehicle while wearing earphones over, or earplugs in, both ears."" ORC 4511.84.  If you Google the same thing for Michigan, you get all kinds of silly answers. ""Well, there's no law... but but recklessness!"" That, in my opinion, is a ridiculous (and in the case of the link, self-serving) answer. Some results just plain refuse to answer the question, because (1) it feels wrong to say it's okay to drive with headphones in both ears, and (2) it's pretty tough to do the actual due diligence required to show that something isn't illegal.  The lane-splitting thing is identical. Nobody wants to say it's legal, even though it is completely, 100% legal.  To say that something is potentially illegal because someone could commit another offense while doing it is the same thing as saying driving is potentially illegal, because you could potentially be drunk while doing it. It's ridiculous, and annoying to lawyers who are used to keeping separate elements... separate."
badlegaladvice,37lari,AveSharia,4,Thu May 28 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"Could lane splitting be covered by California's reckless driving statute?  Also, in a personal injury context, I wonder if lane splitting would be considered per se negligence."
badlegaladvice,37lari,ANewMachine615,7,Thu May 28 14:16:08 2015 UTC,"I am not certified in California. More generally, absent any other legislation, a case could be made that lane splitting is reckless. Note to would-be lawyers: Reckless doesn't mean ""I don't like it,"" or ""it seems unsafe."" Reckless means:   A person who drives a vehicle upon a highway in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property   I presume that there is a boatload of auto accident caselaw in California clarifying that some more. But were I a judge, I would be skeptical. It would be particularly difficult to convince me given the studies cited in OP's article. (I am also do not drive a motorcycle, FWIW)  In the two cases that I found mentioning lane-splitting, the defendants were held reckless, but (1) actually caused damages to others, and/or (2) engaged in other reckless behavior than lane-splitting.  People v. Diaz, Cal: Court of Appeal, 2nd Appellate Dist., 6th Div. 2013   It is uncontroverted that appellant refused to pull over and instigated a police chase in which he drove recklessly through residential and business areas, ran a red light and hit a car, performed dangerous lane changes, cut off motorists, nearly hit a large utility truck carrying hazardous materials, and endangered the lives of motorists, pedestrians, and officers.   People v. KHANKHANIAN, Cal: Court of Appeal, 2nd Appellate Dist., 8th Div. 2014   A number of witnesses described the dangerous manner in which defendant was driving, including speeding, tailgating, lane splitting and using the shoulder to pass slower traffic. Several drivers called 911 to report defendant's reckless driving.   Obviously, none of that matters if this bill passes, since California's proposed law only sanctions some lane-splitting in the sense that it bans other lane-splitting:   The measure would allow motorcycles to travel between cars at speeds up to 15 mph faster than the flow of traffic, up to a speed of 50 mph...  The speed limits were determined with the help of the CHP and a safety study by UC Berkeley professor Tom Rice.   In a personal injury context, you would have to have, you know... a personal injury. Further negligence per se is a legal term of art that means a duty of care was violated because a statute was violated. So, if lane splitting doesn't already violate a statute, it cannot be negligence per se. It may constitute ordinary negligence, but then, like all negligence cases, all the facts surrounding the lane splitting would be considered.  Because I'm not a California lawyer, none of this considers any specific automobile negligence regime California may have. My answer would be particularly different, for example, in Michigan, where we have a no-fault act."
badlegaladvice,37lari,green_and_yellow,5,Thu May 28 14:34:46 2015 UTC,"Per se negligence requires that you be violating a specific prohibition designed to prevent the harm you caused by your violation. No specific prohibition, no per se negligence."

Adding to AveSharia's post, since the CHP has given safety guidelines openly (they match the prospective law) it would be hard to argue that you're reckless if riding within them. There are also reports on filtering/splitting that establish it's actually safer (particularly for the motorcyclist--rear-end collisions are more likely when your bike blends into the brake lights of the car in front of you, and can be quite deadly for a rider).   The popular opinion--grains of salt--is that if a LEO wanted to hassle you, it'd either be for the frequent lane changes necessary to dodge mirrors or for the fact that you actually occupy two lanes most of the time when you count handlebars and mirrors.   What CA doesn't make illegal are two vehicles in one lane, but, without cites in hand, I have been led to believe there are laws covering not straying across lane dividers aside from normal lane changes."

Fences under 4 1/2 feet are lawful with a bunch of oddly specific restrictions for rock walls and hedges. The fact that there is a specific listing of what fences are legal makes it seem like any fence not listed is illegal and the only listed fences are 4.5 foot maximum.  So fences between 4.5 and 6 feet do kind of feel like they are ""neither legal or illegal.""  As far as I know no one has litigated the issue.

And the only reason anyone even knew the law existed at all was because someone tried to enforce it. Even the AG was surprised.  Connecticut had a similar experience a few years earlier, when state police issued summonses for the state's Jefferson-era law against fortune-telling. As in Rhode Island, the AG declined to prosecute, and lobbied for repeal. My favourite bit of that was the brief pointing out that the state's two-year fiscal planning cycle was itself a kind of fortune-telling.  Also related to Rhode Island, I recall the survey that found that an old interstate line was wrong. A Rhode Island town began issuing tax statements to residents of an abutting Connecticut town. Which was bad enough by itself, but they also included demands for back taxes going back many years. In retaliation, the Connecticut residents threatened to sue for having not received municipal services from the presumed taxing authority for the same period. I believe the matter was quietly settled by grown-ups at the state level of both states."

They had their anti prostitution law struck down and when they redrafted the law they forgot to specifically forbid the actual prostitution part. So from the 70s until 2010 or thereabouts prostitution was legal."
badlegaladvice,37lari,CupBeEmpty,2,Tue Jun 2 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"I apparently remembered it wrong, if this is referring to the same case. It's in the area I remember it being in, low down on the border but not on the coast. That's about when I remember it, too.  As for prostitution, it was an open secret only in the last year or so of that period. Up to that point, it was still presumptively illegal, as I recall, but enforcement was based on existing statutes about solicitation (enforced very aggressively) and some other provisions I'm less familiar with that allowed them to do things like raid massage parlours.  Where they eventually ran into a problem was with savvy gentlemen's clubs (a term that's even more odd-sounding if you've ever been to any there) who operated what are commonly called 'champagne rooms'. For whatever reason I'm not savvy enough to fully understand, it was apparently all but impossible to prove solicitation in those environments. The effect was that outdoor prostitution remained fully illegal (apparently because it inevitably involves solicitation? I admit i don't know), but indoor prostitution was all but entirely legal. I was a journalist there at the time, and that was my best understanding of it. A collegue of mind who covered it much more seemed to understand it much better. I remember him saying that Chris Rock had never been to Rhode Island. (Referring to Rock's line, ""There is no sex in the Champagne Room."")  My own take on it was that it seemed poor timing for the state to actively shut down one of the state's few growing commercial sectors."
badlegaladvice,37lari,newprofile15,2,Tue Jun 2 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is the gist of it. Soliciting was illegal so it couldn't be advertised in any way and you couldn't stand outside looking for Johns. However, if you were in a club or a room for rent above an adult video and someone wanted to pay you for sex there was virtually no way to stop it. Or at least that is what I heard. They changed the statute to make the ban more explicit.  I can't say anything about the quality of the strip clubs but if you ever saw ""Cheaters"" from the outside, you got the distinct feeling they weren't the most high end establishments."

The fair use exception to copyright law is a great example. Fair use is an affirmative defense which means that nothing can be definitively fair use until a court decides it so for that case in particular.  That means, even if you're copying a short snippet of text for academic use for free, you can't technically say that it's a legal fair use exception to copyright. Even though there's 0.0001% chance anyone would sue and a 99.999% chance that you would win in court if they did, it's still ultimately based on the court decision rendered.  There's a lot of gray areas on the boundary of fair use where the precedent is unclear because neither party wants to bring a suit that would establish precedent. Google Books was a great example of this. Google scanning copyrighted books and making snippets available on the internet was neither legal or illegal when they first started doing it. It wasn't until the lawsuit concluded in 2013 that what they were doing became explicitly legal."

badlegaladvice,3759qv,freeogy,4,Tue May 26 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"Possibly. Normally a conflict arises where what you're doing or what relationship you have is adverse to a current (or sometimes former) client, not your opposition, but prosecutors have special rules charging them with more responsibilities to temper their zealous advocacy than an attorney in other settings would have. It's going to vary by state, but - and I don't know what weight this carries since it's my first time seeing them - ABA's Criminal Justice Standards say:   Standard 3-1.3 Conflicts of Interest  (f) A prosecutor should not permit his or her professional judgment or obligations to be affected by his or her own political, financial, business, property, or personal interests.   Which I would guess includes a prosecutor with a strong emotional connection to a victim, although note that it just says a prosecutor shouldn't let those things affect his judgment, not that there's automatically a conflict if he has a personal interest. Anyway, again, that's just an ABA standard and it will be different state-by-state."

So, it doesn't really look like this is a case of conflict of interest. The Pros. may want to temper his zeal a little bit, but he's not claiming that his daughter was a victim of this guy or this crime. Dude just has a hard on for hard drugs and will prosecute accordingly. That's not uncommon in small towns and would be hard to prove.   Also, OP seems to be lying.

If you deal marijuana, don't get a gun. When you deal harder shit, you either have a gun or you're getting robbed or dead.  They were legal BTW.   I would suggest that option 3 (give up 15k plus in drugs) would be your best bet. Given that in the alternate scenario where you yourself are armed, people bust in to steal yo' shit, and you manage to fend them off with your firearms... you're still going to inevitably lose your 15k plus in drugs when the police come to investigate that whole firefight.

THOSE trump state laws.   He also thinks that federal law is different from federal law. Things with ""Act"" in the name don't mean they aren't federal law.  Edit: I highly encourage you to read the guy's post history, it's a goldmine of badlaw. Like this:   YES YOU FUCKING DO. [have a right to know why you were pulled over before handing over license, etc.] it is not RECOGNIZED by the legal system but it DOES EXIST. I have a right to resist an unlawful arrest. MY RIGHT. I can not do so unless I KNOW the arrest is lawful IE what did you stop me for quid pro quo you MUST TELL ME so I know if I can resist you lawfully or if I must cooperate."

badlegaladvice,36pt2c,QuintinStone,2,Fri May 22 02:13:18 2015 UTC,"Oh dear. My high school Latin teach is crying right now I think.   Why? ""quid pro quo"" may not be cleanest Latin (you only say ""quid"" for ""aliquid"" after si, nisi, ne & num) but it isn't awful and has entered common parlance in this form. It just means ""something as a reward for something"" (this use of ""pro"" is classical, e.g. ""sese pro Caesaris in se beneficiis plurimum ei confiteri debere""), in this case: ""you get to stop me as a reward for telling me why you are stopping me"". Regardless of whether the claim is true or not, it does constitute a sensible use of this Latin phrase.  If your Latin teacher is crying then because the only use you put whatever Latin you think you know to is acting pretentiously on the internet."

badlegaladvice,36pt2c,jovialgrimace,2,Fri May 22 00:24:30 2015 UTC,"not most. with the exception of the united states it is the ONLY reasons people revolt. when they have no choice. Freedom ""is the answer"" to most other problems. then we get lazy and complacent. we realize freedom is not free.   you have to work to keep it. It is why it always fails eventually. corruption seeks power and uses this to their advantage. you can not be HAPPY without freedom. at least as I define the word ""happy"" how do you define the word ""happy"" a good example of why people tolerate tyranny or at least the start of it. why they don't stand up and resist when it starts to go south. Imagine I walk into a bank. I spray the ceiling with bullets I am robbing the bank. eurodditor says ""let's rush him he can't get us all"" what happens? nothing. absolutely nothing. but wait. eurodditor is right. I can't get you all. our rush would succeed. so why does no one move? easy. it all about probabilities. while I can not get you all I CAN and WILL get some of you and there is no way to know who I will get. so odds are better for your survival to do nothing. now let's twist things a little. identical scenario. let's rush him he can't get us all whispers eurodditor but this time you all recognize me. I am infamous for my robberies. when I am done I put a bullet in everyones heads. everyone dies and you all know it. what happens now? well in reality you die anyway (I will come back to that) but in this simplistic explanation you all rush me. because now odds are in your favor to rush me. sure I can and will get some of you if you rush but if you don't rush me I WILL get all of you in the end. so taking the chance to rush me increases your odds of survival. so you do. this is ""hunger"" this is when revolts happen. at least this is what history teaches us with very very few exceptions. this is WHY we have a welfare state. to prevent this from happening. to make the takeover easier. to prevent a revolt. it's ok. I won't kill everyone. Interesting how that works ehh? they learn through each iteration. as for why you would all die anyway? because humans are stupid greedy shits sometimes and some of you would hang back anyway to increase your own personal odds of survival unknowingly giving me enough time to slay every one of you fuckers. so you would all die anyway. but that complicates things for this discussion :-) if you stand up and resist they will discredit you if you persist they will put you down. unless you stand up as one. your odds of success are pretty damned low. what confuses me most is why people like you seem to think it is necessary for me to give up my freedom for society to function. that makes absolutely no sense at all. zero sense. there is no possible logical argument to support such a system. none. the only answer that makes sense is you have given up do not want to admit to yourself yo are wrong and so promote tyranny to assuage your own internal feelings and demons on the subject? I can't be free so neither can you type mentality. The united states of america is the single most power nation to every exist on this planet. BECAUSE we had more freedom than ever before to expand learn evolve educate expand in every way. not perfect but better than most previous examples. we shall fall like all nations do. I simply hope some other experiment in freedom occurs down the road.    http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/35ue4p/eli5_why_do_americans_hate_socialism_when_aspects/cr8o2os?context=5"

badlegaladvice,36me93,CupBeEmpty,59,Wed May 20 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"R2: Our linked friend is incorrect when saying ""unfortunately there isn't anything you can do about it,"" even though he does have one nice out of context quote about freedom of speech by Justice Stevens.  A library can indeed do something about ""it.""  Namely, it is constitutionally permissible to filter out pornographic websites in a public library. See United States v. American Library Assn., Inc.  539 U.S. 194 (2003). Basically, since libraries have discretion to curate the content of their collections then they can block certain categories of content. Given the latitude that the government has under Miller in regulating ""obscene"" material:   it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.   Blocking pornographic content in a public library almost certainly does not violate the First Amendment. Indeed, not blocking pornographic content will likely jeopardize federal funding to the library.  There are some very interesting questions out there about the regulation of pornography in relation to the First Amendment. The ""community standards"" element of the Miller Test is still an open question in the Internet Age. What is the ""community standard"" with respect to the entire internet?  Also, it was relevant in American Library Assn. that filtering could be turned off for legitimate purposes, which would prevent the downsides of ""overblocking"" by internet filters. If a library refused to unblock a website for an adult with a legitimate purpose, say a researcher at The Kinsey Institute researching trends in pornography on the interenet, then perhaps there is a problem with part (c) of the Miller Test, because there would be potential social value in the content if used for research.  Finally, just as a practical matter, it is pretty damn rude to broadcast your sexual titillation in a public space where people would really rather not be confronted with it. No one wants to see me shit in public no matter how wonderful the act might be for me. The same goes for public sex."

I fully realize the Seattle Public Library system is completely chickenshit due to an ACLU lawsuit here in Washington a few years back, so getting them to actually do or say anything to the pervy porn viewer would be impossible.  That being said, a lot of people seem to confuse the kinda-muddy issue of automated filtering of the internet in a public library with manually telling some pervert watching porn near kids to knock it off. The irony was seeing how many people had more of a problem with the OP taking the guy's picture than they did with him watching porn where children could see it. They even went so far as to claim taking the picture was illegal (it's not, even though it may be a violation of library policy). I found it extremely disappointing that people fail to realize how weird it is that they think it's ok to ban taking pictures in public (and that it would be supported by law), but not watching porn in public because ""civil rights.""  Despite the supposed 'civil rights' issue all these idiots were trying to make of it, it's perfectly fine to tell someone viewing porn in public, especially near kids, to knock it off or leave. That's not the same thing as filtering or censoring, and it's certainly not a violation of civil rights.   But, of course, this is Seattle, the passive-aggressiveness capital of the USA."

It isn't always true, but sometimes the law actually reflects the practical realities of American society. Obviously on most days we can go into a library and not have to see someone watching pornography on a public terminal, and yet, some people think that this must just be because of the good of society, not because there are rules against it.  Does the linked learned friend really think that all of the nutcases out there are not watching porn at the library just because they think its the right thing to do? No, obviously the guy in the photo hasn't figured out ""one weird trick"" to be allowed to do this.  Sometimes you need to stop and think: ""If my line of thinking were to be true, how would life be different?"" If it hardly resembles what you currently know, your thinking is probably wrong."

badlegaladvice,36me93,cmn_jcs,1 point,Thu May 21 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"Right. A content-based restriction is presumed unconstitutional unless the government can establish a need for the restriction and that there is no less-restrictive alternative.
