The last time Luis was on ykwd he complained how bad deepoo and scopos producing was and even offered bobby his services for a month to let turn this thing around and teach those two how to produce. He basically went on to say the show was shit ever since he stopped producing it. He then bitched at deepoo for not knowing how to run the chat room cause he had blocked luis.  That real ass move is 100% true, and i can only assume the whale got butt hurt about it. Blobby is too PC and boring these days.

LegionOfSkanks,3dx4r8,JMueller2012,9,Mon Jul 20 07:00:37 2015 UTC,They should definitely do 'no guest' night a couple times a month.
LegionOfSkanks,3dx4r8,SonaCruz,5,Mon Jul 20 08:46:20 2015 UTC,yeah I definitely wouldn't mind that
LegionOfSkanks,3dx4r8,Ebhagz,5,Mon Jul 20 07:43:47 2015 UTC,I'm glad that they give people a forum to be funny and plug their stuff but sometimes I feel like they feel that they're obligated to get a guest and it's fine. Some of the best episodes are when they're just sitting around making fun of Luis or Ding Dong. If they really feel the need to get a repoire going just have Rebecca or Christine sit in. They're interesting
LegionOfSkanks,3dx4r8,LOSFan1,4,Mon Jul 20 09:02:27 2015 UTC,I feel like sometimes they need an episode where it's just the 3 of them. A good example is during this whole Podcast War saga. I felt bad for Chris D because that topic kind of dominated the episode and he really looked out of element.

LegionOfSkanks,3dx4r8,iris201,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:44:41 2015 UTC,If they want a guest its fine but being a relatively new listener it seems like they just talk over them or talk about Los stuff and the guest has little to no clue what they're talking about.

It seemed like she may have gotten her feelings hurt by something he said and then went on a crusade to ruin his set. Just came across as petty and somewhat counterproductive to the spirit of the roast.

Apart from that awesome Roast. It's weird to me that people are making such an enormous deal about Ants set, it really wasn't that bad for somebody who has literally never performed onstage before. (Desperately shouting over a bunch of drunken retarded O&A fans on the Travelling Virus cannot be considered performing.) Sure he bombed, but that happens all the time in Roasts.  I think people are just way too invested in the former O&A. I only really subscribe to the network for LOS and Gavin, and anyone who thinks Ant is going to be trying to control or censor their content is fucking delusional. As long as he doesn't mess with their shows I couldn't give a fuck what he says on his."
LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,GRIZx,9,Mon Jul 20 00:29:11 2015 UTC,I thought it seemed a bit weird but totally 'inbounds' for a roast and comics in general. They talk irreverantly about addiction/death etc. I.e. Stanhope runs a death pool.
LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,NoCoJay,9,Mon Jul 20 01:24:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is saying it was out of bounds, but rather shining light on something not a lot of fans knew about. I imagined Kurt as a big weed smoker and occasionally doing other shit, but Ari's jokes hinted at him having a legit problem. ""What do you call Kurt on thirty five pills in one day? In withdrawal."" Ari is all about truth telling in comedy and shit, almost to a fault, so I could see there being some truth to this. Obviously these are exaggerated roast jokes, but luis, dave, ari, jay, etc are all known for smoking weed and dabbling in other drugs yet no one made similar, addicty jokes about them.   But now I've written too much about this and I feel like a faggot."
LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,NoseSalad,7,Mon Jul 20 11:29:47 2015 UTC,There's a very early episode of Ari's Skeptic Tank with Kurt where they talk about all the pills he takes recreationally. It's pretty fucked up. Kurt literally has the same drug habits of a 68 year old retired pro wrestler. This was like back in 2011 so it is probably loads worse now judging by the hints he's given on LOS and YKWD
LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,JMueller2012,0,Mon Jul 20 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"yeah that was a crazy episode, didnt he say he did heroine once? i think he said he's tried everything."
LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,CUNTYMOM,5,Tue Jul 21 03:37:51 2015 UTC,Weird that a guy like Ari would be making jokes on this nature. He's usually just a good natured ribbing comedienne

LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,imhereforwork,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:30 2015 UTC,Skeptic Tank about Kurt and Drugs
LegionOfSkanks,3dw1ru,JimLahey330,3,Tue Jul 21 23:57:42 2015 UTC,"I would have thought that all of the jokes were in jest up until Ari said something along the lines of ""The same thing was happening with Mitch Hedberg and nobody spoke up until it was too late""  I would assume that Kurt probably has been taking painkillers a bit too often and people are worried he might start doing heroin or simply overdosing on pills.   Although all roast jokes are told to be funny, there usually is some substance of truth behind them. Also, Ari mentioning the part about Hedberg wasn't even a joke, merely a statement. Kurt is brilliant and it really would suck if the comedy world lost him. Maybe Ari took advantage of being at a show where anything goes and brought it up merely because it would be seen as inappropriate to say it at any other show/podcast."

Eventually they decided to not be together but didn't file the paperwork to be officially divorced.  So she is technically still his wife but realistically is his ex-wife, so both terms could be used on her.

I thought Mike Finoia was the leading possibility for a replacement. LoS had a much smaller audience at the time so I don't think they had a wide selection to choose from when it came to a full time co-host.   Personally I think LoS would not have grown as it did without Luis. He's crucial, as they all are at this point. But I think Luis being who he is was very important in the growth. He's a colorful guy who is fodder for a lot of jokes. Imagine LoS with Jay, Dave and Mike Finoia? Nothing against Finoia but... Yeah, wouldn't be nearly as good.  edit: I forgot to mention that losing Luis' work ethic behind the scenes would have been brutal too. I think they mentioned once how things fell apart in those two weeks where Luis left for LA. He does/has done a lot behind the scenes to keep shit moving. He really is a real ass dude."

What Dave was talking about was that as comedians we know a little more about inner workings of the game. When a comic is talking about ""bombing"" he/she knows what that word means. A lot of the anti-fans jumped on that word.. but really we are talking semantics. He either made you laugh or he didn't.

You don't need to have a technical understanding of comedy to have an opinion on whether you found someone funny or not. That's like saying only trained chefs can have a valid opinion on what food is tasty, or that you have to be a telecommunications engineer to say that Comcast sucks.  The vast majority of people thought Ant bombed, and that's okay. I still think Ant is one of funniest dudes in the world. It's nice that you guys are sticking up for your friend/rich uncle, but this podcast was pretty condescending."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,biryani_evangelist,-6,Fri Jul 17 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"You have a point but you're coming across as a bit of a pansy. ""Oh boo hoo they're being condescending to meee!"" All they're saying is that they have a better opinion on comedy than we do, which is correct."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,burner989,5,Sun Jul 19 00:55:02 2015 UTC,"110% with you on the pansy comment, but I don't agree with the rest. They have a better understanding of how to manufacture funny, but not necessarily on what's funny. I've seen the same thing with musicians. Musicians are often unable to listen to music the way fans do. When musicians listen to a piece of music, they immediately start deconstructing the song in their heads and start analyzing it and critiquing different aspects of it. They're often drawn to technical wizardry as opposed to a great musical package. Fans are not trained to do that, however, they're able to appreciate the song as a whole, as a song - something musicians to some extent lose the ability to do. I think it's similar with comedy. Now I'm a pansy and wordy. Sorry, dude."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,biryani_evangelist,-4,Sun Jul 19 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"Ant got more laughs in the room than some of you are giving him credit for. I'm not even defending Ant's set because I didn't laugh that much at it either. Maybe it just played better in the room than on stream, I don't know. I think many of you would have laughed if you were there in person. I don't think Luis and Dave are disqualifying people from having an opinion, but I think they're trying to bring some perspective and context because they're right when they say there's been an overreaction and some over-analyzing going on. They're not even saying Ant killed or anything, they both admit that he had some clunkers but overall he didn't do that bad considering he's never done stand-up. Which is right.   So you didn't find his set funny. Big deal. Holy shit I don't get the obsession."

I think what Dave and Luis are saying, though, is that their definition of bombing is a completely silent crowd for the whole set, besides the occasional ""boo"".  I wasn't there but on the stream it seemed like he got a few laughs here and there.  On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being a complete bombfest and 10 being a stellar performance I'd give him like a 2, maybe a 3.  I think Dave and Luis agree, they just don't see anything above a 1 as a bomb.  That's what the latest ReallAssPodcast® seemed like to me anyway..."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,Unc_PaulHarrgis1-5YO,3,Sat Jul 18 06:26:56 2015 UTC,"I think the thing is from years of listening to O&A, we know that their own definition of bombing is isn't as strict as the definition that Luis and Dave put forth, which at best mean's Ant's standards have lowered EXTREMELY or he is an absolute hypocrite (which we know he is anyway)"
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,SAHandre,9,Sat Jul 18 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"Come on.  They aren't gonna say he bombed.  If ant cut like a third of his worst jokes.   And delivered the other two thirds properly.  He would have killed.  You could say he did alright,  it's his first time up and he wrote it all himself.  But if anyone else got the same crowd reaction most would admit they bombed.   For his first time, and no comedian help.   He didn't do that bad.  Lose the racist stuff.  We get it.  Enough about the racism.   Joe derosa said what will my black friends think? I've been saying for years black people don't think!  That's so stupid it would bomb at a klan rally."

""locks of douche"" is even worse.  ""hardly davidson"" is in fact an actual pun, too bad that joke is at least 30 years old.  add in the stammering, rushed delivery, and nervous explanation of failed punchlines (""i don't even know what that means, but it's hilarious""), and we have ourselves the definition of a bomb.  hope that corny old square is paying you guys well."

Jesus christ that's a bit extreme. We've heard them mocking people bombing on O&A for years. Does anyone remember them watching the Joe Piscopo special? Yeah, we don't understand comedy, fair enough, but we're not braindead slackjawed morons we can tell when someone is bombing. Ugh."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,SAHandre,-5,Sat Jul 18 13:07:40 2015 UTC,"You're being overly sensitive about their statement. They DO know more about comedy than you do.

LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,TheMaddLib,3,Sat Jul 18 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of this comes down to semantics and comics having a weird definition of what is and isn't bombing.  Luis basically said that if anyone in the audience laughs at anything you can't say a person bombed.  So can we just say that Ant had a horrific set where almost every joke fell flat and call it a day?  Also, can anyone explain his Harris Stanton/Keith the cop joke?  Was it just a generic ""lolz black people and cops don't get along"" joke or a specific reference to something from one of his white supremacist sites?"

Let me ask you this isn't a comedy podcast suppose to be funny? I don't listen to these shows to hear two features pontificate about the ins and outs of joke writing. I mean at least the real ass podcast has its moments but the part of the problem shit Dave does is unlistenable. The fact that he thinks his uneducated political views without any jokes are worth putting out to the public is baffling to me. Also he is delusional when he thinks he didn't have the worst set of all the comics. Stick to being funny offensive savages on LOS which is a fucking great show and maybe save your extra podcast time to improve you own joke writing."

LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,Bomyknocka,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think Cumia bombed, far from. His delivery was off, and not as suited to a roast as a proven standups would've been, but he got a lot of laughs out of me.  Honestly if you got a group of your friends together to do a roast, and someone delivered a performance on par to what Cumia did there, you'd all think it was fucking epic and talk about it for years afterwards. It would be a fuck of a performance to come from some non pro dude you all know. Also chances are the majority of the rest of you would suck ass for coming up with enough working material for consistent laughs across six minutes. (No really, try it. Try and honestly make a group of people who already like you laugh for ten minutes straight on original material you are working on.) So by comparison Ant's performance here would be way higher caliber.  A lot of the points Luis and Dave brought up in the podcast are dead on from from what I see."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,AutisticInTech,4,Sat Jul 18 07:14:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that if you went in front of your friends and drunkenly railed against blacks, Opie, and Joe DeRosa for nine minutes straight, they'd probably spend a good eight and a half of those minutes not being your friends anymore."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,PCchongor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:50:24 2015 UTC,Seriously dude? It's a fucking Roast. The ENTIRE point is to be as offensive and edgy as possible. Ant is a 68 year old Air conditioner repair man from Long Island who was raised by 50's television. Did you think he was going to kill it first time?  Do you not realise how similar you sound to people who say that comedians who make jokes about women and minorities actually hate women and minorities?
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,Bomyknocka,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe your friends I guess.  Mine, they'd find it hysterical. And I know because I have said jokes about blacks in front of a group, many I didn't even know. And nobody became a pussy about it or was offended.  Also, when did he rail on Opie? And the DeRosa jokes were just the same as the others, he wasn't railing against him."
LegionOfSkanks,3do2eq,AutisticInTech,0,Sat Jul 18 07:58:34 2015 UTC,"You're right, that last reply was just a test to weed out all the sissy Libtards here.  His black jokes were totally politically biting and not at all what the other roasters spent the entire night making fun of him about, and even though OandJ and Joe DeRosa weren't even on the daïs, he stuck to his guns and spent half his time roasting them anyway because making more than just a single godawful Seaworld joke about the actual guest of honor would've just been playing right into Obama's hands."

He is at his absolute best when he's going back and forth with a worthy comedic adversary, and he is at his worst when he is pontificating about race and politics. He's like a shitty Rush Limbaugh when he's doing it. I can't get into TACS because it's just Ant without Opie there to direct him. I really hope things change when he moves his studio to Manhattan.

If you listen to the volume of the laughter for every single other person, including Big Jay's wife (who had her jokes written for her obviously but is clearly not in entertainment) who's set you made really awkward by going on about her eating the mic even though we could hear her perfectly (to be fair maybe on the sound system there it was hard to hear and her somewhat frightened responses to you every time you did it was amusing). Ant bombed because he was drunk, did minimal preperation, and should have at least gone over his material with a veteran roaster just to tighten that shit up. He's a comedic genius, and I think he should be writing his own material, but a little critique only helps.  Sorry for that wordy gahbage i just typed.

These are fair points, but they're reasons why it was OK that Ant bombed, not reasons why he didn't.  Sal and Ant were in kind of a similar position on this roast being new to roasting/stand-up. When Sal finished his set, you said ""Keep it going for sally! Fuckin Sally dude, so funny. God dammit Sal great job, great debut buddy. That shit is so funny."" When Ant finished, you said ""That was uncomfortable. Shit Ant you said it was your first time roasting not your first time in front of a microphone, fuck!"". I'm sure the counter-argument would be that it's in the spirit of the roast, but it seems like, it being his first time, you'd have reacted more like you did to Sal if you really thought he did a good job.  I love you Luis, and the roast was incredibly entertaining, and I'm sad that it's over. But someone needs to be honest with Ant. He's running himself into the ground. People gave him the benefit of the doubt for a year on his podcast. Even his most loyal fans have turned on him because of how unfunny he's become. His black ""jokes"" and his Joe DeRosa ""jokes"" were his genuine thoughts that he was hoping he could pass off as jokes. They were hateful and unfunny, and completely threw off the flow of the roast. He didn't prepare for it because he's lazy. He said on his own show that he was looking at his phone all night because he was writing jokes. At the very last minute he tried to pull some jokes out of his ass but he had nothing. It's disrespectful to Jay and the listeners - this was a huge event for LoS and all their fans. He has more experience than almost anyone at trashing people in a funny way, and he knows most of the people there well enough to do so. If he put the effort in, he could've done a fantastic job last night. He just didn't.  Ant is capable of being one of the funniest people in the entire world, but he spends his time humorlessly ranting in his basement like an out-of-touch old grandpa because he's written off all his critical fans as ""haters"", and because no one he would actually listen to is willing to be honest with him. Hardly Davidson. Locks of douche. Dildo Unchained. ""Black people don't think"". Most of his shit was objectively terrible, and it did not get ""a lot of laughs"". I know I sound like an asshole but I seriously just want someone to get Ant back on track. He's so far from what he's capable of right now."

So yeah, it wasn't unreasonable to expect some laughs  Stop using the ""He's never even done stand-up!"" excuse. If he wasn't expected to be funny, he wouldn't not have been on the dais in the first place.   Nobody is obsessed with the performance. Nobody cared if he stole the show or ate his balls.

He was quick as hell with great lines.  I refuse to believe that he couldn't have come up with better shit than ""Locks of douche"", ""Dildo unchained"", ""Hardly davidson"", etc. if he had actually given any effort into it. If his delivery sucked, fine, I get that. But I can't excuse how awful the jokes he was delivering were.

LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,JoblessZombie,6,Wed Jul 15 14:56:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. There will always be an audience for Real Ass Dudes.
LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,PuffsPlusArmada,17,Wed Jul 15 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"I got into O&A because of all the archives and youtube uploads of comedian appearances on that show. It was fantastic when someone like Louis CK, CQ, Burr, Patrice, etc. was in studio. IMO, there's nothing better. Once I burned through all those shows, I started listening to the ordinary, daily O&A show.  It was still entertaining, but it's a different show when there's not a great comedian in studio with them. To me, an ordinary LoS show is better than an ordinary O&A show, even in the peak of their career. LoS always carries the vibe that O&A did when someone like Patrice was in studio - just funny people shooting the shit. O&A always carried a bit of that ""shock jock"" mentality when they had no guests.  Still think Jim is the quickest and funniest off-the-cuff comedian in the world, but LoS has completely replaced O&A (and TACS) for me at this point. Just a fantastic show."
LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,Flamgirlant,7,Wed Jul 15 07:58:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I'm pretty fucked up (5 cocktails) but I wanted to respond to this post.  I've always been a lurker on these various radio/comedy boards but the hard alcohol has finally compelled me to reply.  I've listened to O&A and Ron and Fez since the late 90s when I was a college student in Jersey.  Loved the vicious comedy, loved Bennington's brilliance, loved the decades of vicious and clever humor.  O&A broke apart and I was sort of lost -- then I found LoS.  HOLY SHIT folks.  The idea that the same feelings I had when I was 19, driving around at midnight listening to Ronny B, would come back to me in my 30s felt impossible.  But it happened when I got into LoS several months ago.  This is the best comedy podcast/radio show I've heard since the height of some of the greats like O&A and Stern.  I could bore you with stories of the times I've been listening to LoS in a food store or walking around the streets and literally broke into tears at the brilliance of this show, but I won't.  Suffice to say Jay, Dave, and PR Rattlesnake are AMAZING talents who have brought great joy into my life.  Really love you guys and are excited about your futures -- I'm also always looking for ways to support your careers, be it T-shirts or tickets to your live shows.  Keep up the great work guys."
LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,Elisnow,8,Thu Jul 16 01:37:44 2015 UTC,LoS is like just the good parts of O&A. I hated the segments on O&A where they did gross and stupid shit with the crazy/homeless/retarded friends of the show. LoS is like O&A without the hacky shockjock bits.
LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,biryani_evangelist,3,Wed Jul 15 13:22:19 2015 UTC,Now if they can stop being lazy and put out 20 hours a week like O&A it will be a seamless transition.

LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,Heifsin85,3,Wed Jul 15 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"True but it took a while to get to that point. WNEW O&A was good for what it was but IMO it wasn't until a couple years into the XM years that they hit their peak for all those great comic shows.  Towards the end those shows were rare. Patrice was dead, Burr and Louie became too big for the show, Bobby & Vos were overused and a lack of new guys along the lines of those name above.... The only new blood that was in the show towards the end was Soder and of course some shitty O&A fans didn't like him."
LegionOfSkanks,3dcwdo,JoblessZombie,2,Wed Jul 15 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah WNEW is where I started but the Xm days were the peak. I loved when Dan Soder started coming in, I didn't understand the hate."

He went a little overboard on the wine but I don't get a sense of hopeless addiction from him at all. It would've manifested itself by now, it seems like. He parties and he does stuff but you don't get to be one of the best comics in NYC by being fucked up all the time and not doing spots. I've always liked guys like Ari and Big Jay for their sense of not letting their substances get out of control. It isn't interfering really with what they do. Artie doesn't have an off button. Whether it's booze, gambling, or heroine, when Artie is in he's absolutely all in. Artie lets it get to the point of complete self destruction. Haven't seen that with Jay."

Big Jay is just fucking around and having fun on the podcast. Chugging a bottle of wine and puking on a podcast is hilarious, and if anything, an indicator that he is NOT an addict. Addicts don't go on air and chug wine. They do shots beforehand and in the bathroom when no one is looking. And they don't puke after one bottle of wine. They're probably just starting to get a buzz on at that point.  Not trying to hate on OP, he seems to have good intentions. But he is dead wrong."

Just look at how badly he embarrassed himself in this thread and this is only the internet.  There's something repellent about his desperate need to be like combined with his narcissism that makes him particularly hateable.  The fact that he's supposedly a comic makes it even worse.

LegionOfSkanks,3cxk2v,este-ballZ,2,Sun Jul 12 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"Great old bit that I haven't heard in a while some hick sounding comic crank Williams I think, was on. Jay was saying how he would beat the shit out of cranks wife. I think they even called her up"

LegionOfSkanks,3cvh75,LOSfan,7,Sat Jul 11 02:53:35 2015 UTC,I thought Kurt Metzger was going to be roast master?
LegionOfSkanks,3cvh75,finewinereview,3,Sat Jul 11 08:38:13 2015 UTC,Luis addressed that in the latest Real Ass Podcast. Kurt agreed to be roast master but never put it in his calendar. He forgot about it then scheduled the whole Race Wars thing with SiriusXM so now he has to leave halfway through the roast to do that.
LegionOfSkanks,3cvh75,Doe22,4,Sat Jul 11 14:22:18 2015 UTC,Kurt needs some real ass time management skills.

It's something you see from time to time at parties, especially if those parties are drug friendly. A few people get rolling on some kind of interesting conversation, and a crowd slowly forms around them. It is exactly the perfect vibe for this show, but I'd almost guarantee you can't recreate it in an environment large enough and well cooled enough to keep everybody comfortable.  EDIT: I couldn't have been more wrong. They went on to say on the very next show that the basement they're usually in is uncomfortably hot, and that they're moving to the garage because it's more comfortable. So it's an awesome vibe for the show AND it's more comfortable... Awesome!"

LegionOfSkanks,3cku3p,stepituppa2,9,Wed Jul 8 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why people do this for podcasts. For most people who podcast, the goal is to eventually get medium / long term sponsors or bigger headline comedy gigs. Most credible sponsors and venues know what a typical ROI is for the media they present on, based on their analytics from past sponsorships. If you show them you have 6000 Twitter and IG followers, 10,000 Soundcloud fans, and 5000 downloads of your podcast per episode then they're going to expect X number of subscribers, product or ticket sales.  It only takes one or two episodes to figure out if you're bullshitting because you can't sell 10 tickets to a mainstream venue on the road or the company only gets two extra sales... theeeen they're never going to trust your numbers again. It seems really short sighted."

LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,biryani_evangelist,7,Wed Jul 8 05:44:03 2015 UTC,"because he refused to play their game, but in the end he actually regreted doing it, he missed out on so many opportunities fighting a war by himself against the industry. He could have had what Kevin Hart has and he knew it. They took lil kev under their wing and made him a better comic, just to see him pandering to celebs and get hype. It's just the way it is."
LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,Anarox,6,Wed Jul 8 06:28:16 2015 UTC,It's even more sad because Jay essentially learned from Patrice's mistakes and this rise is still overdue
LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,JMueller2012,10,Wed Jul 8 07:51:28 2015 UTC,"Jay missed out on that whole O&A fanbase crowd that Patrice and the rest of the Colin guys got from o&a, so his situation was actually worse than Patrice, plus Patrice had alot of loyal comic friends at high places"
LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,Anarox,2,Wed Jul 8 07:56:34 2015 UTC,"What's the story on that? Because from what I remember Big Jay was in the studio during Baby Bird and/or was it the Patrice Bobo Up and Down game. How was he not a regular on O&A. I used to hear about him on YKWD all the time too, only got into LOS after O&A ended."
LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,erockarmy,3,Wed Jul 8 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well sam said that he basically never got to know the crew over at O&a because everytime he was on there was other guests who took over the show (I think they brought in Ace from Kiss at one time to suprise jimmy, on that show Jay had to take a backseat. Luis thinks its because they fear he will take their gigs and shit.  They have alot of shit guests so I would go with what luis said."
LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,Anarox,3,Wed Jul 8 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"They also had some incredible comics on as regular guests even if it was  before they really blew up into mainstream success so I would disagree with Luis's guess on that one. Sometimes the chemistry just isn't there even amongst really funny people.   Comics tend to ""find there voice"" at much different times in their careers even with guys they came up with."
LegionOfSkanks,3cip5v,fattypigfatty,2,Wed Jul 8 22:12:43 2015 UTC,I would say Patrice had a lot more chances than Jay I'm sure he'd have loved to be in the office or Chris rock's show.

If you're in a situation where you've gotta fake anything, it should be the name / address and tell them you don't know your SSN. They still have to treat you even if you don't know your SSN.  My buddy went through this a few years ago, he got caught doing this exact thing and the hospital called the cops and pressed charges for identity theft (he gave fake everything). His attorney told him that if he'd have just used the name he would've been able to argue that he was using an alias because he had ""privacy concerns,"" but had every intention to pay. He eventually got off but it took about a year and almost 5k in attorney's fees plus the ER bill (that he's still making payments on) to get it all figured out.

She didn't even really seem to share the hatred her partner had, and was a good sport when she was also called unfunny and awful, which I don't think I would have taken nearly as well as her. The chick that looks like Kurt Metzger is a real dildo though"

I remember so many instances where Cumia, Patrice and Jimmy would make these types of segments entertaining and hilarious on O&A. It didn't work out last night, but not a terrible idea per se."
LegionOfSkanks,3bu3in,biryani_evangelist,5,Thu Jul 2 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"True, but those bits usually rode on watching eminently terrible movie trailers (which is why the LOS MST3K idea is actually fantastic).

Especially when Dave raises a good point about a political  issue.  Since Luis doesn't understand what Dave is saying he starts clowning on him saying he is too long winded.  At that point he'll just keep interrupting Dave til he backs off his point.

Dave's only factual reply regarded a""permanent record""...which already includes some crappy internet porn BJ which he was talked into and also couldn't finish. He is in love and he would hurt too bad to go thru a ""fake ceremony"" while being mocked. All of his sex stories he shares somehow seem to involve you/ Big Jay and a chick...in which he either participated, watched, or dipped his dick into the same well. He is not on Tinder and is not interested."

He did it once when they started talking about it, and brought it back up in I think the episode right after that and really point blank just said exactly what she was doing, having a reaction, then adjusting the narrative to fit her conclusion instead of the other way around (the correct way to form a conclusion)."
LegionOfSkanks,3bpoj9,JMueller2012,-3,Wed Jul 1 21:20:31 2015 UTC,I get annoyed of her but I do feel bad for her. Last night they all basically told her her how would fail.

LegionOfSkanks,3bn0ox,realassdude,2,Tue Jun 30 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"That was definitely good, thanks for the clip.  Is Soder a regular co-host or just a guest?"
LegionOfSkanks,3bn0ox,realassdude,3,Wed Jul 1 00:12:51 2015 UTC,special guest. bringing in a guest comic and guest fighter every episode. Kris Tinkle and I co-hosting.

LegionOfSkanks,3bn0ox,Anarox,2,Thu Jul 2 01:15:56 2015 UTC,a good show on SXM? Gj dude
LegionOfSkanks,3bn0ox,JPP132,7,Wed Jul 1 10:19:17 2015 UTC,"You can stream for free for 30 days on SiriusXM.com  That is what I did.  I only listened to the beginning of the show as even though I am a huge combat sports fan, I have zero interest in hearing interviews with fighters."
LegionOfSkanks,3bn0ox,realassdude,3,Tue Jun 30 17:07:57 2015 UTC,it's not an interview show.. Matt just hung out and we talked shit about anything that came to mind.
LegionOfSkanks,3bn0ox,ehiknowaguy,3,Tue Jun 30 17:48:52 2015 UTC,Is it true that they are paying you in Chipotle gift cars?

LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,JMueller2012,21,Mon Jun 29 04:59:08 2015 UTC,I was infuriated to hear Lady Trucker call in.
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,yourethebestaround12,15,Mon Jun 29 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"On the plus side Luis seems to be finally getting the idea that audience interaction sucks.  Between yelling at people to only call in when he says, hanging up on the one caller mid sentence and taking the mic away from the tinder guy immediately we may not have to hear any of these clowns much longer."
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,NoseSalad,10,Mon Jun 29 20:25:24 2015 UTC,They should have ripped into her a lot more. She was being a real cunt.
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,pocketspeaking,12,Mon Jun 29 18:26:00 2015 UTC,She's the worst.  She steamrolls phone calls like Lady Di.
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,yapyapyapyappayyap,19,Mon Jun 29 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"I don't care how awkward and disjointed it got, I loved this podcast. Everyone has had a Jay moment. The look of regret in his eyes was priceless. All the same, he shouldn't be discouraged. Good for Jay for taking it to the next level. Fun podcast."
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,GalaxyGuts,8,Mon Jun 29 16:46:49 2015 UTC,the absolute highlight was when Luis said Big Jay apologized to him for being drunk
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,CUNTYMOM,14,Tue Jun 30 04:51:43 2015 UTC,I enjoyed Jay's vulnerability. He's usually the alpha of the show and hardly ever gets any time in the barrel. He played it off well. Love Sean Donnelly too
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,telepepper,13,Mon Jun 29 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"Literally came here just to confirm that Jay moving the mic towards the bucket (while puking) was a TOTAL pro move.  I actually said ""pro move Jay"" out loud as I watched.    That type of attention to detail cannot be taught.   He might have lost his ability to annunciate, he might have lost his ability to NOT puke while hosting a podcast...but, goddammit he will NEVER lose his commitment.     A true hero of the people.    Fuck anyone else who says otherwise."
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,TheBobbyHutch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:02:20 2015 UTC,"because jay is the only true radio guy there, luis acts like a producer but if he had any sense he would have yelled at an intern to mic jay puking, thats why a visual element hurts sometimes because they forget not everyone can see it.  you watch old OnA clips and sam bolts over with a mic anytime bob kelly started puking, jay knows whats up."
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,dumpyduluth,12,Thu Jul 2 19:04:02 2015 UTC,I thought it was funny as shit.
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,LOSFan1,18,Mon Jun 29 17:14:50 2015 UTC,"A funny side note, when I got the puke bucket outside, Garret told me to dump the buckets contents into the neighbors yard. So the neighbors bushes got watered with a bucket of regurgitated cabernet."
LegionOfSkanks,3bh7xw,megszent,16,Tue Jun 30 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"Man what a professional job hosting. Great facility Jay, way to get the Mic in the there to pick up the barf noise"
LegionOfSkanks,3bglcw,panjshirlion,5,Mon Jun 29 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"Wow it's been a year since the dance-off.  Looking back, it seems that one of the judges may have been a little too biased for it to be a fair competition.  No one can trust that ladder-climbing cunt, Aaron Berg.  Re-match...this week.  I think Luis ""Far Too Many To Mention"" Gomez might get a fair shot this time."
LegionOfSkanks,3bglcw,Budflyer,2,Mon Jun 29 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"i miss fat luis, this is like looking back at old nirvana home movies, good times."
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,AGribbleIdea,20,Sat Jun 27 19:47:12 2015 UTC,Luis got a radio show with Soder before Big Jay
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,KongVonBrawn,5,Sat Jun 27 21:15:55 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty interesting observation
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,JimLahey330,4,Sat Jun 27 22:55:45 2015 UTC,Maybe it has something to do with wearing fingerless gloves to an executive meeting?
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,WiretapStudios,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:00:11 2015 UTC,I would be willing to bet $1000 that Jay does not wear his gloves to executive meetings of any kind.
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,JimLahey330,15,Sun Jun 28 05:54:47 2015 UTC,Jay 100% wears his gloves to meetings. Give me my money.
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,realassdude,2,Sun Jun 28 15:06:52 2015 UTC,Only if you spend it all on drugs and cool shoes for baby James
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,JimLahey330,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"i thought, big jay may have letters tattoed on his fingers like ''NAZI HATE'', ''KILL JEWS'' or sumpthin like that and that is why he is wearing fingerless gloves.   not literally those slogans but still something tattoed on his fingers or hand, which he is trying to hide, but apparently it's not the case. On the most recent LOS shows he has no gloves on and the fingers appear tattooless."
LegionOfSkanks,3bc00u,TossyMcSalad,4,Mon Jun 29 18:00:39 2015 UTC,Yes.  We get it.  Luis mentions it every week.

LegionOfSkanks,3b8d2h,BornInJune9182,3,Mon Jul 6 21:07:57 2015 UTC,Him and Jay are friendly. I think Jay even said Burr chipped in on helpin Jay out when he lost his house/stuff to Sandy and Burr personally got Jay into The Store in LA
LegionOfSkanks,3b8d2h,JMueller2012,2,Sun Jun 28 01:46:30 2015 UTC,I'm really surprised at the hate in this thread. I think Bill would be a great guest.

I am tired of this ""it's because of Nia"" shit, yeah he married a black woman, he best friend was black. He found a way to leave all the ethnocentric bullshit behind and be with someone that is not exactly like him. Even Cumias hardcore fans are tired of racist tirades, is it so farfetched that people like Burr would avoid it. He is the original Realassdude, always telling it like it is, even if you don't agree with him or not. Why is jay's eyes so enchanting on the sidepic, god damn you Jay, you handsome bastard, he looks like he is a ruling king with his enforcer and a trickster/opium provider by his side."

LegionOfSkanks,3b57c5,badbillypratt,2,Fri Jun 26 01:49:31 2015 UTC,Gotta say the discharge eating got to me more than the puking.

I explicitly left tech details out for the sake of making the message accessible to a wider audience.  Since you've gone and made assumptions without asking questions, I'll fill some details in. I'm the sole user of a 20 Megabit cable connection. During the window where I was having streaming problems I confirmed that my connection was still solid via multiple avenues including steaming from other sources as well as speed tests. Heck, I even checked my speeds from a Usenet provider to rule out anything like my ISP giving preferential treatment to Netflix or to speed test websites.  I will concede that the problems I experienced watching a recorded LOS episode took place starting about the same time as Gavin's show went live for the night, but any problems caused by that would have nothing to do with the quality of my connection.  If you feel that there's something I've missed in my attempts to rule out contributing factors outside of Cumia's network stream capabilities, I'd be glad to further investigate them. In the mean the personal attack is just totally unnecessary. Cheers."

I became a fan of Louis CK around '07 watching his standup, and saw that he had lots of appearances on a show called O&A through YouTube searches. I soon started listening to Patrice because there were so many great uploads from users like LoganHighestPriest. I didn't know about this ball-busting style of comedy until I got exposed to Norton, Vos, Quinn, Patrice, Keith, Bawby, etc. This eventually led to me listening to YKWD and LoS, and now subscribing to TACN. This would never have happened without YouTube."

Of the thirty-three(33) Goldman Sachs management committee members, twenty(20) are Jews or have Jewish spouses. This is a numerical representation of 61%. Jews are approximately 2% of the U.S. population.* Therefore Jews and spouses of Jews are over-represented among the Goldman Sachs executives by a factor of 39 times(3,900 percent), over-represented among the Goldman Sachs directors by a factor of 25 times(2,500 percent), and over-represented on the Goldman Sachs management committee by a factor of 30.5 times(3,050 percent)."

They are behind the scenes, that's how they operate and infest nations. They are 3% of the population yet have hugely disproportionate amounts of control over the media and the banks. Not to mention the fed. Jewish culture is all about climbing your way up through thievery, backstabbing, lying, and conniving and then helping your fellow Jew. They hate white people and racial tension, gender tension, and a lot else can be traced back to Jewish control and manipulation. This isn't even pontification, you can look at all the names who run these media conglomerates and banks. Lot of Steins, Silvers, Golds and Bergs. They're also the ones beyond that. The Bilderberg group. Their end game is money, of course, but also domination over white people. They want complete control over everything while they benefit the most financially.

LegionOfSkanks,3a2ben,Lasagna_Hat,3,Wed Jun 17 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"The ""Luis Vs Dave"" Saga. It's listed as one episode but it's really like 4-5 episodes where it's just Luis and Dave bitching back and forth about the same exact thing from the previous episode. As soon as Dave took Luis' joke literally, they'd have the same argument and nothing got resolved  When I first heard of LOS a few years back, I downloaded a couple of these episodes. I remember going, ""ugh, these dudes bitch about the same thing every fucking podcast...fuck this"" and turned it off."

LegionOfSkanks,3a2ben,pianosbecome,12,Wed Jun 17 04:09:27 2015 UTC,I thought that one was pretty funny. It was such a mundane thing to lose your mind over and Dave not caring or getting it just made it go on longer.

LegionOfSkanks,39zrca,realassdude,8,Tue Jun 16 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"actually the genesis of this had nothing to do with Legion of Skanks. I recorded a podcast demo for Hammerfisting years ago (like almost 6 years ago) and I got into an argument with a buddy of mine that was in the room that wouldn't shut up while we were recording. I never turned the cell phone recorder off and the argument turned into me screaming ""YOU'RE RUINING MY DREAMS!!!"" which was on tape.. the tape doesn't exist anymore..

I can't imagine how she would logically fit into whatever budget the show has to pay people to work on the show. I'm not even trying to say this in a mean way. I just think from a business minded standpoint, she is of no value to the show. She doesn't like to be on camera. She only talks away from the mic when she's complaining/mad about something but other than that she doesn't provide anything else to the show. Hiring her would just take more money from Jay, Luis, Dave and the production value of the show."

I'm gonna call it now and say they're going to end up letting her go sooner or later because she's gonna start demanding to get paid to work at The Compound. Either that or she'll only go to TCATC shows. But who knows. Maybe she'll be the first uppity fat asian in the world to not complain that others are getting something and she's not lol"

LegionOfSkanks,39lt7l,TossyMcSalad,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"it was pretty enjoyable at first, but luis held on to the topic for to long.   he may have wanted to manifest, that he isn't pumping this up, but it denigrated after a couple of minutes, having no more direction to go; yet it went on and on, due to luis...  it robbed the energy out of the show, which is also why the striptease bit didn't happen.   i think luis would agree, at least after re-watching the segment; and to be honest, i have never encountered something i perceived as a mistake or lame segment in another episode again, so i have nothing but good words and respect for them."
LegionOfSkanks,39lt7l,LCFlowers,9,Fri Jun 12 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"That's what made it so funny. It would have been totally out of character if Luis didn't have that reaction. If this happened on the Real Ass Podcast, he would have gone off for the whole episode. Also Jay goading him on certainly added to it."

LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,OMB_,7,Sat Jun 13 04:32:05 2015 UTC,"What are we in sixth grade now? LOS works as a unit. They all bring something of their own to add to the show's chemistry and flow.  My only gripe is when they step on each others lines, especially when someone is trying to make a point or add something. It's a bit annoying when a guest or even one of the skanks is trying to say something and have to repeat it 3 or 4 times because too many people are trying to land their jokes. I doubt that it will change much, cause when you have something funny, it usually just flows out and in that room, you have to be quick.. but if they could just scale it back a tiny bit and stop stepping on each other.. it would be almost flawless.  YKWD suffers from this as well. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it's overkill."

LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,Fake80s,7,Sat Jun 13 07:08:39 2015 UTC,"Even people who rank Dave the lowest probably don't actually dislike him. They're all very likeable and talented, but one of them has to rank the lowest. The guy who said ""Dave is the opie of the crew"" is a retard."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,Flamgirlant,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:39:49 2015 UTC,"I like Dave a lot too. I haven't heard a lot of his standup, but he's super quick, and I like that he can make fun of his serious side without getting indignant."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,WiretapStudios,8,Mon Jun 15 07:34:21 2015 UTC,"The show is compelling because its quite balanced. There is no Robins, Opies, redbans, keith the cops, or chris scopos on LOS. It's actually a rarity how even it is.  I don't really understand the dave hate. The show is a mixture of ballbusting luis and heated philosophical discussions. Dave tends to drive the discussions, consistently has the wittiest lines with his infinite jewwiness, he has best shots at luis along with the best luis voice."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,Eternalforms,4,Sat Jun 13 19:21:14 2015 UTC,They're all likable.   Big Jay is by far the funniest but Luis is the most entertaining. Even when he's not trying to be funny he'll say or do something that gets a big reaction out of the other two.  Dave's cool too
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,Ebhagz,14,Sun Jun 14 12:50:31 2015 UTC,"Don't underestimate Dave, some of the most epic LOS bits were set up by something dave said. Oh and also he's fucking hilarious so you're dumb"
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,LOSFan1,2,Sat Jun 13 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure if you add up all the time that folks on the LOS crew have derailed the podcast in a direction that hasn't paid off, Luis ends up looking worse than Dave. Dave misses sometimes, but when he hits he hits hard. When they're all riffing on a subject (like the ""live reads"" at the start of the first TAC network episode) it is NEVER Dave running out of gas at the end.  All three skanks are great together. Nobody even resembles any of my least favorite characters on other ensemble podcasts or radio shows."

LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,beverlyhillsjobber,-6,Sun Jun 14 12:51:42 2015 UTC,"i feel like this is happening, he's trying too hard to be the shocking guy who will say anything, which he will be the king at because that shit peaked in 07, i dont care what you say but make it funny, just because its brutal doesnt always mean its funny. he's funny mostly on the podcast but im not sure about his standup, although the elvis joke kills me.  jay is obviously the most likeable/funny on the show, he seemed like he was the most reserved when the cumia deal went down, luis and especially dave were defending it but jay seemed to understand why people were upset. the one reason i dont hate them for making the move is jay is one of the funniest comics out there and he deserves the money, but fuck luis and daves open mic asses."

LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,realassdude,7,Sun Jun 14 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new to the show after being an O&A fan for years and hearing about the show through the O&A sub-reddit, so take this with a grain of salt.  Big Jay and Luis are easily the ones who carry the show for me. Jay's dialogue is the most consistently beneficial input for the show, and he's the funniest of the three. Luis has an awesome energy and passion for the show and can be pretty hilarious, but his willingness to be the punching bag and roll with/laugh at the jokes made at his expense is maybe my favorite thing about him - that's an important ability to have on this type of show and it's easy to overlook.  Dave is the least funny and interesting of the three, and I also think he interrupts at bad times more often than the others, and he delivers bad jokes as if they're going to be hilarious fairly often. I certainly don't dislike him, but he seems much less crucial to the show than the other two."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,Flamgirlant,11,Sat Jun 13 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"Dave does the best Luis voice, and he has some hilarious lines. He does tend to interrupt more and could scale it back some. Not sure how many shows you have watched yet, but Dave is just as crucial to the show and Jay and Luis are. Aside from the stepping on people when they are trying to talk, I think he's great... at sucking my balls."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,KNUCKKLEFUCKER,3,Sat Jun 13 10:19:21 2015 UTC,"If you really listen, they all interrupt each other constantly. I agree with everything else you said though :)"
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,LOSFan1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"In what I've heard, I've found Jay to be way funnier when he was doing the Luis voice than Dave. In just the two last week, him imitating Luis shitting on the guy who was standing and interjecting questions (which was fucking hilarious) he said something like ""Why are you just standing there like a prick fuck? You come see our show and you just stand there dressed like a gentleman!?"" And talking about the pornstar from GoT saying ""Look at that big jew kike nose you fucking racist. What, you won't look at her cause she's a jewish kikenose?""  I'm not trying to shit on Dave, he's made me laugh a decent amount. But he does throw out bombs far more often than the other two (Norton responding to a couple of his jokes as Chip was well-deserved). I've seen/heard probably 20 episodes or so at this point. I think LoS is unbelievably great for how unknown it is, and I really like all 3 of them. I just like Dave the least."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,Flamgirlant,2,Sun Jun 14 04:37:20 2015 UTC,Obviously Luis. There are three Luises in every episode.
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,biryani_evangelist,2,Sat Jun 13 21:57:55 2015 UTC,"Jay, Dave, then Louis  I'd put Louis higher but his stupidity sometimes trumps his comedy."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,HackingYourMonitor,2,Sat Jun 13 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"Jay is the best, but they're all needed.  The show is so good because the three have such great chemistry.  The vibe always feels off when one of the skanks can't make a show.  I think Dave is under-appreciated, his snarkiness balances out Luis' rowdiness.  Luis obviously brings the energy and the focus.  Jay is just hilarious and a very engaging speaker."
LegionOfSkanks,39o5ia,TurkeyLizard,2,Mon Jun 15 02:44:52 2015 UTC,"Show doesnt work without thw dynamic of the 3. Came to the show for Jay's comedy, but grew to love Luis."

LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,BustterMcNuttley,10,Sat Jun 13 23:48:23 2015 UTC,Luis - I would say that LoS has probably kept us together and made us tighter. Jay is pretty hollywood so if we didn't have a binding contract I am not sure where our friendship would be.  Dave - We argue like friends argue but I don't think it is any different than if we werent doing a podcast.  Jay - We've had some basic infighting but overall through circumstances of life we don't get to hang out a ton and Legion of Skanks kind of has given us the excuse to hang twice a week.   Overall.. yeah we are tight like brothers and fight like family.

Edit: Wasn't meant as a jab, that sub-reddit has 8.5 million subscribers, this one has 865 and they are already fans."
LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,2ugly4porn,28,Thu Jun 11 18:01:34 2015 UTC,I researched it. we don't need to do it there. we don't care about people stumbling upon our AMA.. This is for the fans of the show.
LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,TotesMessenger,5,Thu Jun 11 18:10:50 2015 UTC,That's an awesome real-ass dude thing to do but next time maybe try there. Most of the O&A/R&F pest types love your podcast and would pump it up to get you some exposure.
LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,Hibidi-Shibidi,3,Thu Jun 11 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"They wanted the fans to get a chance to ask all their questions, which means leaving it up for more than a day.

LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,keemers,5,Thu Jun 11 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"When you guys first started comedy, what kind of jobs did you do to support your goal of being a comedian?"
LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,Mantis_Toboggan369,3,Thu Jun 11 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"Luis - I sold comedy club tickets on the streets of NYC when I first started until a few years ago. It was a nightmare.  Jay - I worked at a cd store, I delivered auto parts, strippers and hookers and I dressed as characters for kids parties.  Dave - I also sold comedy club tickets and I worked at Chase bank for a short time"

LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,WrightOnTarget,2,Sat Jun 13 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Fuck I wish I knew about this earlier....  Is it just a joke because of his slight phrame or is Dave actually kind of a badass? Ive heard several times from you guys (Dave, Jay and Soder) that Dave would beat Luis in a fight and its just so hard for me to believe that....at first I thought it was just a joke but Ive heard it so much im starting to think its not a troll.   Dave > RealAssDude?"
LegionOfSkanks,39h0zn,KrisJordeen,4,Sat Jun 27 20:14:57 2015 UTC,Dave was raised in Brooklyn in a pretty rough area. Got into a lot of fights when he was a kid. Very scrappy and willing to throw down if it came down to it. I would wreck his shit though.

I also would really like to see pepper hicks on, and for Anthony's one year someone (looking at you luis) should stake out Times square and find that black chick that got this whole thing going. Just an idea/s   Thanks guys, after listening to Opie and Anthony for awhile it's nice to see you guys picking up where they left off."

LegionOfSkanks,39gmoh,wp9215,6,Thu Jun 11 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to ""get away with"" anything. I gave the honest answer. When Luis asked if having the 2 cameras would look better, i said Yes. My concern was having the episode completely edited and released before the deadline of 8pm the next day. My set up was going to make that goal the easiest possible way for that to happen.  It would have looked fine, not perfect, but fine. I guarantee there would have been no complaints. In the end, we didn't even use the extra camera shots, so none of this even matters."

LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,Wsallgood,7,Wed Jun 10 04:30:44 2015 UTC,Anyone trying to do a character or shtick is always going to bomb on LoS.  It just doesn't fit with the vibe of the show and the guys are probably not going to engage and try to save you.  Big Jay with Doug Benson is the only time I remember someone even trying and he still bombed awfully.
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,yourethebestaround12,5,Wed Jun 10 12:52:11 2015 UTC,"Gavin is a guy that has ""offensive"" opinions  but he isnt hang with comedians funny. He can only be outrageous guy in a sanitized feminized corporate news network atmosphere. He came outta the gates humorlessly/awkwardly mentioning how jay is fat and then started giving fox news bullet points to luis about sticking together with his wife/baby momma and then oddly enough started to come outta the closet to a very awkward and confused response. Interesting clusterfuck of events but not really a fit with the show."
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,Eternalforms,2,Wed Jun 10 13:06:31 2015 UTC,Benson did not bomb. Haters just hate regardless
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,pianosbecome,2,Wed Jun 10 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"False, Doug ""ON WEED!!!!"" Benson bombed as expected.  He is an unfunny one trick pony hack.  The Skanks hopefully learned their lesson about bringing people on their show solely because they have a lot of Twitter followers."

LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,pianosbecome,3,Thu Jun 11 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm with you that Benson kinda fell flat, but are you really shitting on the New Jack episode?  I thought that one was excellent. We got to hear some grade A Luis buffoonery."
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,paradin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:47:39 2015 UTC,I thought it was terrible.  He basically grunted 3 word answers with a few expletives thrown in. Didn't elaborate on anything the guys wanted to talk about and just seemed overall difficult. Sucks cause if you have on an ex-wrestler there should be a lot to talk about and laugh about considering all the skanks have some wrestling knowledge and past interest.
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,pianosbecome,2,Thu Jun 11 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"I could've sworn there was a mighty interesting story or two in there somewhere, at least for someone totally unfamiliar with the guy. Something about stabbing a guy with a knife in the middle of a match, and then dodging the charges by agreeing to train the guy he stabbed then never following through. I think he talked about wrestling on acid too. Either way I enjoyed it. It may not have been ""Subway Counts"", but it certainly wasn't as bad as Benson or Gavin."
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,paradin,8,Thu Jun 11 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"I like Gavin but it was not his best appearance on a show.  He was on the marriage thing for the whole show probably because he was talking to Dante on his podcast last week.  It got old and no one ""steered the ship"". It should have been Luis since he seems to be a Gavin fan but he was super baked. It seemed like everyone was too high. The end of the show seemed rushed. They didn't plug anything. Also they didn't show any of Gavins videos. They should have him on the next time he starts another internet shitstorm which should happen fairly soon so they have something to talk about right off the bat."
LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,SpaceOctagon,5,Wed Jun 10 05:00:15 2015 UTC,In the past it was one thing the handful of times LOS got too drunk and/or high during an episode and it turned into an unentertaining clusterfuck.  However now you want people to pay for your show so you should at least have the common courtesy to be even the tiniest bit professional and not get that fucked up.

LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,Mantis_Toboggan369,5,Thu Jun 11 17:36:57 2015 UTC,"This episode was great! Gavin incoherently pontificating for about an hour and a half while the skanks listen on in stoned bewilderment.   I think Jay expressed it perfectly at around 1:23:10 - "" Do you know why I love you, Gavin? I literally don't agree with any of your philosophies but I want to hear you tell them constantly""  His guest appearance on the Race Wars podcast was hilarious. One of the girls screams at him and chucks a phone at his head!"

LegionOfSkanks,399a5z,tar_baby33,2,Thu Jun 11 17:02:00 2015 UTC,He got too drunk and bombed. It was awkward. The guys didnt know how to react/ probably didnt wanna burn a bridge with gavin since hes networked in with cumia pretty tight.  He seems to seriously nd humorlessly believe most of the stuff the skanks play up and joke about.

LegionOfSkanks,392raa,br0hemian,0,Mon Jun 8 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not super angry about their new deal with Cumia's network.  Anthony is a great dude and I hope it works out for everyone involved... but that doesn't mean I can't be be disappointed in the changes they are making.  I will not be subscribing to the network because I'm a cheap fuck stuck in student debt who technically has no money to my name.  LoS is my favourite podcast for my commute hands down, they are the #1 in terms of entertainment value.  But there are thousands of podcasts out there that take more time and work to create, have a much higher production value, and are released for free on an ad based revenue stream (Radiolab, This American Life, etc.).  I would love for the guys to address why they decided against that business model, because that is what all the backlash is about.  /essay"
LegionOfSkanks,392raa,Touch_Of_Red,7,Tue Jun 9 01:12:22 2015 UTC,"""I don't want to pay so I'm mad that other people get things that I don't"".  That's pretty much what the argument boils down to, right?  Because none of us know the details on the deal they made or what other offers they had, but it's pretty reasonable to assume that since they aren't idiots, this was the best deal they could make.  So I'm not sure why you feel that you need an indepth breakdown of their business model when the end answer is obviously going to be ""this made us the most money""."

That is precisely why I'd like them to clarify the details.  If it really does boil down to ""we make more money doing this than ads"" that would be extremely disappointing for a lot of the fans, and rightfully so.  It's a very short-sighted model, if the podcast keeps growing at the exponential rate it has been in the past few months, they would be raking in the cash with an advertisement based model without even charging anything.  It just seems like a win-win situation for both the Skanks themselves, and the fans.  Why not do that?  Edit:  I already bought two Legion of Skanks shirts, I've seen Jay twice, and I'm planning on catching Luis in Toronto just next week.  These guys bring joy to my life every week, I just don't understand the concept of charging for podcasts.  It boggles my mind.  There are literally thousands of podcasts out there being provided to the public for free, where the producers make decent money from ads.  It is the accepted business model.  If the guys didn't see the backlash coming they were kidding themselves."

But again...there is still a free podcast every week on youtube and itunes.  So why wouldn't it keep growing at an exponential rate?  Aside from the live stream (which couldn't have been pulling in any money) there is literally no difference on the free side.  So why would you think they are losing money, actual or potential?  They can still run ads if they so choose (Cumia does).  Literally the only difference is that now, if you want, you can pay around $.50/hr and watch every show whenever you want, and get an extra show a week.  How anyone can be mad at or question that, beyond simple jealousy, is beyond me."
LegionOfSkanks,392raa,br0hemian,-1,Tue Jun 9 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"At this point I'm just repeating the same points which you refuse to absorb, and I'm getting kinda bored of it.  Let me simplify things for you.  In gaming, games cost 70$ across the board - that is the price the market dictates.  Some games have tried to also charge a monthly subscription just to play the game.  Elder Scrolls Online did it recently, charging 15$/month to play - because of this pay model the game completely bombed.  Utter failure across the board, despite being a part of the massive Elder Scrolls series, one of the most popular franchises in gaming in the last decade.  Literally a week after release the game world was completely dead.  In podcasting, podcasts are free - that is the price the market dictates.  The producers still make their money from advertising, while providing content for free.  Some people still decide to charge for their hard work, but putting anything behind a paywall when 99.99% of the market is providing their content free of charge is almost certain failure.  LoS will not fail, because only half their content is behind a paywall, but they will not be benefitting from the growth they would have experienced doing two shows for everybody every week.  They could have been profitting doing what they love and providing it to everyone free of charge.  At the end of the day it was their decision and, like I've said, I hope it works out for the best.  But to act surprised at people getting a little bit upset is flat out stupid.  Yeah, we are getting the same amount of content, nothing has changed for us... that's the disappointing thing!  LoS  has felt like it was about to blow the fuck up for months, but if this is how they are planning on ""expanding"" it is letting down the vast majority of their fanbase, period.  If you fail to acknowledge the nuances of the situation and come back with some kind of ""you're spoiled lol nothing has changed for you"" comment, I will not be responding.  This has been a colossal waste of my time."
LegionOfSkanks,392raa,mad-lab,4,Tue Jun 9 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"LoS will not fail, because only half their content is behind a paywall, but they will not be benefitting from the growth they would have experienced doing two shows for everybody every week.    How are you suggesting this ""growth"" would have come about, just by releasing two shows? Why aren't other podcasts releasing two shows, if that leads to ""growth""? In fact, some of the podcasts you mentioned release slower than 1 show a week! Radiolab releases roughly every two weeks. Twice as slow. If releasing more free podcasts per-week is what leads to growth, why don't they do that? Why is Radiolab releasing half as many shows?  Growth in podcasts happens with exposure. Exposure is mainly due to word-of-mouth. People talk to their friends, tweet/facebook/reddit links to the podcast. People also  give downloads/hits/ratings on itunes which raises their profile even more.  The point of joining TACS is that it immediately gives them (presumably) thousands of new subscribers, and gives them access to new facilities (compound, and upcoming studio in NYC) and guests (friends of TACS, like Jim Norton, and Gavin). All of that leads to more exposure. The traffic on the subbreddit has increased because of that.  Releasing two podcasts a week for free doesn't give them that. The only way it would help their growth is if the people who were already subscribing were to say ""Hey, I normally wouldn't recommend this podcast at one-show-per-week... but because it's now two-shows-per-week I'll start recommending it"". I doubt that's a common scenario. Most people who would recommend the show already have or were already going to because of how funny it is, regardless of the number of shows per-week."

The only way it would help their growth is if the people who were already subscribing were to say ""Hey, I normally wouldn't recommend this podcast at one-show-per-week... but because it's now two-shows-per-week I'll start recommending it"".   I don't know how you can possibly think more shows doesn't mean more growth, that's how all online content works.  The content creator builds an audience, slowly at first, but the growth gets faster exponentially depending on how often content is released.  The more content is released, the more opportunities there are for people to talk about it and spread the word - whether that be face to face, over the internet, through texting, whatever it may be.  You even went on to say ""growth in podcasts happens with exposure"" literally proving my point.  I get that they reach an audience there, I am pumped that they have a new location, and I fucking love that they already had my favourite comedian of all time Jim Norton on as a direct result of this deal.  I know there are a lot of positive things coming from this.  As I've said in every comment so far, I understand why they went with the deal and I hope it works out for them, BUT I also think a 5$/month subscription fee is ludicrous.  Especially when it's not only possible but easy to supply the same content for your viewers free of charge while profiting off ads.  I just don't like how they've handled it so far.  Just saying ""hurr durr but you get the same shit guys!  stop being so stupid and whiny!"" doesn't address the fact that they expanded and the vast majority of their viewers are not going to be experiencing 50% of that expansion because it's behind an unnecessary paywall.  This has been a long winded post, but at the end of the day it boils down to this.  There are two kinds of people in this world:  those who pay for porn podcasts, and those who don't.  The people in the ""we pay for porn podcasts"" boat are evacuating ship, but the Legion of Skanks just hopped on board."

And yet can you provide me a single comedy podcast that is more successful than LoS and that releases more than once a week? Like I said, every single one of the successful podcasts you mentioned so far do not release more than once a week. Some even release less.  Why are all those podcasts you mentioned not releasing more than once a week if that is they key to growth and success?   The more content is released, the more opportunities there are for people to talk about it and spread the word - whether that be face to face, over the internet, through texting, whatever it may be. You even went on to say ""growth in podcasts happens with exposure"" literally proving my point.   People will spread the word if the content is good, not if there is a lot of it.

You're in denial man, there are tons.  Joe Rogan, Adam Carolla, Bill Burr, Marc Maron, just a few off the top of my head.  I don't know how that's even relevant?  Correlation does not imply causation.   Why are all those podcasts you mentioned not releasing more than once a week if that is they key to growth and success?   Firstly, I never said it was the key to success.  Obviously quality of content is the key to success, which brings me to Radiolab - I can't believe I'm even addressing this.  Radiolab is a part of WNYC, one of the biggest broadcasting companies on the planet.  They have staff on salary.  They send people around the world.  They research topics.  They interview people.  They need to put so much time & effort into each one of their podcasts it is next to impossible to do a show every two weeks, let alone every week.  The Legion of Skanks on the other hand is a bunch of comedians who like to dick around on camera for 90 mins every week.  The only preparation involved is rolling joints and ubering to the location, and the editing is child's' play compared to the mastering involved in Radiolab's episodes.  But you're telling me the Skanks cost 5$/month and Radiolab is free?  That would be like Brazzers being free for everyone and Pornhub being subscription based.  Anthony Cumia's network is going against the grain of the market, and that generally entails failure.   Yeah, I didn't say that. I addressed your argument about growth and pointed out how it was wrong. That's the only thing I'm interested in. You can spare me the other complaints that don't apply to me.   Firstly, you didn't prove jack shit, lmao.  And I never claimed you said that, I really couldn't care less about you or your opinions.  That was aimed at the Skanks themselves, who made this a way bigger thing than it had to be by pretending everybody is selfish to not pay 5$/month for a service that is being provided for free by the rest of the market.  EDIT:  I'm going out to watch the basketball, and I'm done arguing here.  I've made my points and all I've got in response is a bunch of arguments just for the sake of arguing.

LegionOfSkanks,38v3q4,jsmill1,8,Sun Jun 7 04:03:26 2015 UTC,I've spent my commute to work every day this week catching up on his podcast 'Free Speech'.  I cannot recommend it enough to any fans of LOS or Race Wars.  I agree cwith Gavin on maybe 60% of the time but his fearlessness  and humor are really entertaining.
LegionOfSkanks,38v3q4,Fake80s,3,Sun Jun 7 09:23:01 2015 UTC,I hope this isn't the free one next week. He stinks.  Luis seems to have a massive hard on for him tho.

Bonnie McFarlane was on the same episode, and though he tried, Gavin completely failed to get under her skin. She couldn't be bothered, and just smashed Gavin and everybody else on the show."

So when Big Jay and later the whole crew started appearing on TACS, it brought the podcast to my radar.   I have listened to approx. 40 shows now, picking the guests that interest me most.  Only one more recent Geno Bisconte episode is bad, because he got drunk and is deliberately derailing the podcast. But that episode is interesting to listen to as well.   I wish i was more reserved and less positive about LoS, but i find them simply to be this good. O&A and R&F going away left a BIG FUCKING GAP, and i only see LoS being able to potentially fill it (#somehomo). Bla bla, i resubbed to the network because of them.

It must have sucked telegramming to this and editing it. My two cents:  1) Luis admitted he fucked up by laying hands, but it wasn't just the heckler that sucked, there was a build up of mismanagement by the producer. But wasn't there so hard to have a perspective of on the situation. 2) At the podcast, I feel like it could have gone differently. Luis actually threw some verbal jabs first and I think this hardened the mystery against him. I think Luis should have gone in more cool and started with the fact that he was a veteran producer. Next he could give a couple examples of why he would crowd control rather than not. Instead Luis went in hot and it quickly deteriorated.  My questions: 1) Anyone know who the mystery guest is? Voice sounds so familiar. 2) Anyone know where/when the Joe List taking in Boston will be? Peace [rattlesnake sound]"
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,Saywh4t,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:35:50 2015 UTC,Just listened to ykwd and Joe said he's taping on the 10th in Boston
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,redsox885,7,Thu Jun 4 05:53:09 2015 UTC,"Luis. I am a lifetime gomite. But you seemed to be wrong in this scenario. Why didn't you just deal with the heckler in a comedic way. Why fight/challenge him. You see to be so alpha male that you can't see a way to defuse the situation with comedy. I love the no holds barred comedy that you produce, and you will be a force in the industry in years down the line, but you need to suck some of the shit up and deal with it rather than constantly challenging everyone.  You are a skilled artist, but to make more people pay attention you need to not make your headline ""comic smushed hecklers face"" but rather "" comic destroys heckler asshole from his comedy"". You are a talent that I love on ykwd and Los. I just think your way to alpha male and it may hurt you in the long run. Anyway. Keep up the solid comedy and I can't wait to see what you can do on Anthony Cumia's network.  Good luck in your future."
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,SlapNutz666,6,Thu Jun 4 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is one of the few times I didn't agree with Luis. He sounded like he lost his cool and he did on the podcast too. And then attacked his guest, who, on a re-listen, never really did anything but disagree with The Real Ass Dude about how he handled the heckler.  Never disrespected Luis' comedy.  Even the clip they played on LOS made Luis sound out of control."
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,yourethebestaround12,14,Thu Jun 4 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"The guest was being a complete cunt.  Luis was screaming like a psycho but he did admit(several times) that he was wrong for attacking the guy and the guest kept harping on it even after this.  He also refused to acknowledge or concede any point Luis made, denying that there even was a problem with any audience members."
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,SlapNutz666,3,Thu Jun 4 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"How was he a cunt? Luis asked for his side and after a couple of false starts he tried to give it. Luis had trouble seeing why the guy saw things differently, I think.  Any guesses on who the beeped out comedian was?"
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,realassdude,13,Thu Jun 4 13:20:09 2015 UTC,"he was a cunt because he didn't police his own room and then blamed me for losing it on a guy that was being shitty for 30 plus minutes beforehand to every comic on the show. I never claimed to be right for losing my shit on the guy. I wasn't even going to blame the comedian who produced the show.. I was just going to tell the story but then this pussy pretended that there wasn't a problem with the audience.. that is was me. Shows like this and the people who produce them are the problem with the comedy scene. Too many people think they can be shitty to comics without repercussions. I'll take the label of ""crazy"".. It was worth it to punk that guy out in front of his girlfriend. She probably can't cum with him anymore."
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,biryani_evangelist,4,Thu Jun 4 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, these idiots are being shitty to the other people in the audience as well. What I hate the most about live comedy is members in the audience yapping, over-laughing cause they're drunk, repeating every punchline (wtf is that about?), etc. It bugs me to the point where I can't focus on the act, and that makes me even madder. I would definitely watch live comedy a lot more if the clubs gave a shit about this."
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,SlapNutz666,3,Thu Jun 4 14:21:58 2015 UTC,he was a cunt because he didn't police his own room and then blamed me for losing it on a guy that was being shitty for 30 plus minutes beforehand to every comic on the show.>>>   Can't disagree because you were there. Plus the definition of you being a Real Ass Dude is you put this stuff out there unapologetically.  My only last question is do you think you over-reacted to the heckler or to your guest?
LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,realassdude,6,Thu Jun 4 14:41:53 2015 UTC,I probably overreacted to both.  Real ass dudes have no regrets though.

He wasn't helping the argument at all by making smarmy, cunty jabs while you were trying to make your point. It's almost like he was egging you on, to see if you would put your hands on him to prove his point. Glad you kept your shit together. Him not being willing to admit that he made some mistakes in the way he was handling the   crowd issues,  thinking it was no big deal makes me side with you on this one."

LegionOfSkanks,38f4ms,antshells,2,Sat Jun 6 08:45:31 2015 UTC,The guest was a dick. He was an amateur who didn't understand how comedy works. It's not a participation event- listen to the comedian and don't interrupt. This is the hipster attitude to life maaaaaan!

LegionOfSkanks,38d4b8,realassdude,4,Wed Jun 3 14:43:39 2015 UTC,playing standup from the guest makes perfect sense. i even remember it now. sorry for not thinking and thanks for the reply.

However, one episode from the previous week will be uploaded on Mondays on both itunes and their youtube channel. So to answer your question, you do need to be a subscriber to get both episodes per week. Only one episode per week will be free."
