Antiques,3e7st5,RufusSaltus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"It doesn't appear to be a piece of Northwest Native American art, so it's probably not associated with totem poles.  I'm sorry to say I can't tell you much more than that, though it gives me the impression of more African art."

Antiques,3e2kyk,adlihdz006,4,Tue Jul 21 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but here's what I found out! :)  ""Minne at Stockholm"" is apparently Swedish for ""Memory of Stockholm"" (Translation courtesy of Google Translate) :)  The building shown on the inside of the bowl of the spoon appears to be the Royal Palace in Stockholm :) Here's a picture, for comparison: http://www.landmeedchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/royal.jpg . Also, here's some more information about the Palace: http://www.kungahuset.se/kungligaslotten/kungligaslottet.4.7c4768101a4e8883780002658.html and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Palace.  The Queen's head on the handle of the spoon appears somewhat similar to the Stockholm Crest :) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HMS_Stockholm_vapen.svg  I looked into the marks on the spoon, and discovered a mishmash of information as to what they could mean.  I discovered that the CFC mark could mean that the spoon was made by the Danish silversmith C.F.C. Christensen-Kolding, which would date it as being made anywhere between 1920 to 1937: http://www.925-1000.com/denmarkC.html and http://www.nobelantik.dk/2solv_maerker_c.html.  However, I assume that it could also stand for the Finnish CFC, which stands for Controlled Foreign Companies: http://www.nobelantik.dk/2solv_maerker_c.html  The heart-shaped mark appears to be either the Swedish http://www.925-1000.com/Fsweden_Date_Code.html or Finnish http://www.925-1000.com/Ffinland_Date_Code.html National Mark, which has been worn with age.   The mark of a person's head appears somewhat similar to these French Hallmarks (At the left of the page):  http://www.925-1000.com/Ffrench_marks.html  The numbered mark (that says either O6 or Q6) appears to be a Date Mark.  If the spoon is Swedish, this would mean that it was either made in 1890, 1892, or 1894.  However, this would contradict the time frame in which C.F.C. Christensen-Kolding existed.: http://www.modernsilver.com/Swedishhallmarks.htm and http://www.925-1000.com/Fsweden_Date_Code.html.  If the spoon is Finnish, this would mean that it was either made in 1940 or 1945: http://www.925-1000.com/Ffinland_Date_Code.html.  I, unfortunately, could not find any list of Danish Date Marks online; so, if the spoon is Danish, I wouldn't know the date it could have possibly been made in :(  Anyhow, given this information, it appears that your spoon may have been a souvenir spoon! :) Here is another Antique Stockholm Palace Souvenir Spoon from 1891: http://ancientpoint.com/inf/48725-ca___1891_swedish_sterling_silver__enamel_stockholm_palace_slott_souvenir_spoon.html  I hope that this information helps! :) And that spoon is gorgeous!"

Antiques,3e2vsr,Artbrutist,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"So many photos, yet so little information.  There is no way to verify this based on what we see and read.  It is certainly not new, but is it 160 years old?  I have my doubts.  How about a photo of a dovetail?  How about a photo of the bottom of a drawer?  How about a photo of the back of the desk?  And don't make claims about possible provenance that obviously can't be backed up."
Antiques,3e2vsr,ironantiquer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"Agree. The photo with the drawer pulled out looks like it is nailed together, so it definitely not from the 1860's. The claim about the provenance makes the seller look very uninformed or an amateur who does not know what they are doing."
Antiques,3e2vsr,bigblacksquirrel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:52:42 2015 UTC,"My attitude is buy it if you like how it looks.  My gut feeling is that it's probably not 1860s.  It's just an interesting used desk.  I would like to see pics of back of desk, any hardware, inside drawers, dovetailing, and any other detail."
Antiques,3e2vsr,funchy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:16:29 2015 UTC,"Fascinating piece but couple things.... 1) yikes? are those wood borer holes? is that what they mean by treated? 2) how/why did Chinese desk get to India? 3) whole thing refinished at some point....not badly, but changes value. Make sure it is bug free and argue that price way down."

Value unknown 30 or so quality postcards, @ $40 8 CDV (antique photos) with revenue stamps, @ $30 Various other paper bits that could add another $50 or so to the haul.   Not a home run by any means but the ticket stubs should have me covered by midday tomorrow. That's leaving aside the fun of acquiring more cool paper bits, which is something I really enjoy. Out of all of this I will probably hold on to a few of the postcards for a while. I tend to keep stuff I like until I notice that I haven't looked at or enjoyed it for a few months. Then it's time to let it go and make room for something new. There are only three pieces that will never leave me while I live. One bronze and two paintings, all gifts from people who were important to me."
