Too often it feels like people just cast down their racial issues onto the South instead of addressing the very same problems plaguing their community. The South isn't an annulment for the rest of the nation's racial issues.   It may suffer from the same problems, but at least Southerners will acknowledge the elephant in the room."

I've seen too many times where someone tried to downplay racism in their area by saying it's not as bad as the South. Of course, they also have never been to the South, and think it's  still being run by George Wallace and his ilk (I once had someone ask me if black musicians could play in major cities or if they faced too many racist protests still). The racial tensions are not that radically different than the ones faced in other parts of the country, they're just slightly more overt. And they definitely shouldn't be used to avoid discussing the issues on a national level as much as they are."

Not maliciously, but I'd have to know who I really am, and I'm not sure I even know that, so how could I present myself to anyone else with complete honesty?  It seems, maybe, that without tangible reinforcement or punishment (is karma or shadowbanning really anything substantive?) people are likely to become more or less honest than their interpersonal projection.

Currency exists before it is given or it is created through debt. Karma is frequently described as ""worthless Internet points"". Karma only has value for indexing content up or down on the page. The accumulation of karma doesn't change the behavior of the user.   Not to get too existential...   This topic is about existentialism. Sartre stated that ""existence precedes essence"". In other words, a human being comes into existence (born into this world) first and then determines for her/himself the meaning and purpose of their life (essence).  A fictional character's purpose (essence) is determined by the writer before the character comes into existence. A redditor's essence is determined by the user  before the redditor comes into existence (account creation). A redditor is a non-existential being...anything resembling social behavior can only be analogous at best. I think your tribal comparison is an analogy but not a realistic characterization of the behavior. I think you might have a bias towards believing that ""social"" in the context of reddit is the same as ""social"" in the context of real human interaction.  tl;dr:  Thank you, Archchancellor.

For a lot of insecure men on Reddit, the fact that they were born male will always be a positive that they can look to and hold up in their favor. When it's convenient to them, they like to celebrate this through masculinity, or the symbol of ""male-ness"" for them.   The masculine symbols that Reddit most prefer are, unsurprisingly, the ones that require the least commitment and discipline. Beer and bacon you can buy at a store, and a beard is something that almost all men can grow just by not shaving. This all also ties to red meat, grilling, owning and carrying weapons, the whole ""gentlesir"" bullshit, fetishizing suits, etc. Meanwhile, Reddit either ignores, is ambivalent to, or sometimes actively resents masculine symbols which aren't so easily picked up- a muscular physique, carpentry, auto repair, tattoos, et al. but most significantly by far, athleticism.  Reddit picks up masculinity when it's convenient to their needs and assuaging to their insecurities, and it manifests through the masculine symbols that are easily bought."

As another commentator has said, it's a really long series and the discussions is creates are even longer so people who invest the time into it are going to be prideful of it. It borders on a hobby for many people and it is a hobby for people like BrydenBFish, Preston Jacobs, Linda Antonsson & Elio Garcia. Linda & Elio have co-authored a book with GRRM and he often asks for their input on keeping the facts straight in his story.  So lots of people get upset when the popular version of a story they are really into is not the same one they've put a lot of time into. Their favourite characters simplified and brought closer to black or white than the greys that they love.  Another thing to bear in mind is that the elitist book readers spend enough time in the discussions that they've seen ""Is Gendry in line for the throne?"", ""Do I have to read all the books if I want to understand the next one?"" a hundred times.  And people are bitter that nearly 20 years have passed yet the show will finish before the books.

Laptops have a lower TDP since they use less power, however, the decreased airflow level with constricted space and generally lower quality fans can also have a very negative effect on how cool the laptop stays. My desktop has a total of 500W usage and manages to stay cooler than my laptop did because it has bigger fans to disperse air and it isn't forced to suck in air through a single hole out the bottom or side.  However, my laptop didn't get near as hot as my first one did that was a hand-me-down from my dad. It was a 2000 Sager with a dedicated AMD graphics card and a desktop-grade P4.

Negareddit,3ds9tl,JonWood007,2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, my calculations were done on a non-retina iMac. I used affordable quality parts on NewEgg to build a machine with identical specs. I didn't include the price of Windows.  It's generally agreed that Apple makes the best displays. Getting a built-in Apple Cinema Display is a giant selling point. If you want a 1080p ViewSonic and the cheapest parts you can find online, obviously a PC is cheaper. But you don't get cheap, low-quality parts with a Mac. No matter what the circlejerk tells you. My last iMac lasted me over 8 years.  Edit: You said you wanted my calculations. I'm no longer on mobile, so here's the relevant part of a piece I wrote:   So I did the math (I stuck with quality items, but not the most expensive at Newegg.com):  • Quad-core 3.2 GHz Intel i5 CPU: $180  • NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M: $250  • 8 GB 1600 DDR3 RAM: $60  • 1 TB 7200 RPM hard drive: $170  • Bluetooth keyboard (a good one, mind you): $50 (Apple sells theirs for $70)  • Bluetooth mouse with touch-sensitive top: $70  • Motherboard (this was difficult, but with similar I/O and good quality): $350  • Fans, enclosure, power supply, general requirements for putting it all together: $270  Total? $1400. Which seems reasonable for a quality-minded PC builder. And that’s not including the HD iSight camera, speakers, or… oh wait, I forgot one key thing: the display.  For $2000 you get $1400 worth of computer built behind an industry-leading 27” 2560x1440 IPS LED Apple Display. I’ve had even the most hardcore PC evangelists say that their dream setup would be a powerful PC paired with an Apple display. That runs $1000 retail. I checked for similar non-Apple displays and found if you want a good-to-great one, you’re spending about $800. $2200 for the same thing. Let’s throw in a pair of $15 Logitech speakers (which, I’ll be honest, is comparable to my iMac’s). $2215.   So, I lied. It's actually $215 more."
Negareddit,3ds9tl,kjoeleskapet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"Ok. Let's do a little math here.  The cheapest imac is $1099 on their website and has these specs:  1.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz 8GB memory 500GB hard drive1 Intel HD Graphics 5000   Also has a 1080p display.  That's....bad.   Meanwhile, on r/pcmasterrace, they have this build for $672.  http://pcpartpicker.com/p/xzZmZL  So the CPU not only has twice as many cores, but its clock speed is significantly higher.  RAM, the same.  Hard drive, twice the size.  High end GPU as opposed to the integrated in the imac.  If we added a monitor for $200 and an OS for $110, it's STILL cheaper than the imac while running circles around it performance wise.  EDIT: $707 now according to the part picker link. Still cheaper though by almost $100."
Negareddit,3ds9tl,JonWood007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But we're still not including any peripherals that come with the iMac. And the 21.5"" iMac's screen is not the same as a $200 screen. It simply is not.  Either way, cheaper by $100 is a long shot from the usual ""Macs are horribly overpriced"" circlejerk. I happily concede that MacBooks are grossly overpriced. But Mac haters always seem to compare their gaming towers to MacBook Pros without looking at iMacs or Mac Pros."
Negareddit,3ds9tl,kjoeleskapet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:33 2015 UTC,Um....that pc is many times stronger than the iMac. If I were doing a direct comparison it would be waaaay cheaper.

Negareddit,3ds9tl,kjoeleskapet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"And that's $1800. I showed you a PC built for around $1000, monitor included, that could keep up, and in terms of direct GPU comparison, outclass that PC. And it totally dominates the comparable 21.5"" one."
Negareddit,3ds9tl,JonWood007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"We seem to be going in circles. I showed you the parts list with prices of comparable parts. Everything included in the box when you buy an iMac for $2000. It came out $200 more. Obviously you can go with cheaper parts and a cheaper monitor, you can go more expensive. The point is an iMac is a powerful computer that doesn't cost much more if not sometimes cheaper. Obviously, a 1.4 GHz iMac with integrated graphics isn't ""comparable"" to that build. It isn't.  I'm not arguing that a PC built to your liking with the latest swappable parts isn't preferable if gaming is your... well, endgame.

Negareddit,3ds9tl,locallyunscene,2,Sun Jul 19 11:59:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to elaborate on this with what I know. I am agreeing with OP, but explaining in detail.  Laptops are OK for gaming today. Tomorrow, not as much.  It comes down to the fact that when someone builds a desktop for beef, they're building it for gaming. (Most) Laptops are meant for general consumer use. This isn't to say that the desktop you find in Wal-Mart isn't made for consumer, either. We are talking in general, most people are going to buy a laptop.  And why wouldn't you? If you're on the go a lot and need the mobility, then that is what desktops are for! Let me tell you. It sucks major tail to haul a 50lb steel case down the stairs, to your car, so that you can buckle it in and... get your monitor and keyboard. Shit! So you can get a laptop out with you in 5 minutes versus 20. And if you're like me and anally careful, you pull your graphics card out and out it in the original manufacturing box so that you don't risk damage to your motherboard socket. (High power graphics cards are huge and heavy. Not meant to be moved around a lot.)  However, the laptop has a couple of issues with gaming. Power aside, you have to consider the integrated graphics card in most consumer laptops. The card itself wouldn't be too bad if the drivers were updated... ever! They're literally never updated! This is because in most cases, the driver for the chipset is written for that setup. You'd go mad updating 20 drivers for every laptop you manufacture and there's no reason to if the laptop is being used for general use. It isn't meant for gaming in mind.  So as I said. A laptop is great for today, but down the road, you'll find a massive performance drop with newer games that a desktop wouldn't have. So if you're playing the games of today and yesterday, great, you're set! (Some older games have issues with Intel, which is the most common integrated chipset. Fallout 3 is a perfect example.)  Although... there is a project in the works that allows people to shove a dedicated graphics card into an external connector. I am interested to see what this will bring to the table. It would be awesome to be able to blow $1000 and have a solid mobile platform. The Integrated Chipset Problem is what holds laptops back the most and if this thing takes off... let's just say it would make attending college LAN Parties more awesome."
Negareddit,3ds9tl,Stressedcal,2,Sun Jul 19 10:18:14 2015 UTC,"Also, It's generally much more difficult to upgrade a laptop.

It happens to every overly used phrase introduced into this extremely social environment. Through continuous usage, a meme takes on new meaning as each individual tries to apply its meaning to their own experiences.  In time, redditors came to associate it with the thin skin of social justice warriors. Not surprising when you consider which topics the term was used most frequently.  You can see the same effect in adviceanimals. ""Awkward penguin"" has slowly evolved into ""mildly offensive penguin"".  tl;dr:  The words that we use most have the least meaning."

The idea that when you know a little bit about something you suddenly think you are an expert.  Also I think it has to do with the natural process of identity formation (which doesn't always follow the same pattern or outline, but it is a good basis). Where many times when you join a new subculture or group you REALLY dive head first into it and become pretty extreme. People who convert to Christianity might go to church multiple times a week and always sit in the front row... somebody comes out as gay and they become VERY flamboyant and over the top... somebody starts getting really into anime and they ONLY watch anime and speak with a lot of pseudo-Japanese... it happens everywhere... and it tends to lessen in time. The Christians might stay near the front but go really only on Sundays... the over the top flamboyant gay man still is out, but doesn't have to ""show off"" being gay at every opportunity, the anime fan still enjoys watching anime but branches out to other types of media.  But you get this with somebody with social justice issues (really any issue, I want to stress this transcends ideologies), mixed with a healthy dose of the dunning-kruger effect since they are new (they both kinda go hand-in-hand), and you get somebody obnoxious that then can be used as a strawman by the other side."

Reddit.com is an organism that other organisms called subreddits live on. There are three types of subreddits: mutualistic, parasitic, and toxic.   A mutualistic subreddit is one that is beneficial for both itself as well as its host. These subreddits bring in content sourced from the external regions of the ecosystem. Both the subreddit and reddit.com thrives. Examples: r/pics, r/philosophy, r/showerthoughts. A parasitic subreddit is one that feeds on other subreddits for content. Many of them are well meaning but never productive in its relationship with the host. They all consume resources internally without bring anything in from the external; resources  that would have been better spent on mutualistic subreddits.  The net sum of a parasitic subreddit is always less than zero. Example: r/circlejerk, r/shitredditsays, r/subredditdrama. A toxic subreddit is one that harms the host. That which kills the host, kills all subreddits along with it...   If you choose 5 subreddits to hate, choose them from the last two categories."

Negareddit,3dma6e,Blank_username,10,Fri Jul 17 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"If tumblr wasn't so intimidating to get into, I'd definitely spend way more time there. I have no idea how you find blogs that you like to start following decent stuff"
Negareddit,3dma6e,RYCBAR,4,Fri Jul 17 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"Some users show what other users they are following. You want to search those out. When you find a good one, it becomes easier from there. Here's one for example. The icons down the side of the page are links to other user's pages. Some of them show who they are following. So you follow a few of the ones that look appealing. As they post stuff, it will be reposts from people they follow, which leads you to others, etc., etc.   I haven't used it in a few years. There's a lot of crossover of content between users and you end up seeing the same stuff repeatedly. Like here."

Negareddit,3dma6e,BaadKitteh,8,Fri Jul 17 19:26:12 2015 UTC,I just don't go to those subs ¯\(°_o)/¯ They rarely affect my reddit experience at all.
Negareddit,3dma6e,tachibanakanade,4,Fri Jul 17 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"There's a problem with the ""don't go to those subs"" thing people like to talk about: that those people who post in those subs post in other subs, that the garbage they spew in those subs is almost never contained to those subs but fans out into wherever they post.    Example: /r/anime is very, very close to being /r/KotakuInAction only with chinese cartoons.    Other example: My city's subreddit is basically a localized version of /r/coontown and /r/conspiracy (aka /r/TheJewsDidIt)    Not going into those subs and Reddit's containment theory don't work. x_x"
Negareddit,3dma6e,nonconcurrence,2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"I would never have found this sub if I didn’t agree with the sentiment in this thread, but I think bailing out of protest is a bit premature.   Reading between the lines, I think the long-range plan is to become more intolerant of intolerance. They just don’t have the ability to deal with it. Yet. It’s debatable in my mind whether they ever will be able to handle it.  This place is wide open. As has been stated, banning the subs is not going to change the problems that you face every day (unless you hang out in r/coontown or whatever). Banning the subs would more likely flush them all out into the other subs, creating a nightmare for mods and legitimate users. Individuals are going to have to be banned by IP.  I would suggest exploring the www, trying some other sites, but I wouldn’t give up on this place yet."

If you don't pay attention to them, no-one will give a shit. They'll just be those mumbling cunts in the corner that no-one listens to.   I hear people complain about pages like greatapes and coontown more than I actually ever see any of their content. What they post is abhorrent, but so is /r/spaceclop and I don't see a campaign to ban them. Where does it end?"
Negareddit,3dma6e,buxwatcher,3,Fri Jul 17 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"Because it attracts racists who then go on to shit all over other subs. CoonTown is why you see so many racist ""facts"" get spammed in /r/worldnews, /r/videos, /r/todayilearned, etc.  Now reddit is saying, yes, come here, we will host you. If they just kept to the chimpire and never posted anywhere else, it would be one thing. But they don't. They just keep the most hateful comments  there.  I am sick of running into this stuff in the wild. Which absolutely happens.  They are mumbling cunts but the difference is that people are listening."

If you look at ""safe spaces,"" their restrictions on what you can say are based on similar rhetoric.  If you accept that, then why doesn't any rhetoric that would get you banned from a ""safe space"" qualify as harassment (and should get you banned site-wide)?

It was an 80/88 with dual 5.25"" floppy drives, no hard drive and ran DOS.  My brother in law at the time gave me a 500mb hard drive for my birthday and helped me install it.  It came with a 13"" color monitor.  A couple years later, I ""upgraded"" to a 386 with GEOS gui OS.  Kind of like Windows, but cuter.  It came with AOL, which, at the time, was the only way to get online.    A lot has changed in the years since.  I think the #1 thing I disliked from the beginning was any spam or advertising.  You could see it from a distance and avoid it pretty easily back then.  When the first adblockers came out (they were individual programs you had to install on your hard drive), I used them all.  Now you can easily install extensions in Firefox and Chrome and there are dozens to choose from...also blocking facebook and google tracking, hiding your IP/Location and much more.  I use them all.

If you get a lot of downvotes from a sincere post without comments then the answer is probably ""yes"". If you get a lot of predictable comments (positive or negative) then you're just circlejerking.  Negareddit is a place to post non-circlejerk (unique/counter-culture) opinions. It's not a place to get upvoted for them though. After all, It's not a circlejerk.  A good negareddit comment will always appear alien and unfamiliar to a redditor."

The mass exodus date is set, July 4th. After 2 weeks of waiting, reddit's goldfish memory span had kicked in long before the set date. All of the hype was lost and the subsequent exodus totaled at a whopping 200 users. Months later it was changed to Voat.

A review for Assassin's Creed is not that fucking important. And if you feel it's more important than preventing harassment, you should feel ashamed.

Seems like unless you have a real manifesto and select a core set of official speakers any wacko or false flag can be the strawperson which tarnishes group or shuts down any discussion. Grassroots has too many weeds imo.  Every community when accused of harassment or whatever will claim that's not what they are about and have rules against that or whatever. And unless the leaders/mods are holding tight control, the democratic votes can push the wrong agenda and pandering ad hominem to the top. This leads to ""Look what our opponent's movement stands for and thinks."" This is more evidence debates should be formalized between experts/representatives and pure democracy fails. Also evidence that leaders mixing shallow humor and politics on the internet is more likely to damage your movement then not."

Negareddit,3djvoe,spotdemo4,12,Fri Jul 17 07:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, normal people feel empathy for other people. When innocent people are being targeted, hurt, harassed, you are supposed to feel empathy. If you don't, you should be concerned.   I don't care when people directly insult me. I do care, however, when there are thousands of people who collectively hate me for reasons out of my control that have been historically reinforced and now play a huge part in modern society. It's not about just seeing an insult. It's knowing that entire communities with hundreds of thousands of members are dedicated to dehumanizing you, and that these communities have been legitimized by legislation in the past, and to a certain extent the present. They represent a much larger problem, and if we can't even get a forum to take a stand against it, how can we expect any real change?   That's why it's bullshit. It's incredible anyone supports these people. I find comfort, however, in knowing that I'm on the right side of history. I'm not sure you are. Remember that the hill you're choosing to die on is a hill filled with racist, misogynistic people who only hate because they feel nothing but emptiness without it."

Negareddit,3djvoe,Combative_Douche,10,Fri Jul 17 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"That is a horrible argument and you know it. Come on. Unless we have an 100% solution we should remain stagnant? That's your answer?   Reddit is a top ten website and the content it allows on its servers shares a message. It's not some no name Voat. It's rapidly gaining popularity and media attention. If it doesn't put its foot down, it's reinforcing these fucked up views in a huge way. Far more than, say, 8chan.  Whatever helps you sleep at night, but just remember there's not much of a difference between saying hateful, racist vitriol and letting someone else say it for you.   You say you don't support what they're saying, yet you're literally supporting it. You are fighting for the message to survive and to spread. You are supporting it. This should bother you more. It's disturbing it doesn't, and it tells me that you don't have a realistic grasp on how racism breeds and its impact on people.   Did you know that Dylann Storm Roof was inspired by places exactly like coontown? You are defending the existence of something that actually fueled the murder of multiple people recently. Elliot Rogers went on PUA forums, which fueled his shooting spree. These communities exist on Reddit. And when these people shoot down the innocent, you may not pull the trigger, but you're watching them load the gun. And somehow that doesn't bother you because you convince yourself you're protecting free speech. But all you're doing is shutting out the human part of you that should KNOW this is wrong. It kills people.   I can't believe I have to explain this. There are more important things than the right to call people the n word online, dude."

(For example, police harassment.) In other words, there is a difference between how society treats black and white people. When we focus on white people getting better treatment, we call it white privilege. When we focus on black people getting worse treatment, we call it racism.   Of course 3 and 4 are both valid. But   White people are not getting special or ""privileged"" treatment. They are getting mostly reasonable, ""default"" treatment. Which everyone deserves. Asian people are harassed by the police at levels similar to white people, yet no one would call that ""Asian privilege"", again, because it's the ""default"". Black people do not get that default, reasonable treatment. They get especially bad treatment. It makes more sense to focus on the actual problem, of black people getting bad treatment, than white (or Asian) people getting average treatment (aka white privilege in this context)."

It privilege the academic term and therefore the one to go with? I've seen it creating confusion & needing explanation before.  Advantage seems like it fits. Even if you, as a white male, worked hard and did a lot, you had more opportunities or were taken more seriously on average than someone who wasn't. It's also quite possible to fail, or be surpassed by others who aren't a white male or privileged group; the lottery of your birth just choose the ""banker"" in Oregon Trail for you.

Everything I've ever heard of his comes off as being abrasive, misogynistic, and a little ignorant. I mean, he's got a bit about beating his girlfriend. (I know it's wrong... but she was being a cunt!)  I really get confused when that praise comes from comedians that I really respect and who generally seem to have a progressive stance on a lot of issues. Comedians like Louis C.K. and Marc Maron, for example, can be a little rough around the edges, but have some warmth to them that makes me think they would work to separate themselves from someone like Burr. They admit being out of touch occasionally. Burr just comes across to me as a raging brogressive asshole screaming ""WHAT ABOUT THE MENZ?!"""

Interestingly, there's a line of his that he throws out in his performances and podcast from time to time that goes like ""if you're a white dude in America in his 20's, you have no excuse"" so he clearly gets the concept of white privilege."
Negareddit,3dj9wf,fenom,7,Thu Jul 16 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, I'm not too familiar with a lot of his material.

I thought, wow, this guy seems to have a joke about toxic masculinity! Then I kept watching and realized that it was actually just a bit about him complaining/worrying that other dudes might think he is a homosexual.  I also watched the first part of his comedians in cars episode and all I got was complaining that people are making too big of a deal about sexual assault in pro football and how kids these days are a bunch of whiny babies.

Negareddit,3dj9wf,Nwsamurai,0,Fri Jul 17 10:11:53 2015 UTC,"An alternative to ""white privilege"" is to focus on the suffering of black people.  For example, when we know black people are often stopped by police for no reason, then we should call that what it is - police harassment, stemming from racism. There should be no controversy about that. But if someone say ""you, a white person, have white privilege because that doesn't happen to you"", then it has all the marketing downsides GP mentioned.  It's also changing the subject! The real issue isn't that white people are not harassed by the police, the problem is that black people are. Focusing on white privilege both annoys people unnecessarily, and doesn't help focus on what needs fixing."
Negareddit,3dj9wf,EvanHarper,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"In America, ""privileged"" has always been a pejoritive, and when you insult someone they almost always go on the defensive. It can be counterproductive.  Like if you tell someone, ""that's racist,"" they will go on a rant giving you all the reason that prove they aren't racist, and then nothing changes.  Edit: I think the following comments are putting me into a context I never intended. I don't think we need softer language to appease racistits. I do think polite conversation between individual is often disrailed by hurt feeling from perceived insults. Would a word other than ""privlidge"" eliminate this?

This comes from Yishan's possibly tongue-in-cheek post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3cs78i/whats_the_best_long_con_you_ever_pulled/cszjqg2) that preceded yesterday's more detailed one."
Negareddit,3dgp0i,__shoe__,7,Thu Jul 16 08:46:32 2015 UTC,"My understanding is this is about getting Reddit back from Conde Nast by looking like the competent co-founders. They're not necessarily trying to appeal to users, but their parent company. ""Give us more control over Reddit or the site and your investment will fail."" If Yishan is being half-serious, they've already accomplished this because Steve is back as CEO."
Negareddit,3dgp0i,__shoe__,3,Thu Jul 16 08:55:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure, but it sounds like Yishan was the one who brought equity back for new/current employees and that Y Combinator's $50mil had already reduced Conde Nast's control. Now that Steve has the CEO spot, they want to make Reddit profitable (changing the conversation about the site by banning certain subs will be a start, as well as following through on promises for improvements and they will likely have to restrict moderator powers to shutdown huge subs at will) and gain more dough than they did from the initial deal with Conde Nast. evil laughter, something about the NWO and lizard dudes"
Negareddit,3dgp0i,__shoe__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:00:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying I 100% believe the theory, it just makes me laugh. I will say that Yishan telling Reddit all of this stuff, from the post about the conspiracy to the differing opinions between Pao and the board would not have been part of the plan. I think they have added unexpected fuel to the fire.   I think the userbase is more likely to forget all of this than not, though. Like with memes on r/atheism, etc. The changes, if they come, will matter to so few people. Additionally, Reddit is not profitable and will not become so until they get some plan beyond what they're doing now to make cash. I don't believe advertisers will touch Reddit so long as the site has a reputation for not acting quickly against hatesubs and that whole world. Who's going to put ads on a site where a mod can shutdown a place like the AMA sub and take all their views and clicks with them?"

Negareddit,3dgp0i,tankguy33,-2,Thu Jul 16 09:27:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But it was also not done by the vast majority of Reddit, by Pao's own admission. The vast majority of protestors were content with criticising her over the policies that she (was forced to?) ushered in."
Negareddit,3dgp0i,Five_Two_Zero,12,Thu Jul 16 09:45:51 2015 UTC,"All of it was still getting upvoted to the front page. Even though the community may not have actively participated in it en masse, they still upvoted all the racist, misogynist bullshit of the people who did threaten her."
Negareddit,3dgp0i,tankguy33,-1,Thu Jul 16 09:54:40 2015 UTC,"What I saw being upvoted to the front page was mostly comparing her to various dictators due to the policies. They may not have been the most articulate of postings, I mean I'm pretty sure Pao ordered the shutdown of a few subs and not the execution of 6 million people, but they were, nonetheless, criticisms of policy and not threats or harrassment.  Now that said, I have no doubt what you are saying is true, that there were posts that were like 'zermehgerd, wermern cernt rern beesnesees' (I'm not going to echo what I think was actually being said), and I can see the Chairman Pao meme probably had a bit to do with her ethnicity. I can even see the racist/sexist comments getting a lot of upvotes, hundereds and maybe thousands. But this is a community of 165 million people, and there was no escaping the revolt for anyone that was active for that peroid. It's not really suprising to me that a fairly large group of shitheads were able to congregate and get some shit upvoted to the front page. I'm not calling it right, but all the same it doesn't surprise me. But other than that they were drowned out by legitimate protests."

Well it's hard to know where to draw the line on some of the popular protest memes going around. I mean, was Chariman Pao referring to her ethnicity, or were people using it as a comparison between the dictator Chairman Mao, and thought the name was good? Same with people who used /r/paoyongyang as a protest sub, are they mocking her on her ethnicity or comparing her policies to North Korea and taking advantage of the /r/pyongyang joke?   The truth is, the answer was different for each person that used them, but with each usage it might not be clear which was racist, and which was protest.  As a side note, while I don't miss FPH, I'm not sure some of the other subs like neofag (kinda like TiA but for NeoGaf) deserved their fate."

And then the bandwagon started, and there was no stopping it.  At the same time, she was hired while the company was in trouble, and given little to no support or backup.  And that's a set up for failure.  I'm not sure I buy yishan's Machiavellian Plotting theory which would involve intentionally undercutting her.  Never blame on malice what can be easily explained by stupidity.  And if no one there had a figuring that putting an asian feminist in the middle of a sexual harassment lawsuit in charge of reddit is akin to throwing a steak to a pack of hungry dogs, they are, in fact, stupid.

I always just went for the ""children can't consent"" angle, but this is another great argument against it.     God fucking DAMN do I love being compared to pedophiles.  Here's a simple thought process: sexuality is on the basis of sex. If you are attracted to the opposite sex, it is different (hetero) than your sex. Heterosexuality. If you are attracted to the same same, it is the same (homo) as your sex. Homosexuality. Homosexual and heterosexual attraction have longevity. They can last entire lives. Pedophiles' attractions toward an individual lasts at most 18 years. This is not love. This is not worthy of respect. This is not tragic. It's fucked up and these people need to be trained to not rape kids, because everyone else has been doing a pretty damn good job of not doing that."

Negareddit,3dciuo,Renaiconna,6,Wed Jul 15 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"You had me until:   it is totally normal to be sexually attracted to 10-year-olds.   No, it isn't and can't be, considering that ten-year-olds are rarely even pubescent, let alone post-pubescent.   But pedophiles can and do have attractions to adults of their gender of desire as well, in addition to even having particular preferences for certain narrow age ranges of minors. But while one can't and probably shouldn't paint all pedophiles with such a broad brush, they still suffer from abnormal and harmful urges that can cause exceptional harm to children."
Negareddit,3dciuo,pedoseverywhere,-2,Wed Jul 15 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a pedophile, and I am against pedophilia. I don't want to become a normal ""sexual orientation"". It's not and it never will be.  I know children can't consent, but since I haven't hurt any children and I never will, their consent doesn't really come into it. All I want is better mental health support for pedophiles so we can get help before we might turn into monsters. It happens and I want it to stop.  By the way, your quote is wrong because I am a non-exclusive pedophile which means I am attracted to both children and adult women. So it doesn't work to say the attraction only last 18 years. I'm not into babies or toddlers either, so the 18 year thing is even more inaccurate.  I also don't think I could ever fall in love with a child. Ie, have romantic feelings. What I feel towards beautiful children is lust. Sexual attraction. It's not love, even though I do simultaneously love children the same way I would if I wasn't a pedophile.  I also personally don't need to be ""trained"" to do anything. I'm nearly 30 and I've not abused children yet despite having MANY MANY opportunities to do so. I am just not the kind of person who would do that. It'd hurt ME as well as the child! I'd kill myself before ever doing something like that. I have a beautiful little neice, she's cute, funny, smart. I love her and want to protect her, and if she ever takes her clothes off around me (like kids do), I don't look at her. I don't want to think of my niece like that."
Negareddit,3dciuo,blo0p,4,Wed Jul 15 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"For the record: Bragging about how many opportunities you had to rape someone but didn't, isn't really something to be proud of.   That said, I don't think reddit's new rules ( if and when implemented ) are going to be targeting support groups, they're going to be targeting the subreddits that actively condone the bad behavior. (The behavior that you were bragging about not committing)  I don't think I need to mention that even if you're not hurting a child when you're looking at a picture, that child wasn't consenting (And has no real understanding) of what was going on at the time.  Yes people need to view this as something that wasn't chosen, and stop looking at it with shame but compassion to help stop the issues but that doesn't mean we need to tolerate the bad behavior. The psychopath who goes on a mass murdering rampage didn't choose to be born that way but that doesn't mean he didn't murder people, or that his actions are excusable."
Negareddit,3dciuo,pedoseverywhere,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not bragging, I am not proud of doing what 99% of the rest of the world does successfully. My only point is that all pedophiles do not automatically rape given the opportunity. Many of us have self control and sense of morality that prevents us from abusing kids. I wasn't ""bragging"" and I am sorry you interpreted it as such.  I don't think we should tolerate bad behavior. We should tolerate pedophiles, but not tolerate them acting on their desires. If we don't tolerate pedophiles, they don't get the help they need and they do monstrous things.   It's just like we should tolerate schizophrenic or psychopathic people because we know they can manage their condition and that we can't go locking people away ""just in case"".  I personally do think a serial killer psychopath is morally excused, but unfortunately for him we need to keep others safe, so we lock him up. The world isn't a fair place and as soon as you go brutally trampling on the rights of others, you give up the right to liberty. It's an unfortunate reality of a bipolar universe. However, that doesn't mean we should be cruel and hateful towards ALL pedophiles regardless of whether they are criminals or not."
Negareddit,3dciuo,HeyKidsFreeCandy,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:34:27 2015 UTC,Username checks out. What type of resources in the community are lacking that you believe would help people of paedophilic inclinations to overcome or cope better with their affliction?
Negareddit,3dciuo,pedoseverywhere,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:59:49 2015 UTC,"It's more the stigma and moral panic surrounding us that prevents us from going to see the psychologists who CAN help us avoid deviant behavior. (No therapy these days tries to cure pedophilia, only manage it)  However in most countries a doctor/therapist may break patient confidentiality if they even suspect a child may be in danger. This can very quickly turn your life completely upside down, you lose your job, wife, children, friends, family, liberty, everything. You'd just have to hope that someone will still love you when you're locked away with other depressed crazy people, possibly forever.  Given the hysteria surrounding pedophilia, I just don't trust that my therapist is going to be impartial and professional. The stigma needs to die down. It already has. I posted a comment on /r/worldnews the other day which got >2000 upvotes. The result was a roughly even mix between disgust and support. On either extreme was people congratulating me and telling me I am brave blah blah, the rest telling me I am a monster no matter what I think, that I deserve to die, that I should kill myself, blah blah.  But the fact that so many people are support of some basic rights for pedophiles (the right to receive help for mental illness) is amazing and a huge step forward. The fewer dangerous pedophiles, the fewer cases of child abuse. I give about 10% of a fuck about us downtrodden pedos and 90% of a fuck that there's pedos out there doing disgusting abhorrent things to little children. Some of us are fucked up beyond belief. A CP hurtcore forum on the dark net is called ""scream, bitch!"". What does that tell you about how completely utterly fucked some of us are. I've never been there, I'd probably go jump in front of a bus. I'm not surprised these sick individuals exist though considering that as soon as you are aware you're a pedophile, you begin assimilating the idea into your personality that you're a disgusting monster. It's not deliberate, it just happens because your rock bottom self esteem robs you of rational thought or any ability to see good in yourself."
Negareddit,3dciuo,HeyKidsFreeCandy,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:21:02 2015 UTC,"Man, its gotta be a heavy cross to bear knowing that the world is against you on a psychologically fundamental level. I appreciate your self awareness in ensuring you act within the safety of others, especially children, given your condition. Have you ever looked into the science of what may be the root cause of your perceptions? Are you aware of any treatments which may hold promise soon or in the future? I hope society in the future starts to open more doors for people like you and others with similar psychological conditions, no one should ever be afraid to get help improving their health. I think so much of it has to do with the (very valid) fear people have for ensuring the preservation of their children and their innocence. While I believe sexual assault is a very real danger children face, I think it can and has been effectively treated through educating kids. I wish people put nearly as much effort in teaching their kids to think deeply and critically as they do in trying to safeguard them against every possible scary monster they may encounter, but that is neither here nor there."
Negareddit,3dciuo,pedoseverywhere,0,Wed Jul 15 22:47:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) I truly think there's a genetic factor at play because I had a happy, amazing childhood despite religious indoctrination. I was never abused.  However my brother is also a pedophile, my other brother is a ephebophile, and my younger sister (bisexual) had some pretty borderline shit in her recycle bin once. I haven't asked her about it though. Another close family member had a mid life crisis and had sex with a 14 year old boy (she was in her 40s). There's something going on.  If this is the case, I think any type of medication will be a blunt instrument and come with a lot of side effects. Essentially I believe medication and therapy can only treat the symptoms.  I do think our best hope lies in identification of the factors causing pedophilia (perhaps prenatal exposure to chemicals / hormones etc) and possible identification of gene(s) which can reliably predict pedophilia. In which case genetic modification of the embryo / blastocyst might be our best chance. Maybe nanobots of some type might be able to physically rewire our brains. Possibly even some kind of neural graft where the pedophilia-causing circuitry is bypassed with some kind of emulator which simulates a normal sexuality. Maybe one day we can just 3D print the right part, rip out the defunctive bits and replace it with functional biological material.  I don't think anyone alive today can really understand how completely crazy the future is going to be, provided we don't run ourselves into the ground as a species or fail to invent AI. What I suggested might seem far-out, but I don't think any of it is outside the realms of possibility.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11558305/China-shocks-world-by-genetically-engineering-human-embryos.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface#Invasive_BCIs"
Negareddit,3dciuo,HeyKidsFreeCandy,0,Wed Jul 15 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's absolutely too much to just be coincidences, I never considered the genealogy of certain criminal inclinations before. Makes one wonder how much of the other types considered 'bad eggs' in society can really be held accountable for their actions without having any formal training on coping with their own genetic influences (IE, psychopaths, rapists, etc.)  Not to step on your toes or those of your parents, I REALLY don't mean any offense by this, but do you think its possible that religious indoctrination can have a behavioral influence on child-directed sexual behaviors? I don't mean to crucify Christians. But I can't help but wonder what possible implications may come from teaching a developing human to worship 'purity, servility, and subjugation'... Certainly there's a lot of horrible handling of children by those viewed as 'most holy' like preachers and pastors...   I'm sure thar this is a misguided suggestion, though, as most Christians I know are wonderful people. Still, being trained to turn your impulses inward and fetishizing one's innocence does seem like it could have an effect on one's emotional-sexual expression.  I'm right there with ya, man. It seems like its so hard to have a conversation with another person about how fucking nuts the future is going to be, its like they don't believe it or just don't care. Like, I try to tell people that there's a good chance that MOST people won't have to work before the end of their lifetime and they're just like ""yeah... Lol"". Like, I get that it can be fun to just watch the changes happen, but I can't imagine not taking an active interest in speculating what they may be. I have no doubt that in the next few decades we'll have some sort of technology, even if experimental, in place that will allow us to effectively reprogram certain human behaviors. I just wish there was a way to convince people that it really WILL be a whole new world with new ideas and new problems that we could never dream of today. It's exciting and horrifying. Genetics is absolutely the holy grail we're heading towards, where a simple injection could have unfathomable repercussions in intelligence, longevity, communication and physical capabilities. It's going to take a lot of dark turns and unfortunate lessons along the way, and in the process we will, as a society, begin transcending our humanity. Maybe it's all just wishful thinking.

But a decision that everyone makes without thinking, anyway?   I think you can make every kind of person happy, I don't think that's limited to people who can decide if they want to be happy with something.  One post lately blew my fucking mind on this topic.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3d49py/what_happened_to_you_when_you_were_young_that_you/ct1sfqb  You retroactively decide if you were molested or not. It's not something you felt like it was that way before. The society decides that and now you have to be traumatized. You have to! If not... We will make you traumatized!  We are not making up our own minds. Our culture has decided that children can't participate in such things (yet they do it themselves on their own accord with other children oftentimes). This is why it is not falsifiable, it has turned into a religion. Thinking that it might be different is morally wrong and thus impossible.  Also, some sarcasm: No pedophiles would EVER NOT want to hurt a child. They are all the same!  - Because we decide so.  I used a throwaway not because I fear having this opinion, but because I fear people going on a crusade for it."

But for me it's something else entirely : you are not traumatized because the society tells you to, but because you suddenly understand something you didn't get as a child : that this dude was manipulating you.  And that's the big difference between pedophilia and homosexuality : children are naïve. They can think anything is right if an adult tells them so. And they can think something is right for all the wrong reasons too : in the case of the comment you linked, because she thought she was acting like an adult now.  And about your sarcasm : I don't consider that pedophiles want to hurt children. I'm pretty sure a pedophile is sincere when saying (s)he is in love with a kid, and you don't want to hurt someone you love."
Negareddit,3dciuo,Tubim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"that this dude was manipulating you.   My problem is... How do you know he was trying to manipulate at all? Is this a given prerequisite that a pedophile HAS to manipulate, always? I think that there are cases where manipulation is there, but this is not a problem that's limited to pedophilia. People get manipulated, peer-pressured, everywhere. Except that some kinds of pressure don't work on children (yet), social pressures, etc (what? You haven't had sex yet and you're 21? For example.) I think most just feel the need for love like everyone else (albeit to different people  There were also cases of the child starting things like this because they sometimes go into a very experimental phase where they try to manipulate people as much as they can to get more goodies (you know, where they get you to buy them that new game boy as a parent)... So I think manipulation can be in the other direction too. And many people, doesn't matter what age, are just as manipulatable imho.   I guess you can argue that we should protect our children especially from manipulation because they'll be manipulated enough later... But as I tried to say, I am unsure if really everything done to or with a child has to imply manipulation. If that was not what you were trying to say, I apologize and ask you to reiterate what you were exactly trying to say. My native language is not English.  Also, thank you for actually answering to my thoughts instead of just trying to diss me on them. I think it's really important to listen to all kinds of arguments."

Is this a given prerequisite that a pedophile HAS to manipulate, always   It's quite difficult to express, but I think there's always manipulation when we're talking about pedophilia.  It's not that pedophiles are being manipulative on purpose though, it's just that trying to establish a romantic/sexual relationship with a human being that have absolutely zero idea how these things work can only happen via manipulation.  Besides, it's obvious that we all are manipulative and manipulated during our whole life, but you know what? Manipulating someone else into a relationship, even an adult, is always arguably wrong. So when talking about children who don't know shit about life, love, sex, and are way more naive than adults, I think it's pretty easy to conclude that pedophilia should be prevented.  But I don't feel like most people that pedophiles should be castrated/locked down for life/sentenced to death. It's kind of like a curse to me : they just have to deal with it, and I can understand that it might be fucking difficult."

Negareddit,3dciuo,_Woodrow_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"The only similarity is they are both a description of sexuality.   That's kind of a big part of it, and basically the entirety of the argument. When we use terms like ""spectrum"", we're attempting to describe the range of something. If we're looking at sexual attraction as a spectrum, we have to include everything on it. Heterosexuality too. And when we have examined sexual attraction in the past, the two conclusions that seem to come up the most are that it's not something we learn but usually how we're wired, and it's basically impossible to change. I think this is why people draw comparisons between pedophilia and homosexuality, because society has mostly accepted that being gay can't be ""fixed"" despite plenty of people trying. I can also understand why somebody could be insulted by this comparison, which is why it's one I would never make myself. But admitting that all sexual attractions are similarly concrete doesn't mean we have to accept a particular attraction as appropriate. Absolutely not. It means that we have to consider that the current methods we use to deal with these paraphilias is incorrect. Punish offensive and abusive behavior, absolutely. But what do we do after the punishment has been dealt? Something has to be done, because it's an inappropriate sexual attraction, and we know that it's not going away. But why do we arrogantly believe that it's possible to treat one kind of attraction out of somebody but not others? And why do we further say that a definite amount of time of treatment for offenders is okay when evidence suggests that they will harbor these attractions indefinitely?  Please don't misinterpret what I'm saying here as support or advocacy for pedophile acceptance in any way. I think it's disgusting. But really these comparisons can help us realize what it is we're doing wrong with treatment."

You can't kill it with therapy, medicine, or hormones. Therapy can however manage harmful behaviors and medicine can help lower libido.  I've been trying to stop being a pedophile since I was age 16.

Negareddit,3dciuo,mr_one_liner,0,Wed Jul 15 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree!  I think Pedophilia is a desire to inflict pain on children, more than a sexual attraction to children.  There's no way a child could find being on the receiving end of any sexual encounter with an adult anything other than painful/traumatic, yet pedophiles still want to inflict this.  It's more akin to somebody who wants to physically attack people who can't defend themselves. The sexual aspect is secondary to that.  It's good if Pedophiles can be trained not to do this, but it always makes me uneasy when this pops up on Reddit (which happens a lot) and everybody rushes to equate homosexuality and pedophilia.  A much better comparison would be to equate it with arsonists/pyromaniacs/rapists/physical violence etc.  Not to mention the obvious, sex is only a part of what makes two people attracted to each other. There are so many other aspect (personality, interests, life plans, etc) that make up a heterosexual or homosexual relationship.  With pedophilia all of that is absent!"
Negareddit,3dciuo,flatcurve,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"You make a good point. I think of pedophilia as psychopathic, a seeking of pleasure without any regard to another's feelings.

Negareddit,3dciuo,FlyingBishop,2,Wed Jul 15 22:07:52 2015 UTC,"I think Pedophilia is a desire to inflict pain on children, more than a sexual attraction to children.   You're still describing a sexual attraction here, you've just changed the object of that attraction. If they're not specifically attracted to the kids, they're still attracted to the concept of hurting somebody and getting sexual gratification from it.  I think sexual desire itself is worth separating from the idea of relationships when we're trying to describe attraction. Sure, two consenting adults can have a relationship with each other, or they can just have mechanical sex with no emotional attachment. But there's still something there driving that urge for sex and an attraction that provides the arousal that makes it possible for them to have sex... which is why I think the relationship aspect needs to be kept separate.  The fact is, pedophiles are aroused by children. Heterosexuals are aroused by the opposite gender. Homosexuals are aroused by the same gender. Zoophiles are aroused by animals. Plenty of other paraphilias deal with arousal from inanimate objects, sounds, ideas, situations, etc... And it's this spectrum of what arouses an individual that we're talking about here. We're all on it. Yes, it's an insult to homosexuals when that comparison is made, because frankly the comparison can be made to anybody. But we can't just say that pedophilia is different because we don't like it. When we do that, we're not being honest about what it is, and that doesn't give us the proper line of reasoning needed to adequately treat it. I know I sound like the typical peddit apologist here, but that's far from the case. Heck, if it were up to me I'd just cut all their balls off. I just don't want to be intellectually dishonest about the nature of sexual attraction."
Negareddit,3dciuo,flatcurve,6,Wed Jul 15 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think calling pedophilia an orientation is being intellectually dishonest about the nature of sexual attraction. Most people are sexually attracted to people who are legally children.   I think most pedophiles have totally normal sexual orientations just like other rapists. They simply choose to satisfy their sexual desires by acting them out on children since children have limited agency and are less able to retaliate.  We get too caught  up in what is a ""choice."" Everything is a choice. Homosexuality is a moral choice not because of innate orientation but because it's consensual."
Negareddit,3dciuo,JollyBard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"Well, from studies based on phallometric testing, your last statement is partially correct. Only 60% of men convicted of sexually abusing children were actually physically aroused by children. But this statistic itself belies the incomplete knowledge we have about pedophiles. To date, the research that has been done has been primarily of people convicted of a crime.  Dr. James Cantor has found pedophiles share some physiological characteristics in greater numbers than average (even when compared to sex offenders who did not target children), which would suggest a prenatal origin since these things are determined before birth. Again, this is information only based on studies of convicted sex offenders, so it doesn't paint a complete picture.  As for your first statement, I myself am hesitant to use the term orientation at all, because it's not actually a clinically defined term and is rather ambiguously used. But the bottom line for me is that for most pedophiles, this is about sexual attraction. Furthermore, it's an extremely reprehensible sexual attraction. Why would somebody choose to be that way? And if it's not physiological, then some sort of traumatic event must precipitate these desires. But we also know that previous childhood trauma does not necessarily translate into a predilection for developing pedophilia. There are plenty of convicted pedophiles who had normal childhoods.  So that's why we have to ask these questions. That's why we have to draw comparisons to things about sexual attraction that we do know. That's why we have to look at the full gamut."
Negareddit,3dciuo,pedoseverywhere,-3,Wed Jul 15 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you're talking about. Do your research. It is common for pedophiles to try to ensure the pleasure and consent of their victims. Of course it doesn't work and there are life-long repercussions, but it is true that pedophiles do not do this to children from hate or a thirst for violence. Most pedophiles never act on their desires, and they don't search therapy by fear of social stigma and legal repercussions.  EDIT: Why am I being downvoted? I'm not defending pedophilia. It's simply not about violence, this is an uneducated opinion that shouldn't be spread."
Negareddit,3dciuo,xavierdc,-6,Wed Jul 15 22:53:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a pedophile. I'll give you my anecdotal experience. I won't lie to you, I'm anonymous and I have no reason to lie.  First of all I am a feminist and a humanist and I have an extremely deep sense of empathy for all living things. I am the kind of person who rescues bugs from the swimming pool and puts spiders outside. When I was a child one of my favorite things to do was steal honey, put it in a plate and leave it outside. I'd come back and feel joyful about all the hungry bees getting nice and full. I used to be worried/scared to start petting my cat, because he'd start purring and I'd feel too bad about stopping, so I'd be stuck there petting him for longer than I wanted. I gave $20 to a poor man because he told me he needed milk powder for his baby. I knew he needed it for marijuana, so I gave it to him anyway. I like to think that despite his shitty life, I did something that will provide him with some happy escape, even for a short while.  When I think about all the pain and suffering that happens every day in the world, my heart shrinks up into a little ball of horror and sadness. Sometimes I imagine if I gathered up every person who is suffering in the world today, and put them in one big room. What would that picture look like? It'd be hideous beyond the wildest imaginings of the worst psychopath, yet this is what is really happening out in the world, everyday, right now.  I care a LOT about this and I think about it daily. I can't stop it from popping into my mind constantly. I'm a sensitive and caring person. I want to do everything and anything I can to stop any pain and suffering.  Children are beautiful, innocent, trusting little souls. They deserve to be nurtured, cared for, and protected above everything. When I have my own children I will do all these things.  I will NOT add to the pain and suffering in the world and become a monster. I will not destroy the future of a innocent little girl just to sate my own messed up sexuality. That is so, so far beyond the pale of what my moral code would allow. Being a moral person is not only my self respect and my dignity, but it's my life. I could not live with myself if I hurt a child.  I've done bad things in my life, like looking up pictures of naked children. I did this when I was young, horny, and dumb. I first found those pictures when I was about 15. I wish I had never seen them. It was a mistake. It was wrong. Thankfully I was never dumb enough to pay for these pictures or share them with others.  Anyway, that's all. I hope you will change your mind about us, because I know for absolutely 100% sure that pedophilia is not about any desires to hurt children. I promise you that from the bottom of my heart. I know I am probably the lowest most disgusting type of person you can think of, but I hope you will see past your disgust and see a human being that is afflicted by a horrible mental illness that I HATE and wish I could be free from.  If it helps, I don't think pedophilia and homosexuality are ""equal"". Both are sexualities, but only one is a consensual, fair, and non-damaging. Only one is a mental illness. I have no doubts that I am mentally ill, but I also know my sense of empathy would never allow me to touch children inappropriately."

Negareddit,3dbl0w,tachibanakanade,-4,Wed Jul 15 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. Because most of the ""criticism"" of Ellen Pao was (...)   very well placed.

I've never even been to fatshaming or most of those subs, I just can't stand the unfair treatment, because i don't agree with it and I believe it establishes a dangerous precedent. Besides, what you call safe space we call thought impervious bubbles and we don't like it.    Also, sexist.

Now that Ellen Pao is gone, the Chimpire and a whole bunch of shit is gonna be gone (which is great).     but in my book that is a ""capital crime"".   Of course you think that. Because you support the fucked up shit that FPH was doing.     Besides, what you call safe space we call thought impervious bubbles and we don't like it.     Because that means you don't get free reign to treat people like shit for being fat, or for being women, or for being of color. Anything that takes away your right to treat people like shit is a capital crime. So a CEO, a company, asserting its right to enforce its rules is a bad thing if they don't share that view.     By that logic, we should dismiss all criticism of Sarah Palin as ""sexist bullshit"". After all, not an hour goes by without people calling her gendered slurs and threatening violence towards her.   Anybody that uses gendered slurs or threatens violence towards people is human garbage. It's nice that you're not addressing that the criticism was based on information that none of you had, that is now available because of Yishan, so I'm not going to address the ""all criticism"" bit because now it can be safely dismissed because all of you were wrong.     But I digress. You people have made up your minds. You locked and targeted PAO as savior and feminism and all those who oppose her as evil misogynists. Everything Pao says and does is gospell.

I do find Reddit drama to be a fascinating source of entertainment, but I don't so much ""care"".    I'm not a mod, so I don't care about the state of mod tools.  In fact, half the mods on this site seem like power-tripping assholes in their own right.  The sort of people who made everyone stop contributing edits to Wikipedia ten years ago.    Moreover, the majority of AMA's are basically for talking about Rampart.  I occasionally read them when it's a guest who particularly interests me, and I ignore the other 99%, which is probably typical.  I don't think most people genuinely ever thought one way or the other about Valerie (whatever), before she got fired and a flash-mob circlejerk broke out.  I'm already forgetting now that it's run its course.  All of that being said, I was disgusted by the treatment of Ellen Pao... but I think that it's a bit complex, and doesn't neatly fit within the bounds of the simple circlejerk narrative, or the reverse-circlejerk narrative that happens on this sub.  There is no one single ""hivemind"" here.  There were a number of different groups in the mix:   [0.5%] Mods, who were reaching the boiling point over very legitimate (I guess) complaints that go back years. [4.5%] Non-mod, active and engaged Redditors, who posted and commented about the happenings.  This group can be broken down further:   [2%] Libertarians and ACLU-style liberals, who raised principled objections to banning subreddits such as FatPeopleHate. [1%] SJW-style liberals, bemoaning the hypocrisy of NOT banning other objectionable subreddits. [0.5%] Racists, sexists,  angry teenagers, and trolls... just excited about having the excuse to post ""cunt"" on /r/all, and to dish about the sketchy business dealings of the Asian chick and/or her black husband. [1%] The most extreme and shrill of SJW's... who argue that everyone on the planet NOT in group 2(4) is effectively in group 2(3).  [5%] Casual circlejerkers, just posting Nazi memes, fat people references, or ""popcorn"" jokes to be funny. [90%] The rest of Reddit, continuing on with our cat pictures... either uncaring, or altogether unaware of this drama.   So here's what I believe.  Group 2(3) is definitely a thing.  They're a disgrace, and I think it is dangerous to try to pretend that they aren't a thing.  They SHOULD be called out, every time they pop up.  Their treatment of Ellen Pao was ridiculous... and notwithstanding the principled objections of Group 2(1), I DO see a clear distinction between banning behavior vs. ideas, and am cool with people like that getting the boot.  However, I am SICK AND TIRED of clickbait media coverage... which tries to give the impression that Group 2(3) is broadly representative of Reddit, rather than the minuscule slice it actually is.  Moreover, Group 2(4) can just straight-up go fuck themselves.  If I could wave a magic wand and ban Group 2(3) and Group 2(4) from Reddit simultaneously, I would do so in a heartbeat."

Half of them are trolling, and the other truly ideological half are all too aware that ""the establishment"" or ""the mainstream media"" rejects them.    2(4) are assholes who are convinced they're saints.  Anyone who does not eat, sleep, breathe, and scream SJ at the top of their lungs 24/7 is ""problematic"".  Their ""with-us-or-against-us"", ""moderates-are-as-bad-or-worse-than-bigots"" schtick is just a bit too cult-like for me.

From all accounts, she was great at her job, put in significant time and effort, and beloved by her coworkers. I wasn't extremely vocal about it, because I GUESS there could be some scandal that can't be legally discussed openly. I just don't see that as likely.  In addition, AMAs are a truly unique type of content and they can be amazing. The PR filter is removed (for the most part), and the character of the interviewee is much more evident.

If you're gonna say it's based on what ""would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation"", then that encompasses a lot more than a closed list of slurs (and I imagine defenders of the policy want it to cover more things).

So why then do people come on here whining and complaining about ""Oh no le muslims blew up another town. Religion amirite?"" It's just cheap karma whoring, and almost never has a place outside of serious discussion, which in turn almost never happens on a strongly populated board.   If you want to legitimately discuss a certain facet of a certain religion, there are subreddits for that, but whenever I've browsing /r/me_irl or some shit and there's some irrelevant religious discussion, it comes across as desperate to lash out and, y'know, edgy.

Usually in the form of jokes. I also think it's very odd that there's this whole debate about free speech and the fatpeoplehate dickheads while anything to do with criticism of religion is met with hostility. Are we valuing hate speech over that? This concept seems to happen often. Where to combat the extreme loudmouths of a certain group, you are hostile to anyone who is a part of it. That isn't the way to go about it. Similar to the way I shouldn't make fun of Christians because of fundamentalist bigots.

Negareddit,3daik1,luladin,19,Wed Jul 15 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"Because most atheists on Reddit are of the abrasive STEMlord variety who worship Dawkins and Hitchens and not necessarily concerned about intellectual skepticism. The hard truth is that when I think of Reddit atheists, it's really hard to not think of assholes like Amazing Atheist without the Youtube channel considering the background of the rest of the site.  Keep in mind: ""atheist"" actually means very little. It is simply the lack of a belief in a supernatural deity and nothing more, nothing less. Atheism does not automatically entail criticism of organized religion (beyond the essence of theism) or subscription to progressive beliefs. What to take away from this is that redditor neckbeards are usually being called out for being redditor neckbeards, not for nonbelief.   I know that distinction is quite pedantic, but I'm speaking from experience with too many closeminded racist, homophobic, sexist, etc. atheists. If you want an example of how atheism does not necessarily entail criticism of religion or progressivism, I would check out Amazing Atheist or take a poll of how /r/atheism denizens feel about feminism. Surely it would be received warmly because most organized religion sects, inspired by the misogynist Bible, reinforce a patriarchal status quo and the atheist ""should"" be against harmful applications of religion. But I would bet you that it is actually received in quite the hostile manner much like the rest of Reddit, upholding the same status quo that Bible-thumpers promote.   Disclaimer: I'm an atheist but weary of internet atheists. I do understand your concerns with being associated as one of these clowns but I also think Reddit (perhaps the internet in general) is not the best place for serious discussions on a matter of such gravity."
Negareddit,3daik1,mrcytizen,10,Tue Jul 14 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"I like how you explained it.  Prior to getting into /r/atheism, many years ago, I was very much a ""militant"" atheist in the way that I would actively and aggressively engage people who voiced religious belief of any kind.  Joining /r/atheism was an eye opener to me. After just a few weeks of following the thread feed on that sub, it felt like someone held a mirror up in front of me. Fugly.  I stay away from internet atheists these days. It has actually gotten so far that even when afk, I keep my atheism to myself. People can happily continue religioning all they want around me.

I don't think organised religion is a force for good and wish it would go away but just hounding and riling people about it is gunna get you nowhere.  My main issue with the whole thing is that the universe is full of so many wonderful possibilities and we have so much information and everyone can wonder what happened, what will happen etc. Then about 33% (pulling numbers out of backside here) of the world align with some branch of Islam and 33%  align with Christianity, both complicated religions where you have to go through their holy books with a red marker and go ""Oh this is out dated, we ignore this now, add another psalm here""....... it just really suggests to me that people aligned with these large religions haven't actually thought about it and that's what I have an issue with.

Negareddit,3daik1,JonWood007,2,Tue Jul 14 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely think that while some people go way too far, often times the neckbeard /r/atheism stereotype is used to silence critique. Which is, fyi, the big reason the loud and obnoxious atheists exist. You tell them not to draw muhammad, they'll draw muhammad taking a crap while screwing a goat just to piss you off. It's actually a  reaction against attempted censorship.  Like...the idea is this. Religion is to be respected. But when you demand an idea only be handled with respect, you actually are limiting the spectrum to debate. You are setting out the debate terms before the debate can even be had.   In my own deconversion, I found the bluntness of /ratheism, often scorned by the rest of the reddit community, to be actually persuasive. Mainly because it was a ""hmm, I never thought of it that way before"" sort of thing. You have an idea, you are so desensitized to the absurdities of the idea that you fail to see anything weird about it, and then a big mean atheist comes along and points out the absurdities of said idea. Some religious people think the atheist is just being mean, but for others, it's like...hmm, never thought of it before that way.   As such, I find the obnoxiousness of atheism to be kind of a double edged thing. It is kind of...jerky at times, but at the same time, it actually is a very good argumentative style if you're willing to look past the offensiveness and look at what they're actually trying to say. The whole ""you're not wrong, you just an ***hole"" phrase is kind of relevant here. But the thing is, a lot of the time, they actually aren't wrong.  Sometimes they are, then they make themselves look like the idiots. For example, I'm friends with a christian who often debates atheists, and he destroys them in debates even though I don't even agree with him because the atheists rely on the same old circlejerks.  I guess what I'm trying to say is often times, the offensiveness of r/atheism's stereotype actually raises legit points, and actually was a reason I deconverted from christianity. I simply never thought of it from their perspective before, and found it superior to my own ideas. On the other hand, some atheists really are just jerks. It's a double edged sword. A reductio ad absurdum when used correctly, but a strawman when it's not."

It just makes you look like an arsehole and doesn't add to a conversation between two people about Holy Communion.

I think this also explains IQ-fetish on reddit. If you had to actually write something or struggle through a difficult intellectual program, the end result is a ton of humility. However, it's easy to mention that you've got a 180 IQ and hate ""fundies"" and that ""school didn't appreciate how smart you were."""
Negareddit,3dakvn,Ahabs_Pegleg,0,Wed Jul 15 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"STEM guy here. I can say from experience, for the most part, you are absolutely right. May I however offer a counter-point? I am mainly a math and physics guys, but what I am about to say I think also extends, at least, into the engineering field.  Math is not the same kind of subject as, say, sociology, as you well know. But the reason why I think eludes a lot of people. Math is codified thinking; you are eliminated ambiguities and looking at only the 'form' of thoughts to discern what the 'form', devoid of meaning, can say about the 'form' of subsequent thoughts in the same thought process. Math isn't just about numbers, which is a common misconception to non-mathematicians; it is about thinking. By providing a symbolic foundation, math allows your mind to enter into new areas that would not have been accessible without mathematical symbols. In this very real sense, math does make your thoughts smarter; many practitioners, however, mistake that for their own intelligence, beguiled by the fact that 'they thought it'.   The same, in a sense, applies to all of the other STEM fields. They are teaching 'how' to think. Whereas in a lot of humanities, they are telling you 'what' to think, i.e. dates and narratives and facts. I am not saying the 'how' is absent from the humanities, only that it takes a back seat. When a lot of STEM people graduate, they end up thinking, ""well, heck, since my skill is thinking, I could apply it to ANYTHING."" As a result, a lot of STEM people, even if they do not say it outright, think they know more about a subject like sociology than a person who has been studying it their entire life because their degree gives them a more qualified 'thinking' machine."
Negareddit,3dakvn,chinchalinchin,13,Wed Jul 15 11:05:12 2015 UTC,"In my experience with the humanities you're very much taught 'how to think' rather than 'what to think', that's pretty much the entire point of a liberal arts education."
Negareddit,3dakvn,sadtimedadtime,8,Wed Jul 15 11:12:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty much sums up what I was going to say.   I've got a lot of close friends who do humanities, especially history. A hell of a lot of their work relies on looking at situations from different angles.   I can't believe someone suggested that 'how to think' takes a backseat in humanities (and this is coming from a STEM student)."
Negareddit,3dakvn,Needs_more_dinosaurs,2,Wed Jul 15 12:15:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say they are different ways of teaching you how to process information, and therefore think. STEM teaches a very logical process that does not necessarily have many ambiguities. Humanities teaches a more ambiguous form of thinking, in which you must consider shades of grey, partial correctness, and personal influence on whether an answer makes sense.  Everything teaches us how to think. It just teaches us how to think in different ways.  That's why a combined curriculum is important in K-12."

Negareddit,3dakvn,_Woodrow_,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:42:32 2015 UTC,"I really don't think I am. I think you are mistakenly focusing on one thing I said by chopping off what came after. I am not saying the humanities do not teach you 'how' to think; I am saying there is more of an emphasis on 'what' than in STEM fields. There is a difference between studying the theory behind statistics and studying statistics by virtue of studying the economics of a society, say. In former, you are more easily led into the illusion, by knowing it, you could apply that knowledge to anything, whereas in the latter, it is more of a means to an end.  I am not trying to denigrate non-STEM fields, just point out their differences.   I knew I was risking being misunderstood by posting my comment, but I am pleased to see this has not at least led to the typical reddit meltdown and insult hurling. You guys live up to stated goals in this sub. Good on you."
Negareddit,3dakvn,chinchalinchin,3,Wed Jul 15 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"I am saying there is more of an emphasis on 'what' than in STEM fields.   That's the part you need to explain better.   It feels like you are comparing senior level chemistry with freshman history. All college classes are focused on the ""what"" at the introductory level and then, as you learn the context with which to frame your thought moves on to the how's and why's and teaches you how to think critically and analyze things. These skills can then be applied elsewhere.   Even with your example - I can't imagine a major in economics not having an extensive course study of statistics as well."
Negareddit,3dakvn,_Woodrow_,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"I know you got blasted in some comments here, but I actually largely agree with you. I'm a mathematical sociologist -- a ""pseudo""-STEM person (interdisciplinary undergrad) that now does a mixture of formal modeling and statistics. I agree that mathematics can be a way of formalizing and clarifying thinking, but the danger of course is that one has to recognize that it is an abstraction from a manifold and messy empirical reality.  The STEM guys who want to ""apply themselves to anything"" I feel don't always keep that in mind.  The guys I hang out with recognize the limitations of what they do. Even if you talk to physicists, they are also very cognizant of the limitations of what they know.  So yes, math and formal thinking can be helpful, but it can also distort just as much as it can illuminate. And a healthy humility and respect for other intellectual fields is a necessary condition to get there."

Negareddit,3d7smk,butthurtstalker,-15,Tue Jul 14 13:40:36 2015 UTC,Those are years old. And I could find TWO examples of the opposite if the only evidence is a couple year old comments.

The admins to give out a State of the Union address making sure to make note of how much SRS is brigading and what they're doing to keep them in check?  Do you ask the same for any other subreddit you frequent?"

The flood of our time is the predicted African population boom - forget what you know about immigration today; the next century (should nothing cataclysmic transpire) will see massive population growth in Nigeria et al. Now, consider the dwindling white population of Europe, consider the rather cushy societies that exist there comparatively with, say, necklacing-central Africana. The swarm is inevitable, the change of political power of Europe is inevitable.  Now consider Detroit. Or South Africa. Or Zimbabwe. See what happened there? Now, picture a Zimbabwe with nukes. Sometimes I wonder if South African born Elon Musk has seen this future and is racing to build his Mars-bound ark ASAP for these reasons.  Sorry OP for the despondent tone.

The other places are shitholes but they don't throw their shit in the fan and spread it to others which SRS frequently did/does.  EDIT:  Lovely downvotes for actually trying to answer the question from an outsider perspective without providing a comment/providing an argument as for why I ""deserve"" to be downvoted. This is how you get a reputation for being a hugbox."

They've not doxxed anyone (and the example people like to use is violentacres who was ""doxxed"" by giving an interview and outing himself), and the admins have said numerous times that if SRS brigaged, they would be banned. They have not been banned, ergo they don't brigade."
Negareddit,3d7smk,Murky42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:16:38 2015 UTC,Thank you that is an actual answer.  But may I ask if you have any sources on that?  I decided to google the issue and I found this.  https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1yhswb/a_brief_compilation_of_srs_doxxing_brigading_and/  I haven't yet finished it as its quite large but at a glance it seems like they have a ton of evidence?  If your side had a similiar page that would be convenient as then I can compare the facts and make my own conclusion rather then relying on one sides testimony.
Negareddit,3d7smk,petty_throwaway,32,Tue Jul 14 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"But because I'm game, and because you're lazy:   Looks like Gawker is responsible for the doxxing of potato_in_my_anus. And then he got shadowbanned. They said ""SRS did it"" but SRS doesn't have the power to shadow ban someone.  Again, violentacres was doxxed by Gawker Simply repeating that SRS did it doesn't make it true. Geeze you guys are turning into GWB. But also, THIS GUY RAN A SUB COMMITTED TO POSTING PICTURES OF UNDERAGE GIRLS IN STATES OF UNDRESS. WHICH IS CHILD PORN.  If you're going to post this garbage the you're going to have to at least tell me where in this mess that SRS is asking for a brigade.  Same for this one. I see a lot of comments in there saying ""My post is getting downvoted"" and ""here comes the downvote brigade"" (referring to their own posts). Please point out where the users there are calling for a brigade. This post is up over 100 points since SRS linked to it (SRS post here) TOTES BRIGADING Posting a link showing that someone downvotes a user only proves that they downvote a user. It doesn't prove that they were downvoted because they were linked in SRS. Lots of folks that we link to come to SRS to defend themselves. When they do that, we downvote them. I also come across MRAs, and white supremacists who comment outside of linked posts, because we, you know, spend time on Reddit and sometimes come across these dudes. And you know what? I have no problems downvoting them.  Even the commenters in this one don't think it's a brigade I fail to see how this constitutes doxxing. If someone says in a comment on Reddit ""hey I'm a pedophile"" I think that's sort of fair game right? Commenting on threads is not brigading and is allowed all over Reddit. It's not a bannable offense. SRS calls it ""yelling at the poop"".  Oh look at that the user that talks about voting --> has been banned.  Fucking crazy how that shit works, yo."
Negareddit,3d7smk,Murky42,17,Tue Jul 14 17:46:22 2015 UTC,Well I'm not only lazy I am biased. Sometimes its a good idea to ask somebody else to try to convince you rather then just have 100% faith in yourself to be a perfect rational observer. Because I sure as shit ain't one because at the end of the day I am a human being.  TBH there is still a part of me that dislikes SRS simply because of its nature as a meta subreddit. That being said you have provided more then enough arguments to instill quite a bit of reasonable doubt. So I won't sling such accusations in the future about SRS in the future as its only right to presume innocence until proven beyond reasonable doubt.  I won't be providing a significant rebuttal for your post because A: I am lazy and B: I am out of my depth as far as massive subreddit drama and the internal inner workings of reddit's upvote/downvote systems. I think I have already wasted more then enough of your time on silly internet drama.  This is exactly the kind of reply I was looking for so I can only say one thing.  Thank you.  PS. sorry for not vetting the source entirely myself before posting it. I have a terrible habit of posting and then editing my posts.

I just hope at least somebody in this forum saw my post and thought ""hey maybe I should give some of the others a shot as well"". Would be nice if everybody took some time out of their day and gave it a shot. Certainly beats getting mad about everything and shutting yourself in a small group and living in a perpetual state of 2 minutes of hate which far too many groups have done and will keep doing as long as humans exist.

Negareddit,3d7smk,petty_throwaway,2,Tue Jul 14 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"Well if its possible that would be nice obviously. That being said I can understand the difficulty of such a situation. It's also a bit much to ask from one person.  However its not uncommon for pages like the one I linked to exist for both sides which both attempt to disprove as much claims as possible. I'm not a typical member of this group and thus out of the loop and figured I would be better of asking if any of you guys had such a page then trying to dig my way to victory.  I'm just trying to find a bit of info from both sides because there is so much bullshit, false flagging and drama going on. The only thing I know for sure is that both sides most definitely have a population of assholes within their ranks.  Thinking of the argument used before:   the admins have said numerous times that if SRS brigaged, they would be banned. They have not been banned, ergo they don't brigade.   Isn't very strong as corruption and/or mistakes,etc are very real possibilities and not beyond the realm of imagination."
Negareddit,3d7smk,Murky42,11,Tue Jul 14 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm biased, but if you're looking for ""arguments from both sides"" where one side actively sides with white supremacists and pedophiles, then do you really think me doing all this legwork and proving that SRS is not a downvote brigading, doxxing, cabal of social justice warriors is going to change your mind? If, to you, they're already on the same level, maybe it's you that needs to reconsider why you want this information."
Negareddit,3d7smk,petty_throwaway,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:53:07 2015 UTC,"I knew this place was biased but finding neutrals is fucking hard and giving biased people a shake doesn't have major downsides on an internet forum. Worst case scenario I get a dox attempt in which chase HURRAH I proved my point sortaish?  White supremacists and pedophiles may be awful but they still have rights. Everybody deserves somebody on their side. Naturally certain levels of support are unethical but I am not exactly a prime member of those forums either so I hardly have a substantial claim of knowledge proof of if they stay in ""reasonable levels"".   I find it hard to find a ""right"" point of view as everybody considers themselves right and often for good reasons on both sides. Not that I consider neo nazis to be correct but I don't exactly consider every single one of them evil either. Doesn't help that the biggest sack of shit will always be the loudest in any given group and rarely represents majority opinion.  Not everything has to be on the same level to be relevant and worth knowing more about.  That kinda logic doesn't get us in to space. I love trivial pursuits as they are often at least somewhat original.  Anywho I am out of place here its time i float off like a little butterfly or something."

Negareddit,3d7smk,FeralBadger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"I am not sure if this is the exact argument I've seen. When people mention harassing subs that got banned others bring up /r/shitredditsays because they (in the past) have been responsible for harassing people. Apparently this doesn't happen or happens less now but the memory has stuck.   Also when people bring up subs banned for being hateful like the raping/killing/etc ones and the racist ones, others bring up /r/ShitRedditSays (I personally have rarely seen this happen) because, though their targets are the seen as having institutional power (etc) and being the dominant culture on reddit, a lot of the rhetoric  (gendered language and slurs etc, disparaging of people based on collective groupings etc) could be interpreted as bigoted, so I guess it's seen as favouritism or something."

SRS seems to have declined lately, but they used to go around brigading like mad and if I recall correctly they were doxxing people as well. So yeah, racist/sexist/etc subs are certainly full of shit people (and it's easy to make an argument that they should be banned) but SRS made a point of spreading the shit around. Both are bad, one of just more in-your-face about it."
Negareddit,3d7smk,gaso,0,Tue Jul 14 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"The answer is that they're all awful, IMO.  Certainly being a racist piece of shit and glorifying rape is reprehensible, but that doesn't make SRS good either.  Better? Sure.  But being better than a steaming pile of shit isn't exactly an accomplishment.  Edit:  I've read the proof and lack thereof with regard to the brigading rumors and so forth.  I don't really dislike them because of that, but rather because it seems like a massive circlejerk against people who happen to say things that don't match the stereotypical SJW ideology.  I don't appreciate people that get up in arms over being offended by every little thing.  People should treat each other better and with more respect, for sure, but they're not doing themselves any favors by bringing constant attention to comments that they disagree with.  Turn the other cheek, ignore them, and let the people who say things they consider to be offensive believe they're not being heard.  But hey, what do I know :("

They are very obvious hate subs, people know to avoid them, and members know not to try attract attention like that.  SRS is different in that it isn't a straightforward hate sub, but has members and even moderators that lean towards that direction, as evidenced by the distributing of revenge pornography via the sub's CSS (which has now been removed)(EDIT: That was a Starcraft2 sub. I totally fucked up here. Sorry) and the many reports of brigading and harrassment. Redditor's nitpick with SRS is that no one really tries to do anything about these people unless they stray into very-illegal territory.

I suppose it's more positive compared to the usual press, but then the reality is not as black-and-white as 'every pedophile will rape your kids', like conventional media makes it out to be. There are many pedophiles that wish no kids harm and realise they have a problem, and want to seek treatment. However the idiocy and hysteria surrounding paedophilia often makes it all but impossible to do so without making life for them infinitely worse.  As for why the article so popular on reddit, it's likely because the article is so contrary to conventional line, yet still deals with the subject on a fairly reasonable basis and isn't completely stupid."

I go to other sites, other communities not named Reddit or 4chan, and there's not nearly as much a clamor about pedophile this or that.  Only at these places is pedophilia such a hot button topic.

Point is, we don't know why she was let go none of us were there when the decision was made. Given that it was sudden you could assume whatever Victoria did to get the axe was probably fairly bad.

I also strongly disagree with the principle that women's should cover themselves not to arouse men (this is the reasoning btw).

Do I choose the clothes I wear on to the mall on the weekend based on free choice or have I been conditioned to believe that wearing certain things will make others perceive me in certain ways and make my 'choices' based on that conditioning?

Negareddit,3d46li,stanhhh,5,Mon Jul 13 13:19:19 2015 UTC,"It can be argued that wearing the veil isn't a choice but the result of cultural/societal/peer pressure and endoctrinment spawning from the very tradition of women oppression inherent of these cultures and also from a competition towards radicalism of ""who is the most righteous"". And that many women would choose to wear the veil only so they can be spared by their men's own issues towards women.   I'm never for the de facto ""banning of things"", because I see it as a physician trying to erase the symptoms instead of fighting the disease. But I still don't think it's ok for feminists or equalitirians to fight for the right to be ""willfully"" oppressed. I think they should help women who are against it and certainly not women who are for it. That is my opinion.    malala   That the western medias and institutions makes her an idol of some sort doesn't mean she's truely representative of anything. She's going the right direction because she's fighting for the education of girls and young women, but that's it.    These are educated, independent women who make their own choice on weather to wear the hijab or not.   Most of the times: not really. I've grown up in a poor suburb (in europe) with a big proportions of muslims. And I can tell you about the weight of traditionalism in there and how girls and young women aren't independant at all and how the education level for everyone in there isn't spectacular. Also, ""in my days"", you didn't see SO MUCH veiled women (about 20 years ago), that this thing is kind of spreading is pretty new and the result of the radicals push we've witnessed ""recently"". Nothing good comes from that to me.    That's not a source for anything, just an experiment, a testimony, read it please  Also I would venture to argue that the niqab/hijab isn't cloth. It isn't a choice of cloth. Choice of cloth is: i can wear trousers, a dress, a skirt, a saroual, shorts, a tank top, a t-shirt, a vest, a coat, a cap, a hat, classy shoes or snickers or doc marteens etc etc etc .... with the niqab it's only ""i wear the same thing, all day, everyday, forever.""   This alone shows, to me, that it isn't about clothing , it's more. It's about hiding women into non existence. This isn't sane. I won't ever believe that this is sane and I would never advocate for a right to wear this, nor would I fight for the ban of it.   And I never even talked about the security issues and the fact that in some countries, citizens are REQUIRED by law not to hide their face in public. Obvious reasons.

""American power is seen as “clean, rational, and constructive” whereas Muslim society is viewed as irrational, with random violence including assault and hatred (Zeiger 2008:276). What is not realized by the American public is that some Muslim women have had power in their traditional countries long before the feminist movement in America. They have been queens, heads of state, and rulers for centuries (Ali-Karamali 2008:118). When a woman wears the hijab, some Americans only see the veil that she wears. They do not pay attention to the women doctors, lawyers, prime ministers, presidents, professors, and judges (Ali-Karamali 2008:120). So why is it when Muslim women have had highly educated, prestigious positions in public that they are still viewed as oppressed?""   ""Women’s clothing is used to conceal and attract attention depending on the local standards of beauty, modesty, and gender because female sexuality is often harnessed for the integrity of the community (Shaheed 2008:298). Yet, sexual control of women is prevalent in patriarchal societies and they use dress codes to enforce that control; this refers to both Muslim and non-Muslim countries (Shaheed 2008:299). There is this basic human thought that “clothing is about the beautification of the body and is designed to attract the opposite sex for the purpose of procreation” (Shaheed 2008:298). American society has its own ideas about how women should dress and behave. Masculine clothing norms dictate what acceptable fashion is for women, for example tight clothes and high heels (Droogsma 2007:296). American cultural norms greatly influence how women feel in regards to being attractive. There is pressure from capitalist interests and patriarchal perspectives for women to be thin (Hesse-Biber et al, 2006:212). Self-esteem for an American woman is often dependent on her perceived attractiveness to the opposite sex (Hesse-Biber et al, 2006:210). It can be argued that American culture oppresses women through promoting unattainable ideals of beauty and thinness (Mussap 2006:122).  ""The veil may provide protection against the strong drive for thinness in Western standards of beauty (Dunkel et al 2010:63). By being able to create their identity through their religion and not identify with American ideals and morals, the hijab allows women to take control over their bodies (Ruby 2006:61). Their identity is secured when they are able to refrain from public scrutiny over how they are dressed. The hijab is often associated with loose fitting clothes that cover the whole body as well so as not to show off the womanly shape. By wearing these things, a woman can create her own identity and take charge of her own body. Wearing the veil is not about shame of the female body but rather a form of privacy over the body (Bunting 2001.)""   ""Muslim women do not conform to the ideals set by the American culture that a person needs to look good and wear the nicest clothes in order to get noticed. These women may see Americans as being oppressed by the ways they dress (Droogsma 2007:310). By not conforming to the scantily-clad image of the American woman, Muslim women who wear the hijab promote respect and dignity from their peers as well as protection (Ruby 2006:59). The male gaze can be seen as oppressive, and by wearing the veil the women are taking control over their bodies (Droogsma 2007:305). Wearing the hijab allows a woman to have more freedom from gender bias, as it is a symbol of religious piety and is respected within the Muslim community (Williams and Vashi 2007:282).""   ""The hyper sexuality of men seems to be a key component when women decide to veil. It is believed that there is a threat to women because it is thought that men cannot control their sexual urges (Williams and Vashi 2007:276). Men stop looking in a sexual way at a woman who puts on the hijab and take more interest in her personality (Bunting 2001). Men are forced to look beyond a woman’s physical appearance, and the hijab lets them know they do not have the right to look at a woman’s body and judge her beauty (Droogsma 2007:305).""   ""Women in America tend to view beauty as a part of their sexuality; as “sex sells” is a prevalent notion. They also tend to believe that the fewer clothes that a woman wears, the better she is at conveying beauty. It is the women who are thin that are comfortable wearing less clothing and those are the women who are considered the most beautiful in American society. In order to look beautiful a woman must be thin and be able to look good while she is naked. The Islamic faith does not have this same view. It has a high regard for modesty and the belief in female modesty is what keeps their societies pure and holds honor. In order to be modest, a woman must wear clothing that is synonymous with that attitude. This means wearing loose clothing and (in some cases) veiling to conceal any womanly shapes. Anything that might be considered sexual by a woman is concealed so as not to portray that kind of demeanor. In contrast, women in America believe that by covering yourself you are hiding something shameful: a fat body, perhaps, or an ugly one. There is this notion that in order to be free you need to be confident with yourself, and that is something you cannot do if you have to cover yourself in public and resort to staying in the private sphere.""    http://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=honors"

Even if all women who veil stopped veiling tomorrow, that wouldn't change their status as oppressed at all. Trying to ""free"" Muslim women from veiling totally ignores their systematic oppression and comes off as white cultural imperialist bullshit. In fact, one reason veiling has become more popular in recent years is because it's seen as resistance to white imperialism."

Comedians knowingly make all sorts of statments with completely broken logic during their stand-up routines. But broken-logic statements are perfectly fine in stand-up material (racially-charged ones, not so much), as it's supposed to generate laughter, not form a logical debate.   Chris Rock's stand-up material which you linked to, if we were to look at the logic of it, essentially states that the world of black people is split between good black people who do things completely right, and bad black people who always do everything wrong. Which is a fairly ill-thought-out proposition, and one I highly doubt he'd share at a racial equality convention.  Broken logic like that is also something you're gonna see in shitposting havens. Hell, there's not much you don't see in that area of the internet that isn't revolting and/or logic-defying. They aren't there to justify, to logically debate.

He knows that retarded is a word 'for him'. Whereas stupid or dumb are words that he knows are not exclusively about him.   When he hears people call other people retarded he understands that people are using what he is as an insult. The general context for retarded hasn't changed the same way that stupid and dumb (I'd even add lame to the list of things that aren't ableist) have changed.

Furthermore, those investors(or at least the people selected by the investors) that sit on that board of directors could give a shit about your problems/troubles, civil rights, etc. All they care about is getting a return on their investment. If getting that return means playing the free speech advocate, then they will be 100% pro free speech. But as soon as that free speech starts costing them money you can kiss it good bye.

Although reddit's first priority is making money through ad revenue their number 0 priority, b4 money, should be keeping the consumers happy. This is because without the users the ads are worth virtually nothing. Imagine if cnn kept reporting on complete bullshit, their integrity would be gone and their core values compromised. slowly but surely their userbase would diminish and so would the profits. If reddit were to keep on its path towards a ""mainstream social media platform."" their main userbase will flee and they will be left with filthy casuals, people who are linked to the site by another platforms and few hopefuls that reddit will return to its former glory (aka the people remaining on digg). So you are correct in that money is their first priority but they need to understand where that money comes from and hiring a ceo who cant even use the site let alone understand the complexities of its culture was a horrible move. hopefully from here they try to retain the current main userbase while also expanding, but retaining integral values of the site."

It is simply not possible in an ethical way to ""weigh"" suffering, be it man or animal. Sure, one can argue ""for the greater good"" of ""the society as a whole"", but for that individual that is suffering this argument has no relief.

In that 12 month period, the estimated number of male victims forced to penetrate was 1,267,000.  Being forced to penetrate does not meet the legal definition of rape in the US, but it does meet the common usage of the word (being forced to have sexual intercourse).

Negareddit,3d4jmw,NUMBERS2357,10,Mon Jul 13 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I saw this data trotted out a while ago to argue female-on-male rape is severely underestimated. While I still have a lot of questions regarding this issue, that article helped me understand the study a bit better.  Definition of Rape   The difference between “rape” and “being made to penetrate” is that in the definition of rape the victim is penetrated; “made to penetrate” by definition refers to cases where the victim penetrated someone else.   A weak point. That was clear from the beginning, especially to MRAs. The researchers offer a lengthier explanation, but I think there's still a pretty good argument for calling ""made to penetrate"" (MTP) rape.  Incomplete Data   ...one must have the total rape perpetrators (the denominator), and the number of female perpetrators of this specific violence (the numerator).  Here, neither the numerator nor the denominator was available.   Why wasn't data on gender of MTP perpetrators available?  Well, the number of MTP victims over 12 months (1,267,000) was similar to male rape victims over a lifetime (1,581,000), so the following seems relevant.  From the original study:  > The estimates for male victims raped by other types of perpetrators were based upon numbers too small to calculate a reliable estimate and therefore are not reported.  At first I thought it was because raw data was too small, but now I'm not sure. This perpetrator data appears to be the primary missing link.   EDIT: I originally assumed the researchers were talking about the percentage of rapes perpetrated by females against male. This would be (reports of female perpetrator / total male rapes reported), but it sounds like they are talking about an unsurveyable figure related to the next topic. This still raises questions, since percentages of sexual violence perpetrated by a certain gender are provided in other cases, including lifetime MTP.   Serial Rapists   Data collected and analyzed for the NISVS 2010 have a “one-to-multiple” structure (where the “one” refers to one victim and the “multiple” refers to multiple perpetrators).  While not collected, it is conceivable that any perpetrator could have multiple victims.   Good point. The study did was not collecting data to research prevalence of serial rapists, and asking people if or how many times they've been raped doesn't give us any insight. It sheds light on how often perpetrators are male or female, but that can be misleading without the above knowledge.  Questions Remain  I did my own analysis to double check the numbers when I saw data from this study posted in an infographic, and I spotted at least some of these caveats before.  Even the 40% was an erroneous calculation. The intended figure should have been 44% - missed an opportunity there. But I certainly noticed the major discrepancy between the lifetime comparison and 12 month comparison. Below is what i calculated for gender-on-opposite-gender rape, including MTP data and using the ill-advised math (for 12 month estimate).  Lifetime:   16.8% 16.4% female-on-male. 83.2% 83.6% male-on-female.   12 Month (using partial lifetime data):   44.1% female-on-male. 55.9% male-on-female.   So that raised a red flag...  However, considering the steps taken to get the 44% figure, even with it being bad science, it suggests to me that we could use more thorough/extensive research before reaching any broad conclusions on this subject.   EDIT: I looked closer at my analysis, and I found a mistake. From the study: ""The majority of male rape victims (93.3%) reported only male perpetrators."" I took that to mean 6.7% of perpetrators were female, but the figure would actually be <6.7% because the statement implies some males were victims of both female and male perpetrators. This affects the above lifetime percentages, which are corrected above."
Negareddit,3d4jmw,Eurotrashie,0,Mon Jul 13 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"That's a different claim - that's talking about perpetrators, not victims.  My post is about victims."
Negareddit,3d4jmw,stanhhh,0,Tue Jul 14 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"Perpetrators aside, this doesn't really seem to disprove the idea that something like ~40% of rape victims are men, which would still go against what OP is saying.  Even with the lifetime numbers here, which show the largest disparity:   In fact, Table 2.1 and 2.2 of the NISVS 2010 Summary Report clearly report that lifetime rape victimization of females (estimated at 21,840,000) is about 4 times the number of lifetime being made-to-penetrate of males (estimated at 5,451,000)   men are still 20% of victims, enough I think to justify an increased focus on them (to compare, women are like 23% of murder victims, but people wouldn't ever make the sweeping statements about focusing on male victims they do for rape and female victims).  And I think the lifetime numbers have more women because there were proportionately more female rape victims (also crime victims generally) in the past than now.  The other part is this:   misses victims in the cells where reliable estimates were not reported due to small cell counts failing to meet statistical reliability criteria   which seems like it would concern types of violence that aren't common enough to make a massive difference, though I could be wrong.  Either way, it seems to me like the % of victims who are female is a lot less than 95%, and I bet the fact that the 40% number isn't entirely right will be used by many as an excuse to keep saying 95%."
Negareddit,3d4jmw,warsie,3,Tue Jul 14 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are trying to make a controversial statement just to be controversial - but your post makes no sense. Because males raping females happens more often, females raping males is not an equal issue - What the fuck??? Rape is rape. Rape is wrong.

Negareddit,3d4jmw,ProbablyBelievesIt,-3,Mon Jul 13 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"I agree to a certain extent. Rape and society's response to it is a reflection of that society's culture. The culture in prison and in the military is different to general society here in the US (as that's all I can speak about), and so rape is a different issue. The fact is that same-sex rape is prevalent in prison. We don't know if it would remain that way if it prisons were not gender specific, or if they would then reflect the trends in the rest of society.  The military, too, has more cases of same-sex rape. However, one must look at the demographics of the military, which is overwhelmingly (80+%) male [Source]. If these demographics were more reflective of civilian America, what might those rape figures look like? That's what I mean when I say it's a different issue."

Yes, the woman hitting you is an asshole and it's wrong to hit someone, but as a guy, if you respond with full strength you're not just an asshole, you're a fucking bloodthirsty psychopath who deserves to be locked up."

Negareddit,3cnfjd,warsie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"In the U.S., the general rule is that ""[a] person is privileged to use such force as reasonably appears necessary to defend him or herself against an apparent threat of unlawful and immediate violence from another.""[1] In cases involving non-deadly force, this means that the person must reasonably believe that their use of force was necessary to prevent imminent, unlawful physical harm.[2] When the use of deadly force is involved in a self-defense claim, the person must also reasonably believe that their use of deadly force is immediately necessary to prevent the other's infliction or great bodily harm or death.[3] Most states no longer require a person to retreat before using deadly force. The minority of jurisdictions that do require retreat, there is no obligation to retreat when it is unsafe to do so or when one is inside their own home   TL;DR: if you punch a girl with full force after she just slapped you, you're not only a fucking blood-craving psychopath, you're breaking the law.

I wasn't referring to legal justification. I was referring to responding to threats and attacks. It's similar (not congruent, I know) to the off quoted 'better to be judged by 12 than carried by six'  Also, since we're getting legal: From YOUR OWN POST   [1] In cases involving non-deadly force, this means that the person must reasonably believe that their use of force was necessary to prevent imminent, unlawful physical harm   Guess what: That means you can still beat the shit out of a women, but to a lesser extent. Instead of punching her on the ground and stomping on her head until she is dead, you only have to legally just beat her until she collapses and is no longer a threat.   you're not only a fucking blood-craving psychopath, you're breaking the law.    Doesn't make it morally wrong to beat up women who attack you. It's not your fault the women decided to pick with someone who would metaphorically made his day.   But to be honest I didn't expect a regular poster of /r/KotakuInAction and /r/cummingonfigurines to have much understanding of basic human interaction.

I'm not saying we should beat the shit out of woman for hitting man, but say that a person shouldn't be held responsible for their actions because of their gender is incredibly sexist.   Also the idea that just because a person isn't large that they can't cause a great deal of damage. Getting a ""few scratches"" to the face can blind you for the rest of your life.

Tell me, what would reasonable force be for me if I were attacked by a woman weighing 180 when I'm a man who only weighs 125?

Negareddit,3cnfjd,DreamProfit,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:18 2015 UTC,Thank you. Posts like these are why I am subscribed to Negareddit. A little sanity is refreshing on this site.
Negareddit,3cnfjd,SPONSORED_SHILL,-4,Fri Jul 10 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Once you hit somebody and the pursue them to hit them more you are no longer in self defense mode.   Depends what you mean by that. If I hit someone who's trying to hit me and I have good reason to believe they might come back straight away to hit me again, I think it's reasonable to say I should hit them again first until I'm satisfied the threat is gone. 'Persueing' them in this instance might simply mean stepping forward a few times. Of course, if I chase after someone long after the situation is over, that's different.   Most people have never been in a situation where they have been brutally attacked. It's not just a 'streetfight' when the other guy/guys are bigger, crazier, and are basically trying to kill you by the severity of their actions. Have you ever been kneed in the face and had people jump on your head? Tried being thrown face first into a wall? Those things kill people. Most people cannot end a fight with a single punch - and running is often harder than you'd imagine. Try showing these rules to the asian man who had his teeth smashed out on a bus stop bench in Auckland simply because he didn't understand what some thugs were saying to him when they demanded a cigarette. He never got the chance to run away - and if he'd slapped someone and taken a step back it wouldn't have made a difference because 10 people would have still bashed him.  The fact of the matter is that 'fights' aren't just fights some of the time. Calling it a 'fight' often implies mutual consent and some modicum of sanity. Fight is just a word we use out of convenience. They are usually random acts of violence fuelled by alcohol, hatred or the desire to get something. In these cases, if you are capable, it's wise to fight until you know you've won and not to simply think it's over. I don't think anyone who's been assaulted should be expected to simply try to run away [easier said than done sometimes] or ignore being attacked.   Besides that, all fights are a potential coma or death waiting to happen. To treat fights on the street like some sort of sport with rules is ridiculous. I agree, someone shouldn't lay out a woman, but she shouldn't attack a person and expect no response either. Also, you're wrong - women can and do set traps for men by attacking them while surrounded by men who are waiting to jump in. Try being accosted as you walk through the city by a woman who wants your bag and starts punching you and then you look around and notice 5 young men surrounding you and waiting for you to retaliate. There are also some women who are much stronger or more dangerous and ruthless than some men and they use it to their advantage. There are women in places like Northcote who will physically assault you for your belongings.  Your statements aren't realistic. I get the gist of it, but good luck applying that to a situation that flies off the chain without any expectation. Try thinking of all those rules when you start getting punched in the back of the head, and you know someone wants to beat you to a coma. I do agree though that people need to use some form of discretion and hold back from situations that aren't truly warranted.   As one of the commentators suggested - life isn't the movies - so I can turn that around and say don't treat assaults like they are schoolyard scraps, they are potentially life ending altercations. The best thing to do is to either run away quickly, or to defend yourself in any manner you see fit until the attackers are properly neutralised or until you can get away. You cannot expect to just throw a punch at some people and think they will back down. Don't stop defending yourself with forceful retaliation and pre-emptive strikes unless you are capable of running away. The other person will may not stop consider how good your manners are when you let him gather himself to come back for another round.  To another commenter...you're lucky you've never been assaulted. It's commonplace nowadays. Simply look at someone wrong, be a little bit smaller than them, or go out with your attractive girlfriend and you can receive more than a slap these days. Also you're wrong about drunk people not being killers - they are - there are lots of drunk people in prison who've killed someone in an act of violence that was fueled by alcohol. In fact, drunk people are the worst, they are the most likely to take things to an extreme.  tldr - I think people should use common sense about what constitutes self defense and avoid escalations [turn the other cheek when possible], but I see nothing wrong with neutralizing a threat properly and decisively should one arise that you deem serious enough."

And outright shitty things do get deleted and people get banned. They just don't happen very often.  But, posting to the front page is tough to do. There's no approval process, you click post and it's live. But quality links that provoke discussion are expected. News articles or inflammatory opinion pieces are usually deleted, unless it's a huge story. Linking to one article isn't always enough, and just linking to imgur or a Twitter post would definitely be deleted. It's a tricky formula that requires a lot of lurking. My account is 13 years old and I've only posted to the front page once.  There are also subsites, such as FanFare for watching movies and television, and AskMetafilter for asking questions. However, don't ask open ended questions about experiences like the ones on /r/AskReddit, it's more for practical questions than just curiosity. There's also MetaTalk for talking about the site itself, but it's much closer to /r/TheoryOfReddit than /r/SubredditDrama.  Edit: Oh, and one more thing. Comments are not threaded, and people like it that way. It means following a huge discussion is a bit tricky, especially if you want to see if anyone replied to you.

It's not about a robot uprising, more like how our technology is going to evolve faster than our biology. Basically the stuff we create is going to  merge into us and we will be superintelligent AI, sort of the ""new human race""  I agree that a lot of it is far fetched, but I do not doubt in our lifetime AI will exceed biology.

Negareddit,3chjxd,TDuffin,9,Wed Jul 15 10:43:30 2015 UTC,What bothers me the most is how stupid Redditors are with tumblr. Tumblr yes has extreme SJW but it also has EVERYTHING. I can guarantee you can look up something like buildings fucking each other with dinosaur dildos and actually find it. The problem is they are cherrypicking and circlejerking how the dreaded femanazis are killing the internet while they fail to realize this femanazi is just one blog of countless millions on tumblr.  Also side note redditors just don't understand satire or jokes. A lot of stuff on subs like /r/tumblrinaction are clearly jokes or satire or one mentally off person in a sea of thousands but instead they cherry pick shit to fit their world view that tumblr is a evil SJW lair bent on chopping off every man's dick.

The Those Who Trespass and Anthony Kiedis autobio eps are also great if you're looking to kill time. :p  I've not read the book, full disclosure, but it's not at all in a genre of book I like. I guess I feel like reddit has very limited taste when it comes to books. I don't mean this in a smug way or anything. I like 1984! It's just the site's favorite books/movies/TV stuff doesn't branch out all that much, so it's a) really easy to get karma listing stuff everyone here already likes, which reinforces how good the site thinks someone like DFW is, and b) discourages people from suggesting stuff that isn't reddit's preference because they don't feel they'll be as well rewarded for it. I think this is an issue with the upvote system more than anything. Chekhov is not ""bad,"" but reddit doesn't talk about Chekhov. A book like 1984, which is not bad either, but is much more read because it's often assigned, will get more upvotes. It sort of naturally stifles less popular opinions that aren't even bad or controversial."

Negareddit,3cbqou,-who_is_john_galt-,5,Tue Jul 7 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"I think of the worst subreddits as containment.    I see this bandied about constantly on reddit and I just don't understand it. How do hate subs serve as ""containment?"" Isn't the entire point of reddit to subscribe to a multitude of subreddits that you like?  Do you really think that the people who subscribed to FPH only ever posted in FPH? Because they didn't. Literally nobody uses reddit that way. The entire point of reddit is that it's a one stop shop for your interests. I masstag FPHers, MRAs, gators, and terps, and they are fucking everywhere. Their safe spaces for hatred were doing precisely nothing to contain them.  And that's the entire point! That's why they were banned! I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but it just baffles me that anyone thinks FPH was contained given that the admins stated reason for banning FPH is that they were not contained.  Hate subs weren't ""containing"" shitlords, they were attracting and amplifying their hatred, and that hatred has now become so amplified that /r/worldnews is nigh-indistinguishable from Stormfront. If reddit knows what's good for them they'll sack up and ban the lot of them, soon."
Negareddit,3cbqou,kraetos,2,Tue Jul 7 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"I meant containment in the sense that their vile thoughts would mostly stay contained in their vile subs. They would talk about cooking in r/cooking, Skyrim in r/skyrim and keep their hating on fat people to fph."

That's an interesting theory but the thing about hatred is that it utterly consumes you if you let it. If you dedicate your life to hating something you'll see it everywhere you look. On more than one occasion I've seen this exchange:   [deleted]   Mod: ""We don't permit that kind of language in this sub, removed.""   Shitlord: ""Sorry, I forgot I wasn't in [hate subreddit].""     Like, what's this fascination with ""containing"" bigots? Can't they just get the fuck off reddit? Why does reddit need to host echo chambers for their hatred? Why can't reddit just say ""you all aren't welcome here, so please leave?"""

My point being that from the admin stand point what you're asking them to do is slash their ad revenue. Personally, I would love to see that. But I don't believe we'll see that. They're too afraid to be the next Digg.   To be honest, I'm only here because, as much as I find their behavior disgusting, it doesn't trigger me and I enjoy the socialist community here.

Negareddit,3cau2y,rslashbatfacts,6,Mon Jul 6 13:39:28 2015 UTC,"The difficulty in diagnosing intestinal issues probably has a lot to do with it. Even when something like IBS or Chron's isfially disgnosed, it can take additional years to figure out how to avoid a flareup. And there's still the possibility that you'll react to a new food, or become sensitive to something that was previously safe.  Then there's the fact that many Redditors are around 17-30, prime drinking years. When you have to pull your irresponsibly hungover ass to work, your stomach is going to be very unpredictable. Not everyone is warned that diarrhea can be a common part of hangovers either.  I'm sure that terribly salty and greasy food being cheap and a favorite of drunks doesn't help either."

And not everyone is forewarned that alcohol can lead to diarrhea.  Then there are many people who do have medical conditions. People with Chrone's, IBS, or food intolerances. It can take years of testing to get diagnosed, not to mention trying to figure out how to control it through medication and diet. You can have it relatively under control, then suddenly realize that tequila makes you sick. Or that new vegetarian place should have been safe, but it turns out they must have use a ton if salt or something because surprise, your stomach wants to escape out your sphincter now.

There were also some amazing and eerie stories with good pacing, and fantastic mood and worldbuilding, like Penpals, or that story that I can't find at all about a girl who spent a summer in a rented house with two dogs and got sucked into a haunted replay of the past (definitely better than it sounds) -  Stuff that really stood out, some jump scares, some 'augmented' stories that did, in fact, use Imgur links.

Negareddit,3c54k2,BuiltTheSkyForMyDawn,16,Sat Jul 4 22:53:27 2015 UTC,"Everyone on reddit wants to act like they are 4chan veterans by almost nobody actually goes there; everybody on 4chan acts like they would never condescend to visit reddit but most of them are regular redditors.

Poll after poll show that even on the most reddit-infested boards like /v/, redditors are just a sizable minority. The numbers check out too - /r/4chan has around 650k subscribers, and even if we assume not every crossposter is subscribed to it, the number still pales in comparison to 4chan's 20 million unique monthly visitors.  The reason why it might SEEM like ""80% of 4channers are redditors"" is because redditors are massive shitposters. Redditors are the underage kiddies who think their opinion on every subject is needed, the ones who can't stop blogposting, the ones who mindless spout memes like a bunch of retards, and they're the ones who abuse the quote function years after it stopped being funny. A big reason why 2015 4chan is so shit is because of a constant stream of 17 year old reddit fucktards who think they know the culture from a bunch of /r/4chan screencaps."

In many cases one single individual made a choice, on behalf of their entire community, to shut that community down.    I, as a user, feel more powerless than ever in the face of all this self inflicted damage.  It's a bit like watching someone you love self-harm and knowing that you're powerless to help them because they're operating under a faulty premise.    If anyone has lost in this debacle it's the users, that's the entire point I'm trying to make."
Negareddit,3c3yty,morpen,6,Sat Jul 4 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"The admins are and always have been very firm in the idea of ""mods are god.""

The whole site had a fuckin' conniption fit and all the news media gathered around to watch the seizure.  We had an astral alignment of stupid on this site in the past 48 hours:     Victoria was fired, which caused /r/Iama to go dark. Other moderators saw this as an opportunity to protest poor communication with the admins, so they made their subs go dark in solidarity. Users, seeing their favorite subs go private, came to the only logical conclusion: The Chief Executive Officer of Reddit was censoring the site, and had personally fired Reddit's most beloved employee that most people had never really heard of. The servers start seeing a thousands of new variations on /r/fuckellenpao being submitted every hour for approval.  Spam heuristics kick in as the server starts thinking that it's under a DDoS. Clearly Ellen Pao is preventing new subreddits from being made.

Negareddit,3byptb,Delores_Herbig,11,Fri Jul 3 06:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think the thing is that her firing was kind of the last straw for a lot of mods.  It seems there's been tension brewing with mods and admins about admin reluctance to address mod concerns for awhile. Then they pushed through a new version that makes modding harder for mods, which the mods had access to in beta and continually complained about/requested changes, which was ignored.  Then they fired a pretty key figure which a lot of mods saw as their liaison, or one of they few people who could actually assist them or coordinate things properly. Basically firing her makes their jobs harder, especially without notice, and they were already pissed. So I don't think its just about her.

However reddit is enormous, worth somewhere between 500 million and a few billion dollars, and gets 169 million unique visitors per month. And it's run largely by these mods. AskReddit and IAmA have millions of subscribers alone.   Treating mods well isn't a moral crusade, it's smart business. You've got people fucking volunteering to manage these huge subs that attract huge numbers of people to your billion dollar website. Maybe you should keep them happy?

Negareddit,3byptb,ASigIAm213,2,Fri Jul 3 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the way I look at it is modding should be seen as a hobby.

If they didn't fire her for a good reason, they're obviously not going to admit that and may post a bogus article to make themselves look better. Just tired with the circlejerk about her."

But that doesn't necessarily come hand-in-hand with professional matters.  If anything, this is probably a sign that IAmA shouldn't be forced to basically rely on a single person. Or shit like this happens.  Also it'd be nice if people didn't make large swathes of the site unusable to do this, regardless of how they feel on the matter.

All people are getting is that some girl got fired and reddit shut down.  I could see it being either way equally, to be completely honest.  The bigger subreddits were the ones who shut down first. They shut down because the firing was the tipping point in a whole onslaught of issues. They were mad about the way she was fired, not because she was fired. The smaller subs got wind of it and just shut down because they thought that they were supporting Victoria herself and trying to rectify her, which wasn't the original intent."

The last straw for them was one of the people they personally interacted with doesn't have that job anymore and the mods weren't kept in the loop by the other admins about it. It's far easier to ignore racism and sexism when it happens than it is to have your (volunteer) job made harder. That's where the line is drawn, apparently.    That said, even if they were concerned by the levels of racism and sexism in their communities, there's not a lot they can do to police hundreds of thousands of people in the same way that smaller subreddits can do (outside of bringing in a lot more mods, or the use of bots and other automatic features.)

One has to live in a bubble made of solid stone to think that the ingrained sexist and racist attitudes of Reddit are a less important issue than the issue they chose to take a stand against.    The second paragraph was my personal take on the matter. If Reddit gives mods more tools with which to make moderating easier, it might make the defaults not unpoliceable.

Negareddit,3bscmc,Jeanpuetz,3,Thu Jul 2 09:48:25 2015 UTC,"You've consumed way too much media.   This is a common trope- the idea that killing a dog or another animal is the ""line"" that can't be crossed. TVTropes has a name for it, but that website sucks, so I'm not going to link to it. An example is this: in the very beginning scene of Equilibrium, we watch the lead character kill dozens of people whose crime is exchanging artistic works. Later in the movie, the unforgivable act that the main character has to do (and the one that finally breaks him and realize the insanity of a war on emotions) is killing a single dog. If that doesn't make you immediately throw up your hands and say ""I quit!"", I don't know what would. But apparently all the movie writers thought this would be believable! And it doesn't have a 0% rating on IMDB! And we aren't bothered, because in media, you're allowed to kill humans with wanton disregard, but you're crossing the rubicon if you kill a fucking dog.   And there's a lot of inherent hypocrisy here too. On the whole, animal rights' activists are hated entirely by Reddit in the majority.  Just look at how many PETA threads come up. And look at the hate for vegetarians! ""Look at how self-righteous those vegetarians are!"" they say. If you decide to step outside of your comfort zone for three seconds, you'll see that the entire meat industry is unimaginable in its scale and in the animal abuse that it participates in. There are videos of people stomping the shit out of newborn calves' heads. There are videos of people throwing animals against walls. There are videos of this shit, and no one decides to stop participating in the industry that allows that shit to happen! How engaged is anyone, really, with animals' welfare?   It's a way to seem edgy. It's le reddit edgy to be like ""yeah, I hate humans! animals are cool though!"" like someone is a world-weary pessimistic cynic, but still (underneath all that) has a heart of gold because they love animals.

When something bad happens to the defenseless though, that's what I can't handle.  Don't know if that's a correct explanation, I'm not a psychiatrist, but it makes sense to me.  And I don't believe that depictions of violence and acts of violence are comparable at all, even if the depictions are of real life violence. There are people out there who actually ""enjoy"" watching videos and pics of gore and that stuff, I don't dehumanize them either. Two of my friends sometimes share those pics, and I don't get it AT ALL - I think it's just morbid curiosity - but I don't judge them for it.

Negareddit,3brvhy,locallyunscene,11,Wed Jul 1 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Sort of besides the point you're specifically making...  The biggest issue that I see with Reddit and cars is that a lot of Redditors worship at the altar of Top Gear, and Top Gear presents (or should I say presented?) an incredibly narrow perspective on cars and driving. The hosts of the show had pretty clear and strong biases about certain aesthetics and performance, and while there isn't anything wrong with those opinions, a lot of Top Gear fans see this shit as absolute fact. Top Gear was not an impartial program, and they did not strive to be one, and pretty much everything they said about cars should be taken with a grain of salt.   Maybe most significantly, as an example, Top Gear out-and-out deliberately lied about the performance of electric cars in multiple instances, because the Top Gear hosts are motor heads obsessed with the smell of petrol and the roar of engines."

Ever been behind a person who drives with two feet, or someone who speeds the puts the brakes on when the realize it's over the limit instead of just coasting down?  You have to apply your brakes because you have no idea how much pressure those people are applying, and soon everyone behind you has slowed down because one person can't be bothered to drive properly.

Negareddit,3brvhy,uggmun,2,Thu Jul 2 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Common practice and most law on United States highways is that the left lane is reserved for passing and faster moving traffic, and that traffic using the left lane must yield to traffic wishing to overtake. The United States Uniform Vehicle Code states:   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic ...   It is also illegal in many states in the US to use the ""far left"" or passing lane on a major highway as a traveling lane (as opposed to passing), or to fail to yield to faster moving traffic that is attempting to overtake in that lane. For example, Colorado's ""Left Lane Law"" states:   A person shall not drive a motor vehicle in the passing lane of a highway if the speed-limit is sixty-five miles per hour  or more unless such person is passing other motor-vehicles that are in a non-passing lane...[4]   Other examples, such as Massachusetts,[5]New Jersey,[6] Maine,[7] Illinois,[8]Pennsylvania,[9] and others,[10] make it illegal to fail to yield to traffic that seeks to overtake in the left lane, or to create any other ""obstruction"" in the passing lane that hinders the flow of traffic. As a result, heavy trucks are often prohibited from using the passing lane.  A common problem arising from misuse of the ""fast lane"" is that it forces faster moving traffic that wishes to overtake on the left to change lanes, do so on the right, and then change lanes again. Further, if the vehicle misusing the passing lane is going slower than the flow of other traffic, it forces those using the middle ""travel"" lane (but who are moving faster) to pass on the right as well, even though they have no intention of doing so.   Just get over. It varies by state as far as it being illegal, but get the fuck over."
