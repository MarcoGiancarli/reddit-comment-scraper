blop,3dnmhi,nenameemz,10,Fri Jul 17 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because her collar is choking her to death. Just kidding, I hope."
blop,3dnmhi,andee510,5,Fri Jul 17 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"Oh no, she makes that face when she gets picked up.  And the collar isn't as tight as it looks in this picture. Just got messed up while being held."
blop,3dnmhi,alejandro712,16,Fri Jul 17 22:39:04 2015 UTC,Was this dog named before or after isis the group?
blop,3dnmhi,alejandro712,28,Fri Jul 17 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"Before, after the Egyptian goddess."
blop,3dnmhi,CptJustice,30,Fri Jul 17 22:48:33 2015 UTC,Damn terrorists stealing a perfectly good dog name :-/
blop,3dnmhi,PacoTaco321,6,Fri Jul 17 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"One of my presas is also named Isis (also for the goddess), and we are asked this question literally every time someone asks what her name is."
blop,3dnmhi,CptJustice,7,Fri Jul 17 23:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it gets old. ""Why did you name your dog after the terrorist group?"" Rrrr."
blop,3dnmhi,doubledubs,3,Sat Jul 18 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"Because its going to bite your fucking head off if you ask too many questions, alright mate?"
blop,3dnmhi,soulteepee,5,Sat Jul 18 04:10:49 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's really fuckin annoying. ""Yes I totally named her after them!"" Cmon, man.   Ah well. Anyway, beautiful dog!"
blop,3dnmhi,alejandro712,10,Sat Jul 18 00:14:58 2015 UTC,Thank you. She's a French Beauceron.

blop,3dnmhi,KyGinger,0,Sat Jul 18 03:28:07 2015 UTC,I wish everyone followed Obamas lead and called them ISIL. It bothers me they have the same name as the Goddess.
blop,3da68b,pinuppixie,2,Tue Jul 14 18:20:16 2015 UTC,Is that a Pyr?

blop,3d8ozj,thejkhc,3,Tue Jul 14 11:08:36 2015 UTC,"Uhm, the blop is really not the focal point of this scene.  The other two frenchies fucking is the focal point."
blop,3d8ozj,quincess,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:54 2015 UTC,Really tender fucking too.
blop,3d8ozj,ed077,2,Wed Jul 15 01:45:37 2015 UTC,I think the juxtaposition of the blop and the frenchies shaggin' is what makes it funnier though. :p

blop,3d3nnk,trre03,2,Mon Jul 13 11:18:53 2015 UTC,"We're not entirely sure what kind of mix she is. She's quite the dog, though. She's so pretty, but she's constantly snorting like a pig and sticking her tongue out."
blop,3d3nnk,KyGinger,2,Mon Jul 13 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"My min pin does the same thing! Every time she gets excited she pokes her tongue out just a little bit! It's so goofy looking, I love it!"

blop,3cqtbb,rachel_carin,2,Fri Jul 10 01:04:24 2015 UTC,Could you not have spent literally 1 minute rotating the image before uploading it?
blop,3cqtbb,saran_man,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:56:28 2015 UTC,I'm a mobile user. I did rotate it but Now for Reddit rotated it back.
blop,3cqtbb,nvldnm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:40:14 2015 UTC,If he had his head cocked to the right this would be perfect.

blop,3cdbry,Roonerth,5,Tue Jul 7 02:01:36 2015 UTC,He looks like the fluffy manifestation of evil. I mean look at his eyes. It's an insanity ball of fur and his fiery soul burns with hate. And I totally want to hug it.
blop,3cdbry,FirelordHeisenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:37:55 2015 UTC,What is this beautiful creature?
blop,3cdbry,phatboy23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:42:30 2015 UTC,Looks like a pomeranian. Probably bred to be extra tiny =(
blop,3cdbry,internetpanda,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Or you know, a puppy."
blop,3cdbry,faithisrealcool,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:23:11 2015 UTC,If this was my dog I'd train him to become very still. Then I would find a toy store near my home and put it in with the plush toy display and watch children fall over themselves in glee when he reacts to them approaching.
blop,3cdbry,Spiralyst,-6,Tue Jul 7 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a scumbag for thinking about this, but what noise would it make if it was kicked?"
blop,3cdbry,darth_taco_117,9,Tue Jul 7 09:09:15 2015 UTC,Your leg would explode into a red mist if you tried kicking such a divine creature. :p
blop,3cbpv5,pizzabutt666,4,Mon Jul 6 17:48:35 2015 UTC,Is he okay?
blop,3cbpv5,SlothRuler,3,Mon Jul 6 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"He's a little scenile and needs to wear a diaper, but other than hip problems he is relatively healthy for his age :)"
