europeans,3dtr9o,weniger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:18:05 2015 UTC,"Summary  Google holds around 90% of the market share for internet search services in most European Economic Area (EEA) countries, and several companies have complained to the European Commission about Google’s market dominance. The European Commission has thus formally launched two separate investigations, one on Google’s comparison shopping and the other on the company’s handling of applications installed on Android operating mobile devices.  In April 2015, the Commission sent a Statement of Objections to Google, indicating that the company had abused its dominant position in the European Economic Area (EEA). Google admits that it is dominant, thanks to its innovative products and services, but does not agree that it has abused its position on the market.  The Google case may provide an opportunity for the Commission to clarify some aspects of competition law with regard to certain digital practices, and to close the difficult gap between the rights of companies who dominate the market, free competition and consumer protection."

One of their main objectives is to “build a collective identity based on precarity”, so that people can begin to be aware of their status as precarious workers who are not alone in this situation.

europeans,3dord4,B999999999,6,Sat Jul 18 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"A more readable version:   Review  Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler (unabridged translation)  It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that Hurst and Blackett's unexpurgated edition of Mein Kampf, published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler angle. The obvious intention of the translator's preface and notes is to tone down the book's ferocity and present Hitler in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, and for that the property-owning classes were willing to forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a version of Conservatism.  Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett's edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, simply on the internal evidence of Mein Kampf, it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken place in Hitler's aims and opinions. When one compares his utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his mind, the way in which his world-view doesn't develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of power politics. Probably, in Hitler's own mind, the Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of time-table. The plan laid down in Mein Kampf was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia's turn will come when England is out of the picture -- that, no doubt, is how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of course a different question.  Suppose that Hitler's programme could be put into effect. What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ""living room"" (i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens except the training of young men for war and the endless breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able to put this monstrous decision across? It is easy to say that at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of Mein Kampf, and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his speeches. I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power -- till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter -- I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity. The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his photographs -- and I recommend especially the photograph at the beginning of Hurst and Blackett's edition, which shows Hitler in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is there. He is the martyr, the victim. Prometheus chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, that he is fighting against destiny, that he can't win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one sees turn upon some such theme.  Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all ""progressive"" thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won't do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don't only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin's militarized version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples . Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people ""I offer you a good time,"" Hitler has said to them ""I offer you struggle, danger and death,"" and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years of slaughter and starvation ""Greatest happiness of the greatest number"" is a good slogan, but at this moment ""Better an end with horror than a horror without end "" is a winner. Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we ought not to underrate its emotional appeal.  George Orwell  New English Weekly, 21 March 1940"

europeans,3dm5bf,weniger,2,Fri Jul 17 11:40:12 2015 UTC,"This passage from Elements of the Philosophy of Right describes very well the current moral situation of the European Union, in which rights are once again subject to habit, and which is a situation in the real sense, because it has halted the process of European unification. The only thing still moving here is sheer fear of the future, which expresses itself as resentment. When it takes to the streets, this resentment is called a movement, yet it is merely a caricatured necrology of the human being as zoon politikon.   Menasse remembered the Greeks but forgot a reference. :)   Out of these two relationships between man and woman, master and slave, the first thing to arise is the family, and Hesiod is right when he says,  ""First house and wife and an ox for the plough, ""  for the ox is the poor man's slave. The family is the association established by nature for the supply of men's everyday wants, and the members of it are called by Charondas 'companions of the cupboard,' and by Epimenides the Cretan, 'companions of the manger.' But when several families are united, and the association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, the first society to be formed is the village. And the most natural form of the village appears to be that of a colony from the family, composed of the children and grandchildren, who are said to be suckled 'with the same milk.' And this is the reason why Hellenic states were originally governed by kings; because the Hellenes were under royal rule before they came together, as the barbarians still are. Every family is ruled by the eldest, and therefore in the colonies of the family the kingly form of government prevailed because they were of the same blood. As Homer says:  ""Each one gives law to his children and to his wives. ""  For they lived dispersedly, as was the manner in ancient times. Wherefore men say that the Gods have a king, because they themselves either are or were in ancient times under the rule of a king. For they imagine, not only the forms of the Gods, but their ways of life to be like their own.  When several villages are united in a single complete community, large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of life, and continuing in existence for the sake of a good life. And therefore, if the earlier forms of society are natural, so is the state, for it is the end of them, and the nature of a thing is its end. For what each thing is when fully developed, we call its nature, whether we are speaking of a man, a horse, or a family. Besides, the final cause and end of a thing is the best, and to be self-sufficing is the end and the best.  Hence it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above humanity; he is like the  ""Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one, ""  whom Homer denounces- the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.  Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state."

We use representative samples from five major economies of the Euro area: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. We find that European citizens rely on nationality to infer behaviour. Assessments of behaviour show a north/south pattern in which participants from northern countries are perceived to be more honest and to provide more effort in a volunteering game than are participants from southern countries. Actual behaviour is, however, not always in line with these assessments. Assessments of honesty show strong evidence of social projection: Participants expect other European citizens to be less honest if they are culturally closer to themselves. Assessments of volunteerism instead show a similar north/south-pattern in which both northern and southern Europeans expect higher performance of northerners than they do of southerners."

One of the challenges is to those who engage in surveillance studies. Three kinds of issues present themselves: One, research disregard: responses to the revelations show a surprising lack of understanding of the large-scale multi-faceted panoply of surveillance that has been constructed over the past 40 years or so that includes but is far from exhausted by state surveillance itself. Two, research deficits: we find that a number of crucial areas require much more research. These include the role of physical conduits including fibre-optic cables within circuits or power, of global networks of security and intelligence professionals, and of the minutiae of everyday social media practices. Three, research direction: the kinds of surveillance that have developed over several decades are heavily dependent on the digital – and, increasingly, on so-called big data -- but also extend beyond it. However, if there is a key issue raised by the Snowden revelations, it is the future of the internet. Information and its central conduits have become an unprecedented arena of political struggle, centred on surveillance and privacy. Those concepts themselves require rethinking.

Write off a significant portion of the official European loans to Greece or, at the very least, stretch out the grace and repayment periods of those loans until the Crack of Doom. There may be an alternative -- persuading the official sector voluntarily to subordinate its credits, on a targeted basis, to new borrowings by Greece from the private markets. If the alternatives for the official sector are to lend the money itself (with the risk that the funds may never be recovered), or to write off their existing Greek loans now as a means of rendering the country presentable to the markets, subordination may be a more politically palatable option."

With only a small part of the assets unencumbered and a government with empty pockets, the depositors might have to take a large part of the burden.

An earlier debt restructuring could hardly have prevented it. (1) However, an earlier debt restructuring would have allowed significantly lower primary surpluses from now on and it would have made the programme more credible. Higher confidence in Greece would have provided more political and financial stability, essential ingredients for growth. Financial contagion was probably an incorrect argument for delaying debt restructuring. Even if it had been right though, it did not change the underlying problem of debt unsustainability. (2) Equally important, the IMF failed to prioritise a strategy for Greece to regain competitiveness. The programme initially made a correct diagnosis of Greece’s major competitiveness problem.  The problem was a result of the pre-crisis Ponzi scheme with ever-increasing deficits financing higher public salaries and rising pensions. However, conditionality on improving the business environment and product markets, augmenting competition and lowering wages through the abolition of the 13th month salary were weak or absent. This made a turn-around of the economy away from a bloated state sector towards a larger export sector impossible. Contrary to Portugal, exports hardly increased in Greece.

europeans,3d07ay,weniger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:24:28 2015 UTC,"Abstract  The present paper is concerned with the issue of local leadership in the countries of East-Central Europe. Concretely, it constitutes an attempt at examining the outlook, i.e. the profile and the role, of the local political elites in East-Central Europe, with a special emphasis on small-to-medium sized communities. The main argument put forward is that the disparities in the outlook and priorities of the local political elites are to be explained through a combination between the different inheritance of the communist ancien régime, at the level of “elite political culture” (Kowitt 1990) and the present challenges imposed by various degrees of decentralization. For the purpose of exemplifying the inquiry into the local political elites of the region and for further exploring the topic on the two dimensions, the paper employs the comparative approach of “quality-based profile” ( Prewitt, 1970) constructed by the members of the Municipal Councils in Tecuci (Romania), Česká Lípa (the Czech Republic), Oleśnica (Poland), and Targovishte (Bulgaria). Hence, the study uses five models of the “ideal portrait” of the local councilor: ethical, pragmatic, technocratic, political, and gender. According to the results of a study applying a standard written questionnaire among the local councilors of the three communities in the period December 2010-February 2013, the paper distinguishes among three corresponding types of local elites: (1) “predominantly elitistic”, (2) “democratic elitist”, and (3) “predominantly democratic”, following two types of explanation accounting for the differences among the four cases: the legacy of the defunct regime and the degree of administrative decentralization."

The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates that northern Sudan houses more than 100,000 Eritrean refugees, but over the years the profile of these migrants has changed. Those escaping the Eritrean war of independence in the 1960s tended to settle in Sudan, some even gaining Sudanese nationality.  In recent years, however, refugees have increasingly been using Sudan as a transit country before moving north - often as part of the diaspora fleeing North Africa to Europe, with all the dangers involved in crossing the Mediterranean.  Eritrea is not an easy country to get out of. So emigrants often fall prey to the shady world of middlemen, brokers and smugglers making easy money out of people desperate to leave.  The documentary explores what continues to drive Eritreans from their own country; the poor conditions they often encounter in refugee camps across the border; and the smuggling and human trafficking surrounding them. We also look at the pressure the Sudanese government and international aid agencies are under in dealing with the problems that arise."

First of all, it is a rejection of the creditors offer that was on the table one week ago. We will see new discussions now. However, it will not be easy to come to substantive discussions of a third programme. To start formal negotiations, the Bundestag and other parliaments have to agree. The political willigness for this has gone down dramatically after the no vote.  Q. Will the new deal be better or worse than the old or will we even see GREXIT?  GW. Grexit is a real possibility. It would be very costly for Greece and for the entire eurozone. But I would not exclude another round of negotiations during which banks remain under capital control. The resulting deal may be slightly more favourable to Greece but I expect creditors to be reluctant as they really feel being held ransom.  Q. What would be the best outcome?  GW. Overall, the best outcome would be a real deal with less austerity but serious reforms in Greece. This is still possible and it would require real leadership in Greece and in other euro area countries. Creditors should understand that generosity is in their interest as Grexit is more costly. But creditors should not compromise on demanding structural reforms. Syriza needs to deliver on providing a transformative programme for Greece that ensures competition, limits corruption and ensures fair taxation"

But think of it this way: we have just witnessed Greece stand up to a truly vile campaign of bullying and intimidation, an attempt to scare the Greek public, not just into accepting creditor demands, but into getting rid of their government. It was a shameful moment in modern European history, and would have set a truly ugly precedent if it had succeeded.  But it didn’t. You don’t have to love Syriza, or believe that they know what they’re doing — it’s not clear that they do, although the troika has been even worse — to believe that European institutions have just been saved from their own worst instincts. If Greece had been forced into line by financial fear mongering, Europe would have sinned in a way that would sully its reputation for generations.

An Oxford-educated economist, Mr Tsakalotos has much in common with the political elite of Westminster, having been educated at St Paul's school, before going on to read politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) as an undergraduate. He later completed his PhD in economics from Oxford in 1989.   Euclid Tsakalotos: Greece's secret weapon in credit negotiations   The hurly burly world of radical left politics could not have been further away. “My grandfather’s cousin was general Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos who led the other side, the wrong side, in the Greek civil war,” he said of the bloody conflict that pitted communists against rightists between 1946-49. “He expressed the fear that I might end up as a liberal, certainly not anything further to the left.” Tsakalotos, who has written six books including The Crucible of Resistance, an analysis of Greece at the forefront of Europe’s economic crisis, embraced the left at Oxford when he joined the student wing of Greece’s euro communist party. What goaded him more than anything else was the treatment of the Greek left – who had led the resistance movement against Nazi occupation – after the second world war. “Greeks have had a lot to resist, civil war, dictatorship, authoritarianism,” he said. “But perhaps the most terrible thing was the unfairness with which the left was treated in the postwar period. We were the only nation where people who had participated in what had been a very important resistance movement were treated like pariahs while those who had collaborated with the Germans had it good. It was just so wrong.” When he moved to Greece, with his Scottish wife in the early 1990s, he signed up with Synaspismos, the party that would become the central plank of Syriza. The anti-globalisation movement convinced him that there was a large segment of society that felt it was not expressed by political elites – one of Syriza’s many mantras. Like many on the Greek left, he believes Athens’ anti-austerity government speaks for the growing numbers across Europe who, subjected to the brutal vagaries of the market, feel excluded from decision-making."

But then he was starting to harbour 'dangerous' thoughts. When I asked him before the vote whether he was prepared to contemplate seizing direct control of the Greek banking system, a restoration of sovereign monetary instruments, Grexit, and a return to the drachma -- if the ECB maintains its liquidity blockade, forcing the country to its knees - he thought for a while and finally answered yes.   ""I am sick of these bigots,"" he said.  His fear was that Greece did not have the technical competence to carry out an orderly exit from EMU, and truth be told, Syriza has already raided every possible source of funds within the reach of the Greek state - bar a secret stash still at the central bank, controlled by Syriza's political foes - and therefore has no emergency reserves to prevent the crisis spinning out of control in the first traumatic weeks.

Paris has struck a dovish tone over months of tortuous talks with Greece, but left the heavy-lifting of negotiations to the institutions representing Athens’s creditors. In recent days, however, France has taken a more active role, according to people familiar with the matter, seeing its vision of the eurozone at risk of a heavy blow if Greece exits the currency bloc.  The French political elite is deeply devoted to the idea of the eurozone as a broader political and economic project, said Shahin Vallée, an economist at the Bruegel think tank who was recently an aide to French economy minister Emmanuel Macron. That idea has never held the same appeal across the Rhine in Germany, where officials have long been suspicious of the costs of eurozone integration; some have argued that cutting Greece loose would strengthen the currency bloc.  “France is very opposed to Greece leaving the euro,” Mr. Vallée said. “In a sense, that’s the final nail in the coffin of the idea France had of the monetary union.”"

europeans,3buya9,weniger,2,Thu Jul 2 10:42:20 2015 UTC,"Abstract  Were the British fated to clash with the European Union? Powerful traditions in British political culture certainly inclined the UK to be an ‘awkward partner’ in Europe. Yet traditions are material from which politics is constructed, not fixed frameworks for destiny. This article argues that a careful historical reconstruction of the development and consolidation of today's British Euroscepticism – with its stronghold on the political right – passes substantially through the distinctive personal influence of Margaret Thatcher. The Iron Lady's individual action and legacy, magnified by a series of contingencies, generated the core dynamics that soured Britain's ties to Europe so bitterly. Had Thatcher not personally inspired this course, the traditions of British national identity and British Conservatism in particular could very plausibly have evolved in less anti-European directions."
europeans,3buya9,Trucidator,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:42:49 2015 UTC,"While this is an interesting article, I think it misses some fundamental points. The UK, differently from almost everywhere else in the EU, does not have an obvious historical motivation for being in the EU. Differently from most of the EU, our experience of WW2 caused us to trust our own institutions more than institutions from overseas. I think Thatcher was simply a consequence of an underlying British uncertainty about the EU rather than a cause of it."

Germany was hit by a very strong shock which was relatively concentrated in the exporting, manufacturing industries. In addition, the German labour market was very resilient during the crisis due to earlier labour market reforms and policy instruments facilitating labour hoarding. As a consequence, public finances were only moderately affected and not many policy reforms had to be enacted. This chapter will present the German experience of the financial crisis. We start by presenting the macroeconomic situation and how the crisis unfolded in Germany, before focusing on the situation of public finances. Finally, we analyse the policy responses to the financial crisis."

The first European Match is an encounter of prominent voices who comment publicly on the continuing conflict in Ukraine from both a Ukrainian and a Russian perspective.

This interesting paper was deposited today: What Greek political elites think about Europe and the crisis? An exploratory analysis   Abstract  In this paper the views of a sample of 74 Greek Members of Parliament (MPs) on European integration and the handling of the economic crisis by the EU are discussed and interpreted. The survey of MPs, which was conducted in 2014, is a replication of a comparable study conducted in 2007. Greek MPs continue to be attached to Europe, but evaluate negatively EU’s institutions’ role during the economic crisis. Overall, three groups of parliamentarians, namely pro-government MPs, parliamentarians self-placed at the centre of the left-right spectrum and more experienced MPs, tended to have more pro-European views and attitudes than MPs of the opposition, left-wing MPs and less experienced MPs. The dominant dimension of conflict for Greek political elites is the issue of the Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs). The SYRIZA-ANEL government that was formed after the January 2015 elections was not a surprise given the close proximity of these two parties on their stance towards the MoUs and the EU."

Setting Greece from 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012.  Participants A total of 11 505 suicides, 9079 by men and 2426 by women, occurring in Greece over the study period.  Primary and secondary outcomes National data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority assembled as 360 monthly counts of: all suicides, male suicides, female suicides and all suicides plus potentially misclassified suicides.  Results In 30 years, the highest months of suicide in Greece occurred in 2012. The passage of new austerity measures in June 2011 marked the beginning of significant, abrupt and sustained increases in total suicides (+35.7%, p<0.001) and male suicides (+18.5%, p<0.01). Sensitivity analyses that figured in undercounting of suicides also found a significant, abrupt and sustained increase in June 2011 (+20.5%, p<0.001). Suicides by men in Greece also underwent a significant, abrupt and sustained increase in October 2008 when the Greek recession began (+13.1%, p<0.01), and an abrupt but temporary increase in April 2012 following a public suicide committed in response to austerity conditions (+29.7%, p<0.05). Suicides by women in Greece also underwent an abrupt and sustained increase in May 2011 following austerity-related events (+35.8%, p<0.05). One prosperity-related event, the January 2002 launch of the Euro in Greece, marked an abrupt but temporary decrease in male suicides (−27.1%, p<0.05).  Conclusions This is the first multidecade, national analysis of suicide in Greece using monthly data. Select austerity-related events in Greece corresponded to statistically significant increases for suicides overall, as well as for suicides among men and women. The consideration of future austerity measures should give greater weight to the unintended mental health consequences that may follow and the public messaging of these policies and related events."

First is the “Myth of the Beggar”: it is believed that supranational solidarity is self-defeating, as it produces a moral-hazard scheme where endogenous incentives to reform (otherwise known as “market pressure”) are artificially removed. Second stands the “Myth of the Efficient Markets”: it is believed that solidarity, through its market-distortive effects, artificially allocates resources into less productive activities, thus decreasing the overall growth rate of the economy. Third is the “Myth of the Demos”: it is believed that democracy -- and thus redistribution -- can endure only within a single Demos, and thus no solidarity can exist outside of a Demos. As for any legend, there lays some truth in the three myths of supranational solidarity. Nonetheless, this paper aims to challenge the view that any scheme of solidarity is self-defeating, inefficient and illegitimate. The first section discusses under which conditions a solidarity scheme does not fall into a moral-hazard trap. The second section deals with the efficient market hypothesis, showing that -- if the moral-hazard issue is dealt with -- it would be inefficient for markets not to finance the economy in distress, regardless of the existence of a solidarity scheme. The third section deals with the issue of legitimacy outside the Demos. We found that, despite its highly disputed nature, this problem constitutes the most challenging issue for a working solidarity scheme, because it calls into question the philosophical foundations of democracy and the personal beliefs of individuals concerning what a demos is about. The paper argues that, while particular institutional arrangements may deal with the weak form of the no-demos thesis, no solidarity scheme can be introduced if we stick to the strong version of the thesis. In the conclusive section the findings of the previous parts are brought together to define a comprehensive set of conditions required to have a sustainable, effective and legitimate solidarity arrangement in the EMU."

But if the Greek account is right, what happened at that moment was the psychological breakpoint of the Euro.  The political willpower had already ebbed. The Greeks haggled over the fiscal details all week but were minded to sign an €8bn austerity package if it could be sold as (a) redistributional and (b) accompanied by a promise to discuss restructuring the debt.  What changed? By Thursday morning it was the lenders’ document that was the basis of discussions with the Greeks allowed to propose amendments. But when the elected ministers of the Eurogroup saw what the EC, IMF and ECB had proposed they rowed back.  “We can’t get this through our own parliaments” they said: it’s too soft.   On the broader dilemma for the EU:   So bleak has Europe become, so lacking in solidarity, that an agreement worked on for weeks, embodying further austerity for the Greeks and further financial solidarity by the rest, could not pass through either side.  It was this that led to what Greeks call the “rupture”. The currency arrangements of Europe no longer fit the democratic wishes of its people.  And it is not the only breakdown of solidarity. The Schengen agreement on free movement is breaking down as the European powers refuse to absorb the refugees arriving in Greece and Spain.   Also interesting stuff about how the lack of credible media will make the referendum campaign, as short as it will be, ""a battle of rumour, emotion, mass rallies and iconic speeches"".

So why is it that ISIL spare some lives over others?  ""The only thing I know for a fact is what the French President told me when I arrived in Paris right after my release"", says former IS hostage Nicolas Henin.

He spent a week handcuffed together with American reporter James Foley. So why was it that Henin's life was spared while the likes of Foley were murdered on camera? Journalist Rukmini Callimachi has investigated the paper-trail leading from European countries towards the middle-east, and has found that many European governments routinely negotiate the payment of multi-million dollar ransoms to Islamist hostage-takers, even if indirectly, while British and American governments will not pay. ""A European government would send the money and disguise it as a humanitarian payment"", Callimachi explains. ""then officials in the country would then pass it on.""

In particular, I underestimated the extent of political incompetence – not just of the Greek government but even more so of its creditors.   Specifically:   The three institutions opposed debt restructuring in 2010 when the crisis still could have been resolved at low cost. They continued to resist it in 2015, when a debt write-down was the obvious concession to Mr Tsipras & Company. The cost would have been small. Pretending instead that Greece’s debts could be repaid hardly enhanced their credibility.  Instead, the creditors first calculated the size of the primary budget surpluses that Greece would have to run in order to hypothetically repay its debt. They then required the government to raise taxes and cut spending sufficiently to produce those surpluses.  They ignored the fact that, in so doing, they consigned the country to an even deeper depression."

You had a clear narrative with at least a theoretically enticing vision of social justice or national superiority, one strong enough to fend off the seductions of liberal democracy and capitalism. Anyone who disagreed could be isolated, silenced, and suppressed.  Those were the halcyon days of what the Chinese call “thought work”—and Soviets called the “engineering of human souls”.

The problem now comes down to moral hazard. Greece wants to have the benefits of a de-facto default without the consequences. Given the current circumstances, the creditors are hardly likely to want to encourage that.  Even if Greece cannot be expelled from the Euro (it has to be a mutually agreed withdrawal), the ECB is not obligated to finance them indefinitely Greece can keep using Euros forever, but it cannot print more.

The Logic, Urgency and Promise of Tackling Climate Change Professor Nicholas Stern will argue that the transition to a low-carbon economy and rapid structural transformations to the world economy provide a story of growth and poverty reduction that is attractive and sustainable.  Stern argues that the risks and costs of climate change are worse than estimated in the landmark Stern Review in 2006—and far worse than implied by standard economic models. He reminds us that we have a choice. We can rely on past technologies, methods, and institutions—or we can embrace change, innovation, and international collaboration. The first might bring us some short-term growth but would lead eventually to chaos, conflict, and destruction. The second could bring about better lives for all and growth that is sustainable over the long term, and help win the battle against worldwide poverty.

It's a decision for another case which, according the author and others, might create a precedent. One doesn't always has to be directly involved to be affected. This is explained in the article.   But I first had to share one particular little nugget: the Court has (implicitly!) decided that Israel is not the occupying power in Gaza. How so, you ask? Both cases dealt with applications by persons displaced by the conflict who are not able to access their property in the affected areas. The Sargsyan case in particular dealt with the the denial of the applicant’s right to return to the village of Gulistan. The village is located on the territory of Azerbaijan, but very close or on the so-called line of contact between Azerbaijan and the forces of the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh republic. Thus, in the view of the Azerbaijani government, the village was not under the control of Azerbaijan, and was moreover mined and inaccessible to any civilian.   How this matter is dealt with from a legal perspective is of huge significance for all parties involved. It's not only Israelis that claim Gaza is not under occupation. A Hamas co-founder and leader said the same in a Palestinian news agency.   But in comments to Ma'an late Monday, senior Hamas official in Gaza Zahhar stressed the situation in the Gaza Strip is different to the occupied West Bank.  ""Against whom could we demonstrate in the Gaza Strip? When Gaza was occupied, that model was applicable,"" Zahhar said.   Is Gaza blocked, externally? Yes. Are ordinary people living there suffering? Yes and the same is true for some of their neighbours. Is this territory occupied? According to the UN, yes. According to others the debate is ongoing and every single development could shift the balance.  The comments shed light to different arguments about the cases. In response to different commentators, the author wrote:   The legal proposition was categorical and not particularly fact-dependent. It may well be wrong – some good arguments (and some bad) have been made in that regard. But ultimately that’s neither here nor there. The point of my post was simply that the Court’s holding on occupation – correct or not – has clear implications for the Gaza dispute, and will inevitably used as an instrument in that dispute, which is not (I think) something that the Court really would have wanted.   So he doesn't claim that Israelis or Palestinians are legally or morally right or wrong. He merely attempts to explain, from his point of view, the implications of cases which are seeming unrelated, at least for people which are not legal experts."

In archival footage of an interview with Escher, the artist says that Jessurun de Mesquita asked him, “Wouldn’t you rather be a graphic artist instead of an architect?” Escher admits, “I wasn’t all that interested in architecture.” There is a balance of stock footage of the period, interviews with the artist himself, and long, lingering shots of his work. The “last images” of Escher, the narrator says, “are not gloomy. We see an artist in his studio, doing the things he enjoys,” a man “proud of his success.” At the end of his life, he still honored his teacher, de Mesquita, and the South Italian coast that sheltered him during his formative years."

europeans,3auqrs,weniger,2,Tue Jun 23 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Abstract  This article focuses on digital surveillance ideology by examining specific empirical examples drawn from media reports of the Snowden affair, in order to nuance the politics, ethics, values and affects mobilized by governments and corporate elites to justify the collect-it-all practices by a ménage à trois of “trusted” global networks. It charts this political space as a sphere of action emerging against the backdrop of what we call ‘quasi-totalitarian’ mechanisms, which are fostered by alignment, collusion and imbrication of the three trusted authoritative networks. This approach accounts for a particular vexing problem in the articulation of digital politics. That is, the process of political disenfranchisement by corporations looking to profit, governments looking to regulate information flows, and co-opted groups in civil society looking to appropriate the legitimate concerns of users for their own political and financial subsistence. The distinct features of this quasi-totalitarianism include a. the monopoly of digital planning on surveillance resting on back-channel and secret communication between government, tech corporate elites and, sometimes, NGOs; b. the role of civil society NGOs as mechanisms for circumventing democratic processes c. enterprise association politics that ensures that the dual goal of state (security) and capital (profit) continues unabated and unaccounted; d. the unprecedented scope in the form of total structural data acquisition by western intelligence matrices; e. the persecution and prosecution of journalists, whistle-blowers and transparency actors outside the scope of civil society groups and f. the significant if insufficient contestation by members of the public concerning the infringement on civil liberties.    An excerpt:   The totalitarian principle is this: the state exerts total control over its members. This does not mean merely performative control, but also cognitive control, both the doings and thoughts of citizens are determined by the state power. The term, coined by Carl Schmitt in The Concept of the Political corresponds to a state which embracing every domain of social life ultimately results in the indistinguishability of state and society. In such a state, according to Schmitt everything is in principle political. The interpenetration of state and society --the hyperpolitization of the social-- is the most salient characteristic of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is not merely authoritarianism in which the power is exerted from above the social fabric. In this regard, Schmitt points out that ‘a state standing above society could be call ed universal but not total’.   The mutual permeability of the political and the social means that in totalitarianism the motus politicus tends to become --never fully is, though-- indistinguishable from the motus socialis. The individual members of society become agents of the political demands of the state and the state becomes the space for promoting the social demands of the collective of individuals. Importantly, this correlates to the occupation of private space that in all forms of totalitarianism is submitted to political and collective scrutiny.   In this regard, the current alignment of trusted networks and acquiescing subjects bears the hallmarks of the totalitarian inter-permeability of political and social agency. On the grounds of foretelling putative terrorist or criminal activity by organizations or individuals, forecasting market practices or modifying socio-cultural practices by changing the underpinning attitudes, governments, corporations and civil society actors collude in explicit and implicit normalization of the moral valuation of transparency."

However, a small, but growing, literature on the administration of the European Parliament (EP) indicates that officials play a role in the policy process that goes beyond technical and procedural questions. On this background, this article therefore aims at, first, finding out who the people working in the EP secretariat and group secretariats are, and, second, investigating whether it matters who these people are. Based on an online survey, we unveil the bureaucrats’ nationality, gender, educational background and former and future career (plans). However, none of the background factors display statistically significant (controlled) associations with staff decision behaviour. Thus, individual processes of pre-socialization outside the EP is not a significant explanation of staff decision behaviour. What matters is whether officials are employed by the EP secretariat or by the political groups (‘organizational affiliation’) and their length of service in EU institutions (‘organizational re-socialization’). It is argued that demography may still play a symbolic role."

europeans,3adytz,select1on,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"Abstract     Uber’s arrival in Europe has generated massive demonstrations by taxi drivers and a number of court judgments banning or restricting Uber’s services on the ground that the company engaged in “unfair competition”. Uber and other online-enabled car transportation services to connect passengers with drivers offer an attractive alternative to regular taxi services. The difficulty is that these services are protected by regulatory measures that create significant barriers to entry. Uber’s business model presents many efficiencies and there is little doubt that it will prevail over time. Regulatory authorities thus face two options. One option is to resist the market entry of Uber and other similar companies. This approach would deprive users of attractive services and trigger many years of litigation. The other option is to embrace technological change and allow Uber to compete on a level playing field with taxi companies. The regulatory changes that will be needed raise complex questions, but these questions are unavoidable and it is important to tackle them early. Taxi companies can also embrace technologies and rely on the competing online-enabled car transportation services platforms that are already available to them."

Letter From Luxembourg: Luxembourg has learned to defend its own interests in a Europe that increasingly looks like a free-for-all. But it does so with more restraint than others.    Letter From Sofia The Bulgarian government aims to boost the country’s image in the EU. That is a commendable objective, but does Sofia have the necessary resources to meet it?    Letter From Tallinn:  Estonia’s foreign policy ignores domestic vulnerabilities and lacks regional depth. As a result, the country is too reliant on the goodwill and commitment of others.     Letter From Athens:  Greek foreign policy looks much more ambitious today than in recent years. But Athens needs to quickly readjust to a changing security and economic environment.    Letter From Ljubljana: Slovenia has hardly any ambition in foreign policy, and the country’s contribution to joint EU policymaking is minimal.     Letter From London: There is evidence of decisiveness and clarity in the UK’s foreign policy outlook. But there is also ambivalence, partly explained by preelection domestic politics.      Letter From Brussels: Belgium is a firm believer in a more integrated EU foreign and security policy. But the country sometimes lacks the clarity and drive to put that belief into practice.      Letter From Vienna: Austria has high foreign policy ambitions, but when it comes to concrete engagement in conflicts, Vienna keeps a low profile and prefers to sit on the sidelines.      Letter From Vilnius:  Lithuania puts more emphasis on upholding European values than some countries at the heart of the EU. This is not just idealism, it is a matter of hardheaded interests.    Letter From Lisbon: For a relatively small geopolitical player, Portugal has a surprisingly ambitious foreign policy. A key theme in that policy is the country’s strategic geographic location.      Letter From Stockholm:The Swedish government that entered office in late 2014 has a bold foreign policy agenda, continuing the country’s traditionally high level of international ambition.   Letter From Bratislava:  Slovakia succeeds in many aspects of foreign and security policy, but the way in which it does so is patchy and complacent. Bratislava needs a more strategic approach.    Letter From Paris: Although France’s economic standing has been decreasing in recent years, that has not affected the country’s foreign policy ambitions, which remain consistently high.     Letter From Valletta: Malta’s small size prevents it from coming up with major foreign policy initiatives, but it is nevertheless keen to promote peace and stability in the Mediterranean.      Letter From Copenhagen:  Denmark pursues an active foreign policy at both the European and the international level, helping develop joint EU approaches and contributing to military interventions.    Letter From Madrid: Spain has faced daunting political and economic challenges that have limited its ability to contribute to EU foreign policy. Will that situation change anytime soon?       Letter From Prague: Despite its export-driven economy, the Czech Republic has a low level of foreign policy ambition. In fact, foreign policy has never been a priority for any Czech government.      Letter From Dublin: Despite two major institutional constraints, Irish foreign policy has ambition. Ireland may lack capacity, confidence, and, occasionally, resolve—but the drive is there.

europeans,3a57oo,weniger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:14:52 2015 UTC,"Abstract  Nations now have unprecedented capacity to spy on global communication, and yet they typically acknowledge no legal restrictions on their right to surveil non-citizens outside their borders. Moreover, incidental collection and inter-governmental cooperation give people little protection against surveillance by their own governments as well.   There is growing support for plugging these loopholes by a multilateral agreement that would establish internationally applicable safeguards. The present paper concludes that such an agreement, far from strengthening global privacy protection, would almost certainly weaken it. Even among Western democracies, the search for transnational common ground and the institutional priorities of the negotiators would be inimical to a privacy-protective accord. Paradoxically, privacy will be better served by leaving all nations free to go their own way. Political and economic dynamics render needed reforms more likely through U.S. domestic law than through international agreements, and such reforms would benefit not only Americans but also the world at large."

Here the Greek objection is not to private or foreign management of certain assets but rather against letting them go for cheap, or without conditions, or without retaining an equity stake. Thus in the ongoing privatization of the port of Piraeus to the Chinese firm Cosco, the government has insisted on an investment plan and on labor rights.

The supranational federation should be constructed in such a way that the heterarchical relationship between the member states and the federation remains intact. The author finds the basis for such an order in the idea of the EU constituted by a “doubled” sovereign – the European citizens and the European peoples (the states). In order to sustain such an order reforms of the existing European treaties are needed. It is necessary to eliminate the legitimation deficits of the European Union in a future Euro-Union – that is, a more closely integrated core Europe. The European Parliament would have to gain the right to take legislative initiatives, and the so-called “ordinary legislative procedure,” which requires the approval of both chambers, would have to be extended to all policy fields."

In order to understand how and why the EU has responded to these conflicts, we initially present an overview of all conflicts among and between the neighbours’ neighbours, broken down first by sub-region and then by conflict type. We then discuss the EU's responses to these conflicts and offer a comparative analysis, with a view to describing and explaining existing variation in terms of the EU's responses and their impact. We find that the Union's response is most in line with a human security approach in relation to those conflicts where it perceives to have the greatest interests at stake.

Shifting mortality and fertility schedules can lead to different steady-state income levels, with long periods of growth during the transition. Incomes between 1300 and 1800 rose because of two related but distinct European “inventions” - a peculiar marriage pattern and a specific mortality regime. Europe checked downward pressures on wages through late marriage, which reduced fertility, and a mortality regime that combined high death rates with high incomes. The speaker and his research group argue that both emerged as a result of the Black Death interacting with economic, social and political factors. In the ultimate analysis, it was not better institutions or more inventions that determined Europe’s economic edge; it was war, death, and (fewer) children."

europeans,394y7a,weniger,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:59:35 2015 UTC,"Abstract  This report analyses how the British discourse on Europe has evolved over the past forty years. Prime Minister David Cameron’s commitment to hold a referendum on European Union membership until 2017 was a major political milestone. The report therefore examines the changes and continuities in this discourse over three key periods: the 1975 referendum on the UK’s continued membership of the European Economic Community, the 1992-3 debates on ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the 2013 proto-referendum debates. Using a poststructuralist discourse-analytical approach, I analyse how political and media voices seek to delineate a British sense of self from a Continental other. I also address the rising prominence of immigration issues within the British discourse on Europe.  I found that issues of sovereignty and democracy were a consistent feature across the three periods under analysis, with Eurosceptics seeking to frame the EU and what came before it as anti-democratic and a threat to British sovereignty. The consistent divide between a British self and Continental other over the forty years under analysis has been strongly reinforced by the increasing prominence of anti-immigration rhetoric within the discourse. Overall, I note that the impact of the Eurosceptics’ discursive campaign will have a significant impact.     Excerpt from the conclusion (p. 104)  There are three important continuities to highlight: first, the persistence of Sovereignty and Democracy as a major theme in the discourse; second, the similar constancy of presence of economic issues; and third, the continuity of the discourse’s tone, which is run through with references to threat and danger. The persistence of debates on issues of sovereignty and democracy are, at one level, understandable given the nature of EEC/EU membership. The UK is not the only country to have Eurosceptic voices raising concerns about issues of sovereignty and democratic deficit. But when the political and media discourse consistently includes strong-to-dominant voices that frame the EU as an anti-democratic, unelected Continental other, this affects both people’s opinions about Europe and politicians’ bandwidth of possible choices, to paraphrase Neumann (2008: 62). This shows how the discourse ‘worked’ so that David Cameron was gradually forced into making the referendum commitment.   The consistent salience of economic issues is also interesting, if not surprising given their status as the starting point and main focus of the European integration process. One point it throws up reinforces the notion that discourse is produced within — and affects — a context. The context for all three of the peaks in the discourse here involved a recession. There ensued in each case a battle for truth regarding whether European membership was the root cause of the problem or a necessary part of the solution.   Finally, the continuity of tone is very important. The negative dominates the positive across all three periods of analysis, both on the pro-Europe side and, to an even greater extent, on the Eurosceptic side. Historical allusions of invasion, worries about loss of sovereignty and implicit and explicit threats to national identity and the self (both individual and collective) feature throughout the three periods. Again, these concerns feature in other countries too (see in particular Spiering 2002). Huysmans and Buonfino (2008: 766), when analysing the British discourse on migration and security, speak of ‘a politics of unease’ which I would argue permeates the broader discourse on Europe as well.   There are three key changes over the period of analysis to highlight. The first is that immigration has gone from being almost entirely absent from the discourse in 1975, to a minor issue in 1992-3, to a major theme in 2013. The second change is a shift from the Labour party being the most divided political party on the European issue in 1975 to the Conservatives being the most divided in 1992-3 and 2013. The third change is that the newspapers’ editorial stance has become markedly more Eurosceptic over the forty years under analysis.   With regard to the growth in pertinence of immigration, there are two plausible analyses. The first is that each of the three periods analysed has an ‘issue of the day’ that is informed by the context of the period and forms a major theme in the discourse. In 1975, this was Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, in 1992-3 it was Centralisation, Federalisation and Subsidiarity and in 2013 it was Immigration. Under this analysis, a new issue may well crop up in the future and take over immigration’s prominent place in the discourse. However, my view is that a second scenario is more likely. The immigration debates have deep roots in the negative tone of the discourse mentioned above. Forty years of threats to national identity, fears of British democracy at risk and so on , have provided fertile ground in which EU-inspired anti-immigration rhetoric has taken root. A number of scholars have spoken of the securitisation of migration in Europe (see Buonfino 2004; Huysmans 2006) and such securitising moves are more easily accomplished in a discursive context where threats and fears have been present for many years. This is a less optimistic take on the issue, and whilst it is somewhat difficult to make firm predictions about how the discourse will evolve, I believe it is reasonable to assert that immigration will continue to form a major element of the European discourse for the foreseeable future.   The second change — the location of party divisions — requires less analysis, in that whilst the Labour party continues to have a number of Eurosceptic MPs, it is now much less divided than the Conservatives. This can in part be explained by Labour’s move towards the centre ground during the 1980s and 1990s (see Daniels 1998), whilst many Conservatives followed Margaret Thatcher in her journey from pro-European to becoming the mother of Euroscepticism (see Lynch & Whitaker 2013). These divisions have obviously had an effect in helping push David Cameron into his referendum commitment and might, as detailed below, have an effect on a referendum campaign. The third change, with newspapers like The Times moving from a pro-Europe to Eurosceptic position, means that Euroscepticism has a markedly more dominant position in the discourse than previously. This is in part down to the Eurosceptic views of newspaper owners like Rupert Murdoch (see Anderson 2004), but I would argue that there are also more complex processes of mutual constitution between popular opinion and the discourse of politicians and the media at work here. Daddow (2012) has described this as a move in the media from ‘permissive consensus’ to ‘destructive dissent’ concerning European integration over this period: the over 220 editorials analysed as part of this study would align with Daddow’s description. The strengthened position of Euroscepticism within the media discourse would also have implications in a referendum campaign.

Islam, as both a religion and a state, supported the attitudes that characterise capitalist endeavour through political and institutional developments. Financial incentives and institutions to support entrepreneurs reinforced Mohammed’s precept that trade should be fair and competitive. European Christians, in contact with the Islamic world through trade networks, gained access to monetary reform, new arithmetical techniques, corporate and trust structures, legal frameworks for protection of property and institutions for training business skills. These models were later replicated in Venice and Genoa.  A Global Transition: From the Mediterranean to the Atlantic  by David Abulafia  Abulafia argues that the new set of economic relationships created by the transformative catastrophe of the Black Death were responsible for the remarkable developments in trade and banking in late medieval and Renaissance economies. The trade networks of the Florentine families within this context provided the platform for the expansion of banking, epitomised by the activities of the Bardi, Peruzzi and Acciaiuoli families, who were larger, though less famous, than the Medici. Abulafia demonstrates, using the example of sugar—in great demand after the Black Death—how these conditions anticipated the launch of great Atlantic business enterprises.  The Changing Axis of Economic Power in the Early Modern Period  by Victoria Bateman  Bateman explores the economic conditions in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution, when Europe, more specifically the Netherlands and England, challenged the economic dominance of the East for the first time. She explains how this change coincided with the “first feminist wave”, a further corollary to the transformative catastrophe of the Black Death. Bateman explains Mokyr’s Enlightenment theory— a conversion in mindset to an open and cooperative scientific enquiry provoked and sanctioned advancement both technological and individual—and links this to continued high wages in the aftermath of the Black Death, necessitating a level of efficiency that could not be found in the workforce.   Making Money, Making Empires: The Case of the East India Company  by Huw Bowen  Bowen analyses interconnected developments in England in the seventeenth century which had profound effects of the global economy: swift European expansion through plantation settlements and the establishment of colonies; emergence of joint stock companies that facilitated this aggressive colonialism and commercialism; and the creation of monopolies granted to trade overseas. The East India Company combined all these factors, and illustrates the emergence, transformation and consolidation of commercial power into an imperial agency, and eventually into an armed force. Bowen concludes that while the EIC was a precursor to the modern firm with corporate goals, it gave full rein to its employees’ private enterprise. What was a monopoly on paper was, in fact, a rampant and extensive range of private enterprises across a territorial and maritime empire.   Industrialisation: Why Britain Got There First  by Nicholas Crafts  Contrary to popular myth, Britain’s first industrial “revolution” was one of very modest growth performance, especially compared to modern rates. Furthermore, steam power, far from being responsible for the increase in productivity in the eighteenth century, would not have a dramatic impact until 1850. Crafts argued that the combination of high wages, cheap capital and coal, along with the “great synergy” of the Enlightenment, offers the most plausible explanation as to why Britain became the world leader in industry. More than any other economy, it was able to take advantage of its endowment of human and physical resources, and had adaptable institutions, as well as already being one of the richest countries in the world by the eighteenth century."

While largely sharing his interpretation of the overall structural trends giving rise to the populist challenges in Western Europe, the article is critical of the static character of his assessment. It suggests that there are three forms of ‘protest populism’, all of which may eventually end up transforming the West European party systems in the name of the new structuring conflicts that characterise contemporary European societies.

First, they confront us with epistemological problems and are hard to understand. Second, there is a large demand for knowledge about what they mean, a powerful political economy that generates a lot of statements about social media, including substantial amounts of bullshit. Given the rapid development of social media and their growing importance, this is unlikely to change in the near future.

Are current sovereign debt levels unsustainable?  How can these be addressed while maintaining the support of national populations, and who should bear the burden?

Satie was famously eccentric - he replaced traditional musical directions like 'ralentando' and 'fortissimo' with instructions to the musician such as, 'While watching oneself approach' and 'like a nightingale with a toothache' and in order to save time deciding what to wear every day, he bought seven, identical, yellow, corduroy suits - one for every day of the week.  Satie's radical new approach to music was initially dismissed by the musical establishment, but he was to prove a highly influential force in the new French music of Debussy, Ravel and anticipated 20th century minimalism.  As Alistair talks to Satie biographers and musicians, he uncovers the story of Satie's one and only love affair, with the artist Suzanne Valadon. Their affair lasted only six months, but years later, after Satie's death, bundles of unsent letters to Suzanne were discovered in Satie's apartment.

It only escapes social rejection because the culture around alcohol pre-dates even the rule of law.    Whilst what you say is partly true, Cannabis (or more accurately, hemp) has been a massive part of British history and culture from the 16th century and onwards. The British navy for instance required hemp for the vast majority of its cordage. In 1563, Queen Elizabeth I decreed that all landowners with sixty acres or more had to grow hemp, and by the nineteenth century, the British government wanted to encourage hemp-growing in her colonial possessions as well.   My major take home fact from it was that alcohol is such an ancient tradition* that subsequent human activities like law and civilisation have to exist in the arena they were created in, of which alcohol and social drinking were already a part.   The same can be said of smoking cannabis though (hemp and cannabis cultivation sites have been discovered dating back to 8,000+ BCE).   Cannabis prohibition in Britain itself only came about as a result of international drug treaties. The first of these, the Hague Anti-Opium Convention, was signed in 1912, and went into effect in 1919. Prior to this there was no control over Cannabis as a recreational drug.  The reason that IMO society saw alcohol as different is that alcohol sanitises water. It creates clean water for people to drink, the only side effect is the getting drunk part. Its not just the fact that beer is really really old. Its the fact that beer is a really really old water sanitiser. Its also the reason that animals evolved to be able to cope with alcohol in their system, it is after-all poisonous.  Edit: Maybe we Brits know too much about beer and its history."

But if we turn to his examination of the so-called 'princely' virtues, especially clemency and liberality, we encounter a very different argument.

The second section explains why China has been so supportive. Beijing wants to move away from dollar hegemony and thus it favours a tripolar monetary system based on the US dollar, the euro and the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). With this in mind, China has continued to diversify its foreign reserves in euros, making it ‘too big to fail’. Finally, the third part focuses on how, by the end of 2011, China switched to a more cautious approach due to the difficulty involved in rescuing the Eurozone. The unwillingness of Europe’s leaders to enter a strategic bargaining process has convinced policymakers in Beijing of the wisdom of keeping a lower profile while making sure the euro’s value remains stable."

When asked what they understand a bank to be, most people describe an institution that accepts deposits and makes loans -- what we generally understand as a ‘retail’ bank. However, the banks at the centre of our global financial system are utterly different. Entities such as JP Morgan Chase, UBS or Deutsche Bank do a great deal more than take deposits and grant loans. Banks have changed from a relatively local institution working in the client’s interests, to a far more complex organisation that is intent on maximising profits and the number of products it can sell to customers. The implications of these changes are profound, especially if we think of the economic consequences of the allocation of much of our most talented human capital away from high value-added roles in the real economy to the banking sector. This paper will seek to explore the full dimensions of this transformation and analyse why it matters for how we think about banks today, and the regulations we pass to govern them."

Here it is: Conscious brain-to-brain communication in humans using non-invasive technologies   Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues."

Almost 60 percent of eligible voters stayed away. Turnout throughout Europe was therefore lower than ever before in European Union history. An analysis of the figures for the 28 EU Member States shows that turnout was particularly low in countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which did not join the EU until 2004 and 2013 in the course of the eastern EU enlargement.  The purpose of this case study is to investigate the underlying reasons for this low turnout in five of the new Member States. Some recommendations for action on how turnout could be increased in new Member States will then be derived from the findings. The following countries were selected for the study to serve as examples: Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Besides country-specific reasons, common phenomena are identified as well. In addition to pursuing conventional explanatory models, the following questions also need to be answered: Why is turnout in the above-mentioned countries so low? Does the low turnout reflect a lack in support for the European Project? Or do many voters stay away from the polls because they are satisfied with the status quo? How can politicians, national political parties, the EU and civil societies counter the trend of declining turnout? What recommendations for action can be derived from the answers to these questions?  Experts from the countries under investigation were questioned to identify reasons for the low turnout besides the usual explanatory approaches (normalisation thesis, representation thesis, individualisation thesis, post-democracy thesis). These interviews provided detailed insights into the respective countries, in turn providing indications of common causes, which then provided a basis for recommendations for action."
europeans,373007,Naurgul,2,Sun May 24 11:39:14 2015 UTC,"Abstract  During the Great Recession and its aftermath, the economic performance of Greece and Germany diverged sharply with persistent high unemployment in Greece and low unemployment in Germany. A common explanation for this divergence is the assumption of an unsustainable level of debt in Greece in the years after the formation of the Eurozone while Germany maintained fiscal discipline. This paper reviews the experience of Greece and Germany since the creation of the Eurozone. The review points to the importance of monetary factors, especially the intensification of the recession in Greece starting in 2011 derived from the price-specie flow mechanism described by David Hume.  Concluding comment  The Eurozone economy has started to recover. The ECB’s policy of quantitative easing will encourage recovery and, if sustained, return inflation to the 2 percent target. Those events will encourage the demand for Greek exports and lessen the need for deflation. However, the Greek economy is effectively “euroized.” It is likely that it will have to continue deflation for many years. Only a national commitment to free markets that facilitates entry and exit will promote the investment from abroad and the internal competitiveness capable of lessening the need for terms-of-trade devaluation achieved through deflation. Spain and Ireland have opened up their economies to a significant degree and they are experiencing strong export growth and strong economic recoveries. It is possible that their example will encourage a similar national consensus for reform in Greece.    On the last point I wonder if creditors expect Greece to be competitive when Bulgaria, also an EU member, is a stone's throw away and its tax rates are significantly lower. Investors are not charities. Multinationals are based in Ireland and Luxembourg for a reason."

This article reflects on the protection of territorial integrity in the Ukrainian constitution, and especially within its provision of unamendability, against the backdrop of the 2014 Crimean crisis. It investigates the aims and limits of territorial integrity as an unamendable principle in the face of a double threat: internal in the form of a secessionist movement and external in the shape of forceful annexation of territory. The article argues that the preservative promise of unamendable territorial integrity is severely curtailed by this double vulnerability, even when backed by a constitutional court with far-reaching powers of judicial review. The article concludes that the uncertainty surrounding territorial change in constitutional law and theory is not alleviated by unamendable protections of territorial integrity."

All these reports that I was abused, that I was called names, that I was called a time-waster and all that: Let me say that I deny this with every fiber of my body.” (He says he taped the meeting but cannot release the tape because of confidentiality rules.)

While there are several measures of countries interconnectedness presented in the literature, none of them is asymmetric or time-varying. We propose a new measure, so called ""Eurovisionness"" or ESC-measure, which overcomes these drawbacks and incorporates different dimensions of the interactions (geographical, cultural, political, and economic). This measure is based on the point distribution across countries within the Eurovision Song Contest (Eurovision). Based on the Eurovision voting patterns we build a measure of country’s relative position in the network. Our results show that after controlling for conventional explanatory variables of GDP there is a significant positive impact of country interconnectedness measured via the Eurovisionness on the GDP growth rate.

In the fast moving debate, where “old” governmental powers clash with corporate players and new actors gaining in influence, we are witnessing a significant increase in the number of European-led actions and initiatives. Specifically, the EU puts a pronounced emphasis on internet governance in its “digital agenda”. As a result, the European parliament, the European Commission and other institutions are increasingly seen as an emerging actor in this policy field.  The increased international engagement of EU institutions calls for expanding our understanding of the role Europe plays in the international internet governance debate, and why it matters, if at all. Moreover, the question of whether a consistent and unitary European internet governance agenda is possible, remains. Given the complexity of internal decision making structures, and the politicised and cross-cutting character of internet governance, the EU is not short on challenges. It will grapple with these in order to enhance its legitimacy and produce tangible outcomes that may be translated into rights-based deliverables.  The panel scrutinises the role of the EU in international negotiations over internet governance, with an emphasis on two issues: cyber security and, data protection/privacy. Particularly, the focus will be on exploring tangible outcomes so far obtained by EU initiatives, as well as future perspectives, while addressing the major obstacles that EU institutions will face in order to enhance their legitimacy and to lead a consistent agenda.  The panel will answer the following key questions:   Where do we find Europe in the fast developing global internet governance?

At a time when the EU is still preoccupied with recovery from the economic crisis, and is facing geopolitical challenges and a number of conflicts, why should it see the importance of continuing to offer leadership in the field of climate change?

The single biggest concern is the ability to exit a failing opportunity. After all, putting some money into a high risk investment but being able to withdraw it before it is completely lost limits the ""down-side"" and makes the investment much more interesting.  The challenge has always been how to limit the downside when there can be currency issues, there can be problems liquidating investments in a timely manner and lastly whether you can actually shift money out of the country before it can be taken from you.  It is one thing to declare overseas assets and possibly see a future government attempting to seize them, or at least pressure you until they are surrendered.

Excerpt:   World military spending, while falling for the third year in a row, has levelled off as reductions in the United States and Western Europe were largely matched by increases in Asia and Oceania, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. Spending in Latin America was virtually level.  US military spending fell by 6.5 per cent as part of ongoing budget deficit reduction measures; spending has now fallen by 20 per cent since its peak in 2010. However, current US military spending is still 45 per cent higher than in 2001, just before the 11 September terrorist attacks on the USA.  The next three highest spenders—China, Russia and Saudi Arabia—have all substantially increased their military expenditures, with Saudi Arabia’s increase of 17 per cent making it the largest increase of any of the top 15 spenders worldwide.   What about Europe?   The conflict in Ukraine is prompting many European countries near Russia, in Central Europe, the Baltics and the Nordic countries, to increase military spending, often revising previous plans and reversing falling trends. However, there is less sign of a similar trend in the rest of Western Europe, despite the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) asking its member states to spend 2 per cent of GDP on military spending. The five biggest spenders in Western Europe—France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain—have all budgeted for further cuts, albeit mostly small, in 2015. However, Germany has announced the intention to increase spending in the medium term.

europeans,35t6vd,weniger,1 point,Wed May 13 08:33:25 2015 UTC,"Abstract  A smart city is one that harmonizes with the geology of its territory and uses technology to develop sustainably. Until the Republican Times, Rome was a smart city. The ancient settlement of Rome benefited from abundant natural resources. City expansion took place in such a way as to not substantially alter the morphological and geological features of the area; natural resources were managed so as to minimize the risks. The geology, together with prudent management, ensured Rome’s fortune. Naples, which developed in a similar geological context and at almost the same time, was exposed to more geological hazards and had access to fewer natural resources. This was fatal for the city that, while remaining one of the most important of the Mediterranean, did not become the capital of an empire as Rome did. The histories of Rome and Naples highlight the important role of geology in the development of a city and the making of its fortune. Over time, fast urban expansion, rapid population growth, and the overuse of resources led to increased hazards for both cities. As a result, the cities became unstable and fragile, and several natural processes resulted in disasters."

Should the United Kingdom choose to leave the European Union using the procedure laid down under Article 50 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, a non-independent Scotland would have no legal possibility to stay in it. However, there is a precedent of a partial withdrawal of a Member State from the European Union. In 1985, following a referendum of 1982, Greenland “withdrew” from the (then) European Communities, even though Denmark – which it is a part of – remained in the European Communities. The legal arrangement for that situation took the form of a treaty, known as “The Greenland Treaty”. Legally speaking, this treaty was an amendment to the existing treaties, in accordance with the amendment procedure – just like the Lisbon Treaty, and the Nice Treaty before that, and the Amsterdam Treaty before that.

europeans,359oib,weniger,1 point,Fri May 8 07:25:51 2015 UTC,"Summary  A new victory for parties of the “grand coalition”  Parties belonging to EPP as well as S&D respectively won 29% and 25% of seats, while all the other political forces won less than 10% of seats. The elected representatives of these two groups are to shape most of the EP’s decisions during the 2014-2019 term.  Parties affiliated to the EPP or the S&D groups came out on top in 20 of the 28 EU countries. In 3 others, parties affiliated to the ALDE group received the most votes. Other parties were only able to reach the top three in very limited cases, i.e. 22 out of 84.  A comparison with 2009 shows a relative decline for the EPP group (29% vs 36% seats), a stability for the S&D group (25% of seats). The ALDE group has dropped from 12% to 8.9% of seats, the Greens group from 7,4% to 6.6% while the ECR group has risen from 7.3% to 9.3%.  The progression of Eurosceptic and Europhobe constellations  It is helpful to analyse the political forces thought to be hostile to EU while making a clear distinction between “Eurosceptic” parties, which strongly voice their discontent with the EU, the Euro area or the Schengen area, but do not take up a stance in favour of their country’s withdrawal, and “Europhobe” parties, which strongly advocate such a withdrawal.  30 Eurosceptic parties or coalitions, in 16 countries, obtained at least one seat at the EP, while 16 Europhobe parties or coalitions, in 13 countries, did the same. These parties have therefore gained around 40 seats each, with a much clearer relative increase for Europhobes (+50% for Eurosceptics as against +100% for Europhobes).  This double progression has no real institutional impact at the EP, where these parties do not form a coherent political block but two disparate constellations. Its impact must then be assessed on the political register, focusing on national politics and the European council.  Abstention at the May 2014 elections: at a normal level?  The very high level of abstention in May 2014 (57.4%) proved relatively stable compared to the 2009 level.EU countries once again broken down into one half in which abstention is on the rise and the other half in which it is stagnating or declining.  The “turn-out deficit” in the EP elections is above all related to the EU’s “power deficit”: the abstention rate is at levels comparable to those recorded during “subsidiary elections” of the same type (Swiss and US federal elections).  A correlation between this low turn-out and an expression of rejection of the EU may exist in countries like the UK and the Czech Republic, but it can’t be applied to countries like Poland (low level of mistrust but low turnout) or Italy (high level of mistrust but high turnout).  Qualitative surveys conducted after May 2014 allow to detect only some minor signs of abstention synonymous with EU-related mistrust. The roots of a negative perception should rather be sought among voters, as 7% of them voted to express their disapproval with the EU."

And then we hit the 21st century and to today in 2015 where we are now living in an on-demand economy; an extension to a sharing economy. It’s no longer about the assets you have, but workers can now sell their time and skills, on demand.  It’s estimated that 1 in 3 employees in the US are freelancers by choice.  Modern knowledge workers are choosing flexibility over security and stability. As a result, employers can now source talent globally; they are no longer restricted by a postcode. This model allows people to work when it suits them and thus balance their work and home lives in a smart way.  For the employer, this giant pool of resource brings about new innovation and a better quality of product. Tools and smart technologies that effortlessly exchange information between people and across teams solve this issue and allow companies to become truly global. At the same time this technology allows employees to self-educate and become self-reliant.

europeans,34tfzt,Naurgul,2,Mon May 4 12:36:28 2015 UTC,"Abstract  The rise of the consolidation state follows the displacement of the classical tax state, or Steuerstaat, by what I have called the debt state, a process that began in the 1980s in all rich capitalist democracies. Consolidation is the contemporary response to the “fiscal crisis of the state” envisaged as early as the late 1960s, when postwar growth had come to an end. Both the long-term increase in public debt and the current global attempts to bring it under control were intertwined with the “financialization” of advanced capitalism and its complex functions and dysfunctions. The ongoing shift towards a consolidation state involves a deep rebuilding of the political institutions of postwar democratic capitalism and its international order. This is the case in particular in Europe where consolidation coincides with an unprecedented increase in the scale of political rule under European Monetary Union and with the transformation of the latter into an asymmetric fiscal stabilization regime. The paper focuses on the developing structure of the new consolidation regime and its consequences for the relationship between capitalism and democracy.    Remember to add a pdf warning and post the abstract (it gets more people interested in the paper). :)"

I doubt that the image of the brand in Germany will improve in the coming years, but that doesn't mean it won't outside of Germany. Second option is that they won't explicitly abandon their neo-Nazi background unless the bigger media concerns gets an hold on it. This might lose them some customers, but I have no insight in how many, and if it will happen.

Section 2 will deal with three transformations seen by Europe's borders and the resulting surveillance regime. Section 3 will  present some examples of counter-surveillance as initiated by a number of European NGOs, activist groups and researchers which react and reflect on these transformations and aim to mediate the Mediterranean, i.e. they visualize the Med as a place of contestation that not only seems to consist of a humanitarian drama, but of a technologically mediated drama of conflicting representations as well. In addition, I will introduce an analytical framework based on Pierre Rosanvallon's account of counter-democracy as to understand the conceptual, historical and political background of counter-surveillance. In section 4, I will use Rosanvallon's notion of powers of oversight to evaluate current initiatives of counter-surveillance. Section 5 continues the search for the political dimension of public actions related to surveillance by elaborating on the writings of Hannah Arendt, specifically on the idea of a 'portable public realm' (Ring 1991) apparent in her work. Using Louise Amoore's (2009) notion of 'lines of sight', section 6 investigates the nature of the representations, such as images and maps, that both surveillance and counter-surveillance provide us with.

Info from Mezzo:   On the occasion of the 250th anniversary of Handel's death, Vienna's theater an der Wien, famous for innovative and unconventional opera productions, realized a unique and truly extraordinary project: the staging of one of Handel's most popular oratorios. For this production, the theater signed up one of the most renowned stage directors of our time, Claus Guth. The result: ""an emotionally and psychologically charged sequence of images"", as the Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote about Guth's portrayal of a family dynasty, complete with guilt, betrayal, suicide and reconciliation. Conductor Jean-Christophe Spinosi triumphs ""with his phenomenal orchestra [ensemble Matheus] and the subtle Arnold Schoenberg Chor"" (Süddeutsche Zeitung). Winner of the Diapason d'Or and the BBC Music Magazine award, the ensemble is internationally acclaimed for its interpretations of early music on authentic period instruments. Offering ""the best of Handel vocal artistry"" (Frankfurter Rundschau) are Cornelia Horak, Susan Gritton, Richard Croft and the sublime countertenor Bejun Mehta. Video director Hannes Rossacher, internationally known as one of the leading video directors for rock and pop events (Rolling Stones), has captured this unique performance of the oratorio on film."

The significant increase in MEPs from a range of populist parties presents new challenges for the mainstream political groups, from working out how to engage with the new members of the European Parliament to developing a successful strategy for reaching out to those voters attracted to populist politics.  One of the greatest challenges is the captivating power of populist language. We intend this short publication to be a guide for politicians and campaigners who are searching for ways to respond effectively. The pamphlet comprises our analysis of populist rhetoric in the run-up to May’s European elections, focusing on the discourse of five parties: the Front National in France, UKIP in the UK, the Lega Nord in Italy, the FPÖ in Austria, and the PVV in the Netherlands. We include specific frames and narratives used by populist MEPs, case studies from plenary debates, and examples of how to build responses and counterarguments.

europeans,338klq,weniger,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"Abstract  When they look at Internet policy, EU policymakers seem mesmerised, if not bewitched, by the word ‘neutrality’. Originally confined to the infrastructure layer, today the neu trality rhetoric is being expanded to multi - sided platforms such as search engines and more generally online intermediaries. Policies for search neutrality and platform neutrality are invoked to pursue a variety of policy objectives, encompassing competiti on, consumer protection, privacy and media pluralism. This paper analyses this emerging debate and comes to a number of conclusions. First, mandating net neutrality at the infrastructure layer might have some merit, but it certainly would not make the Inte rnet neutral. Second, since most of the objectives initially associated with network neutrality cannot be realistically achieved by such a rule, the case for network neutrality legislation would have to stand on different grounds. Third, the fact that the Internet is not neutral is mostly a good thing for end users, who benefit from intermediaries that provide them with a selection of the over - abundant information available on the Web. Fourth, search neutrality and platform neutrality are fundamentally flaw ed principles that contradict the economics of the Internet. Fifth, neutrality is a very poor and ineffective recipe for media pluralism, and as such should not be invoked as the basis of future media policy. All these conclusions have important consequenc es for the debate on the future EU policy for the Digital Single Market."

europeans,3313xa,weniger,2,Sat Apr 18 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"Executive Summary  The recent, still timid progress in the Eurozone towards recovery and institutional consolidation is tainted by concerns over the possible return of financial instability and/or a long period in which growth remains anaemic. Although a recovery seems finally to be on the way, it is quite weak and there is little room for complacency if one looks at unemployment rates.  The Eurozone architecture is unfinished business in many respects. This report focuses on three issues because they are important and they can be addressed without a fully-fledged fiscal federation or changes to the Treaty. The components of our proposal are:   A one-time debt stock operation to rapidly reduce sovereign debt, particularly in the highly indebted peripheral countries. W e offer a menu of options, one of which is a debt buyback through the commitment of future revenues, which could include seigniorage, VAT or a wealth (transfer) tax. This does not involve any redistribution across members of the currency union, but it would not be sufficient to eliminate the overhang. Therefore, we discuss a number of other choices, including a European solidarity tax with some limited redistribution across countries and ‘debt-equity’ exchange with GDP-indexed bonds. A strengthened sovereign lending framework for the ESM, which both creates strong market-based incentives to avoid excessive debt levels in the future and makes future debt restructuring – should it become necessary – less painful than is currently the case. A set of regulator y changes that discourage and limit the exposure of banks to sovereign debt, particularly that of their own sovereign. This should be complemented by the creation of a European synthetic bond that does not require mutualisation, but would constitute a safe asset and could facilitate unconventional monetary policies by the ECB.   Certainly, our goal is ambitious: we propose to kill the three birds of enforcing long-run fiscal discipline, dealing with the legacy debt overhang and breaking the sovereign bank loop with one stone. This would require a concerted effort and significant investment of political capital, which may only become available if the fragility of the present situation becomes apparent. However, the solutions to these three problems are strongly complementary and would generate large welfare improvements for Eurozone citizens if implemented jointly."

This had little to do with European reality, European interests or European goals. US based Jeffrey Goldberg just seems to prop-up ghosts  from WWII as a canard to further some Jewish-specific thing, apparently seeking to  pressure assimilated European Jews to dis-assimilate ... to dissociate in other words from their actual nationality (French or British etc.).  He for some reason seems to want them to see themselves in terms of their Jewish religion/race first and foremost, not their nationality and ... to leave Europe. But in my view, his whole 'it's the 1930s again' conclusion is about as sincere as typical conclusions on 'Islamophobia' from similar but Muslim events. :/  'Islam First!' events, are just as creepy (but yet more barbaric, as most Muslim fanatics seem stuck in some completely pre-civilised midwarp). Muslims whine of 'Islamophobia' rather than 'anti-Semitism' but they also like claiming that they are being oppressed in Europe. Hey, maybe Israel will accept them too. :) Now, as dis-assimilation can by itself create tensions, almost as a pre-rational  immune response from other (non-Jewish) citizens of a country, it can engender a self-fulfilling prophecy. And it has nothing to do with 'Jewishness' specifically. Were he a Catholic seeking for Catholics to identify with their religion foremost, thus alienating themselves from their non-Catholic countrymen, it would be just as disturbing.   In any case, Goldberg seems to have an agenda. And with all his talk of 'anti-Semitism' he manages to constantly let it slip out, explicitly at some point, that he's 'anti-European'. He even uses the phrase 'strident secularism' ('strident' really?).   The most sincere thing about him seemed, ironically enough, to be that his weasely appearance and demeanour makes him a self-caricature. There's something sincere about someone acting and looking that much like a double-talking douchebag. This was especially obvious in his answer to the very last posed question.

europeans,32nur3,weniger,3,Wed Apr 15 07:46:02 2015 UTC,"Summary   Britain is home to some of the richest and poorest regions in Western Europe, and the gap between their economic fortunes is widening. There are several causes of this growing regional inequality. The number of jobs in manufacturing and heavy industry, long a source of well-paid employment in Britain’s poorer regions, has been in decline for 40 years. The services jobs that have replaced them pay less well on average. And high-skilled people tend to move to prosperous cities while the low-skilled stay put.  A British exit from the EU risks making this regional inequality worse, because poorer regions of the UK are more dependent on exports to the EU than richer ones. Exports to the EU account for 15 per cent of private sector output in the North East of England, one of Britain’s poorest regions, compared to 9 per cent in the South West of England and Scotland, two of its richer regions. And even with its sizeable fi nancial services exports to the EU, London is among the less exposed.  There is a risk that the UK would be unable to conclude a free trade agreement with the EU after exit. The EU buys 45 per cent of UK exports, while the UK only buys 7 per cent of the other EU member-states’ exports, giving the EU the upper hand in any negotiation over Brexit terms. Current alternatives to EU membership suggest that even a free trade agreement that covered only goods would come at the price of accepting free movement of labour: the Switzerland-EU bilateral treaties require it, for example. This might be too much for the British people to accept. Without a free trade agreement, the UK could trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. But the EU would apply tariffs to British goods. These would hit economic activity in poorer regions of the UK, where manufacturing tends to predominate, harder than richer ones. While London’s large financial and commercial services sector would be badly hit by a British exit from the EU, services make up less than one third of British exports, and services exports to non-EU markets have grown quickly over the course of the eurozone crisis. As a region, London would be among the less-affected regions. In order to ensure that Brexit did not make regional inequality worse, Britain’s government would have to secure as much access to the EU market as possible. The UK would need to sign up to free movement, EU budget contributions, and many of the EU’s rules and standards. Since it would have next to no say over what those rules are, such an agreement would be worse than the status quo."

europeans,32ban7,weniger,2,Sun Apr 12 07:18:50 2015 UTC,"Executive summary   Conspiracy theories should not be dismissed as a psychological problem that only affects a small minority – a subtler suspicion of political institutions and their power is far more pervasive. The current period of transition in Europe has resulted in increased uncertainty about national identities and a perceived loss of control. These are in turn the ideal conditions for the proliferation of conspiracy theories about the role of government. In France, Hungary and Slovakia, we found that very significant numbers agree that it is not the government that governs, but that someone else is pulling the strings. Respondents indicated that international finance, other countries and, especially in France, large media empires were the major conspirators. Demographic factors such as gender, age, education and employment are not the key determinants for these beliefs. Politics (especially party politics) matters much more than social status in shaping a conspiratorial mindset – a firm belief that conspiracies can be used to explain all sorts of events and decisions. Comparing survey results from France, Hungary and Slovakia points to a deep relationship between conspiracy theories, populism and democracy. A conspiratorial mindset and a populist mindset are connected to lower levels of institutional trust and reflect a significant concern about the quality of democracy in contemporary political institutions. Supporters of populist parties in France and Hungary are more likely to agree that the government does not run the country and that others are pulling the strings. The danger of conspiracy theories is not only the link between a conspiratorial mindset and undemocratic attitudes or populism, but also the link to xenophobic and anti-Semitic prejudices. There is evidence of substantial levels of anti-Semitic conspiracy theorising in Hungary and Slovakia. (This could not be tested in France.) The key to developing an appropriate response to the conspiratorial mindset is to appreciate how the roots of dangerous conspiracy theories can play a role in short-circuiting them. Merely unpicking the logic of conspiracy theories or debunking the theories and trying to dissuade believers is unlikely to have the desired effect. To challenge conspiracy theories campaigners should therefore be conscious of and address the deeper considerations underpinning them, including political transitions, perceived loss of control, institutional distrust, and populism.

A European study commissioned by the Federation of German Industries (BDI) and conducted by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants.    In brief:   The digital transformation of industry is creating tremendous opportunities for Europe – and confronting it with huge challenges. The possibilities opened up by connected, more efficient production and new business models are highly promising, yet the risks are equally dramatic. By 2025, Europe could see its manufacturing industry add gross value worth 1.25 trillion euros – or suffer the loss of 605 billion euros in foregone value added.  The digital transformation of industry is also driving a radical structural transition in Europe's economies. New data, connectivity, automation and the digital customer interface are challenging existing value chains. Companies must take a long, hard look at their products and skill sets. And they have to improve their digital maturity if they are to recognize new opportunities, develop suitable offerings and get them to market quickly. The digital transformation of industry demands concerted action within Europe. The regulatory framework must be harmonized, with a new weighting given to relevant issues. At the same time, a powerful, no-gaps information and communications infrastructure is needed if European industry is to remain competitive. As standards are shaping our digital future, companies and governments need to get engaged seriously in their global definition.      What is at stake for Europe, visualized."

Through linking the recent developments to the Soviet heritage and Ukraine’s home-grown tradition of Fascism (e.g. Stepan Bandera and the OUN), the coordinated endeavour of the abovementioned actors succeeded in making certain leftist parties rather sympathetic to Russian foreign policy. Germany’s Die Linke, for instance, has interpreted the developments in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine as a justified response to the ‘EU-sponsored, Fascist government in Kyiv’.    So what did they do?   When the Council of Europe suspended Russia last autumn, Jobbik and Die Linke representatives voted against the move.   That's all the Russian propaganda machine needed.

europeans,327syw,weniger,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:34:49 2015 UTC,"Summary  In the fifth century, Augustine argued that “the wise man will wage just wars” at the direction of the government. Nine hundred years later, in the Summa Theologica, Aquinas built upon this argument. Formalized by Grotius in the seventeenth century, propositions Aquinas articulated with lucidity have matured and crystallized to be fundamental to just war thinking. Accepting war as an evil, which might be defensible only when just, Aquinas's reasoning remains central and important to global political theory and public policy. But, arguing that a sovereign might identify a cause and declare war without reference to the nation's soldiers, Aquinas defines a condition of just war—the doctrine of legitimate authority—that no longer obtains.  This paper argues against the claims of legitimate authority, to the extent that the doctrine implies a concerning inattentiveness to the rights of soldiers, and an unsafe confidence in the political bureaucracy. The paper agrees with Aquinas that peace may be breached only in the cause of justice. But this paper argues that the jus ad bellum assertion of rightfulness by political authority alone is not sufficient. Reflecting upon foundational argument in the just war tradition, this paper argues that without the moral confidence of the soldiers, no war can be just. Contesting the persistent and essentially medieval doctrine of legitimate authority, this paper suggests an approach to thinking about war, which is more responsive to the claims of individual soldiers to justice.  This paper argues that if democracies are to exert a constructive effect upon world affairs, then the democratic system must itself be wholly just. The democracy cannot abide by proverbial and comfortable conventions: habitually and unreasonably curtailing the rights and dignities of the soldiers who aspire to advance democratic ideals. No such corrupt instrument can advance justice.  The paper looks for practical expression in public policy. By and large, instruments such as legislation and military doctrine speak to politically realist needs for security. The policy they articulate tends to be insufficiently attentive to growing demands for justice. That public policy is unmindful of justice is significant—because just institutions are essential to just societies, which in turn are critical to global justice. As the publicist Geoffrey Robertson observes: “At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the dominant motive in world affairs is the quest—almost the thirst—for justice. [This thirst is] replacing even the objective of regional security as the trigger for international action.”  This paper proceeds in three sections. Part I reviews the accepted wisdom about war derived from the Thomistic position, and the significance of these inherited ideas. In Part II, discussion explores the idea of the state, which is seen to obscure the moral claims of soldiers to justice. In the third part, the paper explores the moral responsibilities of soldiers. The paper claims that when soldiers lack conscientious commitment to justice, their killing is merely political and analogous to murder."

Overall in Greece, the number of new arrivals has been increasing from 1,070 in the last week of February to 2,212 in the last week of March.  Whilst the number of people arriving in Italy via the Central Mediterranean route from Libya rose in the first two months of this year (in January by 59% and in February by 33%), there was a significant drop (59%) in the number of people who arrived via this route in March.  MSF is extremely worried that the situation in the Greek islands will only get worse if nothing will be done to prepare for the upcoming influx. The Greek authorities and EU must urgently agree a contingency plan to cope with the needs that may emerge from this potential new trend. “We are not yet in the peak season which usually falls from July to September.

europeans,3200dz,Naurgul,3,Thu Apr 9 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"Executive summary:   As Greece descended into a financial maelstrom in the spring of 2010, a small group of staffers at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) held top-secret talks with officials from the German and French finance ministries to discuss the idea of restructuring Greece’s debt. Many independent analysts believed a restructuring was inevitable because the country’s debt burden appeared unsustainable. But instead, the “Troika” — the tripartite group of lenders that included the IMF, the European Commission and European  Central Bank — attempted to resolve the crisis by giving Athens bailout loans of unprecedented magnitude, piling debt atop debt. The idea considered in those secret talks would come to fruition only much later, in March 2012, when Greece received the largest debt relief in history. In the meantime, the rescue effort would go terribly awry, with consequences that continue to reverberate today as the euro area struggles with weak growth and a rekindled crisis in Greece.  This paper tells the story of the first Greek rescue, focusing on the role played by the IMF. A detailed look back at this drama elucidates significant concerns about the Fund’s governance and its management of future crises. The Fund has come under attack for yielding to the clout of European policy makers and lending its credibility to a rescue that some of its senior staffers viewed with grave misgivings. The result, critics lament, tarnished the Fund’s reputation for technocratic judgment, rendering it less effective at promoting international stability. The 2010 rescue enabled Greece to avoid default at  that point, which might well have sparked a global conflagration akin to the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman  Brothers. European banks holding Greek bonds continued receiving payments of interest and principal for quite a long time thereafter, from the money lent by the Troika. But the interests of the Greek people were arguably sacrificed, and among economists there is widespread agreement that the country’s debt should have been restructured much sooner.  In addition to shedding new light on what happened, this chronicle of events highlights the importance of the IMF’s acceptance, as a condition of its participation in the rescue, of a “junior partner” role in the Troika. This step is judged in the concluding section as being particularly ill-boding for the IMF’s ability to manage future crises, and policy recommendations are offered for alleviating the harm."

These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones.  The Natural History became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus's reign.

Up until very recently one of the most unpopular and outdated intellectual concepts in contemporary Europe. The period of uncertainty which started in 2009 has included strategic tensions between European powers which have paved the way for introducing a new geometry of state relations that will continue altering the balance of power among key EU regional groupings. The aim of the paper is to provide a conceptual framework upon which, the predominance of the creditor-debtor divide rather than a consistent European wide response to the crisis, apart from sustaining systemic ambivalence, structural vulnerability and loss of confidence, above all introduces elements of geopolitical uncertainty. Due to the creditor-debtor relationships and not any other form of geopolitical frictions, a number of core EU balances have been broken down which affect intra-European power correlations and progressively pave the way for the evolution of geopolitical dilemmas impacting both on Europe and the US (indicative examples will include the Franco-German axis, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and China). On top of that, growing US concerns over the strategic implications of Europe’s debt crisis and the geopolitical necessity for maintaining an unbroken and coordinated Atlantic West, increase the need for combining a forward thinking transatlantic analysis. In this regard, the methodology that is followed sheds light on how the Ukraine crisis symbolizes a policy shift and a definite signal of changing geopolitics by the US for: a) effectively address the linkages between economic and security issues in the EU context, b) progressively establish a functional balance of power that keeps Europe united and capable of sustaining its slow but determined pro-integration drive."

europeans,316ebg,weniger,2,Thu Apr 2 10:27:00 2015 UTC,"Abstract  This CEPS Special Report analyses the composition of the 20 committees in the new European Parliament and how representative they are of the 28 member states, identifying which policy areas or committees are of particular interest to MEPs from certain countries. It also examines the allocation of committee chairs and party coordinator positions to assess whether the country of origin matters and if so, why. The study reveals that in general the countries’ share of representatives in the committees is very similar in most of the cases to their representation in Parliament. Still, some policy areas have a special relevance for some countries and attract their MEPs in larger numbers. Due to the procedure used in the allocation of the committee chairs, which favours the largest political groups and the largest national parties within them, MEPs from larger member states tend to hold most of these coveted positions. The internal process followed by the political groups in appointing their coordinators in the respective committees is predisposed towards MEPs with seniority, experience and good connections. All in all, the strategic relevance that national parties attach to these positions makes a difference.  Tables   EP committees ordered by volume of legislative activity (2009-2014 legislature) Difference between the share of MEPs from each country in each committee and the country’s representation in Parliament Illustration of the d’Hondt formula for allocating 34 hypothetical positions among seven parties Number of committee chairs by country and political group Committee chairs in the 8th European Parliament Party coordinators in each of the committees, by member state   Conclusions  The cross-country examination of the composition of the EP committees reveals which policy areas hold a special interest for MEPs from specific member states, although in general the representation of member states in most committees largely reflects their representation at large in the Parliament. In particular, Environment, Public Health and Food Safety seems to attract more Croatian, Hungarian and Italian MEPs. In the current legislature, Economic and Monetary Affairs appears to be especially attractive for Belgium, German and Greek MEPs – and more generally for MEPs from the euro area. Swedish MEPs show a special interest in Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and Austrian MEPs in Industry, Research and Energy. International Trade seems especially appealing for Italian and French MEPs, and Foreign Affairs for MEPs from Greece and in general from the new member states. Irish MEPs show a special interest in Agriculture and Portuguese MEPs in Fisheries. In the case of smaller member states, the slight overrepresentation in a committee might result in a poor or lack of representation in the other committees.  In the allocation of chair positions in the EP committees, there is a significant bias in favour of larger member states, as demonstrated in the fact that 17 of the 20 committee chairmanships are held by MEPs from the six largest member states. The formula used in the allocation of these positions tends to benefit the biggest political groups and the biggest parties within them. Similar positions in national parliaments are also divided among the political parties according to the size of their overall representation in parliament. Nevertheless, the fact that the European political groups consist of many national parties add s complexity and a ‘country-of-origin’ bias in the European Parliament. The appointment process, however, is flexible and the allocation ultimately depends on the agreement among the political groups. All in all, these coveted positions are reserved for MEPs who have established a strong reputations based on extensive experience.  Similarly influential are the party coordinators who are appointed for each committee by the political groups. In this case, the MEP’s previous experience in the Parliament and his/her personal and party connections are more relevant than the size of the political party s/he belongs to. MEPs from some member states are tuned into the influence and importance these positions bestow on the incumbent and accordingly push harder to secure them. The turnover of MEPs in office contributes to explaining some of the differences across EU countries. Political parties (and ultimately member states) with larger shares of new MEPs hold fewer of these positions, which require experience, expertise and the right connections.  In sum, certain national parties and MEPs seem to be more mindful of the important role that the EP and in particular its committees play in the EU legislative process. The privileged position of the committee chairs and party coordinators does not go unnoticed by them. Others are still just learning the ropes."

europeans,311dht,weniger,7,Wed Apr 1 09:40:17 2015 UTC,"The costs of Greece’s fiscal consolidation  Sebastian Gechert, Ansgar Rannenberg - Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK), Hans Böckler Foundation  Abstract  This policy brief re-examines the effects of the Greek austerity experiment on its economy via a counterfactual analysis. We combine the fiscal multipliers from the meta regression analysis in Gechert and Rannenberg (2014) to the fiscal consolidation measures that have been implemented in Greece between 2010 and 2014. We estimate that austerity explains almost the entire collapse of Greek GDP after 2009. This result suggests that - ceteris paribus - , in the absence of austerity, the Greek economy would have entered a prolonged period of stagnation, rather than a depression.  At the same time the path of the government debt-to-GDP ratio would have been somewhat lower. Furthermore, we estimate that if the consolidation would have been postponed until after the recovery of the Greek economy and implemented gradually, almost two thirds of the cost in terms of lost output could have been avoided. Our results suggest that the period 2010-2014 was the wrong time to implement frontloaded spending cuts due to their strong multipliers in downturns. Implementing only the revenue components of the Greek fiscal consolidation would have strongly reduced the output contraction as compared to the actual path of GDP, but would have been much more effective at lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio than the actual fiscal consolidation. A more cautious consolidation would thus have been in the interest of international creditors as well.  Figures and tables   Figure 1: Cumulative multipliers of fiscal impulses for different regimes, full sample Table 1a: Consolidation actions in Greece - Cumulative revenue increases and expenditure cuts, 2010 Table 1b: Consolidation actions in Greece - Cumulative revenue increases and expenditure cuts, % of 2009 GDP Table 2a: Estimated cumulative GDP effect of Greece's fiscal consolidation Table 2b: Estimated cumulative GDP effect of Greece's fiscal consolidation, % of 2009 GDP Figure 2: Greek real GDP under various scenarios Figure 3: GDP Deflator, annual change Figure 4: Greek Path of Primary Balances and Debt-to-GDP   Conclusions  The debate on Greek economic policy since the outbreak of the European sovereign debt crisis as well as its future is set to continue over the coming months and years. We contribute to the assessment of the former by estimating the effect of the Greek tax increases and expenditure cuts. We find that austerity in Greece almost exclusively explains the decline of Greek GDP since 2009 and actually increased the government debt-to-GDP ratio somewhat as compared to a no-austerity scenario. We also estimate that most of the costs of fiscal consolidation could have been avoided by postponing and gradually implementing it after the recovery of the Greek economy, due to the lower expenditure multipliers during normal times. Finally, a much lower path of the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio could have been achieved by implementing only the revenue increases but not the expenditure cuts which were part of the consolidation package. It appears that those who warned against the Greek austerity experiment early on (e.g. Horn et al 2011) were right.  To be sure, we do not argue that the Greek public finances were in good shape when the fiscal consolidation began. However, irrespectively of whether the Greek budget was structurally unbalanced or not, as the economy was in particularly bad shape, our results suggest that the 2010-2014 period was the wrong time to implement spending cuts, and that any expenditure based consolidation should have been phased in gradually after the recovery of Greek economy."
europeans,311jcg,weniger,3,Wed Apr 1 11:01:28 2015 UTC,"Non-Technical Summary  A large literature focuses on the determinants of attitudes towards immigrants and ethnic minorities, and how these vary across countries. The increase in negative attitudes to immigration in recent years, likely due to growing international migration, has continued to fuel the debate as both academics and policy makers have not yet reached a consensus on what drives natives to view immigration as threatening and why otherwise similar people living in different countries tend to vary greatly in their opinions.  Most of the literature focuses on individual and household characteristics that influence anti- immigration attitudes. Fewer studies focus on the role of national characteristics in shaping anti-immigration attitudes, and even fewer of them analyse the role of regions within countries. Nevertheless, there are important differences in economic performance across regions, and even within one country immigrants tend to cluster within few areas; such regional differences are lost if, as the majority of the literature has done up to now, we compare countries instead of regions. Furthermore, people are likely to form their opinions about immigration by drawing on the local/regional environment where they live rather than on the average characteristics of their country, which is often geographically large.  We combine individual and aggregate data to analyse what may contribute to cross-country and regional differences in attitudes to immigration. Our analysis focuses on 111 regions of 24 European countries between 2002 and 2008. We use the European Social Survey (ESS) to analyse how respondents evaluate the impact of immigration on the country’s 1) economy, 2) culture, and 3) quality of life overall, and how these attitudes vary by individual and household characteristics. We use individual level data from the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) to construct indicators of regional characteristics that may be relevant in shaping people’s attitudes to immigration. By using the EU LFS we are able, for example, to test the impact of the share of immigrants born within and outside the EU, the impact of the qualification level and unemployment rate of immigrants and of natives.  Our findings suggest that an increase in the regional unemployment rate of immigrants and in the percentage of immigrants born outside the EU are both associated with increased concerns in the population over the impact of immigration on the country. However, an increase in the regional unemployment of natives is associated with a decrease in feelings of threat from immigration. We also find that higher proportions of both natives and immigrants with low qualifications are associated with lower feelings of economic threat from immigration, while anti-immigration attitudes are significantly higher in regions where natives on average overestimate the share of immigrants. Our findings thus contradict hypotheses based on economic competition and in particular, employment competition within the low-skilled, manual workforce. They also suggest that differences in anti-immigration attitudes across regions in Europe may not be as closely related to the current economic conditions of the region, as they might be driven by concerns over the conditions of the immigrant population in that region, in addition to an overall inflated estimation of the extent of immigration.  Finally, our empirical results indicate the need for future research to account for local conditions separately for natives and immigrants and for EU and non-EU immigrants, since their impact on anti-immigrant attitudes appears to diverge."

A number of European pioneers were disconnected from this mainstream by time, most singularly Charles Babbage, or by a combination of geography, politics, and language. The latter include Konrad Zuse, now recognized for building the first binary, digital computer anywhere, and a number of other Europeans who built the first computers in their respective countries.  S.A. Lebedev, whose centenary was last November, was one of the most accomplished, but least known, of these “isolated” pioneers. Between 1947–51 he designed and built the MESM, the first operational all-electronic, digital, stored-program, general-purpose computer on continental Europe, and did so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances.

europeans,30l8y2,Lejeune_Dirichelet,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:04:14 2015 UTC,"Abstract  The history of Swiss republicanism was memorably summed up by Orson Welles in the classic film The Third Man (1949): whereas the tumultuous and tyrannical politics of the Italian Renaissance produced a great cultural flourishing, Welles observed, “In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.” Suggestive as it may be, Welles's contrast is as misleading as it is memorable. The Swiss were a fearsome military power at the beginning of the sixteenth century, admired by no less a Florentine than Niccolò Machiavelli, but by the eighteenth century they were no longer capable of defending themselves, and they were summarily occupied by the armies of revolutionary France in 1798. The nature of Swiss democracy was long contested, and in 1847 the Swiss fought a civil war over it. Finally, it must be said, cuckoo clocks were invented in the Black Forest region, on the other side of the Alps. As we shall see, the success of the Swiss watchmaking industry does in fact deserve a place in the history of liberty, but Jean-Jacques Rousseau turns out to be a more helpful guide for understanding its significance."

europeans,30d71x,weniger,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:37:18 2015 UTC,"Recap:   A panel of three speakers looked at different aspects: Franck Duvell, from the Oxford Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) spoke on “Shifts in the Regional Order, New Patterns of Mobility and Migration Transitions in Europe – the Case of Turkey”; Eugenia Markova, from London Metropolitan University, on “Bulgaria’s Immigration Experiences”; and Dragos Tudorache, of DG HOME in the European Commission, on “The View from Brussels”.  Franck Duvell highlighted the data and the factors – political, economic and social –leading to his conclusion that the EU has ceased to be the only migration destination region; Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey, as well as the Gulf States and Israel are also migrant destinations. Emigration from, and transit migration through, Turkey has diminished significantly and it has now become an immigrant destination, with consequent legal and institutional adjustments. It currently hosts 1.4 to 2.3 million regular and irregular immigrants plus some 1.7 million refugees from Syria. It is thus right, in his view, to talk of shifts in the global and regional migration order. While the EU may remain migrants’ first choice, they also have others; “we settle in Istanbul, even if we dream of Europe”. While this diverts immigration pressure away from the EU, it also creates competition for qualified migrants. As an example, Turkey is now aiming to recruit medical staff from Greece. Overall, from a situation where everything flows into the EU, we now have one where there is an emerging belt of countries with relatively liberal visa regimes surrounding the EU to the South and East which also receives migrants and refugees. Eugenia Markova concluded that even though Bulgaria remains predominantly a country of emigration and transit, it has been gradually transforming into a migrant destination area for citizens of Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. The country's EU membership remains a strong 'pull' factor. With the adoption of the EU Blue Card Directive, it has been attracting high skilled professionals, albeit in small numbers, from China, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Albania. Since 2013, the Syrian crisis has led to an unprecedented influx of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, most of whom perceive Bulgaria as a temporary destination (“please tell the media that we don’t want to claim asylum here, because Bulgaria is a very poor country. We don’t want to stay here.”). This is a similar phenomenon to that seen in Greece since the early 1990s. The country has been responding with a massive increase in surveillance at the border with Turkey. Bulgaria is still adjusting in practical policy terms to the changes that have occurred in the region over the last few years and there are few concrete measures to facilitate the integration of migrants.  Dragos Tudorache questioned Franck Duvell’s suggestion that transit migration through Turkey has greatly diminished; this wasn’t so far the impression in Brussels, but rather that of a “perfect storm”. Developments in the EU’s neighbourhood – Arab Spring, Syria – had led to a peak flow of refugees in 2014. The media were full of coverage of dying migrants in the Mediterranean, attempts to board trucks in Calais, and Syrian refugees in Bulgaria and Turkey. There is a clear breakdown of citizens’ trust in the EU’s and Member States’ ability to deal with migration, as well as between EU citizens and migrants; a new migration agenda at EU level is urgently needed and will be put forward in July. The statistics don’t help in explaining the merits of free movement within the EU – too often confused in the media and by citizens, with immigration. There had been 22,000 asylum applications from the West Balkans in December 2014, against a backdrop of visa liberalisation; 46% of all repeated asylum claims in the EU came from the Western Balkans. The West Balkans remained a key focus of policy. Developments inside the EU didn’t always help, with recent Member State national court decisions encouraging claims for asylum from parts of the West Balkans. It was politically difficult for any EU Member State to seek suspension of visa free treatment, but the growing number of rejected asylum claims meant that alternative tools needed to be identified. Turkey was a different case and the challenge of dealing with Syrian refugees was real. Many of them would stay a long time, some permanently. It was vital that a good dialogue between the EU and Turkey be established on all these issues, so that EU support could be made available.    Jonathan Scheele's conclusions:   Following these presentations and a lively Q & A, my own conclusions are:   There is a change in the situation, with Turkey becoming a different player compared with ten years ago; Russia takes skilled migrants from Turkey and elsewhere, often linked to contracts; immigration issues are the single area where EU/Russia relations remain active and effective; Transit flows into the EU from Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, remain at high levels, but they are no longer so focused on transit through the Balkans, mainly due to the situations in Libya and Egypt, which facilitate flows directly across the Mediterranean to Italy, as well as the emergence of the “ghost ship” phenomenon, bringing migrants from Turkey and its region to Italy; but this situation could change as rapidly as it emerged; Migration from the Western Balkans into the EU is significant, pushed by the economic situation and pulled by a series of policy and judicial decisions inside the EU; a new migration agenda within the EU will need to be accompanied by a series of measures to support the efforts of Western Balkans governments both to prevent migration and to create new jobs and investment within the region."

Using a sample of nearly 400,000 British residents, we mapped the geographical distributions of the Big Five Personality traits across 380 Local Authority Districts and examined the associations with important political, economic, social, and health outcomes. The results revealed distinct geographical clusters, with neighboring regions displaying similar personality characteristics, and robust associations with the macro-level outcome variables. Overall, the patterns of results were similar to findings from past research."

Whilst both the US and China have managed to exceed 2008 GDP levels, Europe continues to languish and in many cases (notably, Greece, Spain and Portugal) is worse relative to the impact of the Great Depression. If Europe in its current form is to survive, notes the economist Karl Aiginger, Director of the Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO), then restarting growth is both necessary and (more importantly), feasible.  But the new growth should not be more of the same, which is to say, attempted via a series of “beggar thy neighbor” internal devaluations (the economics of which are highly questionable). Rather Europe’s policy makers must embrace a new growth path that is more dynamic, socially inclusive and ecologically sustainable. More importantly, it needs to go beyond metrics such as GDP growth, embracing a model which aims to lower carbon dioxide emissions, and also reduce unemployment and income differences. In effect, Ainginger is calling for a new kind of social contract that measures “economic success” via different outcomes of a country’s socio-economic system (poverty risk, inequality, youth unemployment), as well as advocating an ecological pillar that evaluates environmental outcomes. Gone is the “low road model” of fiscal prudence and low inflation to all other countries and wage cuts to sustain an unsustainable economic mercantilism. Rather, Professor Ainginger urges Europe to embrace a more dynamic, more inclusive, more sustainable, and more stable European Union, one which serves the needs the real economy, rather than the narrow interest of the continents rentiers."

Many Turks look at the trouble-stricken and enfeebled Union with an overt sense of Schadenfreude. And they relish at their own robust growth, which has kept apace irrespective of the stalled accession negotiations. Turkey feels empowered: no longer on the European periphery, but at the centre of its own world spanning from North Africa and the Middle East all the way to the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Arab Awakening seemingly vindicates this vision, though turmoil in Syria has exposed the limits of Ankara's influence. But crises present opportunities too. It is precisely from the depths of the Union's ongoing drama that a “post-hubris” Turkey could rise from its ashes if and as it is brought organically into the conversation on the future shape of the European integration experiment."

When some of the most active and critical citizens leave only three samurais are left to struggle for change. Going by the current level of corruption and poor political leadership in Bulgaria, this is not enough.  So could giving in to British calls to curb freedom of movement be a blessing in disguise for Europe’s east? Not so fast. A survey published last year to coincide with the 25 anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, tried to establish the gains and losses of the post-communist transition in the eyes of the public.  The results came as a shock to many politicians: while the overwhelming majority of Bulgarians still support their country’s membership of the EU, many tend to view the last two decades as a failure rather than a success.  They see their country’s arrival in Europe through a prism of de-industrialisation, rising social inequality and corrupt elites. And yet freedom of movement emerged from the survey as the one unqualified success of the past 25 years. It is the one thing that makes people still believe that the EU has a future. Europe’s leaders thus face a dilemma: curbing freedom of movement may help to keep the UK in the EU, but it runs the risk of delegitimising the project in the eyes of its newer members."

Explaining news visibility of Members of the European Parliament   Abstract  Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) represent their citizens in European Union policy making, having the power to approve, amend or reject the near majority of legislation. The media inform EU citizens about their representatives and are able to hold them publicly accountable. However, we know little about whether, and to what extent, MEPs are visible in the news. This study investigates the visibility of MEPs in national broadsheets in Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. It seeks to explain individual-level variation by employing an original dataset of news visibility of 302 MEPs over a period of 25 months (September 2009–September 2011) and tests the applicability of the news values and mirror theories in the context of supranational politics. The results show that political office, length of tenure and domestic party leadership have a positive effect. Legislative activities have a mixed effect on MEP news visibility. Attendance negatively affects news visibility, while non-attached MEPs receive more news coverage. In short, despite the core supranational nature of EP legislative politics, MEP news visibility primarily depends on journalists’ domestic considerations. This informs both our understanding of MEP parliamentary behaviour and journalism studies in the context of the EU."

It is a response to conflict among Member States in maintaining the common zone of freedom of movement. This Policy Brief aims to analyse how this package was developed and to assess whether it represents a suitable response to the conflict and difficulties within the Schengen agreement. The Brief argues that the Governance Package only touches on one part of the problem, namely border controls, whereas it does not deal with solidarity and burden-sharing and hence represents another missed opportunity to improve cooperation in the Schengen Area."

Up until very recently one of the most unpopular and outdated intellectual concepts in contemporary Europe. The period of uncertainty which started in 2009 has included strategic tensions between European  powers which have paved the way for introducing a new geometry of state relations that will continue altering the balance of power among key EU regional groupings. The aim of the paper is to provide a conceptual framework upon which, the predominance of the creditor-debtor divide rather than a consistent European-wide response to the crisis, apart from sustaining systemic ambivalence, structural vulnerability and loss of confidence, above all introduces elements of geopolitical uncertainty. Due to the creditor-debtor relationships and not any other form of geopolitical frictions, a number of core EU balances have been broken down which affect intra-European power correlations and progressively pave the way for the evolution of geopolitical dilemmas impacting both on Europe and the US (indicative examples will include the Franco-German axis, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and China). On top of that, growing US concerns over the strategic implications of Europe’s debt crisis and the geopolitical necessity for maintaining an unbroken and coordinated Atlantic West, increase the need for combining a forward thinking transatlantic analysis. In this regard, the methodology that is followed sheds light on how the Ukraine crisis symbolizes a policy shift and a definite signal of changing geopolitics by the US for: a) effectively address the linkages  between economic and security issues in the EU context, b) progressively establish a functional balance of power that keeps Europe united and capable of sustaining its slow  but determined pro-integration drive."

europeans,2zkxhk,weniger,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:09:54 2015 UTC,"Executive summary  Background  The economic and fiscal crisis has demanded EU responses which, in formal terms, adopted a heterogeneous form: EU secondary legislation, revision of the TFEU and, most noticeable, the negotiation of new treaties which bound EU member states outside the EU treaties themselves, were negotiated outside of EU prescribed procedures and required less than unanimity for entering into force. These instruments did not close all issues opened by the crisis and this, together with EU’s own development itself, has prompted the revision agenda. Actors (involving national government, EU bodies and scholars) have opened the discussion on new reforms needed which comprise from a repatriation of EU powers back to member states to creating a fully-fledged economic and political union. Independently of the substance of the changes implemented, future constitutional evolution faces the constraint posed by the strictness of the EU revision requirement: unanimity. In fact, extra-EU Treaties (i.e. the TSCG and the TESM) have already applied a less than unanimity requirement for entering into force and these alternative rules have proved their efficiency.  Options and challenges  This analysis presents several options through which future EU constitutional development may advance. Each of them combines specific advantages and disadvantages and specific solutions on how to address the issues of democratic receptiveness and accountability in constitution making (even if constitution making implies a reduction of EU powers) legitimacy, and efficacy (i.e. the possibility for each of these procedures to deliver successful treaty revision and/or constitutional development). None of them provides an optimal mix of these criteria, nor does one of them seems to be more likely than the others. Main EU actors (both institutions and governments) may face tough choices if EU constitutional development is taken seriously."

This article presents a new theory of the radical right that emphasizes its reactive nature and views it as backlash against the political successes of minorities and concessions extracted on their behalf. Unlike approaches that focus on competition between the extreme and mainstream parties, the theory stresses the dynamics between radical right and non proximate parties that promote minority rights. Most notably, it derives the salience of identity issues in party politics from the polarization of the party system. The theory is tested with a new party-election-level dataset covering all post-communist democracies over the past 20 years. The results provide strong support for the theory and show that the rise and fall of radical right parties is shaped by the politics of minority accommodation.   The Radical Right in Contemporary Europe   The family of the radical right is enjoying a prolonged spell of electoral and most importantly political ‘success’ in Europe. Established (though constant¬ly adapting) parties and new movements, from a variety of backgrounds and with different political trajectories and ideological profiles, have gradually come to represent a combined, formidable challenge to the ‘mainstream’ political system and society. Since the turn of the new millennium in particular, heightened existential insecurity and popular anxiety about identity and welfare have created an even more fertile ground for the radical right’s populist message. More alarm¬ingly, however, some of its key themes (in particular anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, anti-establishment, anti-EU critiques) have gradually become ‘mainstreamed’ - that is, accepted by large sections of society and adopted by ‘mainstream’ politi-cal discourse, thus blurring conventional boundaries between ‘extremism’ and the ‘mainstream’. This study explores the political itineraries, ideological characteris¬tics, and current strategies of the radical right in Europe, as well as the responses of ‘mainstream’ actors to it. This is an analysis that sees the success of the radical right not only as a critical challenge to, but also as a complex problem of, ‘mainstream’ politics and society."

Why not actually listen to local democracy and allow limits to migration?  Adjustment funds make no sense whatever for Europe as a whole -- the places that these enterprising, valuable, well educated immigrants have come from are suffering from the loss of their young people. Do not these areas need adjustment funds also?    Those who claim that Britain gets tax advantages from so many immigrants should realise that at some point, Europe will want us to use this money to subsidise regions that are getting poorer because of falling populations.   From a pan-European point of view, the huge imbalances in migration are not necessarily a good thing. How are areas that so many young people leave going to make an economic recovery?"

In Europe, there is nationalism with different cultural identities in the mix. This is (obviously) causing political problems where people arrive.   Immigration is being sold to the UK public as the key to growth and a larger tax take.  From a European point of view, will they not want us to contribute cohesion funds to areas from which people are leaving?  There are now suggestions that cohesion funds should be given both to areas where people arrive and where people leave. It's a comedy."
europeans,2z0pau,breezehair,0,Sun Mar 15 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"We can't really compare the situation in Detroit with immigration to the UK. EU immigration is a success story for the UK.   European migrants to the UK are not a drain on Britain’s finances and pay out far more in taxes than they receive in state benefits, a new study has revealed.  The research by two leading migration economists at University College also reveals that Britain is uniquely successful, even more than Germany, in attracting the most highly skilled and highly educated migrants in Europe.  The study, the Fiscal Impact of Immigration to the UK, published in the Economic Journal, reveals that more than 60% of new migrants from western and southern Europe are now university graduates. The educational levels of east Europeans who come to Britain are also improving with 25% of recent arrivals having completed a degree compared with 24% of the UK-born workforce.  It says that European migrants made a net contribution of £20bn to UK public finances between 2000 and 2011. Those from the 15 countries which made up the EU before 2004, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, contributed 64% – £15bn more in taxes than they received in welfare – while east European migrants contributed 12%, equivalent to £5bn more.   The current UK government failed to control immigration outside of the EU, despite being able to do so (there is no freedom of movement).   The Oxford University-based Migration Observatory recently criticised claims from ministers that the reason they missed the target was increased EU net migration. “Policies have failed to reduce net migration from outside the EU to less than 100,000 at any time over the course of this parliament, meaning that the target would have been missed with or without any rise in EU migration,” the Oxford migration experts said."
europeans,2z0pau,breezehair,1 point,Sun Mar 15 13:32:04 2015 UTC,"I am glad you agree that immigration from outside the EU is a problem.  In the narrow sense of temporary increases in tax-take, immigration from the EU may be a success. (We save money by not paying for the immigrants' education.) But this is a narrow view.      There are other strains from the sudden influx of several million people. Rents and house prices are now very high; Britons (and foreigners) who own property can be pleased, but young Britons who might reasonably wish to rent or buy are worse off.    For the EU regions that these immigrants leave, there are multiple feedback effects that make the regional problems there worse.  The birthrates are not high; enterprising people leave; economic stagnation and the dependency ratio get worse; and perhaps most importantly, political pressure for structural reforms is less, because the young people who would benefit most from reforms have left. This is comparable to the feedback effects in Detroit.   It is now obvious that Southern Europe needs massive regional assistance; it would be funny if it were not so sad that there are now suggestions that the destination of the immigrants needs cohesion funds as well...."

The model shows that a no-bailout policy within a monetary union cannot be credible and, hence, needs to be replaced by an improved set-up.  Another implication is the economic importance of statements made by politicians and policymakers. Since in reality the value of the first-exit premium is not publicly known, any statement made by a political leader within the monetary union about granting support may influence the public perception of the value and change the borrowing costs of risky governments.  In fact, it might be argued that the ECB president Mario Draghi used exactly this power on 26 July 2012 when he made the pledge that “the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro”. Therefore, negative statements made by other European leaders may have the opposite effect and contribute to international debt problems.

The anekdot serves as a discourse of “cultural consciousness,” connecting otherwise atomized people to a homeland, collective culture, and memory. In conducting a paired content and critical discourse analysis of 1,290 anekdoty collected from Russian archives, I explore how this oral folklore served to construct a Russian collective consciousness that (1) resists Party rhetoric, social policy, and ideology, but also (2) adopts and reifies social boundaries established by Soviet discourse by constructing particular groups as “other.” Those who are familiar with cultural folklore—and the historical context to which it refers—are taught who are the perpetrators responsible for injustices, who are the victims, and how we should feel about these different people; folklore also gives insight into the perspectives of those from the hegemonic “center.”"

Loyal to true punk tradition, the band plays loud and harshly, and their lyrics are critical of the surrounding reality: poverty, housing problems, intoxicants and the attitudes towards disabled are brutally slung to the listener's face. ""In The Parliament, they always talk but you can't understand what they say!""  This is what punk used to be about: misfits screaming their lungs out about real problems.

All this is compounded by short-term thinking on politicians behalf, the fallacy that life in society just as ours is natural, the current trend that capital is more important than the man.

Stock markets are about price discovery for the purpose of allocating risk efficiently. Money markets are about obviating the need for price discovery using over-collateralised debt to reduce the cost of lending. Yet, attempts to reform credit markets in the wake of the recent financial crisis often draw on insights grounded in our understanding of stock markets. This can be very misleading. The paper presents a perspective on the logic of credit markets and the structure of debt contracts that highlights the information insensitivity of debt. This perspective explains among other things why opacity often enhances liquidity in credit markets and therefore why all financial panics involve debt. These basic insights into the nature of debt and credit markets are simple but important for thinking about policies on transparency, on capital buffers and other regulatory issues concerning banking and money markets."

europeans,2wzfxa,weniger,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Abstract  In this paper we argue that the rise of the cyber war metaphor is connected to the spread of the norm of sovereign statehood on the Internet. Although early discourse about the social and political meaning of the Internet prophesied a stateless utopia, the growing importance of digital communication triggered an active proliferation of state-based metaphors. States began not only to seize legal and technical control of the Internet, but also started to shift the discourse on digital affairs, emphasizing typical attributes of statehood, like collective subjectivity, territoriality and hierarchical structuring. This happened through language, and the metaphor of 'cyber war' and the related narrative of sovereign statehood is one of the strongest cases in point. The paper shows how metaphors and narratives work and why they are so important by, firstly, giving an introduction into the role of metaphors in discourse and cognition, then sketching the role metaphors play in the  particular discourse on the internet and finally examining how especially pacific and Internet- friendly states, like Estonia, Hungary and Germany, deploy the ‘cyber war’ metaphor."

So what do we know and what do we not know about these elusive components of the cosmos?  The simple answer is that we don't know much about dark matter and even less about dark energy.  However, that could change quite soon thanks to groundbreaking research being done by scientists at ESA and CERN, home to the world's foremost particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider. The LHC's discovery three years ago of the Higgs Boson set researchers on a voyage of discovery to the dark side of the Universe. They are about to fire up the colossal accelerator again this year, and for the first time at full power. That extra energy is what's giving optimism for new revelations about dark energy and dark matter.

In so doing, it attempts to grasp the tension between the postnational articulations of membership, both as normative expectations and institutional construction, and the post/neocolonial condition as expressed in the politics of citizenship and migration in today’s Europe. I argue that the exclusion and exploitation of postcolonial migrants have both underpinned and betrayed the EU’s ambition to re-establish Europe as a leading ‘normative power’ committed to the value of human rights. When shifting the focus from EU citizenship and its reproduction of differential inclusion and essentialist cultural identity to migrant subjectivity, the paper engages with the emerging field of critical citizenship studies which sees migrant mobilisations as sites of contesting and enacting citizenship. However, it further argues that this emancipatory intent is continuously disrupted by the fact that the employment of the discourse of rights centred on performativity and universality often has to be mediated through the categories of race, religion, culture and the colonial legacy. Thus a critical cosmopolitanism needs to start with acknowledging, rather than masking, the paradoxes in itself."

europeans,2wnna6,weniger,2,Sat Feb 21 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"Abstract  In Russia, conspiracy theories involving clandestine and sinister external actors are widespread. Many of these theories are geopolitical in nature, involving antagonism toward Russia because of its vast territory and natural resources. Other theories are underpinned by Russia’s differing Orthodox civilization. To a large extent, these theories replace the concept of “international class struggle,” which was once a Soviet mainstay justifying the inevitable confrontation between the Soviet Union and the West. Alarmingly, many of these new theories have permeated Russia’s education space, where they are intended not only to shape knowledge but to secure the political loyalty of Russia’s youth.  In this memo, I analyze this phenomenon by examining textbooks on “geopolitics” used in Russian universities. Using the Russian State Library online catalogue, I identified 86 such textbooks written by 61 authors, then reduced the list to works by 44 of them. I analyzed the books’ educational context, assessed the prevalence of conspiracy theories within them, and categorized the most prominent. I found that approximately half the authors of these textbooks resort to conspiracy theorizing.  Most geopolitical textbooks that include conspiracy theories portray the United States as the primary conspirator against Russia and, accordingly, as a threat to Russia’s existence, independence, and territorial integrity. Other conspirators cited include China, Germany, and Japan, as well as certain “alliances” of states in international organizations and the Muslim world. Beyond risks to Russia’s territorial integrity, some theories outline support for ethnic and/or religious separatist movements in and around Russia. Since the mid-2000s, many textbooks have also denunciated a supposed “fifth column” inside Russia.    Also on academia.edu."
europeans,2wpa3l,Aschebescher,3,Sat Feb 21 22:45:54 2015 UTC,"That was the last article I expected to read about the Greek finance minister. I googled around and he explained what happened.   Before reading on, I should tell you  that the undersigned was purged from Australian state radio (SBS-Radio) on a charge of ‘antisemitic’, on-air, commentary. The formal complaint was tabled by an organisation called ICJS Research (Issues of Concern for Justice & Society) that was formed, according to its website, in order “to express the concerns of Australian citizens about a broad range of issues such as terrorism, appeasement, tolerance, war and justice in society.” The specific charge against me was (a) a claim that Israel used the blockade of Gaza as part of “a strategy for retaining a large part of the West Bank” and (b) my reference to the ‘security barrier’ as a “concrete monster”. The fact that my comments were supported by reports in the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz was not deemed a sufficient defence against the charge of antisemitism.  Once the decision to terminate my weekly radio broadcast, after sixteen years of broadcasting, was reached, this is how the station’s representative explained it in a letter to the plaintiff: “The particular anti-Israeli line of his commentary could be reasonably held to have assisted in the promotion of negative stereotypes about Jews, and more particularly, Israeli Jews.” And this is how the Australian Jewish News summed up the outcome: “It is the first acknowledgment by SBS that portraying Israel in a bad light is the same as negative stereotyping of blacks or women, that it does harm to people.”   (Edit: Varoufakis' full comment is here. He mentions what many Israelis and international human rights organisations say.)  Then suddenly the German finance minister makes a guest appearance. So it's the supposedly antisemitic Greek against the protective German, in an article that has nothing to do with finance. That Greco-German feud seems to have deeply penetrated the media. I guess that we should expect to see Varoufakis and Schäuble making guest appearances on cooking recipes too, with authors taking turns exalting zwiebelkuchen and spanakopita.  On a more serious note, while the recent events should worry us, succumbing to fear mongering is the last thing we want to happen in Europe. The author wrote this.   The value that a state places on its institutions can be seen in the budget they are given. The funding Germany's domestic intelligence agency currently lacks was negotiated away to expanded social services when Chancellor Angela Merkel was putting together her current coalition government. Pension benefits to women to took time off to raise children, for example, or payments to mothers choosing to stay home rather than put their little ones in daycare.    Oh look, instead of fighting the bad terrorists we fund watercolour paintings. We must hate the police then! The problem with the author's logic is that terrorism is not a natural part of everyday life, while raising children is. Terrorism is the exception, not the rule. Taking care of children and making them tolerant is more effective that arming everything under the sun. Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be vigilant against offenders, but there is a reason why we have a system of checks and balances in place."

Given that the Crimean crisis is but one of many other sovereignty conflicts currently existent around the world, why not thinking of this particular dispute as an example towards peaceful multilateral understanding through multilateral dialogue and negotiations?  We are used to seeing and accepting as fact that in one territory there is one population governed by an ultimate authority, with a common legal bond or system of norms. What would happen if that one territory and population had two ultimate and hierarchically equal sovereigns (legally speaking) and, at the same time, two valid sets of norms? Would it be possible, for instance, that Israel and Palestine had sovereign authority at the same time over Jerusalem? Would it be possible that Argentina and the United Kingdom were at one time sovereign over the territory and population of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands? What about Russia and Ukraine having the same degree of sovereign power over Crimea? If the answer was positive, what would the consequences be — in terms of territory, population, government and law?  I propose to see these conflicts from a different yet broad perspective rather than as conflicts between separate and independent rights. Therefore, I view the problem as a distributive justice issue following the work of Rawls. This article aims to explore if a solution that certainly is desirable can also be possible and may offer a peaceful way of solving sovereignty conflicts through the use of principles of distributive justice."

The availability and the provision of Financial Assistance under this Agreement, including pursuant to the Facilities (as defined below) made available under the Facility Specific Terms (as defined below), shall, unless otherwise specified, be conditional upon (i) the Beneficiary Member State's compliance with the measures set out in the MoU and (ii) the Guarantors deciding favourably, on the basis of the findings of the regular assessments carried out by the Commission in liaison with the ECB in accordance with the Council Decision of the European Union on the basis of Articles 126(9) and 136 of TFEU on 12 July 2011 (which recast the former Council Decision 2010/320/EU of 10 May 2010 as amended), that the economic policy of the Beneficiary Member State accords with the adjustment programme and with the conditions laid down by the Council in the Decision and any other conditions laid down by the Council or in the MoU.   Time for an explanation.  Greece and its creditors signed a Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement. Greece will receive financial assistance when the creditors give the green light. What do the creditors seek? Compliance with the criteria set out in a Memorandum of Understanding, which is linked to the Agreement. This MoU essentially says ""we will fund you if you do this and that"". But this is not something that can't change, because the conditions change.  By now we've established that a) there is Greek reluctance in following through with some measures set out in the MoU, and b) that the targets set out by the creditors were not realistic. IMF already admitted its mistakes, some measures made things worse. Juncker said on behalf of the European Commission that the EC-ECB-IMF troika sinned against the dignity of the people of Greece, Portugal, and Ireland. ECB's Draghi shows that he won't pull the plug on ELA for Greek banks, disregarding a vocal board minority.  Back to the ""unless otherwise specified"" bit. For a number of reasons, Greece did not always strictly comply with MoU criteria but still received assistance. So the MoU is not absolute, it was ""otherwise specified"" many times. The problem with Germany and a few other countries is political, not financial. It's understandable, the Greeks have their own electorate at home, the Germans, the Finns and others have theirs. The problem is that if one pushes too hard, the whole building might collapse. Germany should think twice about that.  Via the same Twitter user, I've found a transcript of an short interview with Greek Finance Minister's mentor. I can't help but think that this guy knows what Varoufakis' plan B might be.  Excerpt:   [Schäuble] does not have the final say on this, though he imagines that he does. This is a decision which can be taken, for example, by what's called ""enhanced cooperation"". In the European Union that's a procedure which does not need unanimity, and Angela Merkel has used this to propose the Financial Transaction Tax, to bypass David Cameron. Other European member states who want recovery, such as France and Italy and Poland, and also the UK, George Osborne, could use that procedure now, to bypass Schäuble and Merkel.  You know, Schäuble doesn't know very much economics, but what is even more surprising is he's ignorant what the European institutions can do. I've just tried to explain that already: he thinks the German taxpayer has to pay, the German taxpayer doesn't have to pay anything. European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund borrowing to recover the European economy, does not count on Germany's national debt."

europeans,2wbb8y,weniger,3,Wed Feb 18 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"Abstract  Why are heavy metal bands so interested in the figure of Alexander the Great? The present article develops the argument that there are two overshadowing reasons: (1) the bands reconstruct the figure as a symbol of masculine power and communal unity; and (2) Alexander becomes part of a larger tradition already at an early stage of heavy metal’s history that many bands were interested in maintaining and revisiting. Several heavy metal tracks about him are explored and examined to substantiate this hypothesis. It is shown how these tracks associate him with a number of interrelated, recurring themes, such as conquest, community, imperialism, legacy, masculinity, nationalism, power and unity. These in turn help to project him as a figurehead of warrior virtues and also as a heroic bringer of culture. This is particularly true for Greek heavy metal bands, and their contribution is analysed at length. It is demonstrated how Greek metal songs also offer an intriguing insight into Greece’s political conflicts. Finally, it is suggested that, in his role as a powerful culture-hero and king, Alexander is capable of becoming an allegory for heavy metal itself.     Yes, you read right. There is an International Society for Metal Music Studies and Metal Music Studies is their new journal. This had to be here, European metalheads rejoice."

After this things changed, although Greenland remained important in Danish-US relations under the umbrella of NATO. Nowadays, the geostrategic position of Greenland between North America and Europe is gaining fresh prominence in the race for natural resources in the Arctic. Many issues arise from the prospective opening of the Arctic, all of which may have fateful impacts on future development in the region. Climate change, claims related to the extension of the continental shelf, exploitation and exploration of natural resources, together with the protection of indigenous peoples are all current issues that must be taken into consideration in the context of security and foreign policy formation in Greenland. The future of the Thule Air Base is also relevant. This article reviews developments from the World War II to the present regarding international relations from a Greenlandic perspective. As a self-governing sub-national territory within the realm of Denmark, Greenland does not have the ultimate decision-making power within foreign and security policy. The new Self-Government Act of 2009, however, gives Greenland some room for manoeuvre in this respect."

europeans,2vn2qf,weniger,1 point,Thu Feb 12 10:41:06 2015 UTC,"Info  Europe has long been regarded as one of the most attractive destinations for migrants from all over the world. People come here, not only to escape oppression and to improve their lives, but also in response to invitations from the European countries themselves. For many years, Western governments responded to the needs of their dynamically developing economies by opening their borders to guest workers, however, the economic calculations these governments made, failed to take into account the social and cultural implications of these migrations. One particular belief, which has since been disproved, is that one day all of the newcomers would return home, taking all of the difficult questions surrounding their presence with them.  These hopes never materialised and various policies towards migrants have proved inefficient – a fact now acknowledged by even the most eminent European politicians. Not so long ago, David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy almost simultaneously announced the failure of multiculturalism in their countries. The accuracy of this diagnosis is reflected in the growing influence of radically anti-immigrant parties all over the continent. Negative, often populist rhetoric concerning the other has become a permanent feature of the European political landscape. Are the old ghosts coming back with a vengeance or are we facing an entirely new phenomenon?  Europe needs to face the challenges presented by the integration and assimilation of the other – a fact as true in Western as in Eastern Europe. How can this goal be accomplished – by political means, cultural exchanges or maybe social transfers? Finding the European equilibrium will be difficult because the European Union – unlike the United States – does not see itself as a land of immigrants. In this conflict with the other we can also see a visible tension between the right of the individual to be treated with respect and the right of communities to protect their own cultures.  “Instead of stigmatising immigrants, it’s necessary to boost their sense of belonging to the new country. Otherwise, their frustrations and their sense of exclusion will only worsen”, said the philosopher Charles Taylor in an interview with Kultura Liberalna. Yet, how can we achieve this goal without antagonising citizens who are already expressing their exasperation by voting for radical parties? Or maybe we shouldn’t worry. Maybe the rumours about the death of the European multicultural project are still greatly exaggerated?  Moderation  Tomasz Sawczuk, Kultura Liberalna.

europeans,2vhbbt,weniger,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:40:05 2015 UTC,"Abstract  We take a first pass at quantifying the magnitudes of debt relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1979-2010, focusing on credit events in emerging markets, and 1920-1939, documenting the official debt hangover in advanced economies that was created by World War I and its aftermath. We examine the economic performance of debtor countries during and after these overhang episodes, by tracing the evolution of real per capita GDP (levels and growth rates); sovereign credit ratings; debt servicing burdens relative to GDP, fiscal revenues, and exports; as well as the level of government debt (external and total). Across 45 crisis episodes for which data is available we find that debt relief averaged 21 percent of GDP for advanced economies (1932-1939) and 16 percent of GDP for emerging markets (1979-2010), respectively. The economic landscape after a final debt reduction is characterized by higher income levels and growth, lower debt servicing burdens and lower government debt. Also ratings recover markedly, albeit only in the modern period."

europeans,2vhbbt,arte_misia,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"No, that would be ""controlling for the stimulus from debt relief seldom forms a part of the growth accounting following debt crisis episodes"".   The conclusion is that debt relief works for advanced economies. It has happened before and it will happen again, the markets don't grant eternal pariah status to those economies and continue to do business as usual after a transition.   Advanced economies in the 1930s, like many modern emerging markets, also resorted to default and restructuring as part of their toolkit to deal with a massive debt overhang in economic hard times. The magnitudes of debt relief delivered from the debt write offs are of comparable magnitudes and, in most cases, quantitatively important (even by conservative estimates).  As to the aftermath of restructuring, the general picture that emerges is that, once the restructuring is completed decisively, the economic panorama tends to improve in terms of growth, debt servicing burdens, debt sustainability (higher growth lower debt), and international capital market access."

The research analyses EU law and its relationship with national provisions regarding the criminalisation of irregular migration and of acts of solidarity vis-á-vis irregular migrants.

By considering the role of public trust in fostering compliance with the law, the paper explores the impact of criminalisation measures on institutions’ authority to compel individuals to comply with the law (institutional legitimacy).  The study finds that certain indicators question institutional legitimacy and reveals the varied nature and extent of penalties imposed by different member states.

A domino effect ensued and we have to face the consequences today.

The same thing is going on as far as history goes."
europeans,2v1yrj,ironheel,2,Sat Feb 7 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will try to actually answer your questions because you clearly put some effort into that post ;)  I'm German and live in Germany.   Yes, definitely. For the obvious historical reasons. I don't know how racist my country really is, though. But according to the table on page 125 of this document, it is pretty racist. That was not my impression. Well, mostly it's fear of anything unknown. An immigrant from Denmark would be welcomed with open arms, because Denmark is pretty similar to Germany. Within the EU there is freedom of movement between the member states because we all know and trust each other. And I guess that's because we share certain values like democracy, civil rights, equality before the law, some sort of gender equality, separation of powers, separation of state and church and liberal societies (no laws about moral behavior, e.g. no law against sex between two consenting men). Let's call those ""Western values"". So, I don't think that Europeans resent outsiders, but rather that they feel superior, because Europe basically invented all those ideas (along with the US maybe). Another thing is of course that Europeans at one point in history basically controlled the entire earth. And people like to think, we're still that great. When an immigrant comes, it's somehow expected that they first prove themselves worthy of Europe. Most European countries are very homogeneous. And homogeneous countries are great in theory. Look at Finland, of all EU countries they have the smallest amount of foreign citizens. And they are regularly at the top of various international rankings. But the reality is, there are immigrants in Europe. It doesn't even matter much, how they got here. They're here now and we can't just send them away. Europe never had an immigration culture like the US or Australia. Europe never really tried to integrate its immigrants. The many North-African immigrants in France are basically all poor and uneducated (that's of course a bit exaggerated) and they have trouble participating in society. Currently, Europe is struggling to integrate the existing immigrants. There aren't even that many new immigrants except for a few war refugees who normally don't have any trouble getting an asylum. So, no, nobody is forcing multiculturalism. We already have enough cultures in Europe and enough bickering in the EU. But some changes are necessary to make immigrants participate in society. For example, some Christmas markets in Germany have changed their name to ""lmarket of lights"". So that Muslims will come there as well. Combating extremist Islam is easy. Just make sure people are educated and live in prosperity. It's always the same people who become extremists (whether Muslim or right-wing doesn't matter): unsatisfied young men. Men who feel that society doesn't respect them. Men who feel they're missing out. The ISIS recruitment videos look like adventure camp. Islam, too, is to blame as it channels these desires into very unproductive directions. What Europe definitely doesn't need is more religion. Yes, patriotism is look down upon in Germany. But not so much in other countries. For example the French are quite proud of their country. The Germans secretly also think that Germany is the best country in the world but they rarely say it. Making fun of other countries is completely acceptable. All European countries do it all the time. Though mostly they probably make fun of themselves.   Taking pride in the country where your parents were born is something I'm afraid I will never understand, though. Like, ...why?"

europeans,2v1yrj,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:43:44 2015 UTC,"Hey Guten-tag! and thank you for your response. It was very informative.   Germans (after Croatians of course) are my favourite people in Europe and it saddens me that you can no longer sing ""Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles"". I think its time that people stopped seriously associating German pride with Nazism. Unfortunately for next few generations there will be many jokes about nazis (theres a similar situation in the Balkans, but at least its restricted to the Balkans. Germans can get laughed at anywhere in the world and almost no one is alive from that period anymore). It is true that Europeans controlled most of the Earth at one time. I also don't like to immediately surrender to the idea that it was completely bad for the colonies. The example I like to use is Croatia under the Astro-hungarians. Yes we didnt have sovereignty and yes we had to fight to be treated the same as Austrians but in the end Croatia ended up much better off. Our cities were built up, we had a technological and cultural boost. Eventually Zagreb became one of the 3 capitals of the Astro-Hungarian empire.   Now compare the Aboriginal Australians. There is a lot of pressure for people to believe that they lived in harmony with nature and each other before the British came. If this is true they would be the ony people in history to so. Every other civilisation has had master nature in order to survive.   Now the plight of natives under colonies is common knowledge to pretty much everyone with a university education. What they fail to mention is that the Europeans dramatically built up Australia for the better. They unified the aboriginals (so no more tribal warfare), new foods and cultures were introduced as well as advanced medicine. In some case, even fire was re-introduced to tribes that had forgotten how to make it.  Now to be fair, I'm not advocating for the old colonies to be introduced. I just wanted to make the point that there was a lot of good that came about. But thank you for this.   I agree. Once migrants have entered your lands you cannot kick them out. It would be inhumane and immoral.    When I say ""forcing"" multiculturalism I am basically asking the questions ""When were the German people asked if they wanted their borders opened?"". The answer of course is never, and the same applies for almost all countries. Multiculturalism has very real (not necessarily bad, but real nonetheless) consequences. When you let tens of thousands of foreigners into your country you permanently change the culture.   One example I use a lot is ""White Australia"". Prior to the 1960's Australia had a ""White Australia"" policy. Only British, Irish and Western Europeans were allowed into the country. This created a unique culture which existed for about 70 years. The Government without asking for the peoples consent abolished this policy and opened the borders to all potential migrants. This resulted in that unique culture being forced to adapt to new circumstances.  Some people would say that the policy was racist and i would agree with them. But now you have a people who grew up after the war with a single homogenous cuture. A multicultural society was created without a vote in the hopes of turning Australia into a utopia. They are now old and will die in a country and culture they are unfamiliar with. Some changed successfuly but a lot didnt.  I do agree with you when you say Europe needs better integration policies. The last thing you want is to balkanise Europe.    My mention of religion is in regards to the battle for the ""soul of Europe"". I no longer believe that properity and education is enough. Regardless of your religious beliefs, spirituality is very important aspect of humanity often overlooked by people (especially academics). Whilst I agree that prosperity and education are important and necessary people require an identity and purpose in life. The kind of identity and purpose I am talking about can only really come from religion.   This is not to say that I do not value skepticism. To give you some context: I am a devout Catholic, my closest friend is an equally strong Atheist and a soon to be academic. We were discussing music (he is a professional pianist) and worried that without religion humanity would never had produced some of its greatest musical works. I argued that atheism had only become mainstream in the last century. He said that whilst with time there may very well be brilliant atheist composers you will never get anyhting close to an atheistic version of the sistine chapel, allegri's miserere mei or Notre Dame cathedral.  This is why I believe Europe should revive its Christian identity (but I did not come here to start a religious argument)   Making fun of each other? I love that. It's something Australia (and probably the US) lacks severely. They will disagree with me and say they do make fun of each other but it's not the same. For example, I'm sure that if you lived in a country town in Germany there would be a funny story/stereotype about all the other towns. Australia hasnt really had the time to develop this yet.   and to answer your question about being proud of where my parents are from:  It is very difficult to explain and I completely understand how some people would find this concept difficult to understand. Why take pride in something you had no control over?  You my friend sound very well read and your English is fantastic.  I assume that you have read books by authors who have long since passed away. These authours may very well have shaped and influenced you in some way. If this authour was particularly important to you but also realtively unknown you would react with excitement everytime you a reference to them. In essence, this author has helped you form your own identity.  I take pride in Croatia for similar reasons. Everything about my identity can be traced back to there. I take pride in it because I see myself in the culture over there. Even though I have lived in Australia most of my life I feel a closer connection to Croatian culture than Australian. This is something i did not choose (and it is important to mention that).  I hope this answer helps. I have struggled with this question most of my life and this is the best answer i can come up with.  danke for your answer!"

europeans,2uz45q,weniger,3,Fri Feb 6 11:17:00 2015 UTC,"Legal opinion commissioned by the Chamber of Labour, Vienna (in cooperation with the Austrian Trade Union Federation, the European Trade Union Confederation and the European Trade Union Institute).    Author  Prof. Dr. Andreas Fischer-Lescano, LL.M. (EUI)  Centre of European Law and Politics (ZERP) - Faculty of Law, University of Bremen    Abstract  As members of the Troika, the European Commission and the European Central Bank are bound by EU primary law, which includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Memoranda of Understanding concluded by the Troika therefore have to be in conformity with the European system of competences and human rights. The Memoranda of Understanding impact on fundamental rights, such as the human right to housing and social security, the human right to health and rights steaming from the European labor constitution. Specific examples are interference in medical care (higher charges on prescription drugs) and in the wage bargaining systems of individual states, thus eroding tariff autonomy. This raises fundamental questions of human rights conformity. Moreover, because the European Parliament is not involved, it is questionable whether the measures observe the principle of democracy and the EU’s system of competence.    Summary of main conclusions  1. The European bodies and institutions are bound to comply with EU law even during the financial crisis. There is no state of emergency that suspends EU law. In their own institutional interests, the EU institutions must take vital social issues affecting Union citizens seriously.  2. The Commission and the ECB have fundamental rights obligations under international human rights codifications and customary international law as well as the CFR. The essential obligations are derived in particular from the CFR, the ECHR, the UN Social Covenant, the RESC and the ESC.  3. Through their involvement in the signature of the MoUs, the ECB and the Commission are encroaching on many of the rights protected by those norms. Although MoUs cannot formally be regarded as international law within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute, as sui generis legal acts they encroach on rights protected by those codifications.  4. Through their involvement in the negotiation, signature and implementation of the MoUs, the EU institutions are infringing primary law. They are acting unlawfully. Specifically, the following rights are being breached: rights to freedom to choose an occupation, freedom of collective bargaining and remuneration for work under Articles 27 to 32 CFR in conjunction with Articles 1 to 6 and 24 RESC, Articles 6 to 8 UN Social Covenant, Article 11 ECHR, Article 27 UN Disability Convention and the ILO core labour standards; the human right to housing and social security under Article 34 CFR in conjunction with Articles 12 and 13 RESC, Articles 9 and 11 of the UN Social Covenant and Articles 2, 3, 8 and 14 ECHR; the human right to health under Article 35 CFR in conjunction with Article 11 RESC, Article 12 of the UN Social Covenant, Articles 2, 3 und 8 ECHR and Article 25 of the UN Disability Convention; the human right to education under Article 14 CFR in conjunction with Articles 9 and 10 RESC, Article 2 Protocol 1 ECHR, Article 13 UN of the Social Covenant, Article 24 of the UN Disability Convention and Article 28 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ; the human right to property under Article 17 CFR in conjunction with Article 1 Protocol 1 to the ECHR and the right to good administration under Article 41 CFR in conjunction with Article 6 ECHR. The encroachments cannot be considered justified, for the following reasons:   In their actions the Commission and the ECB are breaching the general rules of EU law. In so far as the MoUs lay down conditions for remuneration for work, the right of association, the right to strike and the right to impose a lockout, they are infringing Article 153(5) TFEU, since the Commission and the ECB have no collective powers in that respect. In implementing the MoUs the EU institutions are also acting ultra vires in the fields of education, health and social policy. Furthermore the institutional competences under EU law are being disregarded, since the European Parliament is not sufficiently involved under the ESM Treaty. The encroachments on the above human rights are also not substantively justified. The measures ignore the fact that financial and social stability are indivisible. They are disproportionate and to a certain extent contrary to the substance of the fundamental rights, they infringe the prohibition on discrimination and fail to meet the procedural requirements laid down in EU law for fundamental rights encroachments.   5. Claims of breaches of those human rights can, firstly, be brought in national courts, European courts and committees, but international proceedings are also possible:   At European level, apart from referral to the Ombudsman under Article 228 TFEU, an action for annulment in the ECJ might be appropriate. In particular the European Parliament, as a privileged plaintiff in those proceedings (for which there is, however, a two-month time limit), might bring an action both for disregard of collective and institutional powers in the signature of the MoUs and also for the breaches of human rights, since, as ‘acts’ of the EU institutions, the MoUs are suitable subject - matter for proceedings within the meaning of Article 263 TFEU. Proceedings cannot (yet) be brought directly against the EU in the ECtHR and the European Economic and Social Committee. However, they can be instituted not only against the States implementing the MoUs but also against the States that, for instance, are failing to fulfil their human rights obligations in the ESM. Internationally, the breaches of the law can be pursued in the ILO and before the UN committees. Here again, it is true that – apart from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – direct action cannot be taken against the EU, but it is possible to take action against the States implementing the MoUs (before the UN Social Committee against Spain and Portugal in particular) and also against the States that are failing to fulfil their protection obligations in the IOs. Issues relating to the compatibility of austerity measures with human rights and the human rights obligations of international organisations could also be referred to the ICJ through a legal opinion procedure.   6. Internationally and in the Council of Europe, the main obstacle to effective legal enforcement with regard to the measures by the EU institutions is the fact that the EU has – apart from the UN Disability Convention – not signed the relevant codifications. It has been announced that the EU will accede to the ECHR and that should therefore be followed by ratification of the RESC and the optional protocol on a collective complaints system and by accession to the UN Covenants (and their optional protocols) and the ILO. That would also ensure that more consideration was given to the codifications and the decisions of the relevant enforcement bodies in EU law."

europeans,2ushci,weniger,2,Wed Feb 4 20:19:01 2015 UTC,"Abstract  This paper examines the legal and political course of contemporary secession struggles within the European Union, with particular reference to the recent Scottish referendum, the 'consultation' in Catalonia, and the developing situation in Flanders. The focus is upon the way in which secession debates have become tied up with the question of the EU membership prospects of the potentially seceding state. The EU institutions themselves have adopted an attitude of 'conservative neutrality' to these prospects and to the legitimacy of secession more generally – a minimalist approach which largely defers to the various and differing domestic constitutional arrangements of the ‘parent’ state and which, at best, does not exclude new membership where secession may be compatible with these domestic arrangements. The paper contrasts the unwillingness of the EU to assume a directorial role in the theatre of European secession – an attitude which has some anomalous consequences but which accurately reflects the EU’s weak legitimacy over such a ‘high political’ question – with its highly significant role in the more elementary matter of stage (re) design. For the very existence and development of the EU as a supranational entity, alters the basic calculus through which we attribute value – both instrumental and expressive – to forms of political life at, above and below the level of the state. And while the full historical consequences of the EU’s reframing exercise remain unsettled and unpredictable, they are already reshaping political expectations and aspirations in ways that alter our very sense of the significance of 'secession' and associated statuses."
