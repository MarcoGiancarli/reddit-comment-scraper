drunkvapes,3duo6p,fivehate102,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:42 2015 UTC,Damnit. I couldn't read your chicken scratch honey
drunkvapes,3duo6p,caepha,2,Sun Jul 19 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"huh, ive never seen sip of sunshine in the big bottles like that. ive only seen the 4 pack of cans."
drunkvapes,3duo6p,caepha,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:30 2015 UTC,They release them at some Lawson event every year. Got some in a trade with a guy who went. Just as good imo.

drunkvapes,3duo6p,Nigelfish90,2,Mon Jul 20 00:05:07 2015 UTC,Me neither. Cans are just better for when you're out. That's the only difference I can see. Cheers

drunkvapes,3dov63,DenverNugs,2,Sat Jul 18 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"this stuff is so damn good. Just bought a second 6'er, since I blasted through the first one."
drunkvapes,3dov63,tendoman,2,Sat Jul 18 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"I work for the distributor that carries that here in VA and Jesus we went through THOUSANDS of cases in no time flat. I have a Shoppers that burned through 50 cases in two weeks. We've been out of stock because the brewery had to redesign the package to make the alcohol percentage more visible to consumers.  It's back in now, oh and heads up keep an eye out for another root beer beer made by Coney Island Brewing, they just got picked up by the Boston Beer Company and will be rolling out soon, taste tests said people were digging that one over Not Your Father's which will be interesting to see. Sorry just got super stoked that I saw one of my products on Reddit haha"
drunkvapes,3dov63,TheBeerDude,2,Sat Jul 18 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"I work for a distributor as well, but not one that carried NYFRB. Was talking to the sales guy for this, and they are having a hard time keeping it in stock. Not surprising. A few weeks ago there were only a few stores in the area that actually were able to carry it. Its rolled out a bit more, an d sales are through the roof apparently. Its too bad my company didnt pick it up, we would have made a killing. Haha."
drunkvapes,3dov63,tendoman,2,Sat Jul 18 02:24:46 2015 UTC,Anheuser distributor by chance?
drunkvapes,3dov63,TheBeerDude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:31 2015 UTC,Yarp
