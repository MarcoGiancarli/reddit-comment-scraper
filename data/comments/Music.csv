Sadly, I am not a fan anymore. A group of Juggalos decided to come to the concert, DESTROY the bar it was in, and then laugh as they left. This was fully encouraged by the last remaining band member. They literally ripped the ceiling down, destroyed every piece of furniture, threw it all in a pile in the middle of the room and proceeded to throw each other onto the pile. The owner of the bar was bawling her eyes out as the concert ended and all those bitches left laughing."

The band showed up without the singer (he was coming seperately from NY). All of the other bands played and the place had a pretty good crowd, but the singer was a no-show. His band played a few songs (they were hired guns from another band) and that was it. We all started to break down (it was well past midnight) when he walks through the door and wants to play! The crowd was gone, bands were leaving, and the bar was closing, so the guy who set up the gig told him he blew it. The singer insisted on getting paid just for showing up hours after they were supposed to play. After a twenty minute argument, the owner very courteously told him to go screw. It was a strange night."

Music,3e2g9o,chiggerskido,4,Tue Jul 21 15:47:09 2015 UTC,Tornado of Souls is on my top 5 favorite Megadeth songs of all time.
Music,3e2g9o,ErroneousEric,30,Tue Jul 21 17:37:34 2015 UTC,I saw them on their 25th anniversary tour for this album. Best concert ever.
Music,3e2g9o,jojorobo,9,Tue Jul 21 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"I saw Megadeth live for RIP when it came out - they were part of the ""Clash of the Titans"" tour with Alice In Chains, Anthrax, and Slayer.  ""RIP"" era Megadeth is without a doubt the tightest live band I've ever seen.  They were absolutely FLAWLESS."
Music,3e2g9o,bigbabysurfer,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Best Megadeth album in my opinion. Every song had something different to offer. If you like Marty Friedman' ""exotic"" sound listen to Lucretia on the same album"
Music,3e2g9o,VoodooWaffle,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:09 2015 UTC,That's one of his best solos. Tornado of Souls is definitely a classic but Lucretia has some of his most interesting melodies and phrases.
Music,3e2g9o,DrSvarheeny,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:09 2015 UTC,Agreed! Lucretia also features the elusive 15/16 time signature during the verses.
Music,3e2g9o,monarc,12,Tue Jul 21 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Lucretia has my favorite solo that I've ever heard, and I've been listening to most manners of heavy metal for a decade. Marty's section straddles the line between beauty and straight fucking ridiculousness in a way I haven't heard again."
Music,3e2g9o,ShakeItTilItPees,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"haha i like that description.  Something I learned from listening to what Marty Friedman does is superimposing a fuller harmony on top of power chords. The backing rhythm for his solos are just power chords/5th chords. Friedman treats them as if they're 7ths, alt chords, diminished, etc.  By doing that, his lines take on a very rich harmony and it sounds like a borderline jazz solo. He hits the guide tones and breaks out of the standard pentatonic sound that's so common in metal guitar solos. That's where his exotic sound comes from. Not to mention he is a very tasty player to begin with.   I think Lucretia and Tornado of Souls are perfect examples. He plays to the changes and really EXTRACTS all of their JUICES."
Music,3e2g9o,DrSvarheeny,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, every one of those solos on the album was blistering.  That album is bad ass, start to finish.  Earth's population loves Polaris."
Music,3e2g9o,Voodoogumbo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:30:13 2015 UTC,A true classic.  I've seen Megadeth live 3 times and they didn't play Holy Wars until the last time I saw them in St. Louis last year - and it rocked (of course).  Friedman's acoustic bridge is without compare.  My brother once turned in the lyrics for this song for a poem assignment in Junior High English class... Let's just say the teacher wasn't amused ;)
Music,3e2g9o,stratogod,2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I've seen them twice once for the 20th anniversary for the Rust in peace album where they played the whole album(and then some) and the other was for the Big 4 show in California.
Music,3e2g9o,cody180sx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:13 2015 UTC,I would be curious to know what shows they didn't play Holy Wars. It's been their closing song for at least the last 10 years.

He moved on to heavier stuff but still attributes RIP as his inspiration."

Music,3e2g9o,Tagrineth,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"This album is Megadeth's masterwork and a brilliant thrash metal monster.

Music,3e2g9o,crisden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"The middle section was based off The Punisher, but the beginning and end are pretty much political and religious commentary.

It's a little weird sometimes, honestly, but that's what you expect from Dave Mustaine."

Love the whole way the song is structured too - starts of intense, backs off and gives you a momentary breather and then slow starts building back up to a furious climax with killer riffs and rhythms and soaring solos all along the way.  This back-to-back with Hanger 18 is a hell of a 1-2 punch."

The ""import your playlists"" feature on this new hotness is probably limited to public Grooveshark playlists, which must've been data-mined at some point.

Music,3dyql5,Cormie,14,Mon Jul 20 23:03:07 2015 UTC,Exponential decay doesn't work the way you are implying.  Let's say polonium's half life is 100 days.  It won't be gone in 200 days as that would be linear decay. At 300 days there will still be 12.5% of the original amount remaining and 1% remaining won't be reached until 666 days.  So the concentration at the time of the autopsy can be used to determine the concentration at the time of death so long as there is still a detectable level (and a 100 day half life allows many months to do so).

They would then take a few days to look over our reports and determine if concentration were lethal or contributed to death. Then they would relay the information back to the coroner who would talk with the families.

Music,3dyql5,seign,2429,Mon Jul 20 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"In case the site goes down  Grooveshark co-founder Josh Greenberg, a pioneer in Gainesville’s student startup movement, was found dead in his bed Sunday by his girlfriend in the house they shared. He was 28.  Lori Greenberg, his mother, said Monday he had no health problems and she was told by police who investigated Sunday night that there was no evidence of foul play, injuries or drugs.  She said her son was more relieved than depressed about the settlement that shut down Grooveshark on April 30 since it ended the lawsuit that had been hanging over his head. Several record companies had sued the online music streaming service over copyright violations.  “He was excited about potential new things that he was going to start,” she said.  The medical examiner was performing an autopsy Monday morning and would know if there were obvious problems with Greenberg’s heart or brain, otherwise, toxicology results would be done in two or three months, Lori Greenberg said.  “They are as baffled as I am,” she said.  Josh Greenberg’s girlfriend, Abby Mayer, was away for the weekend and returned to find his body.  “It looked like he was sleeping,” Lori Greenberg said.  Greenberg and Sam Tarantino founded Grooveshark as 19-year-old freshmen at the University of Florida in March 2006. At its peak, the company had up to 40 million users a month and 145 employees, occupying most of the second floor of the Union Street Station in downtown Gainesville and a small office in New York City.  Greenberg helped train other entrepreneurs and computer programmers to get their start in the tech industry through Grooveshark University classes, the Summer with the Sharks internship program and as a partner in the Founders Pad business incubator.  He started MaidSuite with Student Maid founder Kristen Hadeed to provide an online scheduling application for cleaning companies and other service providers and recently helped start the Gainesville Dev Academy to offer computer programming training. He was a founding member of the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce’s Gainesville Technology Council.  In addition to his mother, Greenberg is survived by his younger brother, Jacob, and grandparents, Jerry and Sandy Greenberg. Lori Greenberg, who lives in St. Petersburg, said Josh’s friends would be arranging a memorial service in Gainesville."

I ran over to him and started calling for my grandma to call 911.  I can remember thinking how he was going to yell at me because I was making a big deal about him just slipping or something.  The look on his face... It was so scared; something I had never seen on his face.  I can remember how frail and light he felt as I carefully took him from the little room; how he kept trying to help with his right leg but it was just meaninglessly flailing.  I pulled him out and I used the wall to sit down.  He ended up laying with his head on my chest between my legs with his back on my chest.  We looked each other in the face; eye to eye.

Then I started to slide off the bed like I had no control of my legs. I woke up in the ER. They had given me TPA. I got there in just enough time to not die. I had wet myself, evacuated my colon and was unresponsive. I was lucky. Sadly your grandparent wasn't, but what I can hope to give you, from what I don't remember, is that I wasn't afraid.

My point was that it's quite likely that you quickly realised he was gone. It's kind of a built in instinct or sense or something.   Even if you walked in and found someone dead that you didn't expect to be dead, they look different, they feel different, they are utterly still. You can just immediately tell and all of your instinctual ""avoid dead things"" lights flick on."

I, too, remember my own silence and gritted teeth while watching his last breath, the subsequent call for ""time of death"" from the medical professionals and Catholic prayers from the priest (a great family friend).   Just weeks before, the doctor in charge of dad's case delivered the news that death was inevitable, with only days or weeks left- the brain would be eaten away by lesions.   I was in the room and watched the doctor's face crumple as he conceded that the time had come to where the only solution was to reduce the pain as much as possible.   At the time i was 19 and took the news silently. Nothing for me to do except accept. And hate. Hate cancer so hard.    You know what? My father still had it in him to comfort my mom as she gently cuddled with his broken and misshapen body on the hospital bed.   Even in the spare moments of lucidity through the delirious, medicated and painfulend, he did his best to calm us.   It was heartbreaking to watch him suffer and to see my mom unravel. I held unhealthy rage for several years.   This was nearly 10 years ago. The details are hazy, but the emotions are imprinted.   Grace, though, my dad had it. More than I will.   On a good note, we're all doing well! It got easier for me to bond with people after realizing that death happens no matter what. Live life, y'all."

I imagine her trying to wake him up thinking he was just asleep and maybe even laughing, thinking he was just playing a game.   My friend's brother was a big dude. Huge weight lifter with a complete gym in his parent's basement.  His mother came home and did some laundry then cooked dinner. She saw the basement light on and heard his workout music so she made enough for him as well. She placed the food on the table and went to go get Stephen so he could eat.   When she got to the bottom of the steps, she found him on the bench press with the barbell across his neck.  At fifty plus years old, and weighing all of 120 lbs, she couldn't move the weights (200+ lbs) off of her son.   Not that it would have mattered, she'd been home almost two hours before she went down. He would have suffocated long before she found him, assuming he wasn't already dead when she got home.  Not that that would have mattered either. The coroner said his neck was snapped in half, killing him instantly.   Don't lift weights alone.   Discovering her son in that state...she's not been the same since."

I got up for work and after getting out of the shower, I saw the top of his head still laying down on the couch.  He always slept on the couch since my step mom had left a year ago. Even though all I could see was the top of his head, I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach and I just knew.   I touched his head to wake him and he was cold. Push him to shake him and his whole body just rocked. Skin was pale.   Even if you don't know the second you see them, there's a lot of little signs that point to the terrible truth.   It's definitely a haunting thing to come across.  It would freak me out just to see someone sleeping for a while.  The images stick with you. I'm only thankful that I don't really have dreams, or I'd have probably been haunted in them for a while.  Especially with how 911 wanted me to do CPR despite my descriptions of him.   I couldn't do it on the couch and needed to put him on the floor. I hooked an arm and a leg, and just lifted him off the couch and set him in the floor. He didn't even flex, he was like a board.  And the position he was contorted into from sleeping on the couch. I still have that image burned into my brain.   Sorry, I kind of got off on a tangent there, but I guess what I'm saying is that yes, it was likely very traumatic. However, if it makes you feel better, I highly doubt that she was fooled into thinking he was playing. I'd be willing to bet she knew either immediately or within seconds."

Music,3dyql5,Dr_Terrible,19,Mon Jul 20 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"You forgot pages 2 and 3.   Tarantino could not be reached for comment.  Greenberg was widely regarded as a mentor to budding entrepreneurs and computer programmers, helping people get started in the tech industry through Grooveshark University classes, the Summer with the Sharks internship program and as a partner in the Founders Pad business incubator. He was a founding member of the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce’s Gainesville Technology Council.  Duncan Kabinu said Greenberg was working on another music-related mobile application and they spent Friday together working on the Gainesville Dev Academy, which launched this summer to offer training in computer programming. Kabinu said they wanted to expand on Greenberg’s Grooveshark University by offering it to the community so people could improve their skills and their lives.  “I think it was just in him to be that guy to help people out,” Kabuni said. “He was always available, as busy as he was, to take the time to mentor people.”  In a prior interview, Augi Lye, founder of the tech companies Trendy Entertainment and ToneRite, said Grooveshark helped put Gainesville on the map as a company known globally.  “I really don’t know anyone who has had more influence than Josh, everything from being a visionary for the amazing technology coming out and training the next generation of developers and entrepreneurs,” he said.  Greenberg started MaidSuite with Student Maid founder Kristen Hadeed to provide an online scheduling application for cleaning companies and other service providers.  Hadeed said they made a pinky promise four years ago to do something together.  “I’m just so glad we did because I learned so much from working with him as such a good friend and just so talented,” she said.  “I think he’s somebody that everybody looked up to. He inspired many people, even beyond his years. He will be missed beyond belief.”  In addition to his mother, Greenberg is survived by his younger brother, Jacob, and grandparents, Jerry and Sandy Greenberg. Lori Greenberg, who lives in St. Petersburg, said Josh’s friends would be arranging a memorial service in Gainesville.  She said her son had a keen intellect and a wonderful sense of humor. He was an animal lover who adored his three cats and was a vegetarian for ethical reasons.  “I call him a legend,” Kabinu said. “It’s weird to say that, but that’s what I think of him because he embodied a lot of what Gainesville innovation and startups and entrepreneurship is for a lot of people.”  “As a community, we definitely rallied behind him and we want to continue his legacy, so to speak, by continuing to be like he was — contribute back, mentor back, provide back. That’s the legacy we should all keep growing to remember him.”"

Grooveshark was one of a kind when it came to the variety of music you could find and easily listen to (without having to worry about seeders for obscure torrents). It's nearly impossible to find lots of the video game and non-English music it had, and the extensive public user playlist database was a goldmine for discovering new stuff. In 2015 it felt like a relic of a different age before DMCA was really enforced and Youtube/Spotify hadn't made filesharing services obsolete. I hope one day in another legal climate a site like it can exist again. From what a read there was a lot of drama and anxiety behind the site, with employee conflicts and shady business, so this news isn't that  surprising."

Also had tons of obscure music and would let me upload my own obscure music when you couldn't find it anywhere else.  As a programmer, I also really admired the sophistication of the site.  It was a fully functioning web app with great performance long before that was ever a thing.  One of the first Flash sites to make a successful translation to HTML5 long before it was even a solid standard.  There aren't any really good alternatives and the music industry is even starting to go after apps that are essentially just YouTube players.  I basically just don't listen to music now and it sucks.  Will miss Grooveshark and I think the cofounder's death is a great loss for the programming community."

I made a pandora station from them a while back and while the station is pretty much shit, it further reinforced that they've really carved out their own unique niche and don't sound much like their contemporaries.

ETID has a great habit of closing out their albums with an amazing song. And make sure you're grabbing the deluxe editions as they have bonus tracks like ""grudge music"", ""business casualty"" and ""goddamn kids these days"" that I know I'd be sad to miss out on.

Hybrid Theory got me to want to find more stuff like it. And every Linkin Park album was the same way for me as a kid, Meteora, Reanimation. Each one just got me more and more into music.   As much as i can say i dislike where LP has been headed since Minutes to Midnight (to be honest, since Reanimation.), i will always love them because they were the first band that got me into actual music."

Downtempo with Ambient elements depending on the artist.  Just One Dance by Caro Emerald. Hard to find artists that have a similar style to Caro. I'd call it Modern Jazz.  Habits (Stay High) by Tove Lo. Video NSFWish. For when I need a bit of sexy energy in my music. Indie/Alt Pop. Odd considering Foster the People are the same genre and sound nothing like her.  Miss You by Foster the People. You've probably heard ""Pumped Up Kicks"" by them at some point. They have the best...I dunno what to even call them...'electronic breaks' in their songs. Indie Pop.  Over the Hills and Far Away by Nightwish. Nightwish started my love for female singers. Goddamn those girls can sing. Symphonic Metal.  Radio by Lana Del Ray. Marry me Lana. Please. Trip Hop. I guess. I had to look that up.  I know you asked for one song and one genre but fuck you no one listens to one genre. If there is someone out there that only likes one kind of music I don't want to meet that person. Side note, why is Pop such a universal qualifier?

Music,3e2hs4,Rattional,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:46 2015 UTC,"If you're playing an instrument that uses multiple clefs, such as the piano, then I'd recommend not learning the letters, as they're different on treble/bass clefs.  If you're planning to learn other instruments in the future, I'd recommend associating the notation with letters, rather than the fingerings.  Otherwise, yes, I'd go with just learning the notes by your finger positions.  Source: Learned treble clef by finger positions on flute and had difficulty adjusting to bass clef when learning piano, and treble clef fingerings on saxophone."
Music,3e2hs4,WritingAScript,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"After a while I started to associate certain notes with their position (I started on alto sax about 10 years ago). If I was talking about it I could look at the note and tell you what it was, but while sight reading I just saw a note and played that fingering. It may also help if you sit down without your instrument and say the note names out loud as you read it to become more comfortable with notation."

Eventually, because of things like people setting themselves on fire at a live show, they were banned in Tel Aviv and took the US by storm for a couple years.   I'm pretty sure they didn't shower once in that time.  They drove coast to coast playing at parties and dives...and over time played a few festivals.  I'm not sure what they are doing now, but holy shit were they the most crazy motherfuckers I have seen live.    Saw them twice in 2009.  First show was at a music store in Portland.  No one had any idea what was going on.  They ended the set on the sidewalk with the lead singer hanging from a street lamp.  Second time was at Sasquatch.  They set up in the pit about halfway through the show.  Lead singer was singing, pants down with the mic in his asshole while the drummer was playing his snare on a rug being passed around in the crowd.  I really had no idea what was happening, but it was glorious.  I can't find any decent versions of their music besides a few youtube clips. Even the albums I have bought on line don't seem to have the original versions of a few of their songs.  I mean, technically it's English, but half of the charm of the band for me (aside from their live show being completely bat shit crazy insane/smelly) was that I'm not sure if they understood what they were saying.   Edited to throw in a few details."

I Like a lot of their older stuff too. They recently (2011, maybe? Recent in my world.) re-released their Some Girls album with some new songs. Some were written ""back in the day"" but never made it onto the album, and others were written recently. The whole album is awesome, but maybe my favorite from it is Tallahassee Lassie.   I also love some of their more chill stuff like Waiting on a Friend and Losing my Touch, the latter of which is on the new Some Girls album.  There are so many great Stones songs it's hard to pick their best. And, at least with me, ""best"" is subjective. I don't consider myself a true music scholar or anything. I just know what I like. And I know I like just about everything the Stones ever did. LOL Way to narrow it down for you, huh? ;-)  edit: reading other people's posts and going, ""Oh yeah! That's my favorite, too!"""

This was during one of their psychedelic phases and isn't for everyone, but it's different and fun.  PS, I just saw them live 2 weekends ago, and if you're wondering... they are incredible live. Arguably the best show I've ever seen."

Music,3e36cq,Sla5021,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"""Having been the subject and willing conspirator of many intentional lies planted in Sonic Youth bios over the years, I know first hand the way album lore can bend reality to its truth. After the infamous Byron Coley originated the SY “Trilogy” myth in the Murray Street bio, we had no choice but to fulfill those expectations with Sonic Nurse. “Why did you decide to make a trilogy?” was always the first question asked in interviews around that time.  But this is Kurt Vile’s bio, and I wont do that to him. Anyway, Kurt does his own myth making; a boy/man with an old soul voice in the age of digital everything becoming something else, which is why this focused, brilliantly clear and seemingly candid record is a breath of fresh air.  Recorded and mixed in a number of locations, including Los Angeles and Joshua Tree, b’lieve i’m goin down… is a handshake across the country, east to west coast, thru the dustbowl history (“valley of ashes”) of woody honest strait forward talk guthrie, and a cali canyon dead still nite floating in a nearly waterless landscape. The record is all air, weightless, bodyless, but grounded in convincing authenticity, in the best version of singer songwriter upcycling. In Kurt’s words, “I wanted to get back into the habit of writing a sad song on my couch, with nobody waiting on me. I really wanted it to sound like it’s on my couch — not in a lo-fi way, just more unguarded and vulnerable.”  For a record that plays like a cohesive acoustic experience, its musicality marks Kurt’s departure from an electric guitar experience to include a range of instrumentation with a large group of players. From the banjo he plays on “I’m an Outlaw” to the piano and lapsteel on “Life Like This,” and the myriad other instruments on other songs, including farfisa, resonator, arps, horns and synth, one never thinks about what exactly yr listening to as it all serves the song.  The heart of the record is “Stand Inside.” The music is quiet and the melody, like a hymn, folds in on itself, and embraces full strength in a sexy, floating forcelessness that slowly gathers into a wave that doesn’t go where you think it will or rather gives in to itself and celebrates a man willing to be defined by a woman and his love for her as witness to each other’s lives… Don’t stand by my side, stand inside gives up roleplaying for true exposure and vulnerability.  It’s a weird, accepting, mature record, acknowledging the inherent immaturity of being a person whether father, husband, partner, adult, musician, not perfect, but compelling for its understanding … that’s life though so sad to say… I love this record, b’lieve i’m goin down.""  Kim Gordon"

Vile is just incredibly talented, and to boot an incredibly warm and genuine person. I had the good fortune to spend father's day in 2014 with him at a Tuneyards show in Philly and it was hands down one of the greatest nights of my life."
