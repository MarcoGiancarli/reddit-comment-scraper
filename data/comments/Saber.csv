Saber,3e2m66,rare_umbreon,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:23 2015 UTC,Well you couldn't have picked a better one to be your first
Saber,3e2m66,SirusRiddler,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"I remember back when I lived in Tokyo, I had to preorder at Sofmap in order to get my hands on the second shipment of the original figma Saber. 2.0 improves on it so much though my favorite it's still Saber Lily."

Saber,3dya3c,RyuDragoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:01 2015 UTC,I bought it locally here in Japan
Saber,3dxdzy,ivoryonyx,4,Mon Jul 20 09:16:21 2015 UTC,"I really like what you did with the image. It's really hard to point out what to change. I do feel like Saber's clothing is a tad too dark for the scenery, then again the brightness of her skin is fine. Is the image quality better in the final version? I can see good amounts of jpeg artifacts (especially on her right shoulder).   I've done similar stuff like this before so I can understand why you'd want feed back before moving any further."
Saber,3dxdzy,ArchadianJudge,2,Mon Jul 20 10:01:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I felt similarly about the darkness of the clothing, I'm just not advanced enough to effectively brighten it without also brightening her face and hair, which are pretty high as-is. I'll see if I can find some methods outside of using the Dodge tool like an amateur.    As for the artifacts, those are definitely present in the Saber render. I removed a good chunk of it through Camera Raw, but I didn't put the noise removal slider all the way up because I felt like it blurred it too much. I actually have a better, larger version of her (though it's not cropped out - it's a .jpg with a white background, as opposed to the transparent background .png I used for this composition), but that would entail making it the exact size as the current render. I have effects and such layered on top, so if it's not exactly the same size, it'll be off. I resized the original render within the .psd by using CTRL+T, so I didn't reduce the size a set amount, I did so arbitrarily. Outside of eyeballing it, do you have any advice as to how I could replace the current Saber render with the better version (with less artifacts)?  I think it's also worth noting that I saved the image with the maximum output settings on Photoshop to avoid additional artifacting. Compared to the .png I saved, I didn't see extra artifacts, so I assume what's there is in the composition itself. Is there any in the background or is it just Saber?"
Saber,3dxdzy,shotstrider,4,Mon Jul 20 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"While it looks damn near perfect now, there's no real reason you couldn't do multiple versions at different saturation levels, or with other little changes.   Just with some five second experimentation on my end:   Dumping the Saturation value to -20 produced a slightly different image where as dropping it to -50 drastically changed the image with out really losing anything in my opinion. The -50 version is more along the lines of what I am used to seeing in Fate art/fanart (dark but with lovely images and good detail) where as the original and the slightly de-saturated version are a refreshing change. As a person I prefer less vibrant images on my desktops as to not blind myself completely if i need to hop on my computer early in the morning. Very slight blurring might be a different idea all together, alas I cant really whip up a basic example as I don't have the psd. It should be relatively obvious when there is way to much blurring though. Hitting the background with a slight Gaussian blur might make it 10x better or 10x worse. .jpg's unless really properly done produce very interesting artifacts, some of which are more obvious than others. To avoid any of this I normally dupe my psd file (to avoid any screwups later) then go in to the duped version and merge all the layers then save as a .png Whether or not this actually helps anything or not I dont know but .png artifacts are really annoying and I never see them when using this method. (They seem to come out when using way to many alpha layers...)   On the flip side I don't see any real rookie mistakes, the pseudo-final you've provided here is fantastically done and any real changes are up to a user such as my self, but options are nice."
Saber,3dxdzy,shotstrider,3,Mon Jul 20 10:50:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I appreciate it. I'll try different saturation levels for sure. Some people may prefer it that way, so I'll include that in the imgur album once everything's done.  As for blurring, I see what you mean. A friend of mine introduced me to the idea a few years back, and it can certainly help hide flaws and make the image look better in general. He did a little mockup of a sky background I needed once and blurring helped make the clouds look more natural - the same could be done here I'm sure. I think I would avoid the grass though, just because it probably shouldn't be blurred unless I wanted to go for a lens effect of some sort, if that makes sense (where the subject is in focus and everything extending radially outwards blurs progressively). I'll play around with it and post up samples.  Edit: What's duping? As mentioned in another reply, I also made sure to output the .jpg on the highest settings possible. I compared it to a .png I saved and didn't see a difference with the artifacts. I'd be interested to know what duping is and how I can reduce any potential artifacts!"
Saber,3dxdzy,shotstrider,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"Duping simply refers to file duplication, i just use it as an anti-screwup measure as i often forget to undo my merge layers only to exit PS and be completely screwed later on.......     Duping in and of itself wont prevent artifact so much as saving major headaches later on.  Artifacts normally come from image compression so using lossy formats (the jpg in older times was culprit #1, its gotten better though.) pngs barely ever artifact but can if layers are un-merged or you've got a subject cut out on a flat colored background. As for preventing them.  They have a nasty tendency to occur around edges and while there are a few little tricks here and there, I've had the best success with just merging layers before saving.  Edit: Also if you (or anyone else for that matter) needs pointers with PS, i'm fairly knowledgeable myself and if I can't help out i know a ton of people who can. (My University has a massive CG department, most of the people who i hang out with are in it.) Just drop me a PM and ill do what I can"
Saber,3dxdzy,shotstrider,3,Mon Jul 20 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"Aah, okay, I see. A little frustrating that we have to manually do something ourselves to make sure we can ""recover."" You'd think they'd have something built in to handle that. Yeah, I tend to be rather paranoid (I've used PS for several years doing basic stuff), so I often make duplicates when making ""destructive"" edits.  As for the artifacts, I'll try re-opening a saved .jpg in Camera Raw to further reduce noise/artifacts, and see how that works out.  Thanks for the offer on PS pointers too - that will definitely help! One thing I was wondering is this: if you don't have material to work with (an image is ""cut off,"" like the Saber render here), what is the best way to approach trying to piecemeal the large missing chunks, like on the right side? I'd like to make a variant where Saber is centered, but I can't due to the right side missing so much of her dress. The left I was able to patch up, but the right is missing too much."
Saber,3dxdzy,mashiriki,3,Mon Jul 20 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"Well for large chunk image fixing there are a variety of ways to go about doing so, alas none of which are sure fire methods (especially on such a large part such as that). I do however have one decent example.  Take this image of Sasha Braus from AoT for example, I wanted the kanji on the image to no longer be there along with the surfboard to be full length so i could use it as an image asset for wallpapers and such.  Step one was relatively easy: removing the kanji. For that you can use a combination of the marquee (square selector), Fill (right click on your selection > Fill), and the smudge tool. This process if done properly is fantastic for image repairing (more examples can be found here in this LoK image set I did a while ago.) Next step is to take the fill data an repair it using the smudge tool and isolated areas to prevent further goofs. Normally I find the pen tool to be fantastic here but any selection tool will work, along with generous helpings 'Crtl+Z', this is a rather tedious process. You should be smudging and blending colors together and after that can rematch any lines with:  The pen tool! This is one of the more nifty devices in your PS arsenal. While its not as useful as it is in Illustrator, the pen tool in photoshop is fantastic at matching curves. In the Sasha Braus example I used it to repair some line work and finish the undrawn portion of the surfboard. Heres the final of that wallpaper btw. The fill tool in this area was about as useful as a boat on land, so the fill work was done by the Clone Stamp Tool. Use alt to select an area, and then the tool replicates that area in the new place your painting it on. This process if done properly should take a little while, but produces amazing results. After you've gone through with the clone stamp, once again use the smudge tool and very carefully blend the edges and any areas that just stick out.  Granted the AoT example itself is a little messy (namely at the elbow section) as its an older attempt, but it fits the general style of the image so ive never really felt like going in and fixing it.  I'm not too sure how useful that information will be with the Saber wallpaper (there might just be too much guess work there for it to work) but its one of the better methods i've figured out over time.  If any of that was unclear, just say so, I might not get to corrections tonight, but ill be able to tomorrow for sure."
Saber,3dxdzy,scloutkst2889,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for all the examples! You did remarkably well with the Sasha wallpaper, I must say! I'm not too worried about the elbow - the art style wasn't a super clean one to begin with, so it doesn't stand out to me at all. As for the LoK stuff, very cool. They have some great shots throughout the show that are only affected by 'extras' in the scenery. I've done similar, small object removal in product photos and such. Clone stamp is so useful.  I use the clone stamp tool fairly often for image repair / object removal, but your marquee + fill + smudge technique is new to me. In particular, the ""fill"" part throws me off a little bit. Are you able to grab an area of, say, the surfboard and fill it automatically into a marquee around one of the kanji letters? And then you smudge it? I'm most likely misunderstanding you; I only ever use fill for solid colors, and I don't think I've ever used the smudge tool.  Oh man, the pen tool. It's awesome. I used to use the polygonal lasso tool before I found out about that, and for whatever stupid reason it has a ""timer"" on it where if you don't make your next point quickly, it just closes the selection. The pen tool was a godsend. My only issue with it is time - it's always a very lengthy process. I haven't had time to really sit down and use more tedious techniques, but once summer school is out I should be able to. I'll do the Saber image justice by using a higher quality version and taking the time to crop it.  As for how to fill out the dress on the right side, I'll definitely try cloning and the marquee + fill + smudge technique you mentioned (once I understand it better of course). The tricky part is all the shadows/lighting and such. As far as cloning goes, that's one of its limitations - if there's variation in lighting or texture, it can be tough to get good results."

Saber,3bgkza,ArchadianJudge,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:49:25 2015 UTC,"Not rare, just really popular.  Each time they open pre-orders, they have a set limit and then close them until they can ascertain more numbers from the manufacturer, then open again until they reach a final quota."
Saber,3bgkza,Bewker,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"Well, they're actually closed, as I forgot to make the post when they first started taking pre-orders, but yeah.  They might open the pre-orders again, so keep an eye out!"
Saber,3berbu,Ownsin,6,Sun Jun 28 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"I think it will happen, one way or another. She didn't really have much closure with Shirou. This was good - but fairly minimal. Which is a good thing, because it makes me feel like they're holding out on something for us. Whether it's a film or a small set of OVAs for the Fate route, I'll take it if ufotable's doing it. They certainly did an awesome job with Rin + Shirou, so I don't doubt their ability to do an awesome job with best couple."
Saber,3berbu,ivoryonyx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"Have people not seen the first Fate/stay night series? I mean, it was the fate route. Unless i'm misunderstanding something here, if i am then disregard this comment, but the first Fate/stay night series was the fate route, then came the UBW movie and now the UBW series has concluded, the next thing coming is the Heaven's feel route movie, and i assume after that the heaven's feel series will probably make its way out. Though, i did explore the possibility with my friend of them expanding the UBW series longer, exploring their time at the magic academy, making alliances and enemies, how the other mage families view each other, and how they view Shirou, i imagine some would be envious of Rin for partaking and surviving the events of the grail war and and probably view shirou as an outsider that just happened to be there and survive because of her and think they are better than him and that he doesn't belong there. Shirou being himself, would probably help other mages, and would even put himself in harms way to do so, in the process, pissing off Rin for for endangering himself and getting involved in things that didn't involve him. Though, i came up with these ideas myself when talking to my friend, she hates shirou, so she wasn't exactly thrilled with hearing any of this, lol."
Saber,3berbu,ViziTronMan,4,Sun Jun 28 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"It's based on the Fate route but it's not exactly the same. They tried to pull in bits and pieces of UBW and HF, which made the story even more convoluted along with the infodump. I think they were going for an ""umbrella"" series that covered the other two routes.  What a lot of people in this subreddit want is a reproduction of the Fate route that removes most of the infodump scenes, since much of the lore has been established in ufotable's F/Z + UBW, and gives us a more developed romance between Shirou and Saber. Even Nasu, the VN author, said that he struggled with Saber being female instead of male, hence why Shirou often made comments like ""Girls shouldn't fight."" If it's ufotable producing this with Nasu at their side like what was done for the UBW series, many believe it will be significantly better than the source material because Nasu will have made his changes and improvements. Not to mention studio DEEN's animation quality was lackluster.  As for your ideas regarding a sequel to UBW, that would certainly be interesting - almost a Harry Potter-esque vibe going on. I mean, they're basically attending Hogwarts. :P I wouldn't mind watching such a series myself. However, I think that they will prioritize finishing off animating the main three routes first, and then Hollow Ataraxia (just because of the fact that they animated an opening for it), before moving on to something like a sequel series."
Saber,3berbu,ivoryonyx,0,Sun Jun 28 22:01:45 2015 UTC,My money is that when it happens it will be in movie form. Since Ufotable laid out the intro portions in the UBW show and they are expanding more story in movie form I think they will do a good service with this method.  Or at least I hope so.
Saber,3berbu,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"If this is the case, I hope for a series of movies. If you cut out all of the infodumps, it should be shorter than whatever they have planned for HF, for sure."

Saber,3berbu,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"As much as I want a Fate route. I want a fully edited one. Since there's no need to introduce the viewer into the universe, they can cut that out. Nasu needs to tinker with the story to make it better. If Nasu actually tried editing, I'm positive that the edited version would be two times better than the original."
Saber,3berbu,Saber_Na,0,Sun Jun 28 17:53:08 2015 UTC,Oh very much so. I personally hope it'll be in movie form. As I mentioned to Ivory UBW laid out the fundamental intro in the show so it can be skipped over. And yes... Shirou is the problem with the story. I could understand a good number of his parts but some parts... Yeah they need fixing.
Saber,3berbu,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:57:49 2015 UTC,This is nice. I like it.
Saber,3bdvet,ArchadianJudge,5,Sun Jun 28 07:57:21 2015 UTC,"This is good, because I think it means they have something in store for us. Yeah, I would've liked to have seen her spirit there looking at Shirou or something, but then I realized... Last Episode. It'd make no sense for her spirit to still be on Earth, since she goes straight to this subreddit Avalon. This was minimal, but appropriate given that it's Rin's route. The Good Ending would've made a lot of people happy, I'm sure, but to me it would feel like ufotable was trying to pander to both parties at the same time so that they wouldn't have to make a Fate route. They didn't do that, so it makes me optimistic."
Saber,3bdvet,ivoryonyx,2,Sun Jun 28 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"Yea looking it at like that it is possible but they are releasing the Heaven's Feel movie first after that we don't know what their next project will be, I doubt they'll work forever on the Fate series even though it's very popular in Japan.   I do hope they make a Fate only route but they did say if they do they'll add some things that make it different from the visual novel."
Saber,3bdvet,aBabyShoe,2,Mon Jun 29 05:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think they could've showed her ending from the Fate route by the tree and that'd have a lot of impact (that's what I was really hoping for, even after the credits). I'm assuming that's what happened before she reaches Avalon. Just showing the grave doesn't seem to do one of the biggest main character justice."
Saber,3bdvet,Selnight,2,Sun Jun 28 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"I think the grave-scene was really touching. Showed that Sheroo and Saber were more than just Master and Servant.  Didn't overdo it aswell. I mean, she's gone, Shirou probably had a hard time in that year to overcome her death (if you may call it that way) and managed to leave the past behind and look towards the future.  He will always be grateful for what she did, else he wouldn't visit her grave. Yet he won't shed any tears, because they were able to part in good terms."
Saber,3bdvet,RIvkyn,2,Mon Jun 29 18:09:08 2015 UTC,It's not Saber's route. Ufotable already gave her plenty of attention she shouldn't have gotten in earlier episodes. I think the grave thing was a nice thing to do.

The program runs however it just keeps showing the black command screen working on each segment forever. I've sat there for 10 minutes on one picture then gave up. I think I have the right program..
Saber,3b2f1o,ArchadianJudge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"I would say let it run. Depending on the size of your file, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. There is also a setting that allows you to specify how much of the CPU you want the program to use. For example, the file I upscaled in the comment above took a little over an hour (to go from 2048x1536 to 4096x3072) set at full CPU usage. By default, it is set to use half of your CPU (therefore doubling the upscaling time). As long as you're getting no errors, it should be able to finish.  I'm no computer whiz, but here are my computer specs (desktop); I suspect that if your laptop's are lower, it's possible that it would take longer for files to complete upscaling.  System: 64-bit RAM: 8.00 GB CPU: Q6700 @ 2.66 GHz  Edit: I should add that you can do light activity on your computer while your image renders. I had Firefox and a couple Word docs/PDFs open while the program was running. Oh, and music too."
Saber,3b2f1o,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:00:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Well the only image I tried this program on was a FSN novel screen capture. If you just double the size and do regular de-noise, how long on average does it take for you? To do the same specs that the online version does takes me 10 minutes + (never finished). I can't imagine how much longer it would take to get the specs even higher..  Thanks for your reply!"

Saber,3ajquh,pad117,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:21:28 2015 UTC,yeah agreed. The whole scene felt butchered :/
Saber,3aiiy3,Fernando961226,9,Sat Jun 20 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"1: I think Shirou showed her what she wished for was wrong, and she wanted to return to reflect on it before she died. Shirou knowing this didn't want to try to make her stay either, and they both knew he alone didn't have the power. So she went back to face reality and let her time move forward.  2: Archer can't project anything but swords. Rho Aias is the exception to the rule, but it takes a huge toll on his body and a massive amount of mana.  3: Merlin is probably talking about changing her wish from ""Wanting the grail"" to ""Wanting to be with Shirou"". When this happens I don't know, but I assume that's what's going on.  4: The black mud is the embodiment of the sins and curses and whatever you want to call it of all humanity if I recall properly. It completely taints and destroys servants, and would likely turn any normal person insane if not just destroy them. HF happens because of this black mud basically.  5: Been a while since I read Fate, I should read it again now that the anime is ending, but a more stream-lined story would be good. If I remember correctly fate is the big exposition dump, and it makes sense because it's the first route. Specifics are hard to decide on, but there are things that I'd definitely want left in if it were remade.  This is all opinion and stuff from memory, so I'm probably wrong on stuff but figured I'd try to help."
Saber,3aiiy3,Azhor,3,Sat Jun 20 19:53:57 2015 UTC,it's mostly to do with the story because saber is still alive in that universe in her era so by giving up on the grail she nullifies the wish she made to the world that would make her a heroic spirit to begin with and ultimately let her pass on. If you look up the realite nua epilogue Spoiler title. In UBW saber doesn't give up on the grail she merely decides to live in the present world for a lifetime and then return to her era and recommence her fight so her contract is still in effect. So there's nothing holding her back because her goal hasn't changed.   2) Because the timeline that archer lived in is different from shirou of the fate route from what we know it's the most similar but there are several crucial differences mainly that he wasn't as attached or bonded to saber and that he had a deep connection instead with iliya which is why her death set him into despair. From what we know we can only theorize that either his event of the story didn't have avalon or that he didn't have a deep enough bond with saber to have it burnt into his memory.  3). Again this is expanded in the realite nua ending but basically it says that in order for them to reunite one has to wait for an eternity while the other chases for an eternity. Which is up to interpretation but from the realite nua ending it shows that in order for them to reunite shirou must continue to wish for it while chasing his ideals to be a hero while saber must continue wait for him forever.Spoiler title   4) It's flatout said that gilgamesh is the only heroic spirit that can survive the mud any other heroic spirit would be instantly corrupted by its power. Which is shown in heaven's feel dun dun dun.
Saber,3aiiy3,kavinh10,2,Sun Jun 21 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not the smartest person in the world (and trust me like many others here I'm quite biased for our magnificent king) but I will give my two cents in the best possible attempt I can:   Like /u/Azhor mentioned she was able to recognize that her wish was self-conflicting and would never be fixed. I like to believe that she realized this and wanted to go back and accept her fate resulting from the consequences of her choices. And even if she could stay, unlike Fate route, she didn't spend too much time with Shirou to develop any sort of ""romantic"" relationship/bond to play off of it. Plus let's just face it: UBW route focuses on Rin as the main girl so it was more plausible for UFO to end it this way. This is a tricky question that unfortunately I can't answer all too well. Once again Az expained it pretty fairly and I'd assume that as the explanation. Tough question. No comment. I would say so. Since the mud is the source of all of humanity's curses and ill-wills it is passed off as, ""all-consuming and corrupting."" Given what happens in HF HF spoilers. I'm with you here. Definitely my favorite route for MANY reasons (of course one of them being best girl but we all know this). There were some situations and fights that I enjoy in that route more than the rest of the VN with how they play out and what happens and such etc. One gripe I have about it: Shirou. Him and how fucking stubborn he is. Often more-so than what is believable. Granted it is explained as the route that ""holds ideals over reality"" so it going over-the-top is somewhat reasonable. If I would have to change a few things it would be Shirou following the ""You shouldn't fight because you're a girl"" rationality that he seems to fucking ponder on. The rest of his reasoning (like her not having a happy life because of the things she does and how she doesn't value her own happiness and humanity) is extremely valid.   While the Fate route and the people that love it get looked down on I can, and will, say that this will forever be my favorite route. EVER. Plus...  Fate/Realta Nua Ending spoiler"
Saber,3aiiy3,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"1) Saber didn't stay with Shirou because it was more fitting that way for the author. Why? Well... for one, I think Nasu had an idea for Last Episode, which wouldn't have really worked if she stayed (but he obviously didn't implement this until the Realta Nua version of the VN). They say that ""distance makes the heart grow fonder"" and that ""true love transcends all"" which I took to be LE's message. The second thing is... how strange would it be? Saber can't age, being a servant, and I don't think there's a way for her to become human. The only thing we know that is capable of that is the Holy Grail's muck, which is how Gilgamesh manages to stay in the world. So if she stayed with Shirou, he would have become older and eventually died while she remained the same age. The way I interpret LE, Shirou dies as a young man (or at least around Archer's age) and sees Saber again when he meets up with her in Avalon. As much as I would have liked to see more Saber and Shirou in the real world, it just feels like it might be inappropriate. I had the same thought as you - why can't she stay? Early on, not knowing the Grail was corrupted, I thought, ""Shirou can wish for her to stay!"" regardless of what that jacknob Kotomine said. How silly an idea that was. I hated the ending in Fate - absolutely hated it. So much so that I literally could not leave the VN as it was, so I rushed through the other two routes just to get to LE, which made everything better. In any case, if someone has a good idea as to how else it could have gone, I'm open to hearing them. It may change my mind! That was a long answer, phew.  2) I think it's a matter of him simply being unable to project it because of the time gap. Sure, that's what Shirou says, but he only had the thing extracted from him hours before. His specialty is swords, not scabbards. Another thing is that Archer is referred to (in UBW) as someone who is ""twisted"" by several characters (Rin in the finale, Lancer during their second fight, Kuzuki after Caster dies, etc) so with that in mind, perhaps someone of that nature cannot call forth something as pure as Avalon (whereas Shirou was still very much ""pure""). No fact behind this, just speculation.  3) I believe what you're referring to is more of a flashback to when she first pulled the sword and made it her dream to save her country. During the VN, that is still her wish, except she adds that she wants someone besides her to become king. Merlin was going over past events, to draw a contrast to what her wish has now changed to - being with Shirou, the one person in the world exactly like her. He was also the person who helped her accept her life as it was instead of trying to change it. As for the ""star"" part, I don't honestly know. This is how I took it - strong couples become something of a phenomenon. That is, their love and hope creates a star in the sky that everyone can see, even if they don't realize what they're looking at. A star that may one day guide two star-crossed lovers... or something like that. Again, pure speculation (and cheesiness) xP  4) That mud is what spills out from the corrupted Grail, which houses the corrupted wishes of everyone on the planet. Wishes = magic, and Servants are practically made of magic. So yeah, it would be a powerful, corrupting force when Servants are exposed to it. I imagine it is more potent the more ""pure"" a particular Servant is. Gilgamesh can resist it because he's already messed up. Saber fell to it almost immediately in HF because she's pure. And Shirou being submerged in it and surviving? Well... you could justify it two ways: 1) Avalon, 2) plot armor.  5) I usually tell people this when the topic of which ""route"" is the best comes up - it's kind of pointless to debate it because all three routes are different in my mind (even though this is my favorite as well). You go to Fate for romance, UBW for action, and HF for drama. Kind of an overgeneralization, but I think it works. With that said, as I discussed with a friend of mine, one thing I would change about Fate is making Shirou a little more useful (i.e. not a bumbling moron). I found his resolve admirable, but his actions foolish. I don't want him to be UBW level - that's for UBW - but if he could at least defend himself so that Saber doesn't constantly have to put herself at risk, that would be greeeaaaat. Another thing I would change is the frequency of romantic moments between Shirou and Saber. If you think about it logically, the two of them are together for about two weeks. It's been several months since I've read Fate, but these are the major romantic moments I remember:   a couple dinner scenes (?) Shirou seeing Saber out of the bath their ""date"" bridge argument/reconciliation sleeping together their parting   Maybe I'm too much of a pessimist or maybe I just don't have enough experience, but I don't think falling completely in love with another person in less than two weeks after first meeting them is very common at all. This is fiction of course, but as can be seen from the bullet points above, there wasn't a ton of time devoted to developing their relationship in a romantic fashion. Not to mention that four of those points occur in roughly 24 hours. So it wouldn't hurt to have more heart-to-heart moments between them to make their relationship even more believable."
Saber,3aiiy3,ivoryonyx,0,Sun Jun 21 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"2) Archer is not Shirou in Fate route. It is possible that the event you mention did not happen in his time. I can't remember the VN, but in the UBW anime, he seems a bit surprised by Avalon healing Shirou in ep20. Also, Avalon is very powerful NP (more so than Rho Aias) and not a sword. He may not have enough mana to project it."
Saber,3aiiy3,undefinedobfuscator,0,Sun Jun 21 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"well shirou and archer are the same person, they just live different events. perhaps archer never learned about Avalon and that is why he can't projected. Avalon 3rth projection shirou ever did so, and it is the only projection that is perfect. if shirou can do it you would think that archer is also able to do it, but I don't know. maybe it is useless without the help of saber"

Saber,39k6w1,ivoryonyx,12,Fri Jun 12 08:24:15 2015 UTC,I could surely use a great Saber Chrome theme.
Saber,39k6w1,nataku411,5,Fri Jun 12 09:17:43 2015 UTC,Can't we all? :)
Saber,39k6w1,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Fri Jun 12 22:36:00 2015 UTC,I'd be totally okay with this. I'm not a grand master at making these but I have made a few before. A few of which have been based around our best girl.  I use this one currently. (although it has that error in the top-right corner due to the BG not being wide enough)
Saber,39k6w1,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome, this is the kind of thing that I'd love to see! I think this would be a very fun contest that generates useful content. Would you happen to know of more practical applications, or have ideas of some? The idea here is to not make this so much of an art contest, but to have both the art aspect and to benefit the sub as a whole. I feel that straight-up art contests simply come and go, not leaving a lasting impression on participants or spectators."
Saber,39k6w1,ArchadianJudge,2,Sat Jun 13 08:10:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly I like the idea of making Chrome themes. Unfortunately I can't do it with any of my own artwork as I am not very talented, but I think if we were to organize something like this we could show them off while having download links as well as source links for anything we use.  This is the website I use to make all mine. The creator tool is pretty simple yet effective to use. Maybe we could make this a real deal."
Saber,39k6w1,Astro_Zombie,2,Sat Jun 13 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I see, but you're still welcome to try if you feel confident enough! And yeah, that's the thought I had about the idea behind this whole thing - so that whatever is made can be used by all fans. People can be very, very creative, and to be able to not only admire, but make use of the work? That'd be fantastic.  Thanks for the link by the way. I've only dabbled in Firefox Personas, so I didn't realize that there was a site that helped you auto-generate the themes! Honestly, this was the trickiest part in making a Persona; having the correct size to account for various resolutions and browser sizes."

Saber,39cqad,nataku411,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:46:25 2015 UTC,For a prize figure this does indeed look decently well-sculpted and painted.
Saber,39cqad,ivoryonyx,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:18:40 2015 UTC,I agree. I particularly like the armor sculpt and paint finish. I was most impressed by it even more so than some of the other older Saber figures.
Saber,39cqad,ivoryonyx,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:46:01 2015 UTC,When I got the figure there were some dirt / dark marks on the face. I've gotten that with some other figures as well. They don't seem to come off if I rub it. Are those permanent?   I'm curious if any other figure collectors have dealt with that before. It seems like they don't come off..
Saber,39cqad,ivoryonyx,3,Wed Jun 10 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"I had a tiny, very light smudge on her face, and a big black glob of paint or something on her sword. The smudge was easily cleaned with a little bit of water, but the glob had to be scraped off and then repainted. Luckily I built some Gundam/plane models in the past, so I had some chrome paint laying around.  Edit: This was a video a watched a while back. It's a comprehensive guide on how to care for your figures - skip to about 7:58, which is where he talks about how to clean scuffs. I didn't want to use paint thinner like they suggested, but this would be the best stuff to use if the scuff was from paint. Mine might have just been dirt or something. But the idea of using a q-tip is a good one, regardless of what solution you use to clean."
Saber,39cqad,Ownsin,2,Thu Jun 11 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Ahh thanks for the input and the link! I'll have go look and see if I need some stronger water wiping but it might end up being the ""glob"" you suggested since it doesn't seems to be easy coming off. I don't think i'm good enough to repaint it though.. Here's how mine looks (small dark patches on each cheek):  http://i.imgur.com/P2VSbpO.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/iQOJkmd.jpg"
Saber,39cqad,nataku411,2,Thu Jun 11 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"Man, I wish I'd taken a picture of her sword. When I said glob, I mean a literal glob! It was probably the size of my index finger nail - and it had a thickness to it. Now that I think about it, its texture was more like melted plastic because that crap didn't want to come off. Maybe because, if it was paint, it was a special kind and not the type the dries into something rubbery.   Also, the smudge I had on my Saber's face was more like... like an erasure smudge. Yours are actual marks from what I can tell. From what, I'm not sure... Did your figure come packaged, by chance? Mine was new in box, and her upper body, skirt, legs, stand, and sword were all in plastic bags of their own. If they weren't packaged that way, it's possible parts bumped against each other in transit and scuffed up her cheeks.  If I were you, I would try some more water wiping with q-tips. If that doesn't work, try something a little stronger - just a little. Maybe that solution used to clean eyeglasses (I've never done this before though). The final option would be paint thinner, as the video suggested. If it's paint, it will get it off for sure, but it may also take off some of the skin paint. Remember, just put small amounts on the q-tip, don't submerge it. You definitely want to play it safe with figures like these!"

Saber,37f2ee,-Snow-,17,Wed May 27 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome poll. As per my vote I will write something up I PROMISE!!! WhenICanThatIs.  EDIT - Alright here's my ""summary"" for my beliefs. Gonna contain obvs spoilers. Figured I'd warn ahead of time if it mattered at all.  Alright here we go:  So the question at hand - Why is Saber my king? Why? Well there are many reasons from your simple, ""She's pretty."" to ""She kicks ass."" Easy to tell. Easy to appreciate. But I'm gonna get down to some core reasons she struck my heart and took it like a conquest.  So we'll begin with her personality (which I feel is a big factor in my choice) by looking a bit into her past. Despite the harsh realities she has had to face she still remains loyal, truthful, and all-around a positive person. One of the things that struck me: Her past. How she had to destroy her emotions as well as any form of humanity in order to lead her kingdom to the benefit of her people ONLY to get betrayed by the very thing she sacrificed for. She lead a life that basically held no self-satisfaction or enjoyment, and not getting a chance at truly living definitely hurt to think about. Even with all that said she threw it away and held dear what mattered to her most, continued to endure, and even in the end defended what she believed in. This to me relies on an unbreakable aspect of character which I truly respect.  In terms of her and Shirou: Lots of people like to bash Shirou (all in good reason since he's REALLY daft about things) as well as the whole relationship factor that him and Saber share in Fate, but like many of us here I support it. People say it's a toxic relationship but in the end I believe it works out for the better. He is able to continue fighting for his ideals (not giving them up AS WELL AS realizing the realistic portion to ""being realistic"" about it) and he is able to help Saber see the error of attempting to change the past. It is a rocky road of emotion and miscommunication but it is a beautiful thing. I feel that out of all the main relationship choices that this one works the best in terms of story and character development.  Comparing her to the other main heroines Rin and Sakura I say she takes the cake for these reasons: 1) She is the right balance of docile and initiative. She isn't completely bossy or pushy like her counterpart Rin (not saying that Rin is a bad thing. Just... Obnoxious in a way) as well as being a bit more active than shut-in Sakura. She knows how to get what she wants (YUMMY FOOD!) but will back down when need be. And 2) She's a motherfucking bad ass from the past! Unlike both Rin and Sakura SHE HAS LED A GODDAMN KINGDOM STRAIGHT FROM THE PITS OF COMPLETE AND UTTER ANNIHILATION! Tossed aside any traces of humanity or a normal childhood for the sake and well-being of others and yet continues to be as adorable and well-mannered (or more-so) than most others around her. Talk about some damn strong character!  There are other minor (yet majorly significant) reasons to like this beautiful lady: She's goddamn gorgeous! HOW IN THE FUCK CAN YOU SAY NO TO A SMILE LIKE THIS!? She's undeniably adorable. She also has an amazing voice (even if she were to have a different VA down the road this voice will always stay engraved forever). Just listen here! Plus her choices in food? Admirable. Awe-inspiring even! Who else has the guts (and stomach) to conquer the mountain of good food? FUCKING NOBODY! That's who! Another thing: She is aesthetically pleasing. Look at how graceful she is! LOOK AT IT! As well as the way she shouts, ""EX-CALIBURRRRRRRRR!"" is amazing too.  So with these, and many more I may or may not have mentioned, are the reasons that she is our king. Maybe I'll come back and add more to this. Maybe not. But for now I'm tired so I'll leave this as it is."
Saber,37f2ee,REsoleSurvivor1000,7,Wed May 27 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with many of your points about Saber, and to add one of my own... Saber for me is not just a strong character, she is a rare thing in the anime medium itself. She is a strong independent woman that doesn't need help from anyone, that doesn't rely on anyone, and ultimately can do everything by herself. Basically she is a strong female character, and most other female characters in anime and heck even in live action movies, save for a few are incredibly weak or are always treated as the damsel in distress kind of character that requires attention and care all the time and are always relying on the male main character.  With Saber she's different, she relies on no one but herself. Heck even Shirou relies on her more than he relies on himself, he doesn't come with grasps with it in the beginning because he couldn't believe a girl like her can be someone like that, but later on he comes to understand it and completely relies on her in the end.  Finally, Saber isn't perfect she has her flaws, but she herself knows them and even acknowledges them, and that takes a lot for a character to do that, but in the end she does, she is not stubborn and she is very wise, just and composed as a person. It's just a rare thing to see a female character this way. She is ideally for ""me"" the best fictional female character i have ever seen.  P.S: i would love more discussions like this one too."
Saber,37f2ee,Ownsin,1 point,Wed May 27 13:40:19 2015 UTC,"Adding on to that addition, I really did enjoy her inhuman altruism and the fact that she managed to (somewhat unintentionally) convince her entire kingdom that she was a saintly being ruling over them, even if it meant its downfall. She followed that insanity to the very end. A few ""insane"" ideas tend to become standards for thought; this, unfortunately, was not one of them. The effort towards her rulership, however, is just as admirable. Her character goes beyond commanding; it's powerful with just enough humanity residing in her. Knowing how flawed she is in the end, we still make her look like a saint on this is subreddit."
Saber,37f2ee,REsoleSurvivor1000,5,Fri May 29 16:54:01 2015 UTC,I'll post my own later. I am genuinely curious what makes heroic (heroinic?) figures like Arturia so appealing to other people. I just thought we might have an actual discussion like this on this subreddit one day.
Saber,37f2ee,ivoryonyx,4,Wed May 27 06:35:00 2015 UTC,Yeah it would be nice to have more discussions around here. Get people to actually participate in a way which would be awesome!  I'll edit my above comment sometime soon. Got a rough write-up in the works.  EDIT: It has been done...
Saber,37f2ee,ArchadianJudge,2,Wed May 27 06:50:41 2015 UTC,"The summer laziness has gotten to me. I started up a thread (in light of UBW episode 20) discussing the similarities between Shirou and Saber and how they are meant for each other more than any other pairing. I've yet to finish it because... laziness. Since all of you are talking about what you like about Saber here, all I can say is that I agree on all of your points. Nothing really new I can say here, but seeing that Shirou-Saber relationship has come up a few times, I hope to finish my thread soon and to post it up for some pairing discussions!"

Saber,37f2ee,ArchadianJudge,2,Wed May 27 06:35:14 2015 UTC,"Last time this question was asked I mentioned how she is calm, confident, strong, dedicated, and that she could eat. Very few eating habits annoy me more than someone being a delicate or picky eater.   Of course, there is also her relationship with Shirou, and how she struggles with her identity as the King, as a symbol, as something more than human and with her developing feelings for Shirou.

Saber,35qbc6,Ownsin,2,Tue May 12 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"Man, I know that Mordred had a few screws loose, but if Saber was in the position to accept her and teach her, they would have been a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.  That, and moments like this. Sigh."
Saber,35qbc6,ivoryonyx,1 point,Tue May 12 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you also have to remember that Mordred was manipulated by Morgan to oppose Arthur. Also Morgan basically brainwashed Mordred into thinking that Arthur doesn't like her and wants nothing to do with her. That of course still doesn't justify what Mordred did, but in a way you can see she is not totally all evil."
Saber,35qbc6,Reminnisce,1 point,Tue May 12 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"She actually really, really adored Arthur until she tried to talk to her and was completely rejected as a child and a heir. That, combined with her loneliness of being ""different"" from everyone else and the spurring on from Morgan is what made her have a few screws you.  Heck, Mordred is basically a thousand year old Illya, only angrier since she didn't get the love that Fate or HF Illya got from Shirou."
Saber,35qbc6,ivoryonyx,1 point,Tue May 12 21:35:01 2015 UTC,"That's one way of looking at it... except here, she gets told what she didn't want to hear by her own parent, not told by others via rumors and such. I look at it like the ""straw that broke the camel's back."" It's just... T_T"
Saber,35qbc6,ivoryonyx,1 point,Tue May 12 23:46:41 2015 UTC,"Right, I know. Sucks what happened to her, but all the manipulation in the world wouldn't have beaten Saber's approval.

Saber,35nd02,ivoryonyx,1 point,Tue May 12 05:54:33 2015 UTC,"Nice parallel, it definitely shows how much the two have in common. Personally I consider them the true Fate/stay night pairing, because I'm one who is attracted to those who are similar to myself. For others, maybe it's someone who is the direct opposite of you (Rin) or someone who complements your personality (Sakura). It's totally subjective; just wanted to share my perspective and see what others thought.  To quote a post I had written a while back (warning: wall of text):   I don't know how you came to the conclusion that his attempt to reach her all his life goes against the route's message. He continues with his ideals of helping people and putting himself before others JUST LIKE Saber did (I don't think he became a hero so much as he continued his ideals in a more realistic fashion; he doesn't become Archer of course, since Archer, being a counter guardian and a heroic spirit, would have been isolated in the Throne of Heroes). He didn't regret seeing her go, but he believed in his heart that they would meet again someday because he loved her. Just because he had a wish doesn't mean he regretted anything or wanted to redo anything. Saber had the same wish. For the first time, they both thought of their own desires instead of others'. In the end, they're both rewarded for their sacrifices. It was beautiful and heartwarming. Very rarely does anything bring me close to tears or threaten to tear my heart out.   Full comment here"

It was only in the Extra Material for Apocrypha that they say she CAN be Saber, but she's never actually BEEN Saber.

Saber,34lc9a,Ragsmuena,1 point,Sun May 3 11:22:42 2015 UTC,Yes and no. Ruler class was created to oversee the great holy grail. It in itself is technically not a c lass of its own if you think about it. She is qualified as a Saber and would be summoned as a Saber 99% of the time if she was summoned normally by masters. That's why i have her in here.
Saber,34lc9a,Ownsin,1 point,Sun May 3 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that, but the fact of the matter is that she has never appeared as Saber. Sure she would normally be summoned as Saber if she wasn't overseeing the Greater Grail, but there is no version of Fate or any spin-offs where she actually appear as Saber.   I'm not saying that she shouldn't be allowed on this sub by the way. I just wanted to point out my above point."
