ferrets,3e2ms6,maximilliangc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"I supplement my ferrets kibble like this. I use a coffee bean grinder to grind their high quality kibble into a coarse dust. I save the kibble dust in tupper ware and when I'm ready to use it, I toss it in a food processor with home made chicken stock, cut up hard boiled eggs, boiled deboned chicken, I've even used raw chicken liver from organically raised chickens. When introducing it to a new ferret I mix in some ferret vite to give it a hint of sweetness to appeal to their sweet tooth. I make it up as a paste and then sit on the floor and spoon feed it to them. Once any new ferret has imprinted on the food I slowly reduce the ferret vite I add to it. My ferrets go ape-shit for my home made treat paste.   Once I see that my ferrets stop eating it and start trying to run away and hide mouth fulls, I just cover it and keep it in the fridge for the use over the next day or two."
ferrets,3e161c,kaylajo147,2,Tue Jul 21 04:01:33 2015 UTC,The blue Dawn dish soap will kill fleas. Thats all I used on my sneaky boys when hubs brought home fleas on his pants from his mothers dog.  My sister is a dog groomer and swears by the stuff. Their little necks are a bit small for flea collars but possibly hanging some in the cage might help?
ferrets,3e161c,hulifox,2,Tue Jul 21 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yes! Blue dawn is the best. Our kitties get them now and then, so our boys get them. Blue dawn, lots of bedding changes and cage cleaning."
ferrets,3e161c,traumaqueen1128,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:41:12 2015 UTC,Basically what I have been doing. Glad to see I'm on the right track! Have you had any issues of dry skin or hair loss with Dawn baths?
ferrets,3e161c,traumaqueen1128,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"None at all! I found this on a ferret care site and stick by it:   If your ferret has dry skin or a dry coat, apply a little coat conditioner while your ferret’s coat is still damp and work it into the coat and skin with a massaging motion. A simple homemade coat conditioner can be made from a mixture of one part Alpha Keri bath oil and 10 parts water. Shake well before spraying onto the ferret. A treat of a few drops of Linatone or Ferretone would be appropriate at this time, too!   It's pretty cheap and doesn't take much."
ferrets,3e161c,Shercock_Holmes,2,Wed Jul 22 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"There are certain kitten sized topical flea treatments you can use to kill them. Your vet will be able to tell you which brand is effective for your area of the country and safe for ferret use. A dose should only cost $7 -$15 and you should only need one if you clean, clean, clean after giving the medication. Combine that with bedding changes washed with hot water and maybe some vinegar for good measure.   It's important to visit your vet for dosing instructions as not all topicals are ferret safe and not all ferrets meet the weight limits for certain medications. Flea/tick medicine toxicity is a thing and it is really scary.   Avoid flea baths and collars. They aren't intended for such small critters and ferrets will likely try to ingest any collars. Do not combine different types of flea medicine. Blue dawn is AMAZING at killing fleas and is ferret safe.   Which state do you live in? I'm in the southern US and know a few vets that take ferrets. Without a vet you're probably better off with dawn and lots of cleaning.  You should really try to get a vet ASAP as ferrets can get really sick really quickly."
ferrets,3e161c,Shercock_Holmes,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:41 2015 UTC,I live in south Alabama. I spent over two hours calling around this morning trying to find a vet that takes ferrets and are familiar with them. The closest one is an hour away but I'm okay with driving that far. I have been cleaning his cage daily and that has helped. Washing him in Dawn worked really well! Have you ever had to use a topical for your ferrets? The vet told me over the phone to use advantage for small cats or kittens. Thanks for the advice!
ferrets,3e161c,Shercock_Holmes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with vets in the Carolinas so I'm no help. Yes, when we moved into our new house I was worried about fleas so I gave a dose to all my critters.   Obviously watch them after to make sure they don't try to lick/eat it. The kitten dose is really tiny so there shouldn't be much left for them to lick and it should dry quickly. Other than that you should be on the road to flea free!"
ferrets,3e161c,tararabbit111279,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks again! I was getting extremely mixed reviews on Google and then no local vets would see ferrets.

ferrets,3e161c,nemosevgi,2,Tue Jul 21 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"seven ferrets   Sounds relatively normal. Ferrets start multiplying on you really easily.  Signs of flea/tick medicine toxicity:   Itching, shock, panting, excessive drooling, convulsing, listlessness, puking, excessive diarrhea.  I had a dog react because I gave him his flea pill in the morning and my roommate decided to ""help"" with him while I was at work and give him his pill that evening. He was shaking and drooling. There was no permanent damage done but it was very scary. The vet said it was a really common thing that they see."

ferrets,3dzj35,zakriv,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:55 2015 UTC,Mine had the exact same symptoms and it was mites. We got her treated and then the reddish earwax stopped. You can get some of that animal flea/mite gel that you put on their back. I used that and it worked perfectly. When you get your ferret treated it should stop recurring.
ferrets,3dzj35,adventuretortoise,2,Tue Jul 21 04:45:47 2015 UTC,It sounds like mites. Keep the ears clean until you can get to the vet. The big concern with mites is bacterial infection. Make sure you tell your vet how many other guys you have in the house as the mites could easily spread to your entire business. They might prescribe you some extra drops just in case.   Here is a safe home remedy for ear mites that might help. I hope you can keep everything under control.

Both biopsies came back negative for lymphoma which was a huge relief. We had them out because Pandy's spleen was lumpy instead of smooth and Isabelle had acted distressed with some strange looking poo and elevated white blood counts, and the vet said her spleen looked twisted when they took it out.  We took Odie, our young male, along for the surgery as a blood donor in case they needed a transfusion (they didn't). Pandy had problems with anemia afterwards so we had her on pred for a few months until her blood work returned to normal. Isabelle did just fine with no problems.  Both were able to come home the next day with I think two weeks limited activity.  Pandy was about 6.5 and Isabelle maybe 4 or 5 when they had their surgeries. DewDrop is maybe 3 and her spleen is a little enlarged but smooth so we're just keeping an eye on it. I know of several ferrets with enlarged spleens that are being monitored, it seems like my vet went by what it feels like and if there are other symptoms presenting.  Hope everything goes well with you, it's definitely something the vets can deal with."

ferrets,3dzjmw,Shercock_Holmes,2,Tue Jul 21 07:37:21 2015 UTC,Has he tried moving to cloth bedding and a separate litter box? Cloth bedding can be washed with vinegar to remove the smell. Ferrets are easily (mostly) box trained like a cat. It makes poop pick up easier.  The big thing that makes ferrets smell is food quality. Have him check the food chart linked in the sidebar to see if he is feeding a good food. If he isn't have him switch over (slowly) by mixing the old food with the new food at first.   Make sure he isn't washing the ferret too much. Too many baths can strip the coat of their natural oils and make them produce more stinky-ness.   He can try to find an air fresheners but he needs to get one without essential oils. Those can be a health concern.

Females have a flat belly with no protrusions.  And with switching diets, just be sure to do it gradually, still offer the kibble that they are used to in addition to the raw. The menu looks like a good idea though, it's good to give kits all kinds of different foods while they are young, ferrets will likely refuse food if they didn't already try it as a kit.  Other than that just make sure they are supervised so they don't make a huge mess, some ferrets will try to take half a mouse and hide it somewhere..."

She was my joy and the most amazing ferret I could have ever asked for. Above all else, she was affectionate. I have known a lot of ferrets, thanks to the local rescue & shelter, but she was the cuddliest by far. There will never be another Tater.   She had health problems throughout her little life, including adrenal disease, mast cell tumors, a chordoma on her tail which resulted in amputation… but she overcame those obstacles with grace and her indomitable spirit. The last but worst of these was the lymphoma. We tried everything we could for her, we did right by her… but it was her time. We wanted to let her go with dignity, because she was always very dignified, very regal. We wanted to let her go before it was too late and she was suffering too badly. She wasn’t having fun anymore, it was time for her to cross the rainbow bridge.   DIP Puddin Tater. 2007/2008—7/16/2015"

ferrets,3dqnlq,gigglyroot,3,Sat Jul 18 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to read you are having so many issues with your ferret. I'm in a similar situation myself and I went to a ferret specialist a couple of times, who has got a ferret clinic for over 20 years now. So i'll share with you what her thoughts on the matter are. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.  We went to her because one of our ferrets threw up and there was some blood in it & he often has loose stools. We took our other ferret as well, because his stools are also often loose and/or seedy.   She did blood work on both of them and checked their urine as well. She diagnosed them both with an infection of the stomach due to helicobacter (now all ferrets carry this bacteria, but when something causes them to have stress/or sometimes feeding them processed raw meat can cause the helicobacter to become a problem). Our poor boy who threw up blood even has an ulcer. And on top of that the infection has slighty expanded to their liver.  She said that this is very very common in ferrets, but it is often misdiagnosed and labeled as IBS. The reason that a lot of vets miss this, is because young ferrets don't always show any abnormalities in their blood work or the symptoms don't always show because ferrets are very stoic. And a regular vet doesn't have as much experience with ferrets to really read the symptoms and add it all up. A lot of ferrents don't always recognize the symptoms as well.   Anyway, we are treating our ferrets with synulox, omeprazole and sucralfaat. We give it at the same time twice a day and we need to give it for a month and then come back.   It just sounds to me that your ferret might be experiencing the same thing and maybe that the 3 meds that we got prescribed might help him. I have the feeling that the ferret specialist we went to knows what she was doing. I don't think it your ferret has IBS, she was really clear on the fact that with our ferrets it is most definitely a helicobacter problem, and when I asked about IBS. She said: that is only vet lingo for I Be Stunned (aka I have no idea).   Hopefully this gave you somewhat of a direction to look for/ask for when you see your vet again. I know this isn't necessarily an answer, I just feel I had to share what was told to me. I hope your little baby feels better soon."
ferrets,3dotyp,yarnosaurusrex,13,Sat Jul 18 01:02:26 2015 UTC,"They are very social animals,  and losing part of their buisness can be as devistating to them as it is to us,  except they don't have the mental capacity to think through and process the grief.  Lots of cuddles from you guys are needed,  you are part of his social circle as well,  make sure he keeps on eating,  and if it is at all possible,  try to slowly introduce a new playmate for him. It's hard for ferrets that had a ferret friend to go back to a solitary life again.  Also,  just as a general note,  it's best to have 3 ferrets,  that way if one passes away,  the other two can lean on each other.  Overall,  you two are doing the right thing,  just monitor his food and water intake,  take him to the vet if he stops eating,  and let time heal the hole in his little heart."

The best thing to do is put the dead Ferret in the room(in our case) or cage with the other Ferret. In your case it's also probably that he is alone now. There is a lot of debate about whether ferrets are social animals and have a social hierarchy. Polecats,weasels, and most other mustelids are solitary except during mating season. Start raising funds for a wild ferrets in new Zealand study. I think they are hybrids though. We were lucky that all 8 of ours lived together and got along. No matter what number of ferrets you have albeit 3 or 9 at some point you will have one Ferret unless you keep adopting. The only number IMO that's not good is  when you can't afford the vet. Everytime I see people looking at ferrets with there kid or not I ask them if they are willing to spend $500 or more dollars a Ferret minimal. Sorry off topic. Sorry for your loss."
ferrets,3dotyp,croy_00,4,Sat Jul 18 02:48:53 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of debate about whether ferrets are social animals and have a social hierarchy. Polecats,weasels, and most other mustelids are solitary except during mating season.   I know it isn't very scientific of me to say it but I think it is not the best idea to compare the domestic ferret to their undomesticated kin.  By some estimates humans have had a few thousand years to breed traits into the domestic ferret that we would find desirable.  Being social may very well be one of those traits.  What prompted me to write this is the youngest ferret in my current business.  I just came upstairs to play some World of Warships.  It's 1:30am, he was completely asleep in a cuddle puddle with the other two members of my business.  He heard me come into the room, woke up, trundled over to the bed near my foot, curled up in the bed with his head resting on my foot.  That is not the action of a solitary animal.  Now his older kin realized he had left, has come over, sniffed my foot and decided he's going to sleep here instead of where he was.  Again, seems social to me.  This is not uncommon in the ferrets I have had the pleasure of being owned by.  They cuddle puddle, they sleep together more often than not.  And often at least one takes an intense liking to me and comes over to be with me when I am in the room.  Hierarchical can be debated, but I don't thing social can be.  Also, in writing this I remembered there was a study that compared dogs, ferrets and the wilder ferret kin in terms of domestication in relation to social behavior.

Honestly, with all of my former babies, regardless of what they had, the key to me knowing whether it was ""time"" for them was really their eating habits. Once they decide they don't care about food anymore (even if I gave them the coveted Duk soup or treats), I knew it was time to say goodbye.

Right now she has very little interest in us and bites hard enough to draw blood (out of fear not aggression thankfully!)! She's a little overweight and can hardly jump a few inches up anything.

It took four to six times as long of them to adjust to anything as it said on the internet, so be patient. One was a biter, and it took me literally six months to get her to stop -- and she still relapses when she gets grumpy.  I haven't switched mine to completely raw because one is a VERY picky eater, but I did successfully manage to switch them to healthier kibbles. (They eat a mix of Evo, which I have to order online & Royal Canin Gastrointestinal High Energy, which is a cat food recommended by my vet who's a ferret specialist. She said it was good for picky eaters.) I have managed to get them to eat meat a couple times a week, sometimes they take egg yolks, and I also make them home-made duck soup that they get a couple times a week.   For switching your ferrets from kibble to meat, I'd suggest offering them meat alongside their kibbles, and find what they like and offer them that several times a week, make sure they're still eating, and gradually offer less and less kibble. Just make sure you do it very gradually, and pay attention to how they're reacting. :)  Good luck! :D"

I don't know much about their previous history. I've probably been very lucky that I found they will eat pretty much anything.they love the cat kibble that my cats were eating. They loved the kitten food that I gave them. Now we're on EVO duck and everyone loves this including the cats.  As for litter box training, I didn't have the time to be able to put into trying it with mine. They're completely happy with newspaper and hit spot 95% of the time. I'd like to try litter box training at some point but I haven't had a lot of problems with accidents. If you had pets before, you'll know that all pets have accidents. Overall mine are  pretty good and ferret poop is much easier to clean than  cat accidents.  Personally I would never keep my pets outside especially ferrets. They are so social I can't imagine living in a hutch would provide the stimulation or interaction they need. All ferrets are different of course. My older one doesn't particularly care for me one way or the other. I think she was very strongly bonded to her previous owner and I believe the owner was male. She's better with my fiancé than she is with me. My baby is completely bonded to me. She follows me around the house (we are free range), sleeps with me when she feels like it, and basically spends more time with me than her sister.  I guess what I'm saying is that it's best not to have any preconceived expectations when adopting a shelter ferret. I'm disappointed my older one doesn't want more interaction but that's the character she has and she is who she is. My little one makes me laugh every day no matter what. Still, if I were to get another ferret, I would go back to the shelter to adopt. I just can't buy a Marshall's ferret when there are so many that need homes. Kudos to you for adopting!

I do feed them chicken baby food to supplement their protein intake.  Start off buying small bags of different foods to see which ones they will eat rather than wasting money on big bags of food.    As far as the switch from outdoor to indoor, I can't really say.  Mine have always been indoor ferrets and my understanding is that they should be kept out of hot environments.  Keep them well hydrated with multiple water bottles in their cage.    Be sure to ferret proof your home.  Look for small holes in cabinets, open vents, and other escape routes.  If you have recliners, make sure your ferrets are put away in the cage before you recline.  Ferrets get into EVERYTHING, recliners included.  They will find a way.  Litter training can be surprisingly easy and like most pets, ferrets won't poop where they eat and sleep.  Designate a corner of the cage as the poop area and place a litter pan down.  You can get litter pans with high walls designed for small animals.    Be patient with the ferrets.  They won't always use the litter pan and you may find the occasional tootsie roll in the corners of your home when they are running free.  Free time is important.  Some suggest 4 hours daily, but realistically mine average 2-3 during the work days, and much more on the weekends.   Be sure to buy books and educate yourself about general care and behavior patterns.  They are like a mix of a dog, cat, and a rat (not really a rat, I just wanted to make a rhyme).  They are highly intelligent and will surprise you often.  Since these ferrets are a little older, don't expect them to change right away to meet your idea of a well behaved ferret.  They will in time, settle into your routine though.  If they start curling up and jumping side to side, don't be alarmed, that's just the ""war dance"" and it's hilarious.  They are just happy and playing.  If you hear them hiss, however, they're pissed and handle them with care.  Don't forget to trim their nails and make sure to not cut into the nail bed because you can cause some serious damage.    I hope this helps, be sure to get a book or two and really read through it.  When my wife and I first got ferrets 4 years ago, we read any book we could get our hands on but they will all generally have the same care taking message.  Have fun with your critters."

I got a couple of reports from a very patient ferret sitter who said that my little one had broken out of the ferret gate a couple of times,  but all was OK.   When I got back and called my  very patient sitter to pick them up, I got  an education about how misbehaved my tiny female was. Out of six ferrets, four of them who were male, and one of them who was her sister,  she decided she was dominant. She beat the crap out of all the other ferrets, she stole their toys, she broke out of the ferret enclosure several times, and basically made every day a living hell for everyone but her (and probably her sister who is very familiar with her behavior).   I am fortunate to have a very patient ferret sitter who understood what a stereotypical ferret she is and who is willing to take her back. The next time the sitter was prepared.

Mine are currently eating EVO duck because I read the chart. :-) At $25 for a 5 pound bag at least everyone in the household thinks it's really delicious (except me, I haven't got up the courage to taste it yet). High protein is what is important and a good fat content is good too. And I have to feed two adult cats as well so kitten food is not the best choice because they should be eating something healthier. Otherwise I'd be kitten food in all the way."
ferrets,3dgznt,Shercock_Holmes,2,Sat Jul 18 03:33:26 2015 UTC,I feed mine blue wilderness kitten formula. The kitten stuff is higher fat and protein.
ferrets,3dgznt,goblinish,2,Thu Jul 16 08:12:46 2015 UTC,Check the kibble chart in the sidebar - high protein cat food is great for ferts!  I'd like to chime in and suggest that you mix at least two kibbles together if possible. Ferrets can get picky about their food and if your kibble gets recalled or the formula changes it can be difficult to get them acclimated to a different brand cold turkey.  My boy loves Wellness Core Cat and Orijen.
ferrets,3dgznt,DoubleDot,2,Thu Jul 16 11:17:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of, even high quality, ferret foods aren't really that healthy for ferrets. They have grains and veggies in them that your fuzzball can't digest and can contribute to later issues like insulima  or adrenal disease.    High protein cat food is actually really great. both cats and ferrets are obligate carnivours and have similar dietary needs. Get a high protein and grainfree cat food.   The problem with feeding dogs only cat food is that they need more than just protein. Dogs need things like veggies and roughage for their digestion.  People who try to save a few bucks on food for their animals and feed the wrong nutrition will often end up spending more in health care as their pet gets older."
ferrets,3dgznt,maximilliangc,2,Thu Jul 16 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"The protein content of the kibble is only one of the important aspects of the kibble.   A 30% protein kibble with no added sugars and very little grain, vegetable, fruit, and artificial products in it is much better than a 50% protein kibble with tons of the aforementioned stuff in it.   To concretely answer your question: yes, a high (animal) protein cat kibble is fine, just as long as you make sure that the first few ingredients are animal products, there's no added artificial or chemical nonsense, and there's little grain, sugar, plants, fruits, vegetables, etc. in it.  Orijen is probably one of the best options when it comes to ferret kibble in general, which happens to be ""cat kibble"". We feed it to our three ferrets."

ferrets,3degm0,NewBeginning152,7,Wed Jul 15 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"Not all ferrets and cats will get along. They have very different ideas of play. Your best bet is to separate them and supervise any interactions until you know for certain they have worked out a cohabitation structure. The cats need to learn to not swipe or bite the ferret and the ferret needs to learn not to chase and bite the cats. The good news is that with kittens this is an easier process than if they were adults. They may learn to cohabitate and they may never learn so they will always have to be separated.  It's not ridiculous at all to share your experience. There are a lot of people unsure how to introduce and even begin to attempt having felines and ferrets together. Sometimes it goes super smoothly, but those are the rare occasions. So it's great to have that reminder that it is crucial to supervise all interactions."

I base that assumption off you making no mention of damage to the kitten.   I'm a big believer in letting the animals hash things out as they see fit, so long as no one gets hurt. Ive had my ferrets around dogs, cats and even my bird. The bird is the only one who gets special protection because the ferrets will try to kill it.   In my opinion, just let them figure things out.

ferrets,3d6efl,ferretmom92,3,Mon Jul 13 21:52:44 2015 UTC,My heart just melted. That may have been the cutest thing I've ever seen.

ferrets,3d62uv,ferretmom92,2,Tue Jul 14 01:33:53 2015 UTC,In his mind   Please stop taking pictures with me. I was stealing your shoes and I intend to continue doing that.
ferrets,3d4pfl,lcmotes,6,Mon Jul 13 14:35:12 2015 UTC,The two of you look like you should be on a detective/murder mystery show solving cases together. Soot digs around and finds all the clues for you.
ferrets,3d4pfl,mjh215,2,Mon Jul 13 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"Stunningly gorgeous hair! You ferret's cute, too."
ferrets,3d4pfl,JaxThePillow,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:31 2015 UTC,Great name for a ferret.  I have one named Kitty.  I wanna get another and name it Babadook.

ferrets,3d786w,harris1798,2,Tue Jul 14 01:44:00 2015 UTC,Fostering unwanted ferrets we see this as the most common health issue with our fosters.   We have seen tremendous success with the implant as long as it is maintained by replacing every 18 months.
ferrets,3d786w,comfortandvanity,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:37 2015 UTC,You can use Des Implant as a preventative for adrenal disease as well. I did my senior year thesis on adrenal disease and I am sure you have access through your university library to the Journal of animal science for exotic pets. There are some great articles about adrenal disease in there.
ferrets,3d786w,banditotis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, I had no idea. I will have to find those articles, I'd love to see the clinical trial data on that. Thanks!"
ferrets,3d786w,Shekh_ma_shieraki_an,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:46:31 2015 UTC,We use Des implants at the ferret rescue I work at and they work tremendously.

ferrets,3d3svc,sexychippy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:40 2015 UTC,So fucking cute! !
ferrets,3d3svc,ferretsRfantastic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:42:53 2015 UTC,Does he like N-bone treats
ferrets,3d3svc,ferretmom92,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"Ferrets are obligate carnivores. They can't process anything that isn't meat so keep fruits and grains and dairy away from them! They don't have the organs in their digestive system to break down sugars and it can make them really sick.   That said, all ferrets try desperately to eat anything they aren't allowed so I suspect this photo caught the fuzzer before harm was done!"
ferrets,3d5m9s,Pinch_N_Roll,6,Mon Jul 13 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure your landlady cant change the terms of your lease if you're in the middle of the contract. Unless you've just now renewed your lease, that might be worth looking into."
ferrets,3d5m9s,Dr_Wolfie,3,Mon Jul 13 21:07:14 2015 UTC,I thought it was super fishy too. The place i live in isn't exactly known for ethical business practices.
ferrets,3d5m9s,Dr_Wolfie,2,Mon Jul 13 21:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well, you never know, you may have some success if you push the issue. Be tactful, of course, but maybe you can get them to let you keep your guys until your contract is up. They definitely shouldn't be able to do this, but it's unfortunately often more trouble than it's worth to escalate things."
ferrets,3d5m9s,Dr_Wolfie,3,Mon Jul 13 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"I'll try, but the new owner is pretty stubborn about pets. He denied my friend and mines apllication because he had a dog. I really dont want to start something with my slumlord, but if i can keep them id be thrilled!"
ferrets,3d5m9s,maximilliangc,4,Mon Jul 13 21:40:57 2015 UTC,I hope things work out for you!
ferrets,3d5m9s,maximilliangc,2,Mon Jul 13 21:50:20 2015 UTC,Me too.
