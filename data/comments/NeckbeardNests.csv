NeckbeardNests,3cmdb8,SonOfTheBlueMeanie,24,Thu Jul 9 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"It's horrible, but it's not ""walls covered in fungus and mountain dew"" horrible. One day before garbage day, some Lysol, rags, and a carpet cleaner will actually have that place spic and span. But will it stay like this? Probably not, because there is nothing to stop it form happening again.  Next step from that is furnishing the room like a human being. Push the long end of that fucking desk against the right hand wall in that photo. Yes, there is a chance someone can walk in and catch him 'bating to something awkward, but it's a small price to pay.  Use the extra space he has gained by pushing it against the wall and get some shelves. Fucking hit up yard sales, or just cruise around the dump or around neighborhoods that college/university students live in near the end of the month. Last resort is to go to the lumber yard, spend $40 and get a sheet of plywood and have them cut it to specified lengths. A 4x8 board will get you enough for two shelving units: For one, cut two 4' lengths @1' wide, and four 2' lengths @1' wide (my math is horrible, but you get the idea). Screw and glue those together and boom! Standing shelves. He can use that to put stuff on besides the floor.  Next step: Posters. He should get some shit up on those walls that he cares about. The more you care about a place, the less likely you are to treat it like a dump. I'm not saying it's a sure thing (look at Hoarders), but anything that turns a body-and-PC storage space into something you can feel a bit happy walking in to will go a long way to wanting to do routine maintenance. Get him to get some posters up, or bolt a length of wood to the wall where he can hang action figures from his least favorite anime from. Whatever makes him happy.  And lastly: For x-mas, get this man a garbage can and a box of black, shiny garbage sacks. Empty that box of bags into the bin, pull one out, pull it over the edges and VOILA! When you fill it up, take it out, and tie it up, there is a host of them waiting for him at the bottom and (assuming he aint chucking broken glass into those bags and ripping them) they will be ready to use.  I never got this bad, but I almost did living alone in a small space. It becomes overwhelming to do something, so you just do nothing. Lame excuse, I know, but it is amazing what the power of one friend offering to help can do. It is not your responsibility, but since you tried to harvest Karma from him, I hope I have volunteered some useful tips for you when/if you choose to dive in and help.  Oh, and bring gloves and sponges."

NeckbeardNests,36iygt,ResilientHooker,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"True. The thing is, if your skill is at that level that you can perform professionally, there's a lot more stuff you can do than just play. You could go teach (though the longer you perform and build your rep, the easier it will be to find students), judge competitions (again, the longer you perform, the more prestigious the competitions you are invited to will be), write a book based on your experiences, etc. Of course, performing is NOT an easy thing, and not everyone can become a Joshua Bell or Vladimir Horowitz. IMO, there are only a few performers who can perform for their entire lives, and those are the ones who are really at the top. Most performers have a career and then teach, using their accumulated fame to build a student-base.  But on the other hand, many music majors won't even make it to performing, so it is best to have another major. Something that interests you and that you are good at, and preferably something that can utilize your musical skills (i.e. business, teaching). Today, music students need to be well rounded since, truth be told, music is one of the most competitive fields. This is one of the reasons why conservatories such as Juilliard are not as popular as they once were. Many don't have a program that caters to non-musical majors. Regular universities with exceptional music programs, like University of Southern California, are becoming more and more popular.

NeckbeardNests,36flfk,scabdick,9,Tue May 19 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"Long story ahead:  My buddy used to be friends with this landlord that owned an apartment on a shitty end of town (strangely enough, right across the street from the cop shop) and one of his tenants, an older guy, got busted with child porn and thrown in prison. I guess there was a rumor that he had a gun somewhere in the apartment, so the landlord asked my buddy to search the place before the cops found it to save himself legal problems, and while he was in there he could take whatever he wanted. Well, I guess this guy had a lot of cats and INSANE hoarding problems, because there was literally bags and bags full of cat shit in a closet, and a thick layer of cat hair on EVERYTHING. Also ridiculous amounts of porn mags, mostly Playboy/Penthouse style, but also boxes of the ones with stories and stuff in them. Place was disgusting, but we managed to get a couple old Commodore 64 style computers and boxes and boxes of floppies that had games and such on them (I have no idea what happened to them since and I never checked any of them so I don't know if they had child porn on them). Dude's kitchen was awful too, fridge looked straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, except no body parts, just nasty meat mess (looked like he thawed a lot of beef without using plates or anything to catch the blood) plus there was mold and just grime everywhere. Smell was so bad that we were only in there for maybe an hour, but every time I drive past that place now I gag thinking about it.  tl;dr: guy gets busted with child porn, buddy checks apartment for gun (no sign of it), finds porn mags, cat shit, and old computers."

Picture shows boxes for headphones, 2 keyboards, 2 SSDs, a mic, a webcam, a GPU, an iPad, an iPhone 5 and a OnePlus One...  That is but a small section, maybe half at best. I also have boxes around for 2 mice, A CPU cooler, a CPU, 2 motherboards, a PSU, another GPU and a keyboard or two. There are still more."
NeckbeardNests,35a531,frank500,2,Fri May 8 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"hey, that razor box still has the board in it.  what gives?"
NeckbeardNests,35a531,wobbletons,3,Fri May 8 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"Ugh... I got it half price knowing I'd probably not like it... I don't like the switches too much, and I'm really enjoying my TKL more for space.  I'm just too lazy to get around to selling it."
NeckbeardNests,35a531,Pussy-Hunter,3,Fri May 8 18:58:29 2015 UTC,I'll buy it for 2 cents more than that guy. I don't even have a real keyboard.
NeckbeardNests,35a531,Bacon_Hammers,1 point,Fri May 8 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"slick.  i'm thinking about getting the corsair k65 rgb, but i'm anxious about spending all that money, and i'm probably going to change the switches as soon as I get it too.  currently using a logitech g710+ w/ mx browns, but i think they're too light for me.  i like the model M feel better, and would like to aim for that."
NeckbeardNests,35a531,CrystalDabuu,2,Fri May 8 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"Model M feels very impractical when using, but it's so good. If I didn't play games and use a mic, I probably wouldn't use anything else.  I saw the Corsair RGB series on Massdrop a few days back. Price wasn't pretty, but I think it was the best I've seen in a while, only casually looking though."

NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,Balmarog,86,Thu Apr 30 17:06:50 2015 UTC,Honestly depression plays a big part of everything in my life. I feel like garbage all the time so maybe thats why I was fine with living in it for so long. Its like why care about your surroundings when you dont care about yourself.
NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,Balmarog,62,Thu Apr 30 17:08:48 2015 UTC,I would wager cleaning it would do loads of good for your mental well being.
NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,chicol1090,63,Thu Apr 30 17:10:36 2015 UTC,Im in the process of cleaning it right now. Im moving this coming week so its like a fresh start. I will never allow it to get this bad again.
NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,Ruthalas,18,Thu Apr 30 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"A trick I started using that helped me, was to spend 10 minutes a day cleaning. 10 short minutes every day before I leave for work. Just slip it in at the same place every day and you will never spend more than 10 minutes cleaning ever again."
NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,RamenJunkie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"Making it a routine helps a lot. Once it is a habit, you rarely have to try and motivate yourself to spontaneously clean something.  This is how I get over my laziness."

NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,roomnoises,18,Thu Apr 30 17:36:09 2015 UTC,Honestly laziness. Thats the easiest answer. Ive never been an organized kid but with no one to keep it in check it progresses. At first I had a trashcan I used but then I didnt feel like taking the trash out so I left it around telling myself Ill pick it up later
NeckbeardNests,34f4p4,UncleSneakyFingers,19,Thu Apr 30 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"Is that really piss in the tea jug? If so, why."

This is also 5'11 and 240lb. Very much obese.   BMI isn't accurate for extreme outliers, but if you're one of those outliers, you already know BMI doesn't apply to you. For the majority of people, BMI is perfectly fine."

To be happy with it, they have to be so bad themselves that they chase away tenants. I knew a guy like this, place stank and was full of random furniture rescued from the trash, and didn't even have door locks, and he was perfectly happy with all roommates.

Her father when he was still alive used to rent out the places to people who had bad credit and were down on their luck, usually giving them discounts on the rent as well.  When he died, the mom became responsible for dealing with the the tenants. I accompanied them for an inspection. The kitchen had doors ripped off like in the video, garbage all over... When the tenants skipped town, they gave the key to the neighbors, who had begun using the place as a dumping ground for their garbage, and hosting parties, and letting people squat there. My gf's mom asked for the key back and they said they lost it, so the locks had to be changed toute suite... One of the bedrooms had baby oil sprayed all over the walls. There was food everywhere... kids toys... it was a disaster. She tells me that it always happens in that town."

For me it was probably a mix of depression and being unemployed. You never have to clean up! There is always somewhere else to start putting shit. It's just.. you get to a point where you are so consumed with gaming or watching anime or being on reddit or whatever that ANYTHING else is a massive inconvenience. Things just follow the path of least resistance and getting up to throw things away in the garbage can is too hard. The more the mess grows, the more difficult it is to clean as it would now take a significant amount of time to do so. Sometimes I had so many cans and shit chilling that it blocked part of my TV screen. That was the only thing that got me to take action. And by take action, I mean just moving the cans somewhere else.  I had a wakeup call when I grabbed an Arizona Tea can, took a swig from it, and realized it was piss. I had so many tea cans that I didn't know what was what. And yes I am insane for trying to piss into a small hole surrounded by sharp metal. I have also taken swigs out of cans that had cigs/ash in them and that is probably worse than piss."

I was a neckbeard nester a few years back but even I knew that.  I've had a look at your previous posts and it really was a mess, and seemed to get worse not better over time.  It's heartbreaking that you gave him a weeks notice to clean it up before contacting the landlord, and a week later its all up in smoke. If only the timing was a day earlier..  If you're thinking of getting another house share you should definitely look into getting some personal possessions insurance.  It's like household insurance but you can just insure a single room contents (i.e. yours) and that makes it a lot cheaper. It's well worth having.  One final point, is this the fucker?

NeckbeardNests,30lxfo,C-Ron,116,Sat Mar 28 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"I've spotted some rookie mistakes here:   Piss jugs should have their caps put back on when not in use. This prevents spillage and won't vent fermenting piss-fumes into the air. They should be emptied every day, the accumulation of several piss jugs is a sign that this isn't happening.  These are not ideal piss jugs, due to the narrow neck size. A plastic milk jug will generally have a wider opening where the penis can be inserted fully. This helps prevent accidentally slipping off target and spraying piss everywhere - and it only takes a moment's lapse in concentration for this to happen. In the few seconds it takes to recover from this, you've made quite a mess. These containers also make poor piss-jugs because of their high center of gravity and relatively narrow base. A more stable solution would, again, be a milk jug. Piss jug placement is questionable. For these containers, a solid table is better than, say, a thick carpet for stability. But leaving your piss jugs on display is not classy. And setting them up like bowling pins (while un-capped) is just asking for a soaked carpet.   Over all I think this person needs to accept the fact that they use piss jugs and raise their game. Find a good piss-jug container and re-use it, rather than improvising with what ever happens to be at-hand. Empty your piss jugs before they become rancid. Find ways to mitigate fermentation. But then, this person appears to have some kind of special vomiting wall, so I think they have a ways to go with the whole ""adequate planning"" thing."

I'm going to be a very specific pedant here and let you know that   Healthy piss probably won't legitimately ferment (sugar-filled neckbeard piss might)  It definitely won't if it's left open to the air, fermentation is anaerobic If anything grows on the piss at all it will be bacteria that oxidize ammonia to nitrate, but this is (almost) strictly an aerobic process   Piss is remarkably sterile."

I'm not well versed in matters of science or biology, because I spend all my time playing video games and masturbating.  I have some follow up questions, if that's ok.   Once when I was a kid, I pissed in a coke bottle, sealed it, and left it under my bed for some months. When I came across it again, the bottle contained white gunk that smelled like rotten eggs. Was this fermentation? Or something else? Am I using the correct word?  If I piss into a toilet bowl several times and don't flush it, after a few hours the bathroom will stink. Is this a bacterial process (releasing nitrate?), or has the piss itself been evaporating very slowly over time and filling the room?  If I leave a sealed piss-jug for too long, its contents will begin to take on that rotten egg smell. Could I prevent this by squeezing the bottle until all the air has been expelled before sealing it?"

Some people have weird living situations where using a piss jug actually is reasonable. When I was looking for a new place to live, I spent a few months living in a small one bedroom apartment with a couple of good friends of mine who were married. My ""room"" was the couch in the living room, and the only bathroom in the apartment was attached to the bedroom. The only way I could access the bathroom was by walking through their bedroom. During the day this didn't matter, but late at night I didn't want to walk in on them having sex or simply disturb their sleep before getting up for work. I was forced to use piss jugs for any late night pisses. Of course, I responsibly sealed the piss jugs, kept them in a discrete place so nobody had to see them, and emptied them out as soon as possible (I never had more than 1 full piss jug)."

I thought my tub (note: haven't been in here long) just had some sort of coloration to show off the textured bottom since it was just always like that from the previous resident. Nope. Pure blessed coloring all throughout.   It is also great for stains and buildup. Seeing it work so well actually encourages me to go further!

You've asked for tips so I'll give you mine, more on tidiness.    Not later, now. Everything has a place or a home. Plenty of garbage bins.   I give everything a home by organizing, things that are not garbage should have a home and be returned there when you're finished with them, not later, now. Having plenty of garbage bins makes it less annoying to get to one and throw things out too."

That said, when I should do a task I hate (or too lazy/unmotivated to do) I bite my lip and do it for 15 minutes. That is enough time to see some results. Once you are there you have gained momentum. Also splitting large tasks into smaller ones help a lot. You don't clean your apartment. You just pick up the trash/clothes laying around in that room. Then you can dust/vacuum per room, etc etc."

NeckbeardNests,300tub,Marsev,11,Mon Mar 23 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"Heh, that's my video. I've actually posted it before in another thread, where I regaled fellow redditors with tales of robberies, magical wintertime, and the homeless drinking forties in my igloo. A copy/paste bit from those posts regarding the backstory of this video:   Two years later, my friend had to move to my apartment from his place on 21st and Diamond because a deranged drug dealer tried breaking into their place at 3 AM threatening to kill everyone. Almost kicked the door in before he left. Upon scrambling to move out, the residents somehow managed to get the house to this condition. You can see the near-kicked in door in the beginning.   Another redditor asked:    I'm confused. Somebody TRIED to rob their house, so they all left belongings and moved out in the night leaving it like a crackhead hovel. It's Philly and an attempted break in. Not kristallnacht purges. Yeah it sucks, but Jesus. That guy NEARLY kicked our door in, abandon ship!   My response:   Knowing the type of situation they were in, it was best to get their stuff out of there ASAP. One of their housemates apparently dealt a lot of shit and owed money to that dealer. It was not a random break in: it was a specific person promising to murder that person and everybody else living there. Getting out of that house overnight was actually police advice. Besides, they did get most of their belongings, but the ""crackhead hovel"" look was not much of a new feature. That apartment was full of all sorts of wacky adventures before. Some months prior, my housemate came home to find his room, and the rest of the house, a complete mess. Turns out the place was raided by federal agents that captured and arrested their new housemate, who was a wanted killer on the run from Baltimore. Still, North Philly's griminess is a sliding scale. My last ex lived around 20th and Erie. Now that was an area that I avoided like wildfire if I could help it. I went to her house the first time and moved her to my place immediately. The stuff that I saw there is more fit for a throwaway account. It made 20th and Diamond look like peaceful suburbia by comparison.   Fun trivia: a few months prior to these shenanigans, the feds stormed the apartment and durned the entire place upside down, much to my friend's dismay (the other guy in the video). Turns out they were looking for their new housemate, a quiet guy who was apparently wanted for murder in Baltimore. When he was apprehended, he was hiding in the bathroom seen towards the end of the video."

Then the water buffalo died. And all of this occurred a month ago."" I would clean my fucking room! Do they simply not care? Or do they build some sort of stank immunity?

I'm talking mango slices, orange peels, a cutting board covered in onion slices/peels, and 12 beer cans. It was 6 am and I had to go to work, so I left a note that said ""Your mom isn't here. Pick up after yourself before we get roaches"". Came home to the mess still being there minus the mangos and another note that read ""mangos have to ripen"".

Try not to shake it too much so the paint doesn't get mixed up with the air. Best idea is to rest the can upside down for 5-10 minutes before starting so the paint has a chance to separate from the air. When spraying, once it starts to smell a little like paint (you won't see any paint yet) you should stop so you don't actually get paint on anything. Good luck!"

You don't have to be dealing with a hoarder to find awesome tips there. One strategy suggested there is you pick just a small area to clean. Like literally one corner of a table. And you clean just that corner. Clean 10 minutes at a time and stop for half an hour to process what you did. Then try another 10 minutes.   Other posters are correct in that it's about forming habits and recognizing why he has trouble cleaning. Did he never learn it at home? Is it a feeling of hopelessness (the clothes will only get dirty again so why bother washing them)?   Get a garbage can for the room and start throwing away the trash that can't be argued about. Rotting food he can't argue to save. It doesn't belong inside. Work from there. Have him try clothes on. If it doesn't fit it goes in one pile, if it does another pile. Then the clothes are washed or thrown away and then donated or put away.   I hope this helps a little. Good luck!"

NeckbeardNests,2s10qd,LordPubes,3,Wed Jan 14 05:46:29 2015 UTC,Who is this person that is allowed to tell you to fuck off with no repercussions?
NeckbeardNests,2s10qd,morto00x,5,Fri Feb 13 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Give him a reason to go out. Invite him to go out, to the park or to the mall for a walk. Call up some of his friends to invite him out too.  As others mention, he is either depressed or unconciously giving up on a better life. Help him clean the room every now and then. Having a depressing looking room can also affect this persons motivations."
NeckbeardNests,2s10qd,CitizenPremier,3,Wed Jan 14 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"Cleaning is much more pleasant with music.  That's just a random tip.  If you're going to confront him about this (and you probably should), I'd suggest cleaning together while playing some tunes."
NeckbeardNests,2s10qd,oblonglamppost,3,Wed Jan 21 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"A little edgy, but maybe telling them they need to be more hygienic to live with you? Of course, if you suspect it to be depression, don't do this harshly. Just let them know that what they are doing isn't healthy, and that it can't go on."
NeckbeardNests,2s10qd,srsly,1 point,Mon Jan 12 00:56:06 2015 UTC,If they knew I wrote about them on here they'd freak. That's why I'm not giving away too many details.
NeckbeardNests,2s10qd,zeeyaa,2,Mon Jan 12 03:16:42 2015 UTC,"I personally got to a point where i hadn't had sex in 2 years and there would have been no way i could have invited a woman over and not have her leave in disgust once she would have seen my mess of a room. so even when i was going out with the intention of getting to know or picking up women, when i was talking to one, there was that mental barrier (""oh no, i can't invite her to my mess of a home"") that stopped me from even trying to get laid.  years of depression and just not giving a fuck had led to just about the messiest room imaginable. the general laziness and messiness was visible not only in my room, but everywhere. the living room was a bit messy and was in constant need of a proper sweeping/vacuuming, piles of unwashed dishes in the kitchen sink and we could have cleaned the bathroom more regularly. you could definitely see that at least one inhabitant of that appartment was a total slob.  one thing occurred to me at one point: it may be a fuckton of cleanup work that seems undoable NOW, but if i just throw a little bit of garbage away now and vacuum that corner there, every day a tiny bit, it'll all be gone at some point.  i made it a habit that before i leave the house, i make sure that it looks at least marginally better than it did when i woke up. it's only a few minutes with a broom and grabbing the few things that are lying around and throwing them away every day that make a difference between a neckbeard nest and a bachelor's apartment.  it's a few more minutes a day of deeper cleaning and/or dishwashing to turn a bachelor's apartment into a normal apartment and a few more to turn an apartment into a clean apartment.  i am still working my way to having and maintaining a ""normal"" apartment, but ""necbeard nest"" status is impossible to return to once you start doing the bare minimum and make it a habit to do at least that."

If you actually look at the things in the room then most of the stuff is old furniture and books. Not really the things that your average 32 year old is interested in collecting.   If he really made this his nest then you would see empty plastic bottles and plastic wrappers all over the place. Only plastic bottles I see are filled ones that are placed next to the fridge that the parents had to stop using because their son put his TV on it. It seems like your normal rural family storage room turned into temporary bedroom.  I think you're judging your brother too quickly dude, but if he wears a fedora and has a neckbeard then I'm probably wrong."

We cannot spend the night because their spare room is 3 feet deep in old cloths they never throw away. Other than his nest his neckbeard qualities are not working to pay his stay, spending all his time playing video games at all hours of the night. We had to stay the night once and he was up until 5am yelling at his friends on Minecraft then slept until supper that night. Girls that date him mostly use his parents to babysit while she goes on dates with other guys behind his back. It would be tragic if he didn't keep taking the same girls back over and over because ""At least I have a girlfriend sometimes.""

I don't even smoke weed and I'm still worried that you're gonna die smoking out of a Gatorade bottle like a goddamn caveman.   That's not lack of money, that's straight up lazy.

It's a surprise that you're all unfamiliar with the classic aussie gatorade bong. they're pretty common over here with teens and bogans. Look up the bonglord. The thing is, i'm obviously currently unemployed, so when I get cash, I could choose to go all across the city (public transportation, yuck) to buy a bong, but, for now, that means less weed, which is unacceptable (although to be fair and serious, the gatorade thing was made truly at a time when all else failed, and I stuck to it only because it worked so damn well <3). Weirdly I haven't considered buying it online yet. I might look into it when I can be bothered.   tldr: getting new bong means going outside"

Violent crime of article  Law, government, and crime in Winnipeg:       Winnipeg has always been one of Canada's most violent cities. One great example is that from 1981 to 2012, Winnipeg has been the ""murder capital"" 16 times, of every Canadian Metropolitan Area,   which is 51.6% of the time. Add to that, since 2007 (to 2012), Winnipeg has been the murder capital every year. Beyond homicides, Winnipeg consistently has the highest robbery rates, sexual assault rates and the highest violent crime index in general of any large Canadian city. Winnipeg has had the highest violent crime index since 2009, where it was more than double the Canadian average (187.0 compared to 93.7), as well as in 2011 (173.8 to 85.3), although the rate has been lowering. For example, in 2009 the rate was 187.0, where in 2012 it was down to 145.4, still however 20 points higher than the second place city, Saskatoon. In 2011 is when Winnipeg's homicide rate peaked. 41 homicides were recorded,  for a rate of 6.2 per 100,000 residents. There were an additional 4 unlawful deaths, which would bring the rate to 6.8. This rate was around 4 times higher than the national rate at 1.7 per 100,000 people.  The next year, there were 30 known homicides in Winnipeg for a rate of 4.5 per 100,000 residents, with an addition 3 unlawful deaths equating to a rate of 5.0. Again, a few times higher than the national rate at 1.6. The robbery rate in 2012 was between 250.1 to 272.9, as the annual crime report and CrimeStat  had different numbers. The annual crime report, reported 1,660 robberies, where as CrimeStat reported 1,811. Regardless, the rate is several times higher than the national average at 79.4.  Winnipeg's robbery rate peaked at 346.7 in 2009, the much lower robbery rate in 2012 of course shows a decrease in this violent crime.

To an outsider it seems that with a little bit of effort (taking out the trash / recycling a few times a week), you could live a much more enjoyable life where you didn't have to wade through empties.

NeckbeardNests,2nu2nc,Kirchyking,4,Sun Nov 30 17:03:55 2014 UTC,"From the website:   Mook: A common state of being which leads individuals to behave in impulsive and instinctual manners. The strong character of a mook will transcend loudly in any environment and will display the set opinions, morals and ways of life which the person chose to live by. The opposite of a conservative, socially self conscious, uptight bourgeois elitist, the mook is an open minded individual which lives in the moment and allows himself to indulge in the things he enjoys the most out of life. The common trait amongst mooks is that they refuse to compromise to anything outside of what they feel is truly right.   From Merriam-Webster:   Mook: slang; a foolish, insignificant, or contemptible >person"

Him or herself. Which makes it something you should do if you want to keep tabs on your establishment. It's sad that you have to, but you shouldn't have to, ideally. That's why I'm still of the opinion that it's the tenants' fault. But it's just semantics.

NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,helpmethrowawaystuff,33,Thu Oct 2 02:35:37 2014 UTC,I do it in simple steps. I set an hourly alarm and every time the alarm goes off I spend 5 minutes cleaning shit. Do that for a couple days and your apartment will start to look better. Over a week or two you're place will become spotless. Start off with throwing out as much junk as you can if you're not going to use it again throw it out
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,Gorilla_daddy,38,Thu Oct 2 02:39:34 2014 UTC,"This, and place things strategically.  Got trash beside your computer desk? You need a bin there. Dirty clothes piled up in the bathroom? That's where your laundry basket needs to be. Is your toilet dirty? Put the cleaner beside the toilet brush. Do you have to go digging to try and find the duster? Move it - if it's hiding away somewhere then it require extra motivation to clean, and that's exactly what you don't want.  You want your bins to live where your trash/laundry etc. land. You want your bathroom cleaning cloth and squeegee in the bathroom. You want your toilet cleaning stuff beside the toilet. You want the dustpan and broom in the kitchen.  That way next time you go to throw your trash somewhere or next time you notice the toilet is grubby what you need is right there and all you have to do is spend 30 seconds cleaning.  People who are clean usually aren't the ones who do massive spring cleaning once a fortnight, they are usually the ones who clean up as they go - they spend a minute here and there cleaning things up when they notice them, and they keep the place clean that way. The best part about this is that it only takes a couple of minutes a day (you might need to dedicate 10 minutes a day until it's under control) and that's it. Plus if you regularly clean things and wipe them down etc. then it's way, way easier than trying to clean 9 months of built-up gunk in one go and you aren't going to be caught by surprise when someone wants to go back to your place.  Last tip: only ever use liquid soap. Bar soap builds up like wax on sinks and tiles, and this encourages mould. Liquid soaps dissolve readily in water and they hardly cause any build up and they are less likely to encourage mould growth. Oh, and rinse the sink before spitting toothpaste in it (rinsing your toothbrush before use is a good practice anyway and it will also wet the sink) and then rinse after, ensuring that it all gets washed down because it acts a lot like bar soap."

First things first: music. I don't care what genre of music, but you need something upbeat. Liquid/jump dnb, top 40 pop, swing, big band jazz, hard style - I don't give a shit what it is. It just needs to have a nice tempo. Play it, and play it loudly.   If you have a PC do a partial tear down. Open it up and remove anything with a PCI slot. NICs, video cards, and the like - take it all out. If you have easy access drive bays, take out the hdds too. If it's a console problem, unplug them, and bag them up. Throw everything into the same bag so it becomes a jumbled mess. Now you have motivation. You can't touch your games until your house is clean.  Next, clean your fucking place. Start at one spot in the room and collect all of the trash as you canvas the entire room. Literally pick a spot, grab shit, trash it, and sidestep to the right/left. Do a second pass to clean up dirt/grime and reorganize. This seems kind of simplistic, but it's a surefire way to make sure that nothing is left behind. There is no, ""I'll come back to it later."" When you approach something not in the correct place, fix it. Now.   When I say clean up dirt and grime, I mean use some sort of disinfectant to wipe up. Don't just scrap crust off with your finger nails. Don't just use a wet cloth or paper towel. Lysol or Clorox your shit down, because if it looks anything like these places, you probably should be wearing a haz-mat suit. Sweep/vacuum and mop your floors. Run the dishwasher. If you don't have a dishwasher, do it by hand.  You're gonna need to clean up the keyboard too. Pop out all of your keys, wipe down the keyboard base and clean off every goddamn key. I'll excuse shift keys and space bars due to the nature of their mounting. Pull out the controllers from that bag and clean those too. No tear down of those is needed, but do a damn good job.  Now that your place is clean, routine. Routine, routine, routine. This is where /u/Gorilla_daddy comes in. For every hour you, get the fuck up and clean something. You're spending 5 minutes of chores for everything 60 minutes of fun time. 1:12 ratio. In this routine, you will need to pick up a new mindset that I happened to find here on Reddit.  If it something that can be done in less than 2 minutes, you take care of it immediately. You may not skimp on a 2 minute task. If it's something that can be done in 3-20 minutes, you can put it off once for up to 24 hours. For example: clothes in the dryer are done. You need to fold/hang them. Since you don't want to do them now, you can do it later. Should you realize there's something you need from the dryer since then, you will now fold/hang all of your clothes. If not, you have up to 24 hours later to complete the task.  If it's something that's longer than 20 minutes, you can pass on this task. However, you must immediately schedule a time within the next week to accomplish the task. My favorite example is mowing the lawn. I hate it. However, my rule that I will cut the grass 2 hours before sundown on Sunday evening.   This is basically it. Clean up, get a routine, spot check when necessary. Good luck."
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,AmateurHero,3,Thu Oct 2 03:44:47 2014 UTC,"Oooh, I like this advice!  Personally I would clean with one thing in mind - just the trash, just the dusting, just the vacuuming, and so on. I'd make sure to grab a box or a basket of some description and that would become my housecleaning ""in tray"" for dirty laundry and for stuff that needs to be organized instead of thrown away and so on.  Otherwise I've found that if I try cleaning/sorting/organizing/washing everything from top to bottom I get overwhelmed and I find that I get caught with a to-do list that continually grows rather than shrinks (as in I find myself saying ""I need to wash these clothes, but that means I have to empty the washing machine, then I have to take the clothes off the drying rack so I can hang the other stuff, then I have to fold those clothes, then I have to put them away so I have to clear and clean a working space first and then I have to organize the clothes in my wardrobe which means I need to clean enough floor space to get in there, and then I need to sort the clean clothes from the dirty ones..."") and it becomes this problem where each thing requires another thing to be sorted out first like some kind of physical paradox of tidiness, and I find myself either getting disheartened or I end up running backwards and forwards around the house to do one thing while being completely ineffectual.   So personally I like having a place to put things for later, especially if I'm cleaning up a neckbeard-level mess. But then you do need to be careful that this place doesn't become the seed-mess that sprouts roots and then blooms across your whole living space like some kind of weed."
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,Buffalo__Buffalo,3,Thu Oct 2 06:52:11 2014 UTC,"This is a great point, which is why I said take care of something the moment you reach it.

NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,Buffalo__Buffalo,13,Thu Oct 2 15:12:27 2014 UTC,"Wow thanks everyone for your suggestions. I started cleaning my room finally. I can't believe the amount of garbage that was stacked in my room. 6 full bags of trash and still cleaning. Unbelievable. I feel like I have gained so much room space after all of this lol. My carpet underneath is stained to some darker color. Hope vaccuming gets rid of it. Unfortunately, my base vaccum motor broke because I ran it over a sock, so only the normal suction tubes work. I still have all my clothes lying around in every corner which I have to start sorting and wash. I just realized that I have 30 pairs of sock because I would refrain from washing them and just buy new ones. I still have kitchen and bathroom to be done, but I feel great that I could get my room sorted out.   I hope I get my house cleaned fully tomorrow and invite my friends over on friday. Would be so relieved. I don't know If I'm wrongly using this subreddit, I just needed someone to talk to who had similar problems like me. I thought I was some crazy person with a weird problem like this, until I magically stumbled upon this subreddit."
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,innocuousremark,2,Thu Oct 2 05:52:38 2014 UTC,Is it too late to ask for before and after pictures?
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,Who_U_Thought,5,Thu Oct 2 23:19:39 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry I can't. I can't put pictures on Reddit, as my friends frequent it a lot. And it would be pretty awkward for me if they found out. And pictures of the internet never go out.  Let me just say that it was freaking horrible. I started eating fast food from wendys and taco bell everyday and my trash got full. So I would just dump the trash next to the computer. I never drank soda, and never smoked inside house so I didn't have soda cans or cigarettes in the room.  Once the table got full, it got to the floor and so on. Eventually I was walking on trash. I never cleaned my toilet, so my toilet was full of grime. I would just place toilet paper over the entire seat and sit on it, so I never cared to clean it.  The fridge has rotten eggs, milk, rotten mean, cheese, vegetables that got super rotten and then dried up. Apparently some bugs tried to get inside the fridge to eat that delicious rotten mean and died trying to do that. The kitchen sink had dishes that weren't cleaned from months. I used to cook everyday back before shit hit the fan. My bed had so many clothes on it, I used to sleep on clothes. If I ever washed em, I never put them on the hangers in the closet, I would just dump them on the floor or the bed. I had body aches sometimes after waking up from sleep because I would be sleeping on clothes that created an uneven sleeping posture. Anywa, this one night I felt something walking on me while sleeping. I woke up and I saw cockroaches walking on top me. I fucking freaked and sprayed bug spray around my bed and walls. But I still couldn't get the courage to sleep on my bed after that incident. So, I started sleeping in my living room couch. Living room wasn't a very tide room either. There was so much mail on my living room table, it was filled with it and some of it was on the floor.   I went on a vacation  with friends during the long weekend on labor day, and when I came back I just put the suitcases of clothes and shit on the living room and never got to put them back. It was so much of a mess, it was ridiculous.  Now I've cleaned everything thanks this marvelous sub reddit. I even found the check I got for my tax return from the state. I had lost it in the mess and just gave up on the 250$.  I just need to see pictures of other peoples problems, and it gives me a perspective of how bad it is, and what I don't want things to be. For some reason when I see my own fucked up room, I didn't feel like it was bad.  I hope you can make out a before and after picture in your mind with these details lol."

NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,LostSendHelp,2,Thu Oct 16 01:07:17 2014 UTC,congrats man its crazy once u start cleaning and u reliaze how bad it actually was. and about the carpet if its really badly stained you can rent carpet cleaning machines for cheap from grocery stores. it basiclly shampoos your rug clean.
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,baconreasons,7,Fri Oct 3 18:12:17 2014 UTC,"http://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/  Unfuck Your Habitat has been a really useful resource for me. I still get major anxiety when it comes to cleaning but it's become much more manageable. Personally I like to set timers and do 20/10 cycles (clean for 20 minutes, rest for ten, repeat). I also like to do things in order (EG, I'll collect garbage into bags first, then move onto dishes, then the bathroom etc).  I've also found taking before and after photos to be really helpful for motivation. I don't share the photos with anyone and I usually delete them after a week, but it gives me a big boost when I feel I have ""proof"" that I cleaned which I can look at later.  I also like listening to podcasts while I clean, that way I have a mental distraction so I don't focus too much on how anxious I feel.  I hope you are able to find a system that works for you.  EDIT: Here is a checklist from UFYH to start you off."
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,Tomble,5,Thu Oct 2 04:56:34 2014 UTC,"My mom is a complete hoarder. She's gotten better with the garbage, but this is how I grew up. I've  been away for quite some time, and this is how i do it (became a clean freak, cannot function unless it's at least decent):  Gross goes first. Cups, dishes, whatever grows mold or smells. When you get it out, either throw it out or wash it and put it away. Just fucking do it. You'll feel like a new man, you have ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING. Get that shit DONE, all of it, then reward yourself with a couple hours of games or a nap  or something.  Second thing is trash, papers and packaging. Not gross, dry stuff. Get a big trash bag, it'll go fast, you probably know at a glance what you need to keep. After that, go out and have a drink, or sleep. whatever. don't give up, just revel in the fact that you have made it this far. You are a new man.  last problem is your unorganized little stuff. You will probably find missing treasures, yay! If you can't use it, sell it. You know what's worth money and what's garbage. Give it a hard, detached eye and sell what you can.  Last step is to clean the carpet, other surfaces, then KEEP YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. Get trash cans. You can do it. You'll feel better. Congrats."
NeckbeardNests,2i1zn0,HallucinatesTigers,2,Fri Oct 3 22:08:16 2014 UTC,"I stumbled across a technique which works pretty well for me.  I identify a few areas that need cleaning , maybe kitchen, study and bathroom. I set a timer for 5 or 10 minutes, and clean the first area.  Time done, drop what you're doing and move to the next area.  Restart the timer. Repeat for an hour or so., moving from area to area.   I have a terrible attention span.  I think why this works well for me is that I don't get lost while cleaning an area, wondering what to do next.  Time is short so I end up entering the next area, seeing it afresh, making a mini goal like 'pick up clothes from the floor' and working towards that goal knowing that the clock is ticking. Even if I get distracted by something like an interesting magazine, the alarm goes off and I have to leave that area."

I'd rather just do huge amounts of it in only a few stages, except: I do it thematically.  No, not ""red first, then green"", rather first get rid of 95% of outright trash. Then place dishes in kitchen. Put clothes in hamper or whatever you use (no, not the ground, just use a bag if you have to). Then stow away computer equipment. Etc."

NeckbeardNests,2hfq9g,zagbag,29,Fri Sep 26 03:30:07 2014 UTC,"Have you ever noticed how some people have a lot of trash in their rooms, while others just have a lot of strewn about non-trash items? (Of course, I'm ignoring those weirdos with clean rooms here.)  I've always had such difficulty imagining how you let your room be littered not with stuff, but with trash. It seems so easy to clean up compared to, well, more durable goods (clothes, mugs, computer stuff, hygiene products ;), vitamins, books, etc.). Neckbeards don't usually strike me as the hoarding type - they seem more lazy or depressed than obsessed. Also, placing trash in front of your TV seems about as difficult to me as placing it in a trash can.  Not a complaint, it's just the one part of NeckbeardNests that makes it fascinating to me, I suppose."

Not so much litter, but half-empty bowls of food that I'd taken up and forgotten to return to the kitchen; glasses of milk that had been drunk, but with the residue at the bottom turning into cheese; random items and bits of paper strewn over the desk - mostly either doodles or things I'd never need again, but with the odd important document that meant I couldn't throw the whole pile away... oh and the clothes, and other larger items all across my floor - I'm usually pretty clumsy, but by necessity I developed the skills of a ballerina to be able to tiptoe over the few bare spots of carpet poking out beneath layers of junk..."

Also half of the problem was that the mess had been building up over all the years I'd been there - even when I did really thorough tidy ups, there was still a lot of clutter in the corners of the room that required a lot more thought (like, throwing old documents/toys away, etc.) and just generally I think I outgrew the room - for a very tidy person, they could've managed the space but I didn't have very efficient storage spaces in the first place, so it was hard to keep tidy to begin with...  I do still forget about things, though... like just the other week I found a load of decomposed orange peel slime in my bag... oh and the other day some pears that I'd left on the counter for too long dribbled some foul-smelling juice all over the countertop... and... I think there's a tub of tinned fish of some sort that I left in a cupboard since... about March...

NeckbeardNests,2hfq9g,GiraffeRaging,16,Thu Sep 25 22:32:16 2014 UTC,So what do you want me to do? Clean his room for him and stand behind him all day putting his trash away when he throws it on the floor? I don't have the tools to help him. I've tried. I've talked to him. I've cleaned the room for him. I've shamed him. I've praised him whenever he makes the smallest step toward living a hygienic life. What else do you want me to do? I can't focus on him 24/7. Why do you insist on blaming me for this?

He can try to talk to him about it, he can stage an intervention, he can be supportive, but it won't make a difference if the brother doesn't care.   OP is not a parent. He cannot punish the brother for living like that, he has no authority over his brother. All he can do is try, which he has done."

It leads to a mental state in which even the most mondaine tasks become difficult to complete, let alone do on a regular basis. Keeping a room (reasonably) tidy, taking a shower, cooking a normal meal, interacting socially and, eventually, even taking a dump in a toilet as supposed to a plastic trashcan in your lair of isolation and dejection become burdens and obstacles.  Most of these ""Neckbeards"" are suffering from depression and all they need is a good friend, a good shrink and some love and attention. I know I shouldn't peer into the lives of the depressed for my own amusement and I don't. I don't laugh at these pictures or stories, I don't pitty these people, they just fascinate me somehow."

I do agree that the main reason he's so fucked up is due to his upbringing, but it still doesn't excuse his awful behavior."
NeckbeardNests,2fa1lj,Sapharodon,17,Thu Sep 4 03:41:04 2014 UTC,"I know I'm ten days late, but I thought I'd add in some input cuz as fucked up as he is, Chris-Chan's story is actually kind of morbidly fascinating.  I want to preface this by saying that I totally agree - he's a racist, incredibly sexist and homophobic guy.  A lot of this is probably due to his upbringing, social alienation and semi-related to his autism as well, but I do understand that the guy has some seriously fucked views and they are by no means excusable.  That said, the guy has both changed and remained the same since his internet glory days.  About six months ago his house in Ruckersville burned down - the very room we keep seeing photos of is probably ruined, if not by the fire than by weather, and the building is now abandoned and will probably be demolished.  Most original Sonichu artwork is probably gone because of this.  He and his mother live elsewhere now, but seem to be stable.  He now has returned to drawing Sonichu artwork and attempting to sell pieces on eBay for hundreds of dollars each.  I don't know if a single one has ever sold, but he's trying.  He insists that he has recently lost his virginity and has a girlfriend who is neither ""digital"" or ""a prostitute,"" in his own words - whether he's lying or not is to be seen.  Chris-chan still begs for Lego sets from his ""fans"" and has recently constructed a Lego representation of his old High School (with Sonichu and Rosechu figurines inside!).  He still does not have a job.  Some things never change.  That said, he seems to have taken a total 180 on LGBTQ rights - in fact, Chris-chan recently came out as a lesbian transsexual.  Gay/Lesbian transsexuals are rare but definitely do exist, and looking back to some of his previous statements (""I am a lesbian man!""), I'm surprised we didn't see this sooner.  He recently went to a PRIDE parade and apparently had a good time, and is now actively discussing LGBTQ rights on his Facebook profile.  ...okay, more ""hashtag-activism""ing, but it's a start.  It's such a dramatic change from him trying to embrace uber-masculinity (and hilariously failing each time) so long ago, it's quite an interesting transition to watch.  So yeah, I'm not disagreeing with you, I just find it interesting what has changed and what... well, hasn't."
NeckbeardNests,2fa1lj,lil-demon,3,Thu Sep 4 05:06:47 2014 UTC,"I for one, am wondering where the saga will go next. Will the ""damned dirty trolls"" finally relent and let him burn out into obscurity, or will they start a new trolling campaign against him, bringing him back into the spotlight?"
NeckbeardNests,2fa1lj,CORNHOLIO4D,9,Mon Sep 15 01:14:51 2014 UTC,"I think the trolling part of the saga is (almost) over. He hasn't really been trolled or talked to them since 2012 really. All he does is vent on his private Facebook and being the golden standard for manchilds.  Its a no-brainer that Barb will die in the next few years, and Chris won't get a job (sadly) so they're a couple paths once Barb dies.   Lives happily ever after: I didn't even think this was an option until news of a new GF came out. Assuming she is not troll and is somehow fine with the fact that he is more documented than many people that changed the world, they will likely get married. Then Chris can live out his fantasy and tuck a away that rough period for the rest of his (likely short) life.   That's what I'd prefer to happen. Now for the likely paths:   Chris goes to jail/institution/group home: It's not hard to see why. He's had several run-ins with the law (most notably his 2011 arrest) and based on the private Facebook posts uploaded to the CWCki, he is now completely delusional. He definitely can and will snap one day. And we he does, he will get arrested. After the trial,which he most certainly will be found guilty, he will either go to jail, where he will find trolls that make Cash look like a puny schoolgirl, or go to a mental institution/group home, where a number of things could happen that I'll not go into. After he gets out of jail, then the next option will go into effect likely. Chris becomes homeless: This is the most depressing option. He can't support himself in anyway, so unless someone intervenes and allows him to live with them, he will be on the streets. He will either die on the streets, or pull a step 1.   Overall, the saga is very likely coming to a close, and it will not end in a good way."
NeckbeardNests,2fa1lj,ruffthecrimedog,9,Mon Sep 15 01:52:56 2014 UTC,"It's strangely fascinating to read about Chris' insanely messed up life. To sum it up metaphorically, with Chris' life being a train; The internet's discovery and first contact with him was analogous to the wheels grinding, while the engine simultaneously sped up to uncontrollable speeds. The trolling sagas, from Bluespike to Clyde Cash, was the engine bursting into flames and the wheels breaking off. Finally, following his departure from the internet, his father's death, and his arrest in 2011, his increased societal isolation and onset of poverty in 2013, and his house burning down earlier this year, the train has derailed violently, and is now laying in a field as the last dying embers burn out. There are occasional flare-ups, but the chance of a wildfire is dismally minimal.  It's like the melancholic end of an era for the internet's most famous manbaby."
NeckbeardNests,2fa1lj,Stabbytehstabber,2,Mon Sep 15 03:47:26 2014 UTC,"Attention definitely died down after 2011/2012, when things were calming down and Chris stopped posting online as much.  A lot of attention has returned since his house burned and he started trying to sell his art via eBay though.  Most of the attention was aimed at his reactions to trolls, mostly via video responses.  He doesn't really do those anymore, unfortunately.  Chris-chan is surprisingly finding his way back into the spotlight, just in a different (though equally manchildish) way.  Here's to speculation and slack-jawed wonder as we watch this guy somehow make his way through life."

My brother never would allow me to go into his room. I never could figure out why, until one day I got pissed off and did. Well, needless to say THAT is what I had found. I yelled at him to clean it.. but being a teenager (18) he was more concerned with texting girls.. and going out with his friends. So he told me he would give me $20 to clean it.. and any change I could find on the floor. I ended up finding roughly $15. He also ended up having a complete full bottle of patron tequila hidden in his dresser, which I took shots of in order to handle the insanity of this room. In his room I found $700 worth of empty cigarette boxes. 8 cans of un opened soda (no I didn't drink them, they were tossed) 90% of the plates and cups i'd been missing in the house, most of the cups had something left in them... and they were caked in mold. Corelle isn't exactly a cheap brand to buy for dishes.. I had to throw all of them away. He had clamshells (the white take home boxes from restaurants) with full burgers and fries he ""forgot"" to eat. He would get too drunk, get food... and forget he had it the minute he laid down. He had empty boxes of chips, cheez-its, cookies.. etc. Empty bottles of soda galore. Cigarette butts, cans filled with cigarettes. The dark spots on the wall near the bed were where he would sweat and smoke and play video games. I found a pair of boxers on the floor, filled with SHIT. Human shit. I confronted him about it.. and he claimed he had no idea what I was talking about (Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight). It took my husband and I about 2 hours to clean the entire room. Not including mopping and sweeping. It truly had become a nest. BUT!! Through it all, he still managed to keep his phone charger nicely plugged in by his pillow, and his remote facing straight also next to his pillow."

NeckbeardNests,2coe4y,Nutella_Sandwich,27,Tue Aug 5 10:38:37 2014 UTC,"My maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather were hoarders as well as a good friend of mine from college.  It is a combination of things and the triggers for the behavior vary from person to person. My grandma grew up poor on a farm so she couldn't pass up a ""good deal,"" for example she'd frequent thrift stores and yard sales. She'd buy bags of clothes to mend but run out of time to do so- she had huge trash bags STUFFED with clothing. She was extremely fond of farmy looking knick knacks and ceramics, her home was filled with all kinds of chipped or marred figurines. Her garden was huge so she canned much of her extra produce, the problem being she still had years worth of tomatoes and other pickled veggies in her cupboards. My grandfather had been a mechanic but was paralyzed and partially blind (and an alcoholic), so the projects on his property piled up. Projects being rusted out cars, tractors, garden tillers, and literal tons of ""scrap"" metal and tires. He was living in poverty and refused to leave his home or let anyone do a major clean up on his place.  My pal from college faced depression and battled drug addiction (we knew about the marijuana but had no idea about other consumed substances) and his escapes were painting Warhammer figurines and playing video games. He never learned to cook and ate take out/pre packaged foods only, NEVER washed clothing (he'd buy new t-shirts and pile up all of the old ones, which his cats happily shat and pissed in) and never cleaned anything inside of his home. His home is overwhelming- it would take a small army of people and a giant dumpster to clear the mess inside as the floor is no longer visible and most of the piles inside are three to six feet in height. The carpets need to be ripped out, the dry wall needs to be re-done, the toilet rotted through the floor, and there are literal piles of rotted pizza boxes, soda bottles, and various other dangerous wastes. His neckbeard nest turned into a three bedroom, two bath, and basement nightmare in a few years. The shame from the reactions from visiting pals only made it worse. His adoptive mother was a hoarder but not in his sense of refusing to toss out trash- she kept ALL of the kids' clothing, school work, board games, and had dozens of boxes filled with things that evoked memories of the children she'd adopted. His hoarding began with the figurines, dvds, cds, and other types of media but spiraled out of control after her death.  Neckbeard nests and other hoarders usually realize they have a problem but have either a lack of motivation to take care of their messes or a mental ""block"" and come to accept the items around them. I asked my grandma why she couldn't part with a hundred (this is not an exaggeration) jars of well past expired canned fruits and veg, she'd told me she felt horrible for wasting food. My college pal couldn't answer when I asked about hiring a cleaning service- my guess? He didn't want to spend money on cleaning when he could buy more media, electronics, drugs, and junk food. Most neckbeards are probably similar in that they value their addictions (their personal time, fandom, collectibles, pricey food bill, etc.) over the state of their living space."

I didn't have nice things so i wasn't very motivated to take care of my stuff. I didn't have a trash can in my room so I would have to carry it out somewhere. My parents worked many jobs to support many children and did not have time to clean or teach me how to clean or to teach me that cleaning was even supposed to be a priority. And there was always something more fun to do than throwing that trash away, like reading or masturbating or getting to the next level in my game or answering that IM or watching a movie or whatever shiny thing was distracting me at the time. And after a while there was so much trash I knew it would take a long time to move it, which made me even less motivated to do it because now it meant taking on a Big Task and then who knows how long I would have to wait to masturbate again oh look Buffy is on!  Note: I am now a grownup and a clean freak so please no lectures or advice, I don't need it, I am merely trying to show OP the mindset I used to have"

I was diagnosed 2 months ago and 10 hours after my first dose of Concerta I was taking out 10 bags of trash, I did 5 loads of laundry AND I PUT THEM AWAY, I emptied 3 vacuum containers of dog hair, and scrubbed every surface in my house.   For the first time cleaning was not overwhelming... and trust me... you feel REALLY stupid when you can figure out Programming but you cant clean your damn house because ""its just so damn overwhelming, its all dirty, Ill never get this done, oh well... Ill get high and worry about it tomorrow"".  Seriously, I spent 18 years with an OCD clean freak mother then another 4 years in the Military and I still couldnt be bothered to throw away the cans on the counter or take out the 5 trash bags right by the door.   Once I had the diagnosis and the meds it was like I was a completely different, clean person. My place being clean has helped with confidence, self-esteem, and my general happiness."

NeckbeardNests,2coe4y,DONT_PM,5,Wed Aug 6 03:20:59 2014 UTC,"I'll add my two bits to this conversation, I've lived it first hand.    but I just can't understand letting something so simple to manage spiral so far out of control.   See, the failed logic here, I think, is the ""something so simple...spiral"" aspect. It isn't any single thing that gets out of control, and quite honestly, until one that is struggling has a reality check, nothing is quite out of control.   I've always been a stereotypical ""messy guy.""  I don't really mind having a pile of laundry in my room -- still to this day I struggle with this ""nesting"" behavior.   Many people have hit the nail on the head, including the top comment. For me it was defentitely escapism.  And my nest was full of empty pizza boxes, chip bags, and beer cans.      Here is how my depression/escapism/ratsnest went:  So, you get home from work.  You've been working all day (with a touch of a hangover, nevertheless) and all that's on your mind the whole day is when you can finally get off work, to crack open that beer and turn on CS.   You hate your job, your house seems empty, your life is slipping down a slope of sorrow and sadness, nothing goes your way, your anxiety is through the roof, and you just need to finally get your release for the day. Beer in one hand, mouse in the other, you're finally free from the day, to relax, to game.   Well, it's too much of a hassle to cook. After all, I did just work all day, and I only get so much time to play my games. I'll just grab a pizza.   So, work's out at 5, and on my way home I make three stops. Stop one, the gas station/convience store -- grab some snacks (chips, jerky, etc.), maybe a n.a. beverage (for me it was a jug of tea). Next stop, the L.Q. (what I've grown accustomed to calling the liquor store) to grab my beers.  And finally, at the Little Caesars for a 5 dollar pizza. Now $30+ lighter, and stocked ready for my night, it's time to head home.   I'm home now, carry my stuff inside. Time to kick off the pants. No need to put anything else on, hell I've got boxers on. Sure, they might be a few days old, but I've been rotating them so they don't smell...right? (at least not to me they don't.)   Of course when I open the door I'm greeted with yesterdays pizza, beers, etc. mess.  No worry though, it's not like anyone has to see this, and besides, fuck cleaning, I need to start getting my beers down so I can finally get some relief from all this anxiety and sorrow I have in my head.   Wash, rince, repeat. And then the routine is set. Now, all the pieces to the puzzle are there for the nest to get out of control.   Fast forward a few months.   You're now grabbing a 30-pack each day/two instead of a six pack.  You are pulling 2 -3 beers at a time from the fridge while you're gaming, because you don't want to pause in the middle of a match, but the beers go down so fast that you need three just to make it between breaks.   Let's not forget that while beer is great, it just doesn't get me relief as fast as I need/want anymore, so I better grab a few vodka or whiskey shooters. Today was especially bad, better spring for a whole bottle.   You're now eating an entire large pizza, and more for dinner every day.  You're drinking 20 beers, and 3 shots of liquor or more every day.  You've put off laundry for a month, and most of your clothes aren't fitting you anymore anyways.  There are boxes and bags of empty cans, bottle, wrappers, bags, etc. everywhere.  And you just seem to wake up one day and go, ""Holy shit, my house is fucking disgusting. I'm fucking disgusting. How did I ever let this get to this point?""   This just feeds on the depression.   You're fat, you're gross, and you're alone.   You give up.   And the rest? Well, you see the outcome in these pictures of this sub.     This is now my new favorite sub. It reminds me of a life I once had, and I never want again.   At least for me, I was able to reform.  Today, I'm proud to say I drink about once a week (Sunday funday, Go cowboys!). I keep a fairly clean (especially clean for my prior standards) house. I've lost 50+ pounds. I've done therapy and done some regiments of different anxiety/depression drugs.    And I have pizza maybe once a month."

NeckbeardNests,2ce1ge,NoeticIntelligence,24,Sat Aug 2 01:39:48 2014 UTC,"I would say it takes a while for the pictures to reach mass distribution on the internet, so by the time the picture is under the radar of the users of this sub (roughly 5,000) they've been passed around several websites.   Truth be told, pictures of the nests themselves are probably pretty rare anyway. No one whose house looks like that would just post a picture so disgusting. I would also say the majority of neckbeards aren't very social, or are embarrassed of their homes, so they don't invite people over. The few times people do come over, they have to be asshole-ish enough to take a picture of that person's house and post it on the internet.   The only other source of the pictures would be landlords of the houses/apartments the nests are in or people who bought the houses after they were evicted.  Altogether, this makes finding pictures of recent neckbeard nests relatively rare."

NeckbeardNests,2c1wcj,godzilla1517,1 point,Wed Jul 30 15:07:24 2014 UTC,"Vaporizing, as in for nicotine or pot. With pot, when you light it on fire (like in a joint/bong/pipe) it's called ""combustion"". Vaporizing is when you heat it up to release the THC, but without burning the plant. It's better for your lungs and it's supposed to be more efficient, but a lot of vaporizers, or ""vapes"" are very expensive and/ or are not portable so most people don't bother. The thing on the table there is a portable vape. It looks like the kind that you use for liquid nicotine and/ or weed oil, but i don't know much about them."

That one had been there for a long time before we knew each other.  A side note about the garage was the fact that IF the door could open (it had been broken for an unknown amount of years) you would die in an avalanche. This was given away by the fact that the top right corner of the left most bay was dented/bent inwards and you could see the pile of god knows what cusp the exposure."

I used to have a problem throwing away CD wrappers and wrapping paper from presents for some reason, but that was more obsessive compulsive thing and I was able to keep it all in a small drawer before fighting the obsession...but this.

Non-specific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT. Prevention options for at-risk individuals include early and frequent walking, calf exercises, anticoagulants, aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression.

But isn't finding and using a piss bottle more work than just getting up and using the bathroom?  You have to balance your pee hole right over the bottle opening cuz you can't put it in there. You can't shake it afterward. And you have to worry about the thing overflowing before you're done.

Sure, it's relatively common for a hardcore gamer or graphic design professional to have a third monitor, but for some, the insanity doesn't end there.

NeckbeardNests,1yhai9,BNLboy,2,Fri Jun 20 14:56:39 2014 UTC,It's the old style monitors that look like tvs. It stands for Cathode Ray Tube.
