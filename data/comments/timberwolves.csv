timberwolves,3e2lsr,run1609,10,Tue Jul 21 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"The knock on Wiggins has continuously been that his advanced stats aren't worth writing home about. Now I'm all for the advent of modern statistics, because it tells us very useful things, but that being said, (and I think Canis Hoopus made this point when the Grantland article projecting Wiggins as a future Udonis Haslem or whoever came out), numbers don't always tell the full story. Whenever I see the ""Wiggins will be a league-average player at best"" take, it makes me cringe. Give any NBA expert a sample platter of Wiggins's tape from good games and bad games, spread thoughout the season, and there's no way you can say that he's going to grow up to be a league-average player. Anybody with a shred of basketball knowledge who watched the Wolves last year saw that Wiggins passed the eye test with flying colors. Do I think he'll be as good as LeBron or Durant one day? Probably not. But he's more than capable of becoming a franchise cornerstone, a solid #1 option, top 10 player in the league.   Anybody watching him play knows he has the tools. I'm no expert, but I have a pretty good feeling that playing in Flip's archaic offense with guys like Payne, Hamilton, Raduljica, Neal, Bennett, and the rest of the garbage they put on the court when Rubio/Pek/Martin/KG/Bazz were missing time, miiiiiight have some sort of effect on why his numbers weren't exactly leaping off the page.   In terms of the article itself, I think the Timberwolves have a great young core, obviously better than the 15th in the league. In a dream world, Wiggins and Towns develop into bona fide stars, LaVine does his best Jamal Crawford impression, puts his name in the running for 6th Man year in and year out, Shabazz becomes an above league-average 2 or 3, and the pieces slide in around them as they grow as individual players. I am praying for Ricky to stay healthy, because it's obvious how much he'll help bring along their offensive development.   Let's go Wolves."

timberwolves,3e2lsr,themoertel,11,Tue Jul 21 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"In the end, the system is a little biased toward players with at least some positive NBA production already under their belts.    That's an understatement."
timberwolves,3e2lsr,AlongCamePollyIsBae,5,Tue Jul 21 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously. When you put San Antonio above us when you're making a list about young cores, you should realize your article is trash."
timberwolves,3e2lsr,FlyingScissor,4,Tue Jul 21 16:10:04 2015 UTC,Makes sense based on the methodology. Wolves have hype but haven't actually done anything like the other young cores ranked ahead of them. If the analysis was done entirely off of feelings there's no doubt the Wolves would be #1.
timberwolves,3e2lsr,Garrus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"It's based on projected 3 year WARP. The T-Wolves ranking likely will improve dramatically following next season as Wiggins, Towns, Lavine, Muhammed, etc. develop. According to WARP, Wiggins was basically an average player last year, and Lavine was terrible. I think it's very probable that both will improve, with the caveat that Flip doesn't keep trying to play Lavine as a PG. I also think Towns will rate pretty well as a rookie as long as injuries don't force the offense to depend on his scoring abilities."

Looks like he's the one with the 13 on it. Makes sense because he was #13  Anthony Bennett  Shabazz Muhammad  Chase Budinger 3rd picture top right  Jeff Adrien  Robbie Hummel  Glenn Robinson III - second picture, uppermost leftmost.*  Nikola Pekovic  Mo Williams  Ricky Rubio - 3rd picture to the right of the logo  Kevin Martin -  second picture, rightmost middle.*    Possibilities:  Flip Saunders - Head Coach  Kevin Garnett - Joined the squad later in the year  Justin Hamilton  Gary Neal  Arinze Onuaku  Lorenzo Brown    I'll do some research and get back to you  edit: Ok I went ahead and found all the active players and their signatures at the time of the signing. Keep in mind there may be some coaching staff signatures as well. If anyone wants they can play ""match the sig to the ball"", I'm kinda tired at this point and it's not like I'm getting paid for this. Hope it was helpful  edit 2: the first picture is very hard to compare signatures to.

The Z is sloppy but the last name matches his card perfectly.  Wiggins - second picture, front-middle-left. That print A is pretty distinguishable after looking at his card.  GRIII - second picture, uppermost leftmost. Easiest one so far.  (99% sure) Kevin Martin- second picture, rightmost middle. It's only his initials, but the K matches his card and the M is too boring to make something out of. It's not a full signature and I'm too lazy to try to find other shit he has initialed, so I'm giving myself a 1% cop out on this.  Robbie Hummel - last picture, the huge ass signature above the logo.

I was pleased with LoBro, he should be a solid backup to Rubio, I think. Payne showed some stuff that brought me back from having given up on him completely (still not sold though). Tyus is a bit of a work in progress. Finally, while he didn't play great, Towns showed me enough that I'm VERY comfortable with his ability going forward."
timberwolves,3e1gkh,dis_what_I_say,4,Tue Jul 21 06:44:47 2015 UTC,"Like as whole how the team performed W-L wise? I think they performed about how I expected. I didn't think the Wolves were going to do so well since their roster isn't one that wins in summer league. Look at the 2 championship game teams it's mostly veterans and second year wings/forwards that dominate in summer league settings.      If you want an opinion on how the expected rotation Wolves players performed I can provide that.    Towns: Did nothing to dissuade my opinion that he won't be the best player in the draft or the next franchise player for the Wolves. He did alright in the post and showed off some real good passing. His shot was off from the field and sort of got pushed around by bigger centers but in a closing interview he did acknowledge those things and I do expect him to get better there.    LaVine: Zach LaVine did Zach LaVine things. Plain and simple.    Payne: Did well stats wise and I like he was knocking down 3 pointers. My problem is I don't think his performance will translate to the NBA against better competition. That 3 pointer though is solid.    Tyus: He showed he was a smart player not quite ready to deal with faster and bigger NBA guards. Don't think he'll ever be a starter but he'll be a good solid backup eventually. Also in transition there was a few times he throw some Ricky Rubio like passes which is pretty sick.   Brown: I really liked what I saw from him. I think he performed well enough to get a roster spot from the Wolves. Solid defender I think he did work on the pull up jumpers that Flip likes his point guards to be able to do.     The rest of the Summer League roster was pretty meh. None of these guys performed well enough to get an NBA spot, was pretty disappointed in Heslip who couldn't hit a 3."

Secondary Market- I can tell you the Lynx have switched to a digital ticketing system who's technology doesn't work on secondary websites other than flashseats.com. Limits where you can find them, but everything available will be on that site. Your best bet- Last year we had a three pack to start the year, all weekend games, but am not sure if that'll be an option with how well things have been going so far this off-season.

timberwolves,3ds8ky,bojangley,13,Sun Jul 19 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"I respect the effort, but the article makes me question the research you put into this. You not only Payne ahead of KG, but you have Anthony Bennett.... ANTHONY BENNETT... ahead of him on the depth chart. This is the same guy that Flip has been trying to trade for the entire summer.   Shabazz is also more of a 3 than 2, while I see Bjelica as more of a 4.  I'd have (everyone healthy)...  PG: Rubio, Brown (or a veteran), Tyus  SG: Martin, LaVine  SF: Wiggins, Shabazz, Bjelica  PF: KG, Bjelica, Payne, Bennett  C: Towns, Pekovic, Gorgui"
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Chanceee,4,Sun Jul 19 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"This is how I see it, though I think Towns will be getting work at the 4 as well, though all depends on injuries and performance of Bjelica, Payne, and Bennett."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,adhal,3,Sun Jul 19 04:47:26 2015 UTC,THIS is what is going to happen right here. By the end of the year Bjelica will be starting with KG playing his 15-20.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Egonzos,3,Sun Jul 19 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"This is what I imagine it will look like too. I'm really looking forward to seeing this squad come together. So many dudes with potential.   Payne's a mystery to me though. I probably only caught about 25 wolves games last season, but the sense I got was that expectations were pretty low when they made the trade last February. It seemed like anything he added would be considered a bonus. The broadcast team seemed pretty high on him though I thought."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,LeonDoucette,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:02:54 2015 UTC,Tyus is the #2 PG regardless unless we have a vet
timberwolves,3ds8ky,PurpleVikings,5,Sun Jul 19 20:00:34 2015 UTC,Did you watch him in Summer League?  He's definitely a work in progress.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Rswany,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. However, remember that Flip played Zach last year even when we had LoBrow. He might sacrifice wins for player development again."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,tokyo_dave,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"True, but after the early injuries last season Flip has all but admitted to tanking in the 2nd part of the year.  He'll be trying to win games this year."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Rswany,24,Sun Jul 19 23:22:33 2015 UTC,"Hard to take seriously when you list Adreian Payne as a starter and then quote his summer league performance as the reason.  If you watched us play last year you'd see he's far from ready to start. Not from a stand-point of numbers, but just how clueless he is off the ball on both ends. But hopefully he's improved enough to get decent minutes."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Tevinhead,6,Sun Jul 19 00:13:12 2015 UTC,Payne could average 20 and 10 and this sub would still hate him...
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Rswany,10,Sun Jul 19 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"This is kind of true, but Payne hasn't exactly show any NBA skills other than hustle and his vertical. Starting him over KG is just nonsensical at this point."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Chanceee,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:04:52 2015 UTC,Any NBA skills? Let's ignore the fact that he's a 6'10 stretch 4 that can put the ball on the deck.  His basketball IQ is another story.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,HoopIsLife,11,Sun Jul 19 11:52:39 2015 UTC,I think it's a bit generous to call him a stretch 4 when he shot 11% from 3 last season.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Chanceee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:25 2015 UTC,He took eight 3 pointers.  That's too small of a sample size to make heads or tails.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Rswany,0,Sun Jul 19 22:35:39 2015 UTC,Stretch 4 doesn't automatically mean a 3 point shooting 4.  I meant he's a face up big.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,HoopIsLife,8,Sun Jul 19 15:40:20 2015 UTC,The only face-up game he has is an ok catch and shoot game from the elbow. Stretch 4 is overselling it quite a lot.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Tevinhead,3,Sun Jul 19 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"If it was in summer league, I would still definitely be a bit skeptical.   I hope he works out, but it's definitely a wild leap to think this means he is the starter.   Edit: Dammit double definitely denotes dumbness."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,KeshasGhost,2,Sun Jul 19 22:31:50 2015 UTC,20 bbiq and 10 TOs?
timberwolves,3ds8ky,randyscroutons,3,Sun Jul 19 15:58:33 2015 UTC,But then that would be unwarranted hate.  I'd love to see him become a solid player though
timberwolves,3ds8ky,bentmachine,3,Sun Jul 19 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"I was a big Payne supporter until this Summer League.  I don't hate him, but he is an exceedingly frustrating player to watch more than 80% of the time."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Jmgill12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:04:20 2015 UTC,Flip said last week that Payne isn't a scorer.  He also he needs to focus on defense and rebounding.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,NorthChan,6,Mon Jul 20 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"Shabazz as the 3rd string SG? I think he'll be right behind Wiggins at SF, with Bjelica at PF alongside KG and Payne."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,eggyolkeo,4,Sun Jul 19 02:40:07 2015 UTC,bazz will be the no.1  option off the bench. period.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,rod1g,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:54 2015 UTC,lavine and bazz both in together off the bench is sure gonna be something alright
timberwolves,3ds8ky,DonnieDarkoMilicic,6,Mon Jul 20 03:46:28 2015 UTC,KG's gonna start.  Flip's already said so.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Rswany,7,Sun Jul 19 00:28:09 2015 UTC,At this point in his career [Payne] is a poor man’s Kevin Love ...  a poor man’s Kevin Love   ಠ_ಠ
timberwolves,3ds8ky,CoreyBrewersGoat,15,Sun Jul 19 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"Not only is it a poor man, he's broke and is millions in debt"
timberwolves,3ds8ky,bentmachine,4,Sun Jul 19 01:13:05 2015 UTC,KG and Pek will start.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,Beware_Of_The_Phog,2,Sun Jul 19 05:53:53 2015 UTC,If healthy.
timberwolves,3ds8ky,randyscroutons,0,Sun Jul 19 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"I still feel as if Pek will still start, at the beginning at least."
timberwolves,3ds8ky,BounceBros21,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:36:50 2015 UTC,"1-Rubio  2-Wiggins  3-Bjelica  4-Kg  5-Towns  Lavine and Martin go in  Kg out  Wiggins to the three  Rubio gets break.  NBA championship  Pek, AP, AB, SM, Dieng, and everyone will be sprinkled in here in there like corn in a hot dish.  In all honesty flip will have a lot of flexibility.  He can change lineups to exploit teams weaknesses.  Really AP had a good summer league, but penciling him in as a starter is premature at best.  That's kgs spot.  I bet bjelica and towns start more games at the four than AP."
timberwolves,3dool0,lightbadkid,9,Sat Jul 18 00:13:22 2015 UTC,He's adjusting to the NBA backboards bro
timberwolves,3dool0,Gordon_Black,9,Sat Jul 18 00:28:06 2015 UTC,Except that the ball isnt even touching the backboard or the rim. I guess he's adjusting to that NBA air.
timberwolves,3dool0,SeveralPeople,9,Sat Jul 18 05:03:28 2015 UTC,"NBA air, NBA Coriolis effect, NBA gravity.  It's just different."
timberwolves,3dool0,Gordon_Black,9,Sat Jul 18 08:55:01 2015 UTC,First time i stepped out on the nba court i could almost fly. The. I realized the only reason they can dunk so well is because theyve adjusted the gravity.
timberwolves,3dool0,SeveralPeople,41,Sat Jul 18 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"It's the NBA ball.  Most people don't know this, but the NBA ball is a bitch to shoot. Super slick, not grippy in the slightest. Like a Nike ball that's been sanded down and over-inflated.  I shot with them for a few months during physical therapy in a nice, controlled setting. With any other ball, even coming off of surgery, I was a knockdown shooter. That ball is something else, comes off without much spin and sometimes before I was able to snap the wrist.  It's tough to explain, but the NBA balls are weird. Depending on player's form, they can get wrecked by it. Most prospects handle it well, but some have an adjustment period.  That and Towns form is actually not that great. He's got great touch, but his form is awful. His feet are pointed almost 45 degrees away from the rim."
timberwolves,3dool0,Jmgill12,10,Sat Jul 18 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"NBA ball is my favorite ball to shoot with.  Not those shitty pillow Wilson's.  Its a preference.  The NBA ball is very grippy, especially if you get some sweat into the ball."
timberwolves,3dool0,shved,2,Sat Jul 18 05:28:32 2015 UTC,I just bought a Spalding NBA replica ball and it's amazing.
timberwolves,3dool0,Rswany,0,Sat Jul 18 05:55:22 2015 UTC,Are you talking authentic balls or the replica they sell in stores?  There's a very big difference between the two.
timberwolves,3dool0,Jmgill12,7,Sat Jul 18 06:20:27 2015 UTC,Obviously the actual NBA ball if it gets more gripe with sweat.  The NBA ball is the only ball that is made of actual leather.
timberwolves,3dool0,shved,0,Sat Jul 18 11:21:15 2015 UTC,"That hasn't been my experience. I love the NCAA balls because the newer version retains its grip in spite of sweat. The NBA's grooves become harder to grip through the sweat, at least for me."
timberwolves,3dool0,Jmgill12,5,Sat Jul 18 19:46:24 2015 UTC,Just an FYI - most great shooters turn their feet.
timberwolves,3dool0,kurt99,24,Sat Jul 18 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"That's just so not true. I had a lengthy comment in /r/BasketballTips where I talk about that.  This guy is a complete hack. He points to several cherry-picked examples to prove his bullshit theory, and then puts it out on youtube where unknowable people accept it.  Sometimes players twist when they shoot, I do it too occasionally, but it's far from the rule. It's a walk-before-you-run thing, adding in a variable that completely alters the shot.  I don't think there's a more damaging theory in all of basketball, especially when teaching young kids about shooting. Also, in my experience, the people who claim this are some of the worst in-game shooters—and it's not hard to understand why.  Think about it mechanically: Would a trebuchet become more accurate if it was spinning on its axis as it's motion is being started? Why would a human body be any different? A machine is most effective when it's simple. A shot is the exact same way.  Besides, even if this was the rule, Towns feet are out at the opposite direction, and he barely jumps. He would have to rotate his feet as figure skater speed across his body to get them squared up to the rim."
timberwolves,3dool0,Jmgill12,6,Sat Jul 18 01:43:25 2015 UTC,Preach
timberwolves,3dool0,HoopIsLife,6,Sat Jul 18 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"I teach shooting at the Johnny Tauer camps, overnight camp starts on Sunday.  The amount of kids who have to unlearn this is staggering.  They tell me the same thing every time:  ""I need it for power.""  I tell them if their knees and shoulders were square to the rim to begin with, they wouldn't need to twist their entire body to get the ball to the rim."
timberwolves,3dool0,Jmgill12,3,Sat Jul 18 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"Johnny Tauer camps, haven't thought about those in a LONG while. Went to those from 5th to 10th grade, overnight camp starting after 6th grade."
timberwolves,3dool0,MegaZambam,3,Sat Jul 18 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"That's really cool man, good to hear that you are dedicated in getting solid fundamentals out there, especially in today's AAU-run youth basketball world, which is just a shit show of fundamentals."
timberwolves,3dool0,HoopIsLife,4,Sat Jul 18 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"Appreciate it.  I'm actually a huge believer in AAU though. AAU isn't the problem, it's the high school coaches who refuse to adapt to basketball's changing landscape."
timberwolves,3dool0,Jmgill12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:32:48 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree, to a degree.  I still think AAU should shoulder some blame, but you're definitely right about high school coaches."
timberwolves,3dool0,HoopIsLife,2,Sat Jul 18 02:38:49 2015 UTC,This is one of the reasons I come to /r/timberwolves. Quality content man.
timberwolves,3dool0,JohnnyKnob,4,Sun Jul 19 15:57:57 2015 UTC,"If you don't turn your shooting shoulder square to the basket then how can your arm move in a straight line towards the rim? By having your body centered towards the rim whichever hand you shoot with is shooting across the body and its hard to be consistent that way. By turning the shoulder and hip you can align your upper body to the rim and naturally the bottom half of your body follows suit. Curry, kobe, jordan, lillard, durant all are turn shooters as are most of the great shooters."
timberwolves,3dool0,xxjamesxx32,2,Sat Jul 18 05:54:00 2015 UTC,"The power in my legs is what gets the ball to the rim, and with my shoulders both squared to the rim I don't have to point one explicitly towards it.  If you're shooting across your body from a squared position, then you're going out of your way to do so. I'm a righty, and my shooter's pocket is closer to my right hip than my left, but only slightly.  The part about turning to align is just nonsense. The turning doesn't mean you can't realign, but you have to make a effort to do so.  If you watch videos of Curry, especially during his college days, you'll see he prefers to align his feet to the rim, but doesn't always have time.  The best example of this can be found in my old teammate's mixtape. Isaiah's father is an assistant coach for the Wizards and taught both of us how to shoot. Isaiah now plays at Creighton, and led the EYBL in 3's made and 3% his final year on the circuit. If you watch the video, every time he has a choice, he's square to the rim. But, in some circumstances, like the shot from the corner at 0:23, he doesn't has a choice to turn back his feet. Just because he's such a great shooter that he's able to knock it in without textbook form doesn't mean in the route to go.  Watching what he does now to saves tenths of seconds and thinking it's correct is like making the MLB and thinking barehanding the ball is correct. It's a walk-before-you-run thing, like I mentioned."

timberwolves,3dj0w8,Beware_Of_The_Phog,16,Thu Jul 16 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"It was a terrible article, but acceptable because of all the towns fluff."
timberwolves,3dj0w8,SergeantPolio,8,Thu Jul 16 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. How can you say you haven't seen a graceful 7 footer since Shaq and then mention Anthony Davis in the article?  Towns is very solid, but AD is an absolute monster. If AD isn't considered a game-changing big man like Shaq and Robinson, then Towns doesn't stand a chance."
timberwolves,3dj0w8,jackityjack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:44:04 2015 UTC,AD's not 7-feet tall...
timberwolves,3dj0w8,vbullinger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:20:08 2015 UTC,AD is not built like shaq or hakeem. he's a a lot skinnier and perimeter oriented than they were
timberwolves,3dj0w8,01and10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"He said graceful AND powerful, Robinson, Hakeem, and especially Shaq were built like brick shithouses and AD is not."
timberwolves,3dj0w8,DaDoviende,2,Fri Jul 17 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a pretty nothing article, but I'll take it."
timberwolves,3dj0w8,Pineapple__Jews,6,Thu Jul 16 22:18:55 2015 UTC,I appreciate the KAT love from grantland but the article and commentary isn't great. Andrew Sharp hasn't written a good piece since he left SB Nation. This would be more well received if it was written by anybody else at grantland.
timberwolves,3dj0w8,FlyingScissor,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:19 2015 UTC,this is funny because after watching maybe 5 minutes of Towns in SL I was 100% confident this guy is going to be a superstar.. he just has a fluidity to his game thats hard to find and the way he moves for a guy his size is so sick.. wiggins and towns together for years omg
