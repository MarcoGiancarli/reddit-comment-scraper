7daystodie,3e3isf,Elduriel,12,Tue Jul 21 17:59:22 2015 UTC,There is obviously some issue with the leveled loot system on MP servers.
7daystodie,3e3isf,Lucullus76,8,Tue Jul 21 17:59:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. I am level 63 and I rarely see anything but faulty.
7daystodie,3e3isf,procrastinatorgrrl,3,Tue Jul 21 18:35:31 2015 UTC,I thought 60 was the maximum level?

We just tested this on two servers yesterday and upping the loot for level 1 in the xml's upped it for every player in the game. However for some reason dropped items (Such as minibike wheels from tires, and grocery baskets) seem to use the player level, so it's probably an issue with containers specifically."
7daystodie,3e3isf,elt,5,Wed Jul 22 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"yeah, leveled loot is so horrendously broken right now it's silly.   Seriously hoping it's addressed soon.   Right now it's kinda pointless to even go exploring..   the best loot is from the zeds that come right to your base anyway.   Why bother going anywhere else?"
7daystodie,3e3isf,Alashion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"agree, the only useful stuff we can find during looting is the occasional (like 5 %) weapon parts better than faulty, and brass that we need for bullets. Otherwise I wouldn't bother going out."
7daystodie,3e3isf,impur,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:09 2015 UTC,My group raids tool shops simply because you can get two stacks or so of rebar if you are lucky which is a buttload of iron for checking a store.

7daystodie,3e3isf,ckasek,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:37 2015 UTC,because the feral setting is also broken on our server and whenever it's enabled we're getting massive hordes every day (like hundreds of the fuckers almost endlessly coming at us).

7daystodie,3e3isf,dopaminenotyours,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:52 2015 UTC,I complain about loot not leveling properly as well on my SP games.   Here's my post from a few days ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/3dod2a/leveled_loot_xml/
7daystodie,3e2628,scorcher24,22,Tue Jul 21 11:23:16 2015 UTC,"I never thought having the forge gated by a book was a ""bad"" idea at all. Because honestly, I have NO IDEA how to make a forge as a typical Joe Blow in the world.    I think having to read a book to;    put nails in a bat to make a spiked club poor gas from a barrel in to a gas can find 3 different books to accomplish making the exact same type of bullet - just of different sizes Take apart / reassemble a weapon Tie some scrap metal together to protect myself from attacks take a chunk of metal and mould it to a stick so I can smash things with it (hammer) Then also need another one to make a bigger version of the exact same thing (sludge hammer) light an arrow on fire turn alcohol, a bandage, and a bloodbag in to a defibrillator. ( actually yeah I'd like to see that book)   Is just stupid... And if those didn't exist finding the forge ahead book would be A LOT easier to find and we would never have had a problem.   Personally if I was in charge of this...  If you want to add challenge make it logical, like... I might not even gate it with JUST books, I'd gate it with equipment too.   In order to make bullets you need an ammunition loading machine which you find from shotgun massia. (about the rarity of nail guns and operates like a camp fire) Make weapon repair kits / oil rare (only found at shotgun massia shops) All ammunition construction be learned from a single common book  All Civilian Firearms construction be learned from a single common book All Military Firearms construction be learned from a single rare book All (non powered) household repair tools construction be learned from a single common book  All hand made weapons and ammo be learned from a single Med-rare book or schematic (crossbow / bolts of all types)  Minibike common book All clay molding be made from a single med-rare book All armors be learned from a single rare book  Forge Ahead Book med-rare book Leather Tanning med-rare book Iron work med-rare book Steel work rare book Lead work med-rare book Concrete work med-rare book   Mostly because it's just logical to do things this way, and dragging out the game by putting in roadblocks for progress is not fun when your ability to further progress in the game relies to much on luck.  Another idea is to have schematics be placed as posters on walls of specific buildings. For example go to a LARGE gas station that has garage doors ( a mechanic shop ) on the wall they have a motor schematic. Now you know how to repair simple motors. Or, you go to a Shotgun massia and there's a poster of how to build a pistol. Large cabins that already have a forge built in to the prefab will have a poster on how to build a forge. The poster is always there (can't be taken down or destroid by players) you just need to find the building. Because finding something like that in those locations would be logical!  Then we can put this to rest and they can spend more time on adding new challenges to the game that don't involve luck rolls."
7daystodie,3e2628,Jeradox,8,Tue Jul 21 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know what they were thinking with all these added books, it's like it's turning into a library simulator."

7daystodie,3e2628,chaos0510,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"I was a bit dumbfounded when I realized that now I needed to find every single fricken weapon schematic to make them. Want a better melee weapon? Hope you have good luck, cause you need to either be lucky enough to find the schematic, or lucky enough to find the actual weapon that isnt ""poor"" quality.   It's really aggravating."
7daystodie,3e2628,plantedthoughts,2,Wed Jul 22 00:27:49 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Almost none of us - right now - could get up from our desks to make a forge capable of working metal. It should require a book. You learn it.  Almost all of us would be capable of putting concrete nails into a bat. It shouldn't require a book.  But that is if you are approaching things from a realistic angle. It doesn't mean that it makes the game more compelling. There needs to be a balance between REALISM and FUN, and it will take some time and experimentation to get there - especially considering the wildly different ways that people play the game."
7daystodie,3e2628,blackom,6,Tue Jul 21 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"You can make a forge smelter from a coffee can surrounded by coals in a clay pot, a hole in the bottom of the clay pot can be blown into to heat them up.    Small scale, works well on aluminum. I'm sure you could adapt it to be able to use more heat for iron if it was a necessity.  (Make your ingots this way).  Forges for working metal are much simpler,  a bed of coals with an air supply.  Lay your ingot in it, get it red hot, take it out, beat it to shape with a hammer.  Repeat until you get the shape you want.   With these methods, you could really make any shitty metal tool you wanted with very little skill.  In a real life situation, you would probably not bother making iron ingots unless you were settled into a town with proper supplies.   Making higher quality metals would require skimming dross, and folding the metal into itself over and over to beat out impurities.  I can see a book being needed for that. But for the sake of 7dtd, my comment alone is enough education for a wasteland blacksmith.   Oh!  Before anyone tries this at home!  You pour aluminum, not shape it.  Moisture causes steam that can be explosive in power sending molten metal everywhere.   If this is something of interest to you, check out /r/blacksmithing for info from people much more competent than I."
7daystodie,3e2628,Ne0r15s,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"With this in mind and looking at what we have now, I think we should have both options. A recipe like in the picture for a Rough/Home-made Forge, and a book locked, more efficient, Iron(?) Forge."
7daystodie,3e2628,BMRGould,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Almost none of us - right now - could get up from our desks to make a forge capable of working metal. It should require a book. You learn it.   I could absolutely get up from my desk and do it without a book.  I can use YouTube. :D  Which got me thinking.  If they replaced the schematics with little videos on a tablet, it would be so much less clutter.  And you'd still have to 'find' something.  Maybe QR codes.  But why would those be everywhere?  And then you'd be a naked person with a tablet.  And you'd have to charge it.  Which would be totally unrealistic.  Maybe they could drop you a solar powered tablet in a crate.  But still kinda silly.  But less silly than the infinite schematics everywhere?  I dunno."
7daystodie,3e2628,Mythril_Zombie,6,Tue Jul 21 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"I just wish the book/schematic wasn't consumed after you read it.  It's annoying in MP for both people to have to find a book (say, leather tanning) in order to make the item.  The book should stay so that everyone can read it.  I get annoyed if the person I'm playing with isn't online at the time I need something.  ""Hey, whatcha reading?""  ""A book on how to make concrete.""  ""Can I read it when you're done?""

One thing I've done on my server, whose idea was copied from another server, is to make animals aggressive. Bears, pigs, stags & rabbits will all attack you back once attacked (maybe doesn't make sense for the bunny).   So even though they could kill you, they also don't run away. Which would make getting animal bits a lot easier to attain (and they attack zombies!)."

Go into the woods and try to hit a deer with a club -- he's going to run away, even if you wind up hitting him he's still going to run.  Most would argue the bears aren't even going to just start running to attack you when they see you either. I guess these bears are just so hungry they're coming anyway."

I took my 2 week vacation/honeymoon right after the release of a12.   Since I've gotten back I've fixed the minibike vanishing, fixed some of the UI issues people were having, and fixed a few other things along the way as I've noticed them. Next patch should make sure the minibike sticks around and doesn't vanish like it used to. Also invisible minibikes will go away permanently once the patch is applied.  Hope this quells any unrest or speculation on the matter.   :)"
7daystodie,3e1pcv,Kinyajuu,9,Tue Jul 21 17:50:29 2015 UTC,Glad you took a vacation man :) Too many devs I just worry about burning themselves out; it was more than well deserved. Thanks for the hours of fun you've given all of us

It's common in Early Access for devs to wait until a number of bugs accumulate before they focus on a major bugfix update. One hopes that any devs would quickly patch new features that are buggy when they are introduced, but it doesn't always happen when teams are smaller."

Wood frames for example is 6 iirc. What that means is you can only come out vertically 6 blocks before they collapse. I understand it but don't know all the numbers to give specific examples."
7daystodie,3e4uyf,elt,3,Tue Jul 21 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"Not just 6 out, but it can only hold 6 from that surface.  It could be 2 out and 4 up, 1 out then 5 on top of it, or etc."

7daystodie,3e23i0,xwillybabyx,4,Tue Jul 21 10:49:42 2015 UTC,Not sure about the errors but telnet is not secure.  They should be using ssh.
7daystodie,3e23i0,Smegzor,3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:29 2015 UTC,if you host he server out of your home. Then do not port-forward the telnet ports. You'll still be able to access the telnet if you are inside your network (from your home network) without allowing any joe blow on the internet to get to the telnet ports. I'd suggest the same for the web console too. Players will still be able to connect & play the game but the hackers wont have the chance to brute force attach the telnet / web console passwords.
7daystodie,3e23i0,TechStack,4,Tue Jul 21 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"If you have to use telnet from outside the localhost, NAT the telnet port to something else (non-standard in the 55000-90000 range).  It won't stop someone who really wants in but it will deter your basic port-sniffing morons.  Ideally though: don't allow telnet connections at all."
7daystodie,3e23i0,eataclick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:17:08 2015 UTC,Use ssh instead of telnet. Use private key crypto instead of password.

You alert one and they all know where you are. If you're dead quiet and undetected they still path-find their way to you (if slowly). Hordes spawn constantly, literally one right after the other, sometimes on top of each other and the player during fights.  Me and a friend were playing and we saw zombies en masse spawning 40 feet away and rushing to us. They never stop. There is no rest period. We can kill 200 of them and more will be coming.

7daystodie,3dzhhz,trevorwobbles,3,Mon Jul 20 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the server was overworked. I have been monitoring my ones system load with low player numbers, and the server can be pretty busy at times. Just bought it a new cpu to increase capacity... When I tried with an old junk machine of mine (2600 single core) I could get to the map boundary before it could send the blocks. And that was playing alone. The zeds were just standing still in that scenario... A dual core amd 2400 was enough for about 6 players in a similar area of the map (near each other) and I have yet to try this old phenom 2 quad core I bought, but it looks promising from my past comparisons."

""We don't know you are here, but we choose to wait here anyway""  Having to rely on this stuff is kind of shitty. Fully agree. I will probably end up modding values as another user suggested.  IMO, it is currently game breaking as far as immersion goes in its current state.

But a shift+M 20% size map in the top corner would be great for quick reference without loosing all sight of the surroundings and having to stop.

Open the folder that corresponds to your server map type, and you should see your server's folder in there which will contain character saves.

7daystodie,3e079v,smittyjones,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:25 2015 UTC,I thought caves were only in the random gen maps.
7daystodie,3e079v,Eatsnocheese,6,Tue Jul 21 00:07:56 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  Ore appears in the ground in Navezgane.  Caves only appear in random gen maps.  Unfortunately, it's not as easy to find as it was in A11.  Here's a few places I know of:  50S, 60E (right in front of the church) - go straight down about 30 blocks.  There's tons of everything.  14N, 100E - there are veins every ten blocks down or so until you hit bedrock  31N, 134E - go down about 30 blocks and there is ore all the way down to bedrock  112S, 60E - one vein about 10 blocks down, nothing below that.    That's all I've found so far.  Good luck!"
7daystodie,3e079v,Eatsnocheese,3,Tue Jul 21 00:43:48 2015 UTC,Is it the same on every Navesgane map?  Edit: I'll check a few of those and let you know what I find.
7daystodie,3e079v,littlemokey,2,Tue Jul 21 00:45:41 2015 UTC,Yes. All Navezgane maps are the same.
7daystodie,3e066u,Nevordan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"Unless there is a major update that changes he game, underground bases are still by far the best.  You can make them 99.999% safe from zombies and other players relatively easy."
7daystodie,3e066u,PR05ECC0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:41 2015 UTC,How?
7daystodie,3e066u,dbotf,3,Tue Jul 21 01:15:00 2015 UTC,"No bases are 100% raid proof, the design that I use is just about as close as you can get.  I'm sure that there is others but this is mine.  I'll try to describe the best I can without pics.  Also I should say I have never made this base alone because it takes awhile.  I work in a team of 4 usually.   First you start down at bedrock level for the bottom of your base.  Then you need to clear around the base all the way up to the surface, this is the hard part.  It's not really hard just time consuming.  It can be done pretty covertly though if you start from the bottom and work your way up.  You want to create a square that rises up like the World Trade center (#NEVERFORGET), only from bedrock to the surface.  You can eventually build above the surface but you are just asking for trouble at that point.   Back to the bottom of your base.  Make a hallway with a series of doors into the center of the base at bedrock level. Now dig out a room that is about 5 blocks high.  This is the entry of your base.  Now make the next level of your base but DO NOT ADD STAIRS OR A LADDER.  From now on you and all your clan will carry a couple of wooden frames around to use to hop up to the next level.  You build an opening with a ladder in the roof.  Put down a fram, then minecraft hop and put another down, then jump up to the ladder. Then look down and pick up the two frames.    What this does is once it's landclaimed makes it impossible for someone to enter your base from below because they can't place blocks.  They can't come from the sides because you have dug out an perimeter around your base.  The only way in is from the top down.  The way you combat that is you keep adding re-enforced concrete on top of your base till you eventually reach the surface.  This doesn't make the base raid proof, but it makes it a real pain in the ass to dig down through land claimed concrete.  The inside of your base should follow the same basic format where you have to use blocks to hop up to the next level.  So far we have never been raided using this design.  Again it's not 100% but its about as close as you can get. The only thing you have to worry about  is people digging down which will take them so much gas it's not worth it.  Or people trying to dig out the bottom to collapse the building.  It's pretty easy to defend against that since you are on top of them and can just shoot down."
7daystodie,3e066u,PR05ECC0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know how, as well. Usually the old bums start digging down towards me. They make a big mess even if they don't get to me."
7daystodie,3e066u,rezanow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"The difference between my base and the surface is bigger than the distance a Feral zombie can smell. With that in mind, I can safely ignore the weekly Night Horde."

7daystodie,3e066u,Quigleyer,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this is the best design ever- it does require a lot of player interaction to kill the zombies, but a gatehouse that functions like this has been very successful for me:  http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg123/EricQuigley/gatehouse1_zps4cy5lsdy.jpg  Though they have a clear path to the door I find this helps them stand still, and having only a single block they can really ""stand"" on in front of the door means that A) fewer can hit it at once and B) once they start converting into gore blocks those gore blocks actually cover the door.  I find when the gore blocks block the door and I'm standing inside/on top of one of my gatehouses they tend to just walk right on to the spikes towards me and ignore the door, allowing me to continue taking shots at them.  Be warned, you want a nearby room with a door you can run in and close when you hear cops starting to suicide- I think their suicide hit goes through the metal bars if you're standing next to it.  Another thing that worked for me was to put my base on stilts, like you said, then put a big hole in the floor with iron bars.  I put a spiked ""sarlac pit"" below it (http://s247.photobucket.com/user/EricQuigley/media/Sarlac1_zpso0lvghs8.jpg.html?o=1), but I am also not having as good of a time making the zombies sit still now.  But they kind of wander back and forth into the spikes, which was a lot more effective before the log spike nerf. The first thing I posted works way better for me now.  No matter what you do you should realize that cobblestone is now a starting material.  All it requires is clay lumps and small stones to make the upgrade rocks, and then sticks and fibers to make the frames.  It's like the stone-age concrete now, and it's very sturdy.  Also the log spikes are far more upgrade-able now, I think it's like three times.  The first upgrade is with wood and I think the next two (or three- I can't tell if they're really upgrading, but it lets me do it four times total) are scrap metal.  They don't do as much damage as they used to, but they now degrade when they deal damage- that's why they're less effective.  The more upgraded they are the more damage they can deal before breaking."
7daystodie,3e066u,Tabudragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:47 2015 UTC,"I made a bunch of the frames and the cobblestone rocks, but nothing happens when I right click with my hammer, nail gun or repair tool. Am I missing something ?"

7daystodie,3e066u,Quigleyer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:13 2015 UTC,This is right you have to use the cobblestone rocks as though they were the repair item.  Each frame takes 4 rocks as upgrades each.
7daystodie,3e066u,Feycat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:29:01 2015 UTC,"In my experience zombies tend to punch the gore blocks rather than climb them. I've been fine handling hordes literally sitting on top of a 6-high walkway and shooting down into their heads. If the gore block gets too high, I smack it with an axe til it breaks down a bit.  I'm still using a fortified trench with logspikes around a reinforced cabin base, myself. I haven't noticed the spikes break much as long as you upgrade them at least once."
7daystodie,3e066u,MR_Fook,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:13 2015 UTC,How deep is the trench? I want to build something deep but repairing the spikes seems to be a bad idea.
7daystodie,3e066u,Feycat,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"Ours is only 4 deep with spikes on the bottom, so it's basically 3 deep. We've got the wall built 2 high past that with an iron bar overhang we can shoot through. We've got shooting towers on the corners too. Our group tends to enjoy active defense though rather than just hiding once we get a fortification up. It's more fun to shoot 'em :)  When we need to repair we stick a wood frame down on one of the spikes and repair all around it. Using frames as stepping stones is probably the most useful skill in the game"

7daystodie,3e066u,Ne0r15s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"My guess would be a concrete wall with iron bar overhangs. The overhangs can stop spiders, and can be shot through.   Maybe even holes in the concrete walls with iron bars that can be shot through.   Someone yesterday posted a strategy with fences and rows of dirt, but I'd expect to see that patched and would not rely on it permanently as it takes advantage of pathing issues and z's being unable to reach down to smash the fence.  They just line up like ducks at a carnival shooting range."

The cops will spit at me on an overhang. I wonder . . . could I dig down like 5 x 5 and use an iron bar roof? When they're standing on top of me, I could shoot them straight up the ice-hole. Do bows shoot through iron bars? What about wooden frames?"

Hunting rifle is 4 shot.   This is about perfect, again I would like to see some kind of upgradable magazine.   Rocket launcher is 10 shot terrain buster and lag maker.

Back then everything was square, like minecraft. You could punch a tree down and gather wood without a stone axe, lol. I wasn't happy when they added Forging Ahead, either. But now that everything you make in the beginning is crappy grey quality, it takes away the excitement of finding it early. I'm more unhappy about the log spikes being nerfed. I'm not sure what we're supposed to do now. Anywho, there's a lot of things I'd like to see added. I'm sure everyone has ideas. Been waiting on baseball bats and samurai swords since I started.

Why can't I spruce my home up with paintings (well, I can, but why?), posters, and have that serve a purpose, or find a DVD player and watch a movie to recoup some energy?

The real-time Map aspect within the Cloud-based Server Manager has been updated, and wanted to share it, as it may be easier than modding the in-game map, for many users.  New options:   Display Zombies Display Animals Display Supply Crates Display Owned Vehicles (Minibikes) Display In-game Time   As usual, the operator of the server can easily toggle what is displayed, at any time, through the CBSM. By default, these new options will be disabled.  In a short time, the map will also be able display of a variety of CBSM related features, such as zGates, homes, plots, and vendors.  Hope this is useful!    Note: The icons are simply place-holders, for now.

7daystodie,3dvk9s,croppergib,7,Sun Jul 19 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"If you've been struggling to repair, upgrade your hundreds of log spikes outside your base or in your trench, then making lines of dirt and putting fences either side really helps.  If they break through the first lot (cop exploding causing damage for example), they line up on the next one. Works really well, you can just pop them off from distance in the morning one by one and loot their bodies (although sometimes they instantly turn into gloop).  Hope this helps someone who may be struggling and give them some breathing room!  edit: I really hope they don't patch this for a while, I'm far too much of a dirty casual for this game :D  edit2: in action: http://i.imgur.com/OgKpcSR.jpg (with adjusted brightness)    http://i.imgur.com/hcCXeTP.jpg"

Get THIS kind of fort, defend it THIS way, hope you get THIS loot, and if you aren't ready by THIS day, life will be hell cause now every day has a chance of being THAT day again.

7daystodie,3dvk9s,ravenze,4,Mon Jul 20 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"Its like a step of dirt... so a line two high of dirt, then one infront only 1 block high. Then you can place the dirt on the one above.

7daystodie,3dvpuq,recruiterguy,11,Sun Jul 19 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"That's not new at all. From what I understand, which isn't much other than hearsay, sound is the toughest thing to do correctly in a game and the easiest thing to accidentally break when adding new elements. Because of that, most games in the Alpha stage tend to hold off on doing sound fixing until near the end of Alpha or even into Beta.  This could be wrong, but that's how it was explained to me. At any rate, sound's been wonky ever since I started playing in A8, so I doubt there's going to be any major fixes any time soon until TFP feels like it's an appropriate time. Kinda sucks because having fully-functioning 3D sound in this game would be a godsend, but... Way she goes I guess!"

7daystodie,3dutbp,MR_Fook,3,Sun Jul 19 18:37:08 2015 UTC,God yes. There just doesn't seem to be a high enough sound falloff for distance at all.  I can't figure out how to change that yet.    It doesn't seem to be exposed in the xml files.  All you can do is adjust their volume.  But they STILL play (just quieter) for way way beyond even max view range.

I reduced their spawn, but more than doubled their health, made their panic speed faster, and made them drop substantially more meat than the other animals. Now if you want to hunt down a bear, you had better be prepared.  Other than that, a lot of custom/tweaked recipes. For example, bacon and eggs now require one egg, one pork and one animal fat instead of two eggs (the icon even shows only one egg, c'mon!) and blueberry pie now requires fat instead of an egg, too. Pie crust doesn't use eggs people, trust me on this one. Oh, and you can make yucca juice out of two yucca fruit, too."

Basically you need a rifle now if you want to kill without being killed. I thought it was a tad unrealistic that you could basically kite a bear around town whilst shooting it with a bow, and then easily net yourself the best food in the game. Plus bears now drop between 14 and 21 pieces of meat (because really? I killed a bear and it gave me 4 pieces of meat? Wow that was so totally not fucking worth it) so it balances out."
7daystodie,3dutbp,papachabre,4,Mon Jul 20 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"Reduced the number of bears and increased the spawning of game animals.  Reduced the weather.  Reduced the size of dog packs. Increased general wandering horde size.  Added a couple recipes (moldy bread from sandwiches, pork pies and honey ham) and changed the blueberry pie recipe to need fat and not eggs (BECAUSE YOU DON'T MAKE PIE WITH EGGS YOU USE LARD/BUTTER DAMMIT)  Doubled cave chances and added ""noise"" ore because frankly the new terrain fucked up cave chances bigtime.

7daystodie,3dutbp,LlamaObama,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:10 2015 UTC,does the counter run real world seconds. or game time seconds.   Well the counter for coffee is default at 180 which is what it says in-game and in the XML so i'd say realtime  I upped duration of coffee so it lasts an extra 2 minutes
7daystodie,3dutbp,jianthekorean,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"What i mean by that is per the xml file comment...       A time string can contain two types of times, a real-time, or a game-time value.         A real-time value is just a number, example: duration=""90"" would be 90 real-time seconds         A game-time value is a number with a trailing 't', example: duration=""900t"" would be 9 in-game hours.   like broken leg debuff is 7200t."

I'll have to wait and see how it's implemented, but I really just look up everything I want to craft now.  It's rare that I actually make whatever shape anymore.  The coal/potassium changes are okay.  I like the log->plank->stick crafting though, and would be disappointed to see it go.  It makes sense, and it feels right.  Each item has a clear distinction and clearly different uses.  Ungating the forge again?  Not a fan of that one, but I'd have to see it in action before I judged.  Madmole posted that one idea was a crude forge that would take more materials than a bona fide forge to make an ingot.  I could maybe get down with something like that.  I liked the slower pace of A12 compared to previous alphas.  I felt like I was done with A11 after day 14, but now I'm coming up on day 50, and I still feel challenged, and I still feel like I'm progressing.  A13 should build on that instead of going backwards.  I definitely don't like the idea of chopping animals for parts.  Just use the same system as looting zombies.  It's an abstraction for field dressing the animal.  I don't want to be punished with little meat when I harvest it with a stone axe just because the game wanted to force me to carry a hunting knife around with me."
7daystodie,3dsng8,dointhestankyleg,2,Sun Jul 19 05:37:03 2015 UTC,It's an abstraction for field dressing the animal.   Agree with all of your post but mainly that . There are games where you just hack on something and it magically goes into your inventory. That might be fine for kids with the attention span of a peanut but not for adults.

7daystodie,3dsng8,TribalDancer,39,Sun Jul 19 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"Hello, this blog post by one of the team members seemed to have confused a lot of people.  We aren't ditching having a crafting interface, or switching to right clicking to craft everything.  There will still be a crafting interface above your inventory that you use to make items. We are just rearranging the GUI a bit to make it a bit cleaner and nicer. Over time we've added new features to the existing UI over time which would then get crammed into the existing UI layout, kind of like when we added that recipe list. So we want to rearrange the layout in a way that takes all these things into consideration. It will be the third time we've done this since Alpha 1.  We're not mass deleting 90% of the items you find in the game to try to oversimplify things. You'll still see things like brass candle sticks, aluminum cans found in the world. You aren't going to open a cardboard box and always see just ""wood"" or ""metal"" or anything like that in a void where random household debris used to be."
7daystodie,3dsng8,Wayward_7DTD_Dev,24,Sun Jul 19 06:29:16 2015 UTC,"I like having a lot of crafting. It makes the world more real to have to transmogrify things.

7daystodie,3dsng8,KungFuHamster,10,Sun Jul 19 12:29:40 2015 UTC,Agree! I'm not liking the right click menu much either. I like the Minecraft style crafting.

7daystodie,3dsng8,SelectaRx,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:00 2015 UTC,Maybe for bigger items. But when you're out and about right clicking on the odd couple pipes you've picked up to craft straight to metal strips is mighty convenient.   It seems like I use it most on single item conversions.
7daystodie,3dsng8,ExplodingJesus,11,Mon Jul 20 12:17:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, I say bring it on! I don't fear change, because it keeps the game fresh every time there's a major update!  If I had one wish for the GUI revamp, it would be to bring back the 9 hotkey slot in the toolbelt. It's a little easier to manage toolbelt slots now that you don't need to eat and drink things by switching to them and right clicking, but 1 more slot would make a nice different IMO.

The other one we are unable to control. Not to mention it was said to the moderators that wayward is an imposter yet he still is shown with dev flair.

It removes needless tedium from the game.  Having to manually go from log to lumber to frame is just mechanically redundant. It takes a certain number of logs to get to a finished wooden block, why not just remove all the stuff in between and have it streamlined to go from wood to block? It's a good idea that should hopefully make the game more accessible to a larger audience.   Most people have limited video game time. No one wants to spend their time basically grinding through things they shouldn't have to grind, or pouring through menus and crafting windows.  If it takes away some of the grind from the game. That's a good thing, and the game will be better for it.  The system they're implementing is already in Rust, it's in Ark. Clearly it's a system that works and has been tried and tested. Both these games are vastly more successful and popular than 7 Days to Die, if the devs want to copy over some of the mechanics that worked in those games, more power to them, that's probably a smart thing to do."

The fact things take time is part of the strategy and skill in a game where time is a factor in everything you do. You might not have enough time to chop trees and get them into wood frames to block windows at 23:00.   If anyone knows about limited game time, its me. I work 60 hours a week with a wife and a 2-year old. I still prefer to have to be working against the clock. So that is hardly a defendable excuse."

I'm not saying I want everything handed to me. I just hope they can find a balance that everyone is happy with. I'd personally prefer a little less waiting around.

I think that'll ultimately be the case with this game. It just never reached any big kind of momentum when it first came out and got it's initial big press/youtube bump, but it's since died out and hasn't really be able to recover well at all. I think in terms of popularity, the game's peaked. At best, this game will retain a significant percentage of it's current players, but even that might be a longshot after another year."
7daystodie,3dsng8,SpectreFire,4,Sun Jul 19 09:06:44 2015 UTC,I doubt this is true.  This game has a cult following and the deva haven't made a trailer since alpha 8. This community is growing.  Ark is boring compared to 7 days imo.

7daystodie,3dsng8,Ne0r15s,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:11:33 2015 UTC,I made you to edit it.  That works for me.
7daystodie,3dsng8,mooseeve,5,Mon Jul 20 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"It removes needless tedium from the game.    No, it removes... THE GAME. I came to the game from Minecraft. I don't care about tower defense as much as crafting and building and you know...surviving."
7daystodie,3dsng8,jebblue,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"How about adding a few more steps? 10 seconds to make cut logs from a felled tree. 10 seconds to craft a log into two half-logs. Another 20 to make crude planks, another 20 to make planed planks. Maybe we can break it down even further, the sky's the limit! All those juicy pointless intermediate steps really will add to my feeling of real surviving!"
7daystodie,3dsng8,giltirn,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:58 2015 UTC,"Why not both? They could have direct crafting paths for the most important/tedious things, e.g. a ""logs to wooden frames"" recipe. They'd maybe become available after having crafted the in-between steps at least once and crafting time could be as long as crafting through the various steps (if that's a concern)."
7daystodie,3dsng8,ollomulder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:26:03 2015 UTC,Having to manually go from log to lumber to frame is just mechanically redundant   But that's how I pass the time at night
7daystodie,3dsng8,IAmPartialToRed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:32:12 2015 UTC,I cannot fathom why everyone on this subreddit is equating removing intermediate crafting items with reducing the craft time. It's trivial to increase the crafting time of the simplified recipe to make it take as long as it used to; only now it will cost 1 or 2 less mouse clicks and will suck up less inventory space. Why kick up such a fuss about something so trivial???
7daystodie,3dsng8,giltirn,3,Mon Jul 20 13:45:41 2015 UTC,"The new UI will still have an inventory section for crafting items, the right click menu is there mostly for convenience but you won't be forced into it.  For example the existing UI didn't originally have a recipe list, inventory slots, etc. When we added the feature it kind of got crammed into the existing UI. So one of the things the UI refresh will do is lay out all the things that exist now in a more organized way.  You'll still find random items like pipes, air filters, cans and such that you can melt down to metal sources. You won't open a garbage can and just see ""wood"" or ""metal""."

7daystodie,3dsng8,gaglos255,18,Sun Jul 19 07:29:04 2015 UTC,Hate those proposed changes to crafting. Seems like a lot of other people do too. Really hope the pimps rethink it.
7daystodie,3dsng8,Guyonbench,12,Sun Jul 19 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Im willing to look at it and try it out before i hate it. I am a bit skeptical though
7daystodie,3dsng8,Defttone,21,Sun Jul 19 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't care for the whole drop down right click menu thing much as a whole. Only time I ever use it is to drink or eat food strait from my bag rather then equipping it to my toolbelt. Placing things in the crafting grid is something I like, and having different recipes that branch out from the same item was interesting. Cut down tree for logs to make log spikes, or turn those logs into planks to make frames, or turn those planks into sticks to make arrows. That form of item and inventory management I find fun, and it seems like they want to strip that away to ""streamline"" the experience. I have nothing against getting rid of the forge ahead book, but getting rid of the crafting grid would just be eliminating one of the identifying features of 7dtd."
7daystodie,3dsng8,Guyonbench,9,Sun Jul 19 03:23:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. Also having to take the time to turn say wood logs into wood planks into wood frames is part of the game. It takes literal time, so it may take you 10 actual minutes to turn wood into 50 frames. Which makes sense. 50 minutes is the normal full day, so taking 10 minutes to create those makes the game even instead of it taking your carachter 20 in game minutes to create 50 wooden frames.   I also am not a fan of the right click menu. I find it a bit difficult when in a time crunch. Like when you are trying to create something like a sleeping bag while zombies are around you. You can't just split the cotton into half and put them one ontop of the other and create cloth. You have to right click, and go through all the options to find ""cloth"" first. It's a huge pain.   I really hope they don't ruin this game. I have always loved the crafting grid. Having to remember what order to place items in, and what goes together. That is just part od 7days2die."
7daystodie,3dsng8,plantedthoughts,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:38:28 2015 UTC,So increase the crafting time? The current grid system is crap and the proposed solution is far better. Having multiple stages of intermediate items needed to craft things is just unnecessary bloat; it doesn't add anything to the game and should therefore be removed.
7daystodie,3dsng8,giltirn,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"I don't care for the whole drop down right click menu thing much as a whole.   Saves hundreds of clicks.  You can actually input the number of ""X"" item you want to create with the keyboard.  While my mouse is rated for umpteen thousand more clicks than a standard mouse, I don't want to wear it out crafting in 7dtd.  It's completely optional but as a user said below, splitting items into stacks is more difficult now.  But that isn't really related to the drop down menu.  That was just a plain removal of a feature.  Just because an additional way was added, does not mean the previous way should have been removed.  However - If the current crafting methods vanish, so will I.  The drop down list is really only great for when you need hundreds of something."
7daystodie,3dsng8,Ne0r15s,6,Sun Jul 19 03:53:22 2015 UTC,You can hold shift when clicking on the normal crafting menu to craft the max number of things you can.
7daystodie,3dsng8,Deathmckilly,3,Sun Jul 19 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"I know, seriously. Who is clicking a thousand times over the shift click? lol"
7daystodie,3dsng8,InfectedHeisenberg,0,Sun Jul 19 13:28:08 2015 UTC,"Who is clicking a thousand times over the shift click?   It's cumulative. Do you shift click when you want 20 of something and have the mats for hundreds, if not thousands?  If I need 100 of something, and shift clicking will start producing 500, it would be better off either clicking 100 times, or entering a number value.    Guessing how long it takes to produce 100 and then interrupting the process tends to lead to overproduction.   (Aren't you guys just awesome.  Unless I'm incorrect in my reasoning here, help me explain your voting)"
7daystodie,3dsng8,Ne0r15s,2,Sun Jul 19 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"Shift click amount in, shift click out what you don't need. Still faster than navigating 6 different sub-screens. I am not against the method being used, but it shouldn't be the only method. Removing the crafting grid kills my desire to play A13."
7daystodie,3dsng8,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"I never suggested removing the previous method.  In fact I'm in favor of keeping it.  Having a method to input exacts is still nice.  This does not have to be a ""one or the other"" type of situation."
7daystodie,3dsng8,Ne0r15s,16,Sun Jul 19 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"Simplifying the game (dumbing down) is not a good direction to go Madmole and the fact you think making rope grow on the ground is good survival game play frightens me. That was modded out of my server immediately in fact the server I run has over 100 added items and 50 added blocks. We have a Coal Burner for making Coke (needed to make Steel), you have to cure and dry leather and we have double the number of Skill books as Vanilla game. My server community is livid about the “streamlining” or otherwise known as making a game for a 12year old that will stop playing anyway after 2 hours. I mean are you designing a game for players that play 5 hours then throw it away or are you making a game for the player that plays 2000 hours and is passionate about it? And as for the drop down menu we have now it’s great for eating and drinking and scraping from containers but no one crafts with it. I own Ark I own Rust but I play and host a server for your game because it has depth and is complex. Sounds like you want to put this on the IPad and make it free to play and sale 500 stone for $1.99. I hate Click To Play games. I mean WTF why do you think people stick with your game and play it? You think we do it because it’s easy no way; we do it because it is one of the every every few games that actually offers a challenge to the player. If you remove all these things please just leave the icons in the files so the Modding community can put them back in. We want more items not less. If you want to make books easier to find do like my server and make items able to be examined and by doing so you learn how to make it. Sounds like you’re designing your game for the lowest common denominator- A new player that has no attention span and wants everything on day 1 but want to do no work to get it."

It's practically identical to minecraft and suffers from the same limitation that all recipes must contain no more than x components. The result is that you have lots of intermediate items that serve no actual game purpose.
7daystodie,3dsng8,giltirn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:12:03 2015 UTC,It represents a place to build stuff like the crafting table in Minecraft. ILR there are no menus to magically create a ton of stuff from raw materials.

As it is said in post, the grid system is broken, and always has been.  It was a neat idea, but no end of problems came from it.  He mentions the duping, but also think about if you wanted to create a custom recipe with multiple of an item in it.  You have two basic options.  One is fill up grid with single stacks of each item, or two you make stacks of items as part of recipe.  There is no easy way to tell how many of the is in the latter one.  You either have to guess or whomever created has to find a way to let people know- from experience, it is a pain.    The menu system so far already is much more fluid.  It is still in its infancy, but i see great things ahead for it.  I would love to see a forge need a lot more materials to make (I am sure the hundreds of stone was a bit of an exaggeration for a forge).  Instead of neading to worry about chance when it comes to how quickly you can start the more advanced recipes and building, it depends on how much you gather- great in a survival setting.    You always hear about 'breaking immserion' due a feature in the game.  I hear it a lot about killing animals and looting them like a container.  I can't wait to just be able to skin and butcher the animal.    This game has a long ways to go, and i love every time I see a blog post where they are putting in some pretty crazy changes.  It means they have a vision, and it will not be stagnant.  Folks, give 'new' a chance.  I think it will be pretty awesome."

7daystodie,3dsng8,Thelonous,3,Sun Jul 19 04:33:51 2015 UTC,Now your just being insulting for just for the sake of it.    The crafting system works by placing items in the grid.  The recipes tell you how many of what you need.  There is no need for guesswork.  I've played a shit ton of both minecraft and 7 days to die.  The problem you are conveying is fictional.
7daystodie,3dsng8,Ne0r15s,4,Sun Jul 19 04:45:59 2015 UTC,"What's he's saying is, imagine a recipe where in certain grid spaces you have to stack a certain number of items which will differ from space to space. Like 1 rock here, two scrap metal here and 5 leather strips there, rather than one of everything in each grid space, as it is right now. Just to clarify."
7daystodie,3dsng8,jack_danger,3,Sun Jul 19 05:21:03 2015 UTC,"However, he adds ""guesswork"" to it. There is no guessing. If the recipe is one you have learned you don't even need to drag items out of your inventory. Click the recipe and BAM!  All the needed items are transported from your inventory to the drafting frame.   If the recipes were hidden behind some sort of curtain, maybe I could see his point.  But they aren't.   It's a make believe problem.   Edit: as far as having a stack of something required for a recipe, such as the new forge...  They are intentionally creating a crafting issue. It would have been smarter to have that stack of pipes laid out individually as to confirm with the rest of their crafting.   This problem that they want to fix is a problem they implemented in order to cause a need for fixing.   ""I need to fill in this hole with cement""  ""What hole?""  ""The one I'm digging, don't be silly""  ""Couldn't you just not dig the hole?"""

7daystodie,3dsng8,ConfessionsAway,3,Sun Jul 19 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think a lot of people understand that, just because some mechanics from a game are shared with another, that does not make them remotely the same. All first person shooters have a gun that you shoot, but there are other mechanics besides just that one that make the game different. Even the similar mechanics can be very different depending what is included in them and how they are balanced.   I'm sure nobody shit on Mass Effect 1 for having shields despite every Halo before it having shields."
7daystodie,3dsng8,Detenator,5,Sun Jul 19 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"Rust and 7 Days are indeed fundamentally different, if only because Rust forces PVP, which tends to bring in the grievers and assholes from around the globe. Just play any popular PVP game and you're sure to encounter a constant stream of people who just plain want to ruin your day by spawn-camping you, using cheats, or hopping onto voice chat to say racist, homophobic, or just plain lewd things to everyone who'll give them a reaction.  Games like 7 Days to Die, where PVE is the main playmode tend to attract more mature gamers who enjoy working together toward a common goal. Not saying you won't still find the psychopaths who want to ruin your day in this game, because if a game's online, assholes are gonna play it, but it's significantly LESS.  Changing a few of the crafting mechanics isn't going to suddenly turn the game into an asshole's paradise, despite the current popular opinion."

Where there is smoke, there is usually fire. Alpha is the time to voice opinions, concerns, and reactions."
7daystodie,3dsng8,InfectedHeisenberg,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"But those opinions, concerns, and reactions are based heavily on assumptions.

We paid for Early Access to test their game and respond/react. We have a say. It is up to them to listen or not, but history has shown that when an EA game stops listening to its most passionate fans, and focuses on the casuals, it loses alot of momentum.   Instead of making half-ass late-night posts that cause massive speculation, they should post well constructed blogs that do explain this stuff. Their vagueness caused this."

And basic logic shows that listening to feedback from people that haven't tried the thing they're complaining about is downright ridiculous. Would you go to a restaurant based on reviews given by people that have never been there?   Instead of making half-ass late-night posts that cause massive speculation, they should post well constructed blogs that do explain this stuff. Their vagueness caused this.   I can agree with this in some ways, but this is the classic argument of transparency vs. watching what you say in front people that will overreact to everything. Speculation is one thing, but posting arguments based on assumptions is another. I sit in the camp that appreciates transparency, because I am capable of reserving judgement until it's in my hands. The fact that they couldn't resist posting about this until they had more info or something to show off makes me even more excited, because it means they're really excited about it."
7daystodie,3dsng8,vegeta897,4,Sun Jul 19 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"The analogy would be if you went to the same restaurant every day, and ordered the same dish. Then the chef tells you he is going to change that dish, and to trust him that you will like it better. But the dish is going to be different, by removing some ingredients from it, the ingredients you like alot.   The arguments are not without merit. A company can't sell Early Access, and ask for responses, opinions, and reactions, then get all bent out of shape when the feedback is negative. They can either listen to it or ignore it, that is on them. But pretending like you are somehow more mature than others because you are reserving your opinion is lame. We paid to test their game, we paid to voice our opinions on their changes.  They have released alot of news that has gotten great hype and genuine excitement. This one has fallen short. You can't win them all."

A company can't sell Early Access, and ask for responses, opinions, and reactions, then get all bent out of shape when the feedback is negative. They can either listen to it or ignore it, that is on them.   Seems like you're completely ignoring my point. They're interested in responses, opinions, and reactions to what they can actually play. That is why this is early access. If they only wanted your opinions based on a description of the game, they would develop privately since playing is apparently unnecessary for meaningful feedback.   But pretending like you are somehow more mature than others because you are reserving your opinion is lame.   Haha, this isn't about maturity. It's about knowing what useful feedback is. Feedback based on a text-only incomplete description of an upcoming feature is not useful. How can you sit there and tell me actually playing the game, or at least seeing the full feature in use, isn't absolutely necessary to be able to give proper feedback?  I'm fine with people sharing their opinions of what has been said. But that is not all that's happening in this thread. People are jumping to conclusions and then expressing their opinions of those conclusions.  It creates an atmosphere where developers are afraid to touch any core part of a game that people have grown accustomed to, for fear of the outcry it inevitably brings.  People seem to lose sight of what public alphas are about. They're about trying things. They don't have to get it right on the first try like with a single gold release. It's not like the devs have never reverted anything that didn't work out. In fact, getting it wrong on the first try is far more informative than any amount of speculative/predictive feedback. Trying things means actually trying them, not talking about them and dismissing them before they even exist. More early access devs should try things with their games instead of treating it like a buggy demo to nab some early sales."

Whatever, clearly the outcry from people should be a starting point for the devs to see how people feel about the changes. Those of us who actually watched alpha games dive bomb because of major mechanic changes (that the fans warned against) know how this goes. We are just trying to prevent our friends and clan mates from quitting when A13 hits.   A dev said some controversial things, and the players are reacting. Outside of the guy who nobody is sure is an actual dev or not, they havent tried to counter the ""misleading"" reactions. Unless the reactions are spot-on.   You can sit and patiently wait all you want. My clan is already losing interest over the IDEA of what was presented. This isn't about trying something new, this is about hating the proposed concept and not wanting a fix for something people generally didn't hate to begin with, but these ideas suck already and the players are speaking out. That is what an alpha should be, listening the players."

I don't know what your fascination is with mucking about with the same parts of the game over and over again, but in case you hadn't noticed, the endgame in 7 Days to Die is shallow as fuck.  Instead of introducing a bunch of grind and mucking about with established mechanics, why don't you take care of the glaring flaw in this game and add some new content instead of fucking up the content you already have.  There's nothing wrong with the crafting as it is.  ARK's crafting system is garbage, why the hell would you want to copy it?  I suspect after this change goes through I'll be uninstalling this game.

I'm so tired of hearing complaints about a lack of endgame in an alpha game. The game is unfinished and it will continue to be so for a very very long time. Because they are making it. Right now. Why do people expect a well crafted endgame in an unfinished game? The beginning isn't done. The middle is not done. Why would the end be done right now? I don't understand what you people want."
7daystodie,3dsng8,jack_danger,3,Sun Jul 19 08:50:42 2015 UTC,"I think people are well aware it's still in alpha, and certainly aren't expecting a fully crafted, fleshed out and perfected game to be dropped into their laps. I think most peoples complaints stem from the fact that they haven't paid any attention to the mid-end game in a long time. Their efforts seem to have focused on making the early game as hard as possible to simply delay the mid to end game. It's boring and tedious and makes people stop playing once they reach a certain point.  If they want to overhaul crafting, then chances are it's going to happen whether we like it or not. But please don't dumb it down. It's already fairly simple as it is. If they want to get rid of redundant items, why not make them useful instead of scrapping them? Make nails more a lot more abundant and use them in wood crafting. Allow rotten meat to be used to camouflage your smell, but with a risk of getting infected. Please, just something to add more depth.  And what about skill trees? More vehicles? Bigger and more varied cities? Hopefully these things will come in time, but I'd rather see them getting implemented over tweaks and changes to things which have already been tweaked and changed in the last several patches."

The problem comes in with things that take intermediate steps and those materials aren't really used for anything else.  Quite frankly I figured the issue (if you can call it that) would be resolved as more recipes were added that leverage some of that stuff. For example potassium nitrate in its mined form isn't used for anything but converting to powder. I don't personally mind a step to refine it. It makes more sense to me that bashing ready to use materials right out of the earth. But I think people might care about that extra step less if there was some other reason to have the raw stuff."

On the other hand they could just stop so many things being gated behind the forge. Stuff like crossbows/metal armor/bullets should really be in a later tier than fire axes which are really essential to build a wooden base.

How the fuck are people actually making comparisons to other games already? We have no idea what this is going to look like! We only have a vague idea of the direction they're taking. People will come out of the woodwork to complain any time you change something core to the game, regardless of how objectively good the change may be. If I had a dollar for every time I've seen an early access game change something fundamental and witnessed the pure rage, only for it to die down shortly after when people realize the game has improved.   Why don't we at least wait until we have the rest of the details, huh? Or better yet, wait until we can try it out in the game.  If any developer reads this, please don't let the bad reactions affect your confidence. I at least have some trust in your decisions and am eager to see what you can do. I don't freak out at the mere mention of words like ""streamline."" Streamlining a UI isn't the same as streamlining gameplay, and definitely isn't the same as dumbing down gameplay.

Inventory management is an element to the game that makes loot runs more of a decision making process. More items in the world means more trade options for us. Its a gameplay element and experience we love and enjoy, and it seems alot of others do as well.   So don't speak in absolutes. What you consider arbitrary or unnecessary is your personal opinion.

So do I, but I do not view the current method of working through item types as realistic in the slightest. It barely holds any ties to reality. I think there is a way to make a crafting system that is closer to reality and thus more intuitive. I should not be guessing or looking things up to create things or understand a production line, but there is literally no other way. You can't intuit most of the recipes and processes in this game. Why would I have to turn a plank into sticks before I can make a club out of it? Why would multiple sticks form into one chunk of wood? You cannot tell me it is only my opinion that that is arbitrary. It is absolutely arbitrary, and it is definitely not realistic.

""All"" meaning ore will spawn anywhere and everywhere.  ""Noise"" meaning it will spawn based on your own location. Also known as what it was in A9/A10 or before caves were introduced.  Make sure you change all instances to All or Noise for each individual biome and ore. This game has a very very good comment code written in by the devs to help changing these codes pretty easy. But just in case make sure you back up all files before changing them just in case you do mess it up and break the game."

7daystodie,3dq3rc,Annihilinth,6,Sat Jul 18 10:13:21 2015 UTC,"A few random tips, some of which should help on week one:   One of the first things any new player should craft when they have the chance is a handful of wood frames. They're expensive in early game (8 planks each) but for sheer versatility they cannot be matched. You can stair-step up the side of a building, plug holes, frame out roofs so spiders can't climb up to get you, erect crude weak barricades to slow zombies or make them make noise destroying the frame that can alert you to their presence (great when you're trying to bust open a safe), nerdpole, bridge gaps, even let you ride out a night out in the open (dig a hole straight down and set a frame or two over your head to plug the hole). And all of this usefulness doesn't require upgrading them into ""permanent"" blocks, so you can grab 'em and reuse when you're done. If you have a decent ranged weapon (e.g., crossbow/bow with iron- or steel-headed arrows, or better a decent firearm and enough ammo) and encounter a bear, you can usually drop it pretty safely by sprinting backward while putting rounds in its face. Just be careful to not let your stamina drain completely or get stuck on terrain as either will give the bear a chance to catch you. (They move faster than you walk but slower than you run.) It'll take several bolts or a mess of arrows but it's doable, and retrieve/save the meat - bear stew is AMAZING. Water towers are actually full of water, which can be handy if you're in a desert and can't find any small pools. Nerdpole or stair-step up with wood frames, knock open the top of the tower, and there you go. In A11 you could set up shop at the top of a three-story brick shop building, remove F1-F2 the stairs, and basically be invulnerable, but in A12 the zombies will gradually destroy structures if they detect you but can't path to you. (They'll attack random structural components in the vicinity if their pathfinding code can't resolve a route to you.) Plan accordingly. You don't want to ride a collapsing building down to ground level, and especially not  if there's a feral horde at the bottom. Be careful with spike traps - you can get stunlocked on them and die pretty quickly. Which is embarrassing. If you're setting up a subterranean base, waypoint the entrance on your map so you can dash to it quickly if you see nightfall approaching. Saves from getting killed because you ran to the home marker instead of the entrance and got turned around by attacking zombies/bears. (Curse my horrible sense of direction!)"

Also I know you stressed it a lot that knowledge is power in this game,  and it is wonderful that you have, but if I were you I would even throw in one last ""raid all the bookshelves ever"" bit lol and once you can craft shotgun shells and have a shotgun all that paper from the books you get from shelves that aren't readable will come in quite handy.  Another thing is, because of the amazing crossbow being locked behind a book now, I have used some other weapons I didn't use to before and I have to say, the blunderbuss (once you are able to craft an orange one at least) is quite good if you wait until the absolutely last second and get a head shot, I have been pleasantly surprised to see.  Last note: Great guide. I agree with just about everything you said and this should definitely help people struggling on the first couple of nights.  If you have a friend on your server it is infinitely nicer too because jobs can be split up (ie one mines and one hunts or one builds and one forages) and it increases your survival efforts tremendously if you two are coordinated.   Great job!  PS- no matter what stage in the game you are, if you find a purple small engine (or even a blue one for that matter) guard that thing with your life and make sure it is protected at all times and cradle it at night and sing it lullabies because once you have enough resources to craft a minibike, you will fly though the map with that thing and you will be SO happy you saved it."

7daystodie,3dq3rc,The-Lord-Our-God,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"Great guide. I have a few things to add, which I think make week (or even day) 1 far more survivable:   In the likely case that you spawn in a desert biome, use your stone axe to harvest several of the tall cacti; their fruit is juicy and will help with thirst and hunger. Great early game food. Campsites are everywhere- loot them! There will be sleeping bags, back packs, food coolers, hollow stumps, cooking pots, and more! Not only that, but if you chop at the tents, you'll get enough cloth to last for the next few weeks. You can either take out the small horde that hangs around (and then make use of the camp fire that's there), or you can just lead them away and double back, quickly looting what you can. After the basics, my first priority isn't finding a town, it's finding a woodland biome. Once there, I search until I find the type of cabin with an all stone bottom (not the kind with a balcony around the whole thing)- they have forges in them! Once secured, take your stone axe to as many boulders as you can find, to obtain their sweet, sweet iron fragments. After 5-7 boulders, you should have enough metal (once smelted) to make at least an axe, with a couple ingots left over.    I have a specific way of fortifying the forge cabins, but that's probably not important. From this point, I pretty much focus on what's in the above guide (other than also keeping an eye out for caves)."

7daystodie,3dsk03,xole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"How is she tilling the soil? If you are planting potatoes, the ground must be immediately hoed/placed for the plant to grow. If there's even a bit of grass that starts to grow (usually happened in like 5-10 seconds), then the plant won't grow. Corn still will, however, as it seems to be able to grow anywhere, not just in fresh fertile soil"
7daystodie,3dsk03,artcorvelay,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for that! We actually discovered that she might have not been tilling the soil enough, and she also may bhave been planting crops too closely together. Aside from that, and we're still not sure if it's necessarily the case, but she tilled all the soil in the farm in the same direction, and we've been good ever since (I think 3 days ingame now?). For future reference, I'll bear that in mind, and pass that along to her, though.   Cheers!"

7daystodie,3dsig0,ExplodingJesus,2,Mon Jul 20 12:27:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I was going to share some bitchin' screenshots, but my Drive wasn't running at home so it didn't sync them to my work PC.  This is the best I have.  There's another pile of gore behind me just as big, and another just in front of the book store, as well as several cops that don't show up unless aiming."
7daystodie,3dsig0,smittyjones,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"I'm with ya. I hadn't had my coffee yet and didn't see that ""city"" was specified. I read it as one of those big collections of houses, not a hub. Sorry about that.  I don't think it matters how many you kill in the city, more are coming for you. I've expended hundreds of rounds and they just keep spawning. I think the point is to keep the pressure on you the entire time you're there as a trade-off for supposedly better loot. So the normal spawn rates don't really apply here I guess. There might just be less on the map at any given time... but they're still going to feel infinite."
7daystodie,3dsig0,ExplodingJesus,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"The zombies spawning is quite high. If you run to a POI of almost any type (especially the dirt road ones), a cluster will spawn around it.   Once you have a bow and some arrows, you can double tap any zed in the head for a quick kill. It requires a bit of mobility, but it isn't that hard. Once the zone is clear, you won't see any more pop-up spawns at that POI.   I just started a new game today (on the side of my MP) and did just this. At first I thought the zombie spawn was to much, but then once I learned how the mechanic worked, it becomes much more tolerable.   Don't just run from POI to POI, you won't ever get a break. Instead, harvest at least 80 to 100 arrows and then take over a POI and make your temp base in one of those standalone homes. Once you have a house, the game gets much more enjoyable.   Don't give up!"
7daystodie,3dsig0,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:52:20 2015 UTC,I exactly thought this would be the case and yet it occured to me that even though I kill zombies around a POI they still do spawn very close to me (around the POI).
7daystodie,3dsig0,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:47:04 2015 UTC,"I get randomly spawning zombies, but its a few and once or twice a day. But not the same level as when you first arrive.   Our clan also took over a full town POI, built a wall around it, and still get spawns inside and out. Clearing a zone won't stop them forever.   Just pretend they are ""Walking Dead"" zombies, where as nobody hears them until they have snuck up on you."
7daystodie,3dsig0,Verrix88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:40:05 2015 UTC,This is why your main base shouldn't be a in a POI. By all means have a temporary base in one the first few days until you have the resources/tools/books to get something sturdy up and running
7daystodie,3drwyd,securityclown,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:38:03 2015 UTC,Good question. But personally I just throw a deal of coal in my fire pit and it lasts way longer than needed. So I've never worried about it. Cause when I cook I cook a lot of eggs or eggs and bacon
7daystodie,3drwyd,djcollyder,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think there's actually a gap in the timer on one of the sides. I can't remember which way I've noticed it but its either when it starts to take the next item off the fuel stack or when it stops cooking the last food item and moves it to the ""cooked"" stack... For your result the latter makes more sense obviously, but either way the timers do not seem to hold true."
7daystodie,3drwyd,yamirashi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that too, there's another glitch with the fire where if you are cooking huge quantities of something and leave the area, when you come back your fuel sources(logs, coal, whatever) will still be there and your campfire won't cook anymore. You'll have to destroy the campfire and make a new one(after you take everything out of it of course)."

7daystodie,3drqt7,Frankeh1,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:32 2015 UTC,I started a new game with 12.3 and have looted 3 steel arrowheads so far.  They're out there.

7daystodie,3drqt7,Thelonous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:10:47 2015 UTC,"before 12.3, they had forgotten to put in loot options, so there was no way to gain.  One of the patch notes for 12.3 states they are now part of loot.  I haven't tested this because we haven't reset server (loot requires fresh regions for changes).  What we did instead was just make it so you could make mold out of regular steel arrows."
7daystodie,3drqnb,littlemokey,3,Sat Jul 18 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"Attaching flashlights to any weapon is bugged right now, it destroys the flashlight when you try it.  However there is a workaround to make it work.  After you put the flashlight in just pick up any one of the gun parts so it briefly doesn't show the gun's icon in the output box.  Put the part right back and hit craft, it will have the flashlight attached."
7daystodie,3drqnb,b0rgerking,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:45 2015 UTC,Will try thanks. I have a miners helmet but I just want to finally build one LOL. Plus I i get a military helmet again I'll use that.
7daystodie,3drqnb,dointhestankyleg,2,Sat Jul 18 22:00:52 2015 UTC,Does the gun model show the flashlight attached?  Have you tried using the right click->attach menu?
7daystodie,3drqnb,mrsonicmadness,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"Ya it's red where the light is and then when I click on the shotgun it goes green,  then when I click it again the flashlight will appear with the gun parts so then I click build. And all the parts disappear and the gun appears."
7daystodie,3drqnb,Tabudragon,2,Sat Jul 18 21:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yea I had this problem too. How I got around it was simple. First you go to the weapon you want to attach it to, then you right click it to bring up its menu. You'll see a part that says attach, follow that path and click the flashlight you want to attach (I went through about 5 flashlights before figuring this out)."

7daystodie,3dqek0,Spider013,3,Sat Jul 18 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"That's silly. Just use AutoHotKey, plenty of scripts available for it to do whatever you might need. This is what I use (not only for 7DtD, all games that don't have auto-run): http://pastebin.com/1M9b88UG  Click mouse button 4 once, and it'll auto-run until I press it or w again. Also use auto-mining to hold my LMB down for me, AHK's a lifesaver for the supremely lazy."
7daystodie,3dqek0,drazgul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, I use it as well, this is the script I made (the parts that are overly large and bold have hashtags in front of them, but Reddit uses those to make things overly large and bold):   IfWinActive, 7 Days To Die  keystate=down  g::  Send {e %keystate%}  Send {LShift %keystate%}  if keystate = down  SetEnv, keystate, up  else if keystate = up  SetEnv, keystate, down  return   So basically this turns G into a hotkey that holds down LShift and E. The nice thing about this script is if you run out of stamina, you can just push LShift and your character will keep walking forward so you can regain stamina, then when you're ready to sprint again, you just push G twice. You can also change it to a different hotkey by changing ""g::"" to be whatever key you want, plus if you're a WASD gamer, you can change ""Send {e %keystate%}"" to ""Send {w %keystate%}""  Also, if you're going to use AutoHotKey, just know that it's a possibility that you'll be VAC banned if you're playing on someone's server and they find out and are feeling vindictive. It is, technically, cheating, even though the way you're using it is just to address the lack of something that should naturally be in the game."

Some tips, repair the axe when it falls below 50% and once your stamina falls below ~40%, rest and let the bar fill back up to full before you start slamming it again.  This will give you the strongest swings possible hence taking less time.  I think a low level stone axe can take upwards to 80-100 swings if memory serves."

Of course, they'll respawn after a week anyway (or whatever your settings are) so I guess that doesn't really matter."

They also added the chance for books to spawn in more containers now too (garbage, zombies, cabinets) so make sure to loot everything.

I gave up trying to search everything for one. If I come across one then great. Lol.

7daystodie,3do7mb,djcollyder,4,Sun Jul 19 04:05:49 2015 UTC,"forge ahead is rare because it is common. let me explain, at level 1 there is a ratio of common:rare loot and as you level up rare loot becomes more common. meaning at level 1 the common:rare loot will be 10:1(not actual ratio just example) but as you level up and rare books become more abundant and there are less and less common books opposed to rare books meaning for every 10 rare books you find you may only find 1 common book which is the category that forging ahead is under. basically the only way to avoid this is finding all of the common books before leveling up which is very hard seeing as there isn't a specific way to find a born and nobles and not fight zombies at a low level. basically this is still new and needs balancing."

What's worse: the last time I died like this, the screen went taupe and didn't give me a respawn option, so I logged out and logged back it... at which point the game decided to place me 17km away from my base.  I logged out, turned off zombie spawning, and ran the whole damn way back because I was worried my backpack might despawn if I died before getting back to it (turns out that isn't how it works but I wasn't gonna risk it).  Incidentally, 17km is a long-ass distance to run even if you chug looted beer for most of the way."

If you're using it to herd them or simply protect your crops, I would recommend the wooden farm fence with the barbed wire (normal barbed wire, not the fence stuff) on top.

They float and all that. They have a /spawn command setup that instantly spawns you to a ""safe"" area that is basically zombie proof. Some other commands set up to spawn you to your house, and stuff. Kind of defeats the purpose though. They use it to spawn back to base while looting. There are forges/fires/water/food all setup for new players. Some may like that as its helpful, but I like the entirety of the ""survival"" aspect of the game. It's the main point.   All in all, it just ruined the ""survival"" aspect for me. They were supper nice though!"

7daystodie,3dod2a,rezanow,2,Fri Jul 17 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on this, and won't be able to verify this for you, but I think instead of being a spectrum of 0-1, it is a spectrum of 0-total.  So, probability for 1-100 from lvl 1 to 10 is 1/(1+0.25+0.15+0.05).  I think it rerolls this probability for every item it selects.  I could be completely wrong on this, and it is speculated that the levels of other players affects it in multiplayer, so there's no good way to know for sure without extensive testing."
7daystodie,3dod2a,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:38:25 2015 UTC,I don't think I fully understand the use of dividing by the sum total rather than making the sum of all probabilities total to one. Is it easier to program?
7daystodie,3dod2a,Detenator,2,Fri Jul 17 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"It's easier to add a new option down the line.  Think of it more like a relative weight than a probability.  Each option gives a certain amount of the total weight, so if you want to add a new option, all you have to do is approximate what it's weight should be, rather than what each option's new probability should be."
7daystodie,3dmmew,Ne0r15s,33,Fri Jul 17 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"Devs, please continue to make changes and experiment with different mechanics.  Please continue to try to find places where the game is trivial, and tweak things to make these things less trivial.  We're play-testing a game here.

7daystodie,3dmmew,Wedgenet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:15:53 2015 UTC,I feel by your statement that you have concluded my opinion to be different than yours.   I'm simply calling out a hotfix that needs a re-design.   Yes it's frustrating. And the developers need to know this.
7daystodie,3dmmew,Thelonous,16,Fri Jul 17 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"One just needs to change their style of defense.  They were way op.  They never broke.  It seems they are moving towards more active base defense.  Notice the bodies turning into dirt so that zombies can climb on them.    Before, it was about building a base and... then what?  If they can't get in, what else was there to do in game?  I assume they will also be adding more stuff more mid-game to end-game after this.  I personally like this change."
7daystodie,3dmmew,BlaineTog,3,Fri Jul 17 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"I wish there were just specific zombie-types that could damage log spikes rather than all of them.  Then you could use the log spikes to thin out the herd and focus on taking out the scarier zombies.  Rather than representing just another source of maintenance, the logs would actually allow the player to differentiate between zombies (those you have to worry about and those you don't so much), thus adding to the game's asymmetry in a really interesting way."
7daystodie,3dmmew,Thelonous,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:11 2015 UTC,that would be really cool.  Maybe that is coming with the hint of more types of zombies in future.
7daystodie,3dmmew,mooseeve,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:31:43 2015 UTC,The problem is not zombies damaging the logs. If the logs actually block a zombie they will smash through it.   This is an auto degradation of the logs when they deal damage.   It is so severe that their resource cost makes them not really worth it to build them.   Better off using campfires or fall damage or even just plain wood spikes currently.
7daystodie,3dmmew,Thelonous,7,Fri Jul 17 19:05:47 2015 UTC,It would likely be fine if they gave us something else.  Shoot through metal bars? Great hotfix.  Being able to create metal bars.  Good luck finding that forge book.  I and many others are stuck defending with bows/spikes because we lack the gate books needed for things such as guns and forges.  It's pretty shitty.  Glad you have had better luck.
7daystodie,3dmmew,denoflions-,6,Fri Jul 17 14:53:14 2015 UTC,Fancy cabins have forges in them.
7daystodie,3dmmew,Thelonous,2,Fri Jul 17 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"I can't say i have.  I am actually a server admin- I actually rarely play the game any more.  I have just gotten tired of same stuff every update- nothing really changes.  This is something that looks towards a brighter future.    They seem to have made a lot of things harder to find.  This part i am not so sure about.  It shows they want you to be playing straight coop, which is alright, but i prefer the idea of larger multiplayer servers.  This means people may not always be around at same time and not be forced to play with others if they don't have to.  if this part continues, i'll probably eventually mod the server a bit to deal with looting chances."
7daystodie,3dmmew,denoflions-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:34 2015 UTC,As another admin I've found the easiest way to alleviate a lot of complaining about books was to change a couple of easy things.  First I changed bookshelves to always have at least 1 book in it. Nothing seems to demoralize players like an empty bookshelf.   Next I changed some of the harder targets like safes to have a reasonable chance to contain an unleveled rare book.  Those two changes have alleviated at least 95% of the 'I can't do anything because I can't find x book' complaints.
7daystodie,3dmmew,Togfox,2,Fri Jul 17 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"I love both of those ideas, I think I will implement next wipe"
7daystodie,3dmmew,Rock1monkey,8,Fri Jul 17 18:59:08 2015 UTC,With A12 and this hotfix I've basically given up on base building.  With the log spike nerf and the whole leveled crafting/loot system they obviously just don't want us to build at all and would rather have us running around exclusively shooting zombies to grind levels like we're playing Killing Floor.  So now I just hang out in prefabs and move on to another one when the damage gets too severe.
7daystodie,3dmmew,Togfox,2,Fri Jul 17 18:48:42 2015 UTC,This.  My mate levels twice as fast as me because he is the hunter killer while i mine and build.  I might just put a bed on a roof and just scavenge for 6 days straight then hold tight.
7daystodie,3dmmew,BlaineTog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you two are talking about. Building huge forts here, killing loads of zombies on medium spawn. Perhaps the spikes could be improved but building and defending has been great."
7daystodie,3dmmew,cellfoneguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"Point is, base builders don't level as much as ""shooters"".  Base builders spend their entire early/mid-game using faulty items because they're not out killing Z's."
7daystodie,3dmmew,Devils_-_Advocate,14,Tue Jul 21 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"I agree.  It's seriously making me consider not playing anymore.  The goal of a player's efforts in a survival game is to reach homeostasis, to create a stable living arrangement and thrive in spite of adversity.  The game needs to consistently challenge that homeostasis in order for it to be fun, but it cannot do that by making homeostasis impossible or excessively tedious or the game becomes an exercise in futility.  I've only been playing since I picked the game up during the Steam sale, but already I've seen the devs implement nerfs that seem specifically targeted to make basic homeostasis increasingly tedious to achieve and maintain.  This is entirely the wrong way to go about it.  Don't directly nerf homeostasis, and certainly don't nerf it in such a way that can be solved by mindless grind rather than by intelligence, guile, or bravery.  Rather, add bigger threats which the player must conquer in order to achieve higher levels of agency.  Ideally, these threats would also come with commensurate rewards so that they become a source of greed rather than, ""Ah crap, now I gotta deal with this again.""  Running around your base with a claw hammer and tapping everything a few times every time a random trash zombie shows up isn't fun.  Having to continually replace broken log spikes isn't fun.  Raiding a heavily-populated city center to retrieve a heavy generator which you then have to drag back to your base could be really fun.  Having to fight down the occasional mega-zombie that doesn't care so much about your defenses could be really fun.  What if you could put together a radio, locate NPC survivors, and then rescue them?  What if they could help you defend against giant hordes or help you farm potatoes or even man the radio and point you towards other survivor groups?  NPC survivors would obviously be very difficult to code so I wouldn't expect to see them for a long time, but that's the sort of challenge that could be really fun to overcome.  And normally I hate escort missions -- I think we all do.  But in this case, for this game, they could provide an interesting end-game, where you aren't just thinking about your own survival but someone else's as well."
7daystodie,3dmmew,-DangerAlien-,4,Fri Jul 17 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that the change was a bit out of the blue. Mere weeks ago they implemented gore blocks, now they turn log spikes into what are basically more durable stick spikes? I mean, I understand the logic. Even with gore blocks, enough log spikes and a high enough wall makes you virtually invincible. But this...like a few other things they've done, I feel like this is a band-aid.   In the meantime, consider implementing barbed wire (they path to avoid it usually so you can herd them) and campfires (downside is it costs fuel) into your defenses. I like to utilize their stupid pathing with the ramp trick(i'll ms paint it when I get back to my computer, or someone else can explain it) which works well enough as long as you make sure to remove gore blocks."
7daystodie,3dmmew,-DangerAlien-,7,Fri Jul 17 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"If I do decide to play again, ill just build a massive wall around my base covered in ladders that drops them from the top as they path toward me.  then i just have to manage the cleanup of the gore at the bottom."
7daystodie,3dmmew,wolfiechica,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"You should consider building a moat instead of walls. Dig down around your base, line the bottom with spikes and cover the sides with barbed wire. Your happy little fort sits on top.   Sure, you have to do some maintenance on your pit, but it's a death pit. It saves you, so you need to be good to it so it'll be good to you"
7daystodie,3dmmew,GenerallyObtuse,3,Fri Jul 17 15:15:07 2015 UTC,Dig? With what? My non existent metal tools?  It is much easier to build walls than pits without forges.
7daystodie,3dmmew,scorcher24,3,Fri Jul 17 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. I too have spent many hours building harvesting trees for wood log spikes. But in a game where zombies can destroy nearly every other object, wouldn't it make sense that the wood log spikes would also be destructible?"
7daystodie,3dmmew,Chauserable,8,Fri Jul 17 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"They have always been destructible and not even hard to do so.  The thing is zombies path OVER them, not beat through them.  It would actually be relatively hard to break a wood log spike in this manner.  Yet, the crumble like paper mache with footsteps alone."
7daystodie,3dmmew,FishNeedles,3,Fri Jul 17 15:03:15 2015 UTC,"I see your point, you make a good one. But if they don't swing at them, and stepping on them didn't destroy them, that kind of makes them invincible. This is probably the devs trying to balance fairness. Personally I feel like the gore blocks would have been enough."
7daystodie,3dmmew,splintur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, they have been destructible, but previous to this patch, when was the last time you actually had to maintenance your ditches? Like, really, ever?  I feel like it definitely needed change, but they did swing it a bit far on the side of tediousness. Wearing at about half the rate they do currently would seem more fair."
7daystodie,3dmmew,Ulfgar88,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"Every two in-game days or so, I had to go out and repair some spikes, and replace others."
7daystodie,3dmmew,kyuss80,3,Fri Jul 17 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"I somewhat agree. Nerfing the players defenses over and over is not really going to accomplish whatever they are trying, unless it is to make bases utterly useless.  First they need to make certain recipes a guaranteed drop after a while, to ensure that the player has it after a certain amount of time, e.g. the forge book at level 10-15 and the crossbow at 20+.   Defense and the whole Zombie System needs to be overhauled and re-imagined. At day, Zombies aren't much of a threat. You can outwalk them. At night, you can barely survive once detected because so many can get on top of you so quick. I say make the Zombies a bit faster by default at day, so that running out of stamina is actually a problem. But let us still outrun them at day.   Then the next that needs to be overhauled is the cave system. Random generation does not cut it, leads to many unusable caves. I got one today, where all ore from that cave would float in mid-air and when I tried to get some the whole thing came crushing down when I broke 1 block. So no iron ore at all from that cave.  Make prefab caves, that get placed in the world by the world generator. So this way we have more natural and more fun caves. Also, enable random metal noise in blocks that resemble mountains. So random mining can be a thing."
7daystodie,3dmmew,IAmPartialToRed,2,Sat Jul 18 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"I think its a great idea, It was getting boring building impenetrable bases, now theres a challenge again. You could always make your difficulty settings easier if you prefer"
7daystodie,3dmmew,IAmPartialToRed,2,Sun Jul 19 01:04:50 2015 UTC,"It really has nothing to do with difficulty settings.  I mentioned in another comment that this game isn't hard.  You can outrun zombies all night long if you choose to.  They are attempting to make base building tedious.    It is almost at a point now with the gate books preventing many players from using anything except wood structures, and defensive items being nerfed to the point of ineffectiveness due to their resource/time inputs and low durability that you are better off just throwing a few crates and a sleeping bag on a road and just wandering through the night with a bow.    Hordes would always be moving toward a location you have already left behind, and individual zombies are hardly an issue.  They are preventing players from choosing how to play and forcing everyone to play a similar style.  Adjust difficulty... yeah.  I guess I could also set it to zombies always walk, and 18hour day cycles.  Or you know... Play a more balanced game.  (edit: My actual preference is that the devs stop nerfing success. Balance is fine, but they have gone out of their way to make defending ones base a non-stop struggle)"
7daystodie,3dmmew,azwaldor,3,Sun Jul 19 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"To me it basically seems like they are avoiding the addition of aspects that would create an ENJOYABLE challenge and would rather say ""fuck it"" and lock everything behind rng and tedious bullshit like this.  I'm really not liking the direction they're headed in."
7daystodie,3dmmew,denoflions-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think it to be too much of a problem. They are balancing out the game, and if you can agree with them that the logs need balancing as per "" Sure, wood log spikes were probably a little OP "" , then they are doing their job.   They are forcing us to think differently about our defenses. Before it was stick up some log spikes, upgrade them and call it a day. Now, because they break, what if there were layers of log spikes blocking them to get in? If they break one set then they deal with the second. Or what if barbed wire is integrated in between it all? or what if water is somehow used to slow them all down? what if your entire base is underground and you dont need log spikes at all? What if you create a kill chamber that they are forced to fall into but dont get killed instantly and are just now trapped for you to shoot them? Now you get xp where you otherwise wouldnt.   Sure the change was a little saddening and messed up my build quite a bit too, but now its time for us to brainstorm and come up with an even better defense! =)"
7daystodie,3dmmew,azwaldor,2,Sat Jul 18 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"I've already come up with a new one.  But as another person said, and I kind of agree with them.  The dev's want people to play their way.  They don't want people to use killboxes.  IMO, let people that want to use them use them, and those that dont can focus on different strategies.  I'm currently building a killbox.  I'll post it here when finished (resourse heavy) and see how long till it gets nerfed.  Edit: Does not work... Seems zombies will not climb over tall structures unless you are above them.  Here I am on day 35 depending on a building outside my main fort to ride out the night.  Its 40 blocks tall and outside the range of feral scent.  They still camp at the bottom to wait for me to come down to lead them away."

Not being able to make reliable guns makes the bow a much more valuable tool until then. Also, bullets require materials from mining which you can't really accomplish without a forge.

It can be a pain getting it to fill but keep trying different angles and eventually it will.  Once full you can dump it wherever you desire and experience the joy that is the messed up water physics in this game.  That being said it is super convenient to make an infinite water source in your base by walling in a corner to leave a one block hole, and dumping your bucket there.  Can even drop a forge for making jars and a campfire for purifying the water right on top of the blocks you used to close it in so all your water needs are right there."

You would need at least 3 blocks of height where you want a water block to go, then fill in a corner or the end of a hall as you pictured, and hop up on the block in front of it and make sure the outline for where the water will go is inside the hole before pouring it."

7daystodie,3djanq,rizzlybear,2,Thu Jul 16 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"I imagine at the very least they would need to use the same variable block height they already have on the ground. So when a body of water drains, the volume of the remainder is altered accordingly. I also think that it would have to react fairly slowly, as not to incinerate the entire planet with excess cpu usage... If high system overheads are an issue, perhaps it should be a serverside option whether to have complex water physics or not."

7daystodie,3diqao,mshiltonj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"It's not as bad as it was. Some superstitious tips that may or may not be necessary now: Always set down a 'garage' of wood frames before you assemble your bike. Put the wheels on first, handlebars on last. Never leave it sitting not in a 'garage', as minibikes have been known to drive off on their own. Don't use the storage, things will disappear. When you first assemble it, your battery is marked as ""damaged"" (or something, some variable that marks it as not repaired). There is a bug where you drain your battery for the first time, repair it, then it immediately drains to zero no matter how much you repaired it. To fix this, repair the battery, remove it, then place it back on the bike. And finally, don't log out with your bike assembled in the game world. Take it apart and leave the pieces in your inventory while you are logged out. That sounds like a lot, but if you're careful it's super useful and a lot of fun, too."

Most of the horde was inside the house, so we built a ladder down the side of the build and took them out as they came out the door.  The dogs and cops were a pain.  I don't think the house we were at will stand much longer.  They did a lot of damage on the inside and outside."

But that's another story.  We couldn't find out of they respawn because our respawn timer was set to 20 days and after the day 9 half of the roof collapsed (maybe because I startet do grow a cornfield on it :/) and after day 10 the second half came down too. We have lowered the timer to 10 days and there are a few shelves left so I will find out soon... if we keep the library.

I was just planting the new corn and suddenly we heard metal and glas break. When the second half fell appart we wheren'd doing anything on that roof, a friend was normale walking over it as we did all the time and suddenly it collapsed.    Our guess is, that the building isn't made for the new physics and after a few hours the game decided to update the physics values for the blocks and noticed that it just shouldn't be here and let it collapse.

I had been walking over them for days, and that was the first time I had a torch so close to the pumps, so I assumed it was just an explosion.  Given the several reports I've see here of building spontaneously collapsing, maybe not.  One thing I do though is every morning I go down and repair everything that was damaged.  I found that if I allow the damage to remain, they will eventually do enough damage to compromise the structure.

That thing was indestructible.  We had a moat with spikes and barbed wire around it . Then came a cement wall with barbed wire on the sides (for the spiders) .

Not only logical, but it seems like something that would make the game much more fun, challenging, and rewarding.  Right now, I can pretty much roam around during day, with free reign.  I can hunker down in any old house, or on top of any old building (I'm on top of a gas station in a city right now, because I couldn't make it home last night)  But if they ran during the day?  It would be much more of a challenge to go to the city during the day.  I'd have to sneak about so it didn't spawn a huge horde.  Or I could just go at night, where the challenge would be that I couldn't see where they were.  Maybe give them better vision at night or something.  Still have a 7th day horde at night, and let it run.  Or just make the 7th day horde spawn for several hours during the day on day 7.  Man, I'm going to look at xml files tonight and see if that's something that can be done fairly simply."
7daystodie,3dkfj8,ApexGS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"I might try this on my server and see how it works out.  It's an interesting concept and worth playtesting in my opinion.  There are some limitations to how close I can get to the described functionality, but flipping their wander speed should give a decent feel for it.  To my knowledge there's no way to alter weapon properties for the attacks based on time of day though, but I like that idea.  Right now the only real difference between day and night for the zombies themselves is run speed, the rest is all in how the spawning system throws them at you."
7daystodie,3dlele,Erectorz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:30:56 2015 UTC,I had that issue. The game would cause my pc to restart. I could play other games fine except this one. I narrowed it down to a power issue.  It would seem that the Unity Engine causes a larger power draw in my GTX 970 and when it would fluctuate my pc would restart without causing a bsod and no dump file.   I had a 4 month old Thermaltake 850w Bronze certified PSU and upgraded to a Corsair HX750i Platinum certified and I've played for 24 hours straight with no crashes at all. Only thing I can figure is that the Thermaltake doesn't supply the proper power on the rail used for the GFX cards. If anyone with more tech savvy knowledge can chime in about that I'd appreciate it.  I'd definitely check everything in case you have a different issue but that's the solution I found after trying everything.  It seems to be a very common issue with games on the Unity engine. Random resets tend to be caused by either overheating or power issues.
7daystodie,3dj8ky,deaf_fish,10,Thu Jul 16 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"Caves (or dig deep). I have set up a base in a cave complex that is deep enough that even the feral zombie can't smell you. Wait until morning, then come out and fight what remains of the horde (some despawn, others just wander around) while daylight makes them walk.   If your cave entrance is far enough from where your room is you rarely, if ever, get any wanderers inside. I even opened up the cave enough that I can drive my minibike in and park it with me in my room - still no one enters. Just to mess with the zombies, but log spikes above where your room actually is to mess with them while you're down there waiting for sunrise."
7daystodie,3dj8ky,rezanow,4,Thu Jul 16 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"This worked for me. I found a cave on the day transition from 13->14. I went to the bottom of it. I broke my legs on the way down (Note to self: Don't run down slopes). I heard some strange noises, but I was not hunted and nothing came down to bother me. I didn't find the hoard in the morning though....  Now I am digging a small diagonal hole down close to my base.  Thanks"

They arrive and begin to wander ""looking for trouble"" as the console says. After a while, the AI will direct them to head off to another gathering point where they'll slowly despawn.   I've gotten lucky enough to be able to find them at 6am a short bit away and take them out. I noticed that as I killed them, another would spawn in (as if they were already standing there, but invisible). Maybe it was the limits of how many can be on the screen at once. IDK.   If you can find them, it's an XP goldmine. Same for the Spider Zombies. If they show up during the day, grab your weapons and head to the surface. Let them see you. They'll spawn in a Scout Horde of 20+ zombies will immediately arrive, from all directions to surround you. Watch your back and rake in the XP.   I tend to avoid the Hordes until I am secure enough to face them. You'll slowly see your tactics change from avoiding wasteland cities to actively looking for those damn fatcops. Just gotta survive long enough to get to that point."

Fill underside around the legs with wood log spikes.  Don't forget your first floor has to overhang to prevent spider z's. And the legs should be upgraded at least to second stage wood.   A couple strips of wood log spikes at a distance from your fort will take out slower zombies to lessen the mess created during the z's decomp cycle.   Works for me to take out 7 day hordes.

7daystodie,3dj8ky,Arcanto,6,Fri Jul 17 00:05:00 2015 UTC,Destroy the bottom portion of the stairs leading to the second floor and create some wood frames so that you can easily go up and down.  This will definitely work the first night you're in a house but it's not a good long term option because the zombies will eventually destroy enough of it to make it collapse.

7daystodie,3dj8ky,S1ipperyJim,2,Fri Jul 17 06:04:03 2015 UTC,Its not a good idea to hide from the horde because if you don't kill all the horde it can bug out and not spawn any future 7 day hordes. Kill em all.
7daystodie,3dj8ky,LeeLiLe3,2,Thu Jul 16 22:20:02 2015 UTC,For day 7 hordes you will always get spotted. The run method is to just wait to hear them/see them spawn and then run perpendicular to where they're coming. The horde will only spawn in a line running to your last location.  Hide either very high up or very low down. An apartment complex in the city makes a great place. Just go to the very top floor and the horde will only attack the bottom two layers. They don't run all the way up the stairs.
7daystodie,3dj8ky,rizzlybear,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:14 2015 UTC,"Vertical distance is the only real way to avoid it, though I typically just toss all my stuff into a chest, go outside, and eat the deaths over and over in the early game. I actually stockpile food and water and don't eat or drink (just suicide to refill) until I have a bedrock base going.   I haven't found motivation yet to deviate fro. That early game pattern, stockpile resources like wood iron and stone, as well as food and drink, and explore the map a bunch, once I have leather and forge books I start digging to bedrock to build a base, THEN I start worrying about preservation."

For first few days I usually:   Collect shitloads of logs Find a roof to camp out on make a ledge/lip around the outside of the roof to stop spider zombies make a ladder/latch entrance (surrounded by wood blocks) and remove the bottom part of the ladder to try stop them from coming up. If you don't have a latch then block it with at least 2 high wood frames wood log spikes around the building (keep them repaired and upgraded)   Only problem I've had with this guide is zombies can spawn in the rooms below you somehow (on gas stations, gun stores and pharmacies from experience)"

Second way I tried last night by building a 1x1 woodframe pillar straight up 30 blocks and just sitting there all night. In my play throughs on Navezgane I built a bunker under a lake so the horde would just mill around the water above me until I was ready to come to surface to fight them.

7daystodie,3dj8ky,Feycat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:10:15 2015 UTC,"And the guy asked about 7 day hordes. Not feral zombies. ""Feral hordes"" are what people tend to call the 7 days, but you may notice that neither the OP nor I mentioned ferals. No idea why people felt the need to downvote the fact that you CAN hide in a damn attic from 7 day hordes."
7daystodie,3dj8ky,rezanow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"First off, I didn't downvote you.   Second, watch your console. There are only three types of 'hordes'. Wandering Horde, Night Horde, and Scout Horde.   The Night Horde AI triggers every single night at 00:00. But, unless it's day 7, 14, 21, etc. it spawns 0 zombies.   The Night Horde that does spawn zombies (Day 7, 14, etc) will have hornets, dogs, fatcops, and feral zombies in addition to the regular types. The feral zombies are the ones that can smell you. I haven't had a feral show up on any of my Day 7 Night Hordes, but they always show up from 14 after. Other people have reported them showing up on Day 7. Regardless, if you watch the console, you can see each and every zombie that is spawned in by the AI Director.   So, to address your original comment, you can't stealth a Feral Zombie'd Night Horde unless you are far below or above them. An attic isn't enough, nor is the top of a building. If you're stealthing through them, at relatively ground level, I'm willing to wager you're experiencing a Wandering Horde.  That being said, this is an alpha game and everyone's mileage varies with how they experience the game. Glitches happen to some, but not all. I just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page, using the proper terminology, so we can minimize confusion."

I am wondering if you have a lower setting for daylight if the horde would spawn as it use to, seeing as night time would start before midnight.  Just wondering if anyone has tested this"
7daystodie,3di4lg,FelixMortane,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"I am using 18 hours of daylight, night (running) doesn't start until midnight"
7daystodie,3di4lg,GerbilKor,3,Thu Jul 16 16:21:28 2015 UTC,Same with my server.  What I am wondering is if someone was using less than 18 hours.  So instead of night happening at 00:00 (which is technically now the 7th day) it would happen at ... say 22:00.  Would that difference stop the horde from spawning in the early hours of the 7th day and instead spawn at 22:00 that night?
7daystodie,3di4lg,The_JackelN20ZX10,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:07 2015 UTC,Patch notes say dawn is locked to 6 AM now. So 6 AM - (however many night time hours you have) = dusk.
7daystodie,3di4lg,ironplated,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're on to something, will test in SP."
7daystodie,3di4lg,khurune,2,Thu Jul 16 18:28:42 2015 UTC,I started a thread the other day with the same concern.  I guess it's the new thing for them to appear at 00:00 right after day 6 ends.
7daystodie,3di4lg,khurune,2,Thu Jul 16 14:18:05 2015 UTC,It had me worried for a bit.  I was expecting them a day later and didn't have my defenses set up yet!  They should change the name of the game to 6 Days To Die Then 7 Days Thereafter
7daystodie,3dl0nx,ozdeger,3,Fri Jul 17 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Your prefab idea sounds feasible. If it is a good idea or not is a matter of opinion. They have sort of done this already in concept with the policeman zombie spawning in the city. I think it sounds like a good idea if done right.  The time rush idea won't work. In single player or small server co-op it works, but when you look at the multiplayer server it doesn't. It is quite common to have new players join a hosted server around day 100 or higher. Either you would throw them to the wolves with the time rush boss, or you force them into a pre existing base."
7daystodie,3dl0nx,NMLittle,2,Fri Jul 17 04:20:02 2015 UTC,The end game in every E.A survival game is the same. You get geared and there's nothing to do...

I'll know the the loot spawn, exactly where certain items spawn. Best ways to avoid zeds and shit. The only thing keeping this game interesting is the constant changes, but no matter what the end games the same. So they basically force you to take a different path to get there. I dunno what would make it more interesting the engine seems pretty limited.    Edit: things and some stuff."
7daystodie,3dl0nx,yamirashi,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"I thought that A12 did a decent job of pushing the end game back some, but in some very frustrating ways at times (rng on forge book). You have to be careful when designing a game that you don't make ""artificial barriers"" that while increasing the play time do so in a poor way. I think they are on the right track however, just have to fine tune the feel of things.   I was under the impression no one was reaching end game by day 14 now unless you just got ridiculously lucky."

7daystodie,3dei5k,FlatusGiganticus,4,Thu Jul 16 13:54:30 2015 UTC,It was OP in A11 to fend of the 7th day hordes.    But I also want it back because it's more realistic. Just give zombies the ability to crouch as well.    Players happy they can crouch and players unhappy that their 1 block defense is no longer OP. But at least it'll make sense.
7daystodie,3dei5k,F6Knight,13,Wed Jul 15 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"It wasn't OP because DOGS show up in those 7 day hordes. And crawlers, but the important thing is DOGS. Who can fit through 1-high gaps.   If you're leaving 1-high gaps in your 7 day defense, you're a dead man."

7daystodie,3dei5k,rhaikh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:48:44 2015 UTC,Zombies shouldn't be able to crouch. Not everything in the game needs to be made needlessly hard for the player.
7daystodie,3dei5k,SpectreFire,8,Fri Jul 17 15:28:22 2015 UTC,i think by this point the devs probably realize its something the players want and will likely add back in once they get enough time to work out a few of the uglier implications.
7daystodie,3dei5k,rizzlybear,8,Wed Jul 15 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest complaint is how painful mining, building underground and building bases in general are now that 1 block is gone."

7daystodie,3dei5k,Mythril_Zombie,2,Wed Jul 15 22:30:38 2015 UTC,I like the idea of having to go prone to crawl through a 1 block hole. Make it slower than the crouch speed so Zeds have a chance to catch up as you try to squeeze through.  I would also keep the current stealth crouch.

7daystodie,3dei5k,ozdeger,3,Wed Jul 15 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"True.  Perhaps there could be multiple crawl/climbing animations.  Upwards through a window or similar, and then prone through something on ground level."

7daystodie,3dei5k,zdss,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basic frames should just be placeholders for building. Really any block the player can just pick up should be trivial for a zombie to knock aside since it's got no real attachments or serious mass."

Like I'm watching the crate fall and sometimes it just disappears like your plane is doing.  Also if I kill an animal while it's on a slope and the corpse tumbles for a while it will disappear also.

7daystodie,3dfcgz,smittyjones,12,Thu Jul 16 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"The model looks great!     It would be great if you could start randomizing what the zombies are wearing so they don't end up looking like copy-pasties of themselves once a horde arrives (I assume you will not individually model several dozens of zombies). Personal traits like hair, height and weight would also make great variations."
7daystodie,3dfcgz,SKEW_YOU,11,Wed Jul 15 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"When a horde comes in sometimes I think ""How many of those Hawaiian shirts did they sell in XXXL?""."
7daystodie,3dfcgz,wayfarout,11,Wed Jul 15 22:36:09 2015 UTC,"""How many of those Hawaiian shirts did they sell in XXXL?""   All of them."
7daystodie,3dfcgz,GenerallyObtuse,3,Thu Jul 16 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the same, apply random gen to the zombies as well as the terrain. How many cheerleaders and nurses were there living in Navezgane?"

7daystodie,3dfcgz,gloilin,11,Thu Jul 16 12:49:11 2015 UTC,"It looks good. However, some type of zombie appearance randomizer + proper full motion capture would go a long way towards making encounters more interesting. These individual zombies are fine and all but the game suffers from attack-of-the-clones syndrome. Seeing an endless parade of identical cheerleaders, nurses, and generic fat guys in Hawaiian regalia gets really stale after awhile."
7daystodie,3dfcgz,HP_Strangelove,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"For me, they're plenty dangerous, and that's all that really counts. Not that I wouldn't like to see more variety, but at this stage in development, they're plenty scary.   Except when they're climbing (floating) up ladders. Then they're scary and hilarious."
7daystodie,3dfcgz,SelectaRx,2,Thu Jul 16 08:37:51 2015 UTC,"I also feel that the game is in desperate need of new zombie types, not just new appearances. It definitely gets repetetive seeing the same exact zeds over and over again, but what is worse is the same exact ""types"" over and over again. You got your normal zombies, who vary very little. Your spider zombies, who honestly I never even see anymore. Cops, who barf and will charge you which is great. Dogs, they are basically just zeds that run all the time. Hornets, who really don't pose much threat. A feral zombie who only really matters on day 7 hordes, but I have only seen him once in all my hours of play and that was in a cave. and finally a burning zombie who again you never even see so who cares?   That sounds like a good ammount, but after a couple hours it gets so repetitive and easy. They need to focus on new zombie types, not just new looking zombies. Shit that will make survival more interesting when it comes to dealing with the actual zeds.   Swat zombie, super easy idea. They have armor so they are more difficult and they drop either armor or weapons as a prize.   Track zombie, a zed that is weak but sprints very fast. Good for a surprise every once in a while.   Smoker zombie, was a heavy smoker when alive. Now forms a smoke screen either when killed or on site of survivor. ( Would be very interesting during 7 day hordes)  Ultra-Radiated zombie, a zed that has been in the radiated zones and somehow survived. He shows up infrequently and only later in the game during 7 day hordes. Basically a tank that deals a lot of damage breaking through walls easily.   Radiated Beavers, slow on land, fast in water and deals bonus damage to buildings in water. (so water bases arn't so easy)  Radiated ants/moles, they are found underground so underground bases aren't such a cheat.   If they would just work on some of these guys, the game would be instantly more interesting. In my opinion at least."

7daystodie,3dfcgz,rabidwolf5,8,Wed Jul 15 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the things everyone seems to want for the mid to late portions of the game seem like things that will be added mid to late development. Like NPCs, quests and more zombie bosses etc.   I feel that if they have all the mechanics in place, adding in quests and whatnot will be better implemented. With more features built into the game there will be more they can do with the end game content.   This end game content thing is brought up constantly. I am 100% sure the devs have heard it already and are thinking about it. I think we need to be patient. It doesn't need to happen in A13."

I rarely attack hordes unless I have at least 3 other friends with me and we have lots of cross bow bolts. My group doesn't use guns since that makes to much noise.

7daystodie,3di7yx,djcollyder,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:14 2015 UTC,Hordes generally just keep roaming around. If you're on a server there's a zombie limit. The private server my buddy rents just for us he has a limit of 60 zombies. Now if there's no one on the serve time stops. So I don't know if zombies Despawn or if everything freezes.
7daystodie,3di7yx,MR_Fook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:00 2015 UTC,There must be a lot of hordes then. Any house or place I'm exploring it's extremely common a horde will walk by at least once while I'm looting.

7daystodie,3di7yx,djcollyder,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah there are a lot of hordes. When you're looting, it makes a ton of noise and starts attracting most of the town. I recommend clearing out the area of zombies, nearly the entire town if possible and loot while crouched. Also break both front and doors open and may a window that way you have multiple exits. That's why my buddies and I do."

I took off the stupid fucking safe lock thing they added, nerfed the bears HP, decreased the stun time from 4 seconds to 1 (THE ZOMBIES ATTACK EVERY 2 SECONDS. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU MAKE THE STUN 4 SECONDS FOR?!), and a bunch of other stuff."
7daystodie,3di7yx,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:31 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to info about this file? I want to make a lot of changes especially to the ridiculous amounts of bears in this game.

7daystodie,3di7yx,Devils_-_Advocate,3,Thu Jul 16 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, I'm back and it looks like no one else has stepped in yet, so here we go.   First, download notepad++. You're going to edit all of your xml files in it, and it will make life so much easier.  Second, get to your config files. They're going to be in your 7 Days to Die Folder --> Data --> Config  Holy smokes, look at all those pretty xml files. Mmmm mm! So let's start with your #1 concern, the fucking safes.   Safe Lock Removal  Grab the ""blocks.xml"" file and drag it over to notepad++. Ctrl+F and type in ""secureLoot"" and hit enter. There's going to be a lot of items that have this parameter, but we're only going to change the safes. So keep hitting enter until you find the ""GunSafe"", ""WallSafe"", & ""deskSafe""  Now under where it says:  <property name=""Class"" value=""secureLoot"" />   Change it to say....  <property name=""Class"" value=""Loot"" />   Do this for the ""gunSafe"" & ""secureGunSafe"", as well as all the other safes. Just change it to ""Loot""  Bear Spawn Rate  Grab the ""entitygroups.xml"" file and slide it over to Notepad++. Ctrl+F and find ""AnimalsAll"". I think the default setting looks like this...  <entitygroup name=""AnimalsAll"" >             <entity name=""animalRabbit"" />     <entity name=""animalStag"" />     <entity name=""animalPig"" />     <entity name=""animalBear"" prob=""0.1"" /> </entitygroup>   So you basically just lower the last number there. .05 will cut in half the amount of bears you have now. I have mine set on .08 and there's a fine number of bears for me.  Horde Spawning  Grab the ""spawning.xml"" file and move it over into your editor. Ctrl+F ""horde"". This is where aaaaaaall the horde info is. You can change the ""TotalAlive"" to however many zombies you want, as well as ""TotalPerWave"" if it's too much. Say the wave total is 20 and the total alive is 15. That means you'll have 15 zombies, kill 5, and 5 more will spawn to complete that wave of 20 zombies. So just adjust all the horde stuff as you see fit.  Stun Modification  Go to ""buffs.xml"" and ctrl+F ""stunned"". I changed my duration from ""4"" to ""1"", as in seconds. Zombies attack once every two seconds, so they can EASILY stunlock you. I set the stun duration to 1 second so a horde can still stunlock you, but not a single fucking zombie. Let me know if you have anymore questions"
7daystodie,3di7yx,MR_Fook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"The issue here, is not truly the number. The number would have been totally fine if there were not so many specials. There were too many cops and dogs, and I dont see a way to control that. I have no trouble with a big horde, and a big horde with a couple of cops and dogs in it, thats fine. A big horde that has 12 cops, and 12 dogs, not fine."

Now, we have to hike sometimes for days before we find one and it kind of sucks when you have already built a base and need to move it. It sucks even more if you find one that is inaccesible."

But you bring up some good points.  Details on how to reproduce the bug added to OP.  Improvement suggestion: Make it so that a tree doesn't kill me when it falls, especially when I'm nowhere near it. Seems simple enough.  That seems sufficient to me. You may have paid to be an alpha tester, but I paid for early access to a game. I understand that it's in alpha and am forgiving of bugs. If anyone requests details of my experience I'd share them, but I'm not going to spend my time writing a detailed technical report every time I die unfairly."
7daystodie,3dgkyt,SKEW_YOU,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"Not to bash you at all no offense intended, but you are coming off as a bit entitled.  A. There are other bugs that affect more users than this one in the first place.  B. As a tester or player if you wish for the best outcome and quickest fix for your specific bug, it'd get more attention on their forum under bugs.  C. The steps to repdoduce that you included literally mean nothing. On your specific rug you are saying to just chop a tree and Insta die. If the devs are not experiencing the problem. A very vague tutorial as such is going to mean guess what? Not able to reproduce.  D. Post your specs and maybe just maybe use a free recording program next time and submit the info. Get it upvoted. Come on.  Someone literally explained to you that the feature is not without flaw yet and to expect these kind of things during the alpha phase. They didn't say to not report it. They didn't tell you that you should just deal with it. They simply explained not to get upset and like many others will tell you, to play ea pre release games you will need to do so with the right mindset. That mindset is that you are a tester or a person who has acknowledged they Are getting early access to an unfinished at times completely broken product. There will be times where you may not be able to play the game for weeks if a bug targets specific users and is hard to reproduce. As someone who accepted this and bought into it, you have the option to help this process along by doing your best to report and show bugs or annoyances. Doing so will help you and everyone else see a resolution faster than if you just say simply dying unfair sucks and ryou aren't gonna write a detailed report.  If that is the attitude you will take then you do indeed deserve to die in the game unfairly as many times as possible as you are given the option to help do something about it but instead choose to complain about it on a reddit sub page and with an attitude that stinks to boot.  So please change tune and help them and us help yourself"

Rust for example I love the game but a few months ago after an update trees were invisible for me for a few weeks til a big update came. So after trying a bunch of things thinking it was on my end I was a bit frustrated but I said might as well report it and my specs and hope for the best. Same with this game there have been weeks where I chose not to play until performance was ok on my rig etc. I've lost backpacks restarted worlds etc. I just accept that Im lucky to have these games to test before they're fupl release."

7daystodie,3dgkyt,IpsoKinetikon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"I think there are two main problems with the new tree physics:     After the tree falls, whether wood is obtainable is random. Sometimes it just falls through the ground, or doesn't even appear above ground. It seems to happen more frequently if the tree is on sloped terrain.   The direction the tree falls is random. It usually falls away from the player, but not always. I try to stand at max distance and sprint backwards when the tree starts falling, and that usually works... until it doesn't. The problem is that by the time you can tell the tree is falling your direction, that's about the time you die. I've also had instances where I run backwards while strafing, directly into the path of the tree and die. I think either there should be some indicator which direction the tree falls, or make it much more deterministic. Third option: trees only inflict up to X damage which will never kill the player.      For me, this has been the most frustrating change with A12."
7daystodie,3debk6,PM_your_randomthing,4,Wed Jul 15 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there isn't a setting. It was considered a bug and was fixed like one. I'm not sure if there's some sort of server mod to add the functionality back in, but there isn't a default server setting. It does make quickly raiding houses a little bit more difficult since zombies can just use your entrances, but that's easily fixed with a quickly upgraded door.   I hope the devs reconsider fixing this ""bug"", perhaps make crawlers more common so they can chase you through the holes. Good luck with the zed killing :)"

I haven't looted more than a few tool shops so I can't say for sure that loot sucks, but I've gotten a blue auger part as my best loot from that. I haven't looted any weapon shops since being low level, haven't been able to run across any. I hear that leveled loot is working for loot from zombies, but they never seem to come for me on this MP server. I've spent many boring nights sitting and waiting in the city without any notable zombies.  Fot sure though, gun safes aren't scaling properly."

For fucks sake, the best auger part I have is the poor quality blade in 50 levels... found it today. Not sure about zombies... I got a few better parts from them, but last night when the horde came I looted a feral zombie and got a poor quality sniper rifle. I was actually quite happy, since all we had so far were 2 faulty sniper parts. I don't use it too much and it kills cops in 2 headhots. For us the system is surely broken."

Both types of shotgun, pistol, 44mag, sniper and hunting rifle are all flawless. I've looted at least a dozen completed flawless pistols off cops, and at least half that many flawless shotguns.  Of course I have looted a LOT more lower quality ones as well that were just scrap bait.  I'm NOT saying it isn't buggy as hell, but at least for me it has mostly worked.  I saw the increase in overall quality go up as I leveled.  I actually think the leveled loot system may be to blame for leather working and forge books being so hard for some to get.  You level past the point where the game thinks you need them and they get pushed back to ultra rare crap loot status.  Just a guess, but it makes sense."

You can fill a bucket with water, then travel to where you want a label of  some sort.  Plan out how you would make the letters out of blocks, as in how many blocks in width and height you'd need to draw the letters you want.  Now you dig out a rectangle 1 block deep sized with the height and width you think you need.  Now pour your bucket of water in the hole and keep refilling it from the water you put in and filling in gaps until your hole is filled with water.  Now use the dirt you dug out of it to fill in the blocks that aren't your letters so the water only remains where you wanted a block filled in to spell whatever it is you were writing.

7daystodie,3dgo7k,jellocf,2,Thu Jul 16 03:59:10 2015 UTC,Couple things to consider on random hordes/7 day feral hordes.  *Fresh server: Each time we come into a new A version or blow up the world for whatever reason and start fresh zombies spawning/hordes seem to be stupid for a few days.  Hit a new POI never discovered and BOOM explosion of zombies.  *Server population:  Definitely a huge difference can be seen in a server with sparse population vs one with 20+ regulars on a good chunk of time doing random things.  Having that heat disperesed over a good area seems to help with the zombie population overall rather than having a hate ball of zombies concentrated in one general area :-)  edited:Spelling is hard
7daystodie,3dgo7k,merlinfire,2,Thu Jul 16 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't played on servers in alpha 12 yet, but I did notice that they ended up being incredibly sparse to the point where you could roam around the hub city without an issue. I would often choose servers with a good population, but even with a population less than 10 this seemed to be the case before. I'll have to check it out again, I'm still getting my bearings on this alpha."
7daystodie,3dgo7k,jellocf,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"yes, this was an issue.  a server might have a dozen or more people at peak, and because all the zeds were ""Accounted For"" elsewhere, you could walk around the hub safely.

Proceeded to fight non stop waves with crossbow until barely any bolts left and holed up in the big intact apartment sky rise. Lost track of time and realized when we were making a run for it out of there that in a few mins should be the dog horde.   Made it to a pill store, hardware store, church area holed up fighting dogs. Made enough bolts for a long 2000 m trek back to familiar area but had to run from feral horde northwest instead of northeast. Kid you not out of nowhere it was foggy and once the buildings spawned in and ridiculous zombies realized it was another massive hub type city. Proceeded to hold up in another apartment building and dug under it barely closing off the hole before the zeds busted in. Dug a tunnel to the police station across the road and thought all would be well. Nope.  Ended up fighting our way back to the church and this time tried to set up a make shift forge and stuff on the roof. Needed some wood to cook and make a flat platform so I demolished the would be clock tower part and made a nice platform. At the one spot the wood frame kept breaking so I put a piece under it and then got it to work upgraded the frames and all was well... Until it wasn't all well and I found myself pressing escape to get out of the chest I had just unloaded a crap ton of stuff into while realizing I'm falling. My friend managed to somehow be standing on the corner so she was safe while watching me plummet to the church floor along with all of the roof the whole time spamming medkits and trying to dodge the not ony downward falling debris but the new sliding And ejecting debris physics. Survived that ordeal with no healing left and laughed at the loss of the newly collected dismantled gun parts I was going to upgrAde mine with being gone forever as the chest was gone too.   Then got pissed and decided we needed to find somewhere else close to hopefully get some healing and I thought it impossible to come across another hub city but guess what... I guess Shia lebouff was correct in saying nothing is impossible. So we out on our try hard gloves and the cycle continued.  Tl;dr  Lucky but unlucky cluster of 3 hub cities within short distance of each other, non stop Darryl style zombie action, implementation of Ricktstorship, no survivors lost, inspired by m. Night moldy sham a ton looting from cop Zambies and a story of true friendship through the struggles of surviving a teenage drama starring sad Effron and Celine Dion."
7daystodie,3de751,HP_Strangelove,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:35:22 2015 UTC,"I really like the world how it is now. Lots of desert makes getting wood more challenging until you find a forest area, which is a lot less available then before, and it works. You can't make a huge inpenetrable fortress by day 3 any more. Iron is more challanging to find now as well. I think the town / city generation is PERFECT. My only beef with the world generation at this point is simply I would like more veriation of the POIs. Every cabin is basically 1 of 2 different prefabs and it is kind of lame since any one who spent 30 minutes researching and an hour or two experimenting could make and add a prefab in to the game. I don't see why the developers haven't added more variation, the community certainly has. (Actually maybe that's why)..."

We had to run around cracking boulders for the iron fragments for a while though.   At least you know which cabins have a safe and forge in them when you see them."

7daystodie,3df9c4,rstallard91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"I had the same set up with a light shaft. I wasn't TOO hidden, was on a full pvp server, and my base survived until the wipe. With the increased terrain variation, it should be a little easier to hide that shaft.  What I did was made it too much of a pain in the butt to try to break in the shaft. I lined the shaft with layers of metal bars and barbed wire. If you're out in the middle of nowhere, you should be somewhat safe. It's a risk you may need to take to grow your own food.  If someone does find your light shaft, just try to have your base as close to bedrock as you can. Make them waste the gas to auger down there. A lot of people won't bother wasting the gas. If you want a team mate on your pvp server, I'd be down with that. PM me your server and I'd be glad to join.  Source: fellow mole-man :)"

You still need to find the ammo, the books to make em, and of course the ore. If you've not messed around with your files, you will find them in caves, mainly as form of stalic tights and stalic mites. You can however edit your Biome xml to edit ores from Caves to Noise, and this will make it feel the way it was before A11 in regards to farming ores."
7daystodie,3ddnn3,khurune,3,Wed Jul 15 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have seen about the xml change.  I really would like to stick closely to the developer's choices.  Although, I did carebear our game up a tad and changed the loot respawn timer to like 3 days and turned the loot up 25% I believe.  I kind of want to change it back to default.  The 7 day hordes get pretty intense though when you only have a few shots before the gun breaks or you run out of ammo.  On our 21 day horde we got overran a bit so I did circles around the base popping beers with 5-6 ferals behind me.  Come daytime we slowly picked them off, resorting to cutting trees to land over them and repeatedly leading them through spikes, haha."

But yes, coal can be found on the surface, though you still won't be able to make bullets. I suggest to keep moving from where you are if there are no mines around.

7daystodie,3decdh,tolos,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:27 2015 UTC,F6Knight - this is the standard distance fight technique. This works for everything with every distance based weapon.
7daystodie,3decdh,Ulfgar88,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's standard fight technique, but being able to outrun bears by sprinting backwards is silly. You never even run out of stamina because you only have to sprint in short bursts to regain distance.    Bears are slower than a sprinting survivor.  &bnsp;  Additionally, you can do it quite safely by sprinting backwards 40-50 meters to an area you know is clear. (maybe you just cleared it or quickly checked before sprinting backwards in that direction) Then avoid the bear, go past him and sprint backwards from where you just came.    It's not hard to have good situational awareness when dealing with bears. It kinda goes against the panic feeling of: ""holy crap, an angry bear is chasing me, I'm wearing cloth armor and got a crappy bow"". Oh wait, I'll just backpedal and put arrows in his head until he drops. Yaay, easy meat and hide!"

I know they do a lot of damage (and rightfully so) but I feel like a bear should be harder to kill and be able to run just as fast (if not faster) than us as survivors... unless we're all actually Kenyan survivors... in which case we should be able to run 10x faster/farther than anything else in the game. I know its a game, and (for the most part) I really do think a lot of the ""unrealistic"" features in the game make it more fun and actually more emursuve just because it makes it more fun.

7daystodie,3daato,wolfiechica,3,Tue Jul 14 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"I kind of like that certain areas of prefabs will sometimes collapse.  I feel like I would expect certain parts of these post apocalyptic buildings to collapse under my weight every now and then.  But I also agree that dying randomly because of it sucks.  Maybe there should just be a little more warning.  Like it'll start making creaking/straining sounds when you walk over the block in question, and the block begins taking steady damage as long as you stand on it.  Also, if you step off the block in time, it won't automatically fall down.  This way, exploring decrepid buildings doesn't feel too safe, but also isn't randomly frustrating."

It would feel really odd for me to just enter some kind of alternate reality where I can see how much weight my house holds up. If anything, it would make more sense for me to have some kind of carpentry skill for it. But I would prefer that you have to inspect a block by hand and not just magically get the results handed to you. I guess the color coding would work better in freeplay mode."

7daystodie,3daato,Jlead25,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:48:48 2015 UTC,Yeah. I forget about LCB's not being in SP. I was just thinking that it would somehow have to be limited to just your structures so you couldn't just go around enabling the mode and looking at other players' bases. Maybe they could add a workbench that is only in SP or limited to the LCB-affected blocks in MP.
7daystodie,3daato,Solaratov,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:18 2015 UTC,They could always implement this kind of the way rust does where you look at a block and it shows # stability but seeing as it is voxel blocks I would vote your suggestion as preferred method so as to be able to identifyultiple at once.

Check, right at midnight, and see what it's saying there. See if the console isn't reporting it at all, or if it's reporting but spawning 0. That will help narrow down the severity of the issue."

Maybe some people don't consider that game breaking, but for me at least it really ruins the fun when you have 3-5 identical buildings all within spitting distance of each other."
7daystodie,3dbydx,wolfiechica,6,Wed Jul 15 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Mediocre.  Added a lot of good stuff, ruined a lot of good stuff.  The minibike is great, the new physics are pretty cool, and I especially like the new world gen.  I'm just not happy with the direction they're going with schematics, gating everything behind random generation.  It makes the early game a chore, and the endgame is still as shallow as ever other than the minibike making exploration easier.  Also the mob spawning needs a lot of work and the dog hordes are retarded hard because their pathing is all screwed up and they still have hitbox issues.  Overall a solid 'meh'."
7daystodie,3dbydx,savingbass,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:17:02 2015 UTC,"See for me, endgame is far more entertaining to go exploring looking for new places to rustle up some good schematics. I love actually having something to do besides make more concrete, lol."
7daystodie,3dbydx,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"IMO they completely ruined the bow, it has no entity damage nor do the arrows including the fire. Also, I used to smash open windows to basements and crouch/crawl inside but they ruined that too. So far this is the only update where I have major complaints and that is only because they took out the features that I used most"
7daystodie,3dbydx,savingbass,3,Wed Jul 15 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the bow and arrows still display zero entity damage when you hover over them, but I can confirm that they definitely work, they fixed/tweaked them in 12.1 (to the point where some people have said they now find them op). A headshot with a stone arrow still kills most zombies on nomad setting, haven't played with fire arrows yet though."
7daystodie,3dbydx,wolfiechica,0,Wed Jul 15 08:38:29 2015 UTC,"I hope so, they are my primary weapon choice"
7daystodie,3dbydx,savingbass,2,Wed Jul 15 09:46:45 2015 UTC,"Arrows and bows have never reflected entity damage. At least in any Alpha of recent recollection.  I assume their actual damage is probably computed on the server side, probably some combination of arrow type and bow quality."
7daystodie,3dbydx,wolfiechica,0,Wed Jul 15 13:13:36 2015 UTC,"When my brother and I were attacked by a crawler we put 10 arrows in it and it still came at us, so that is why I am complaining"
7daystodie,3dbydx,TheDmac,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:51 2015 UTC,In Alpha 12.0 this was the case with STONE arrows. They have readjusted the damage of these with hotfixes.

7daystodie,3darus,scorcher24,3,Tue Jul 14 22:01:36 2015 UTC,Dumb Question: Why?
7daystodie,3darus,Kyouka127,4,Wed Jul 15 12:16:59 2015 UTC,It gives more incentive not to die. Some players will will use death as a means to return home. Of course this can also be mitigated with bag drop. I remember a Minecraft server(Treepunch) that used this feature alongside being pvp orientated. It adds to the fun of killing other players.
7daystodie,3darus,Solaratov,3,Wed Jul 15 12:33:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah as an admin, the Suicide Express effect in 7D and Minecraft was always annoying because it wasn't what I wanted for my servers.  Bag drop felt too harsh and my players practically rioted over it, toolbelt drop barely mitigates the problem because people just need to free up enough bag space for their toolbelt stuff and then Suicide Express anyway.  I like the idea of lengthening respawn times/temp ban."
7daystodie,3darus,F6Knight,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"Would it not be much better to mod the respawn timer then instead of using a temporary ban? That way, people who die have a proper countdown and can get a drink, short break, whatever while they wait (or log off and do something else)  Or mod the wellness loss for dying to discourage the Suicide Express (but this might be too punishing for unvoluntary deaths and griefing in pvp)"
7daystodie,3darus,Solaratov,2,Wed Jul 15 16:31:37 2015 UTC,The problem we ran into is people running with minimum wellness on a long term basis. Further reducing the minimum would lead to them being completely useless at some point.  The other idea we had was trying to enact a level/experience penalty upon death or even lose a randomly known schematic but this 'respawn timer' seemed quick and easy so see how it plays out and maybe expand on it later.
7daystodie,3darus,WeezulDK,2,Wed Jul 15 17:42:33 2015 UTC,Would it not be much better to mod the respawn timer   It would be if it were a line in the serverconfig. If there's a simple way to mod the respawn time I haven't heard of it.
7daystodie,3dbbac,ozdeger,2,Tue Jul 14 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine suggests a passive method, where you become better at a given skill when it is practiced.   Say you craft an axe, it sucks.  You use said axe on a few trees, and you now know why it sucks.  Naturally, your next axe should be a bit better.  But your first bow should still suck.  This isn't a perfect system, since in reality you have some skills that are adaptable from task to task or item to item. But that can be covered by a generic crafting factor, which is also weighed in the mix.  So to get a high quality axe, you need to be an experienced axe maker, and an experienced maker in general. When this master axe maker tries his hand at bows, he does okay from the start, but not perfectly.  I imagine these attributes being non linear as they improve, so initial gains would be a bit more significant.  This would also extend well to weapon skills, especially accuracy with a given weapon.  Something similar could be done for crafting times of blocks by type, and physical attributes which are exercised (stamina, run speed, jump height etc) Perhaps just one physical condition attribute, I can imagine people jumping all the time now... Don't want to encourage odd behavior to gain stats.  Thoughts?"

Maybe they'll take bits and pieces from the many ideas floating around reddit and the forums."

7daystodie,3dbbac,beer_nachos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate, damage reduction could be gained through knowing how to roll with the hits.  Damage increase could be gained through learning where the zed are most vulnerable.  Crafting with less resources just means you are more efficient and making less mistakes and wasting less resources when you make stuff.  I agree that immunity isn't realistic, but other than that... well, I'm not sure how less chance to bleed against animals is justifiable but crafting with less materials, etc, isn't.  That said, I love the idea of a skill tree and levels meaning something more than a slightly better chance to not craft shitty shit tools."

7daystodie,3d8oc2,Games4Kickz,3,Tue Jul 14 13:27:38 2015 UTC,"Sadly that is the actual problem. Turning timers off in the settings causes a crafting bug that when you craft an item you already have in your inventory you get the message ""Inventory is Full"" (or similar)  The only to fix that is to change the game settings to use the normal craft timer which for people that don't play with timers is a problem, i.e: Majority of YouTubers :)  The work around to this is to use normal craft timers but reduce the craft times to as close to 0 as possible.

7daystodie,3d8sle,Guyonbench,4,Tue Jul 14 11:53:48 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/7P3L90V.jpg I find that nobody ever really crafts or uses the Barbed Club, most likely because of the materials required to make it. Four sticks and Four forged iron. Those four forged iron are made from just one iron ingot sure, but if you’re at the point that your smelting iron down into ingots, your probably not going to have any trouble making four ingots and then making yourself the best melee weapon (still preferred by a lot of people over the sledge hammer). This leaves the Barbed Club as a forgotten middle stepping stone that’s never needed. So I thought that this new recipe of the same four sticks and the same four iron scraps, plus two metal strips would be thematic, cost effective, and difficulty appropriate.  As long as the damage is balanced somewhere between the iron reinforced club and the spiked club, the idea of it is that you essentially make an iron reinforced club then have to choose to break down a short iron pipe to improve it further or not. A shot iron pipe you may not have, or be wanting to save for other things. I’m just trying to breath a little life into melee weapons awkward teenage years known as the Barbed Club. Let me know what you think, and here to hoping the Pimps see that this weapon could use a little love."
7daystodie,3d8sle,Blaktoe,3,Tue Jul 14 11:54:09 2015 UTC,I don't think any change is needed. We have one club (Metal Reinforced Club) that you can make with nothing more than some initial scavenging. One club (Barbed Club) gated behind the forge book. The last club (Spiked Club) gated behind it's own book. It seems like a logical progression and perfectly in line with other changes being made by the devs.
7daystodie,3d8sle,F6Knight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:14:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. And Sledgehammer is gated behind it's own book too if I'm not mistaken, but requires a forge to make the ingots. (spiked club doesn't). So it's got some linear progression to it, but you might get lucky and get the forge book and sledgehammer book before the spiked club book. It's all RNG but ok as it is."

7daystodie,3d8sle,F6Knight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:38 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree. I still carry a half decent melee weapon with me for those zombies who always move their heads sideways/up and down when they move. I think it's the nude walkers and the burn victims. Those are imho much easier to headshot with a melee weapon.

(a small sniper tower with log spikes around it and a tunnel to enter it)  i found that idea so amazing that i built my own murder tower but that murder tower had at the top some blocks at each side, probably so that mutants cant climb up or so. the first 2 sides, each with 3 side blocks worked well, but then on side 3 they just droped on the ground all the time. somehow it worked after a while.  i think the problem was that the first of the 3 blocks was anchored to the tower and maybe the next 2 blocks were not anchored to the tower but to the first side block or so."

If I take a 5x5 wood wall with a door, add a second layer, then add a wood roof, it works fine.  Add a hatch and ladder in one corner, then go up and build a second floor.  Same design but no door.  5x5 wall, 5x5 wall, and a wood roof.  The second floor wood roof collapses while being built.  really weird since this same design has worked in the past many times."

7daystodie,3d6vdc,rhaikh,2,Tue Jul 14 07:15:25 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, Hotfixes should only address priority 1 and 2 bug fixes addressing bugs such as ""killer tree saplings'"" and similar priority bugs.  In my humble opinion hotfixes should never introduce new features, books, items or behaviour which are not fixing a game breaking feature. That has way to high of a risk to introduce game breaking issues and is also not what hotfixes are intended for.  New features and changes, including more bug fixes should be left for the major patches in my humble opinion.  Lots of humbleness there :)"

As far as the patch notes go, still no fixes to minibikes dissapearing,  no fix for car loot not respawning, more books and from reading comments things are even more broken.

It seemed pointless that they even had books since you could get them all so easily.  In A12 you can get almost every book by fully looting 1 small town (rare ones like sniper rifle may take some luck). You will get at least 2 full sets of books by fully looting a city. It takes 2 days to fully loot a large city by yourself. If you're having problems finding books then you're probably only looking in bookshelves.  Cities and towns are everywhere in random gen now. On default settings I have 4 within a half day run from the hub city. The default loot respawn was changed to 30 days, and they added a minibike. The game is now more about exploring and less about camping out and re-looting the same town over and over again. There is tons and tons of loot out there, you just have to work for it.  If you want everything on day 1 then just cheat. Some of us enjoy a game that doesn't hold your hand and spoon feed you everything."
7daystodie,3d6vdc,gl1tch,9,Tue Jul 14 05:54:01 2015 UTC,"Still too much RNG for my tastes.

I now have schematics for most weapons, as well as leather tanning, and the minibike book (twice) and pretty much every other schematic/book, but I'm still stuck with the bow and wooden club because I cannot find the damn forge book.

It has an economy system built in, where you can gain money from killing zombies or simply playing the game. So I've been adding schematics for a cost.   It's something like kill 100 zombies to afford a forge book, and it goes from there by varying difficulty. I figure I can kill 100 zombies in the first day or two, and if you haven't found your book by then, then you can buy it. It's helping to balance out the game some"

If you found the crossbow recipe but can't find the leather book then you could still have a chance to find some leather strips as random loot and make your crossbow after all.

7daystodie,3d6vdc,Arm-the-homeless,11,Tue Jul 14 07:38:31 2015 UTC,No need to get agressive about it. Part of survival in a post apocalyptic world is salvaging/scrapping and making due with what you find.    The fact that a bit too many items are locked behind books/recipes right now is a bit annoying and will need some tweaking (or people will mod their xml files themselves) but it's still alpha. Skill trees in the future might change this concept (maybe some items will unlock through skills or professions).    Give TFP some time to tweak things. I'm sure they appreciate our feedback as long as it's given in a calm and constructive manner.
7daystodie,3d6vdc,F6Knight,2,Tue Jul 14 08:00:53 2015 UTC,"Very much this. Nothing here is really a dealbreaker for me, especially  knowing the game is in alpha and receives frequent updates. Things are bound to get wonky moving forward, and the game is still enjoyable to me. With so much here done right, this early in the development stage, and as much movement as there has been on this game, development-wise, I feel like this is one of the only alpha games I've gotten my moneys worth for, and I actively enjoy participating in the community and discussions and such. Getting angry about development aspects at this point is a little ridiculous, the game is being worked on and there's tons of awesome stuff to do. Sure, I've got complaints, sure, but the amount of fun I have playing fairly well negates them."

Last night I was headshotting horde zombies running towards my base from -just- inside the distance I'd pop them with the sniper rifle.  It's iron-expensive (an ingot is what, 12 nails?), but damn if it's not a good time."

Obviously, this is easier with quality weapons than without, but with enough beer/alcohol to run for several hours it's pretty easy.  The first horde is pretty wimpy, so a bow (and stamina buffs) is sufficient. By the time the second arrives, you ought to have a gun or two (and a crossbow) such that you're set from there. If not, a high quality bow and good arrows will likely be enough."

7daystodie,3d7mks,Goodgulf,3,Tue Jul 14 06:49:05 2015 UTC,You can turn them into scrap metal. Scrap metal stacks and you can melt that down (in the forge). Really do some items have more metal value than their scrap value? WTF TFP?!
7daystodie,3d7mks,MCRoadkill,7,Tue Jul 14 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and they round down to the nearest .5 when scrapped.  For example a pistol barrel put straight into a forge is worth .8 iron (IIRC), but only turns into 1 scrap worth .5 iron. Casino tokens and candy cans are worth .3 each, but take 2 of them to scrap to .5 iron.  Iron isn't as bad, as it's easy to get, the real killer is Brass, which does the same thing.  It's way better to turn brass items straight into bullet casings instead of scrap brass.  I guess it's a cost of using less inventory space having 1 pile of scrap instead of lots of low count items if you are on a looting run.  An easy way to see how much each item is worth is to put it into a forge with an ingot mold and no fuel, anything worth .5 or a multiple of .5 can be scrapped, scrap anything else and you are losing metal."
7daystodie,3d7mks,Goodgulf,3,Tue Jul 14 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, thnx...I didn't know that. I'll try that out!  Well I think they increased the loot chance of brass, because I've been getting way more than in the A11."
7daystodie,3d7mks,MCRoadkill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:11:05 2015 UTC,Not sure(!) but I think when you scrap them it's the total that is valued down and not each single item. So putting multiple different items into your crafting window should not lose you too much iron and saves you the hazzle in the forge.

No other game I own does this, and I have nearly 100 Steam games.   The game is still in alpha, and probably won't be optimised until its ready for release.

Its hard to say why it isnt running well but if youve followed pc gaming as long as i have you know that sometimes you have to disable crossfire and sli or setup a customized sli/crossfire game profile to fix issues.

7daystodie,3d4gtj,ShoeboxDiarrhea,14,Mon Jul 13 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"I have said this in countless other threads now. If your on random gen. It is very very easy to just go into your game files. So ore spawns in more then just caves.  1) Find the \data\config\biomes.xml file.  2) Search (ctrl+f I think) for the word ""caves""  3) Change where is says rwgGenerationType=""caves"" To something like rwgGenerationType=""All"" or rwgGenerationType=""Noise"".  ""All"" meaning ore will spawn anywhere and everywhere.   ""Noise"" meaning it will spawn based on your own location. Also known as what it was in A9/A10 or before caves were introduced.  Make sure you change all instances to All or Noise for each individual biome and ore. This game has a very very good comment code written in by the devs to help changing these codes pretty easy. But just incase make sure you back up all files before changing them just in case you do mess it up and break the game."

7daystodie,3d4gtj,Kuldiin,6,Wed Jul 15 15:18:05 2015 UTC,I shouldn't have to do that you should be able to dig test holes and hit ore just like irl. Looking for caves is boring...  Edit: this isn't about lack of caves. It is that I want to make my own shaft mines...
7daystodie,3d4gtj,superkuh,2,Mon Jul 13 19:01:47 2015 UTC,It should be the default. My problem with it not being default is that very few (I can find none) popular PVP servers have it enabled.
7daystodie,3d4gtj,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Having to search for caves motivates you to get out and explore.  If you could just dig anywhere and find all the ore you need, you can just turtle in your fort with a massive garden, and you'd never need to leave.  That said, it's pretty reasonable that there be small pockets of ore spread around the world, with caves holding larger veins.  But, you would have to dig for a long time to find a random pocket of ore.  Reasonable price to pay?  Maybe."
7daystodie,3d4gtj,dointhestankyleg,4,Mon Jul 13 19:54:22 2015 UTC,So you are assuming because I prefer to shaft mine that I don't get out and explore? The ore should be spread out underneath the map different biomes can have different ore. Claiming that caves make you get out and explore is just bs. I can't count how many self sustainable bases I've found in caves.

7daystodie,3d4gtj,FlatusGiganticus,2,Mon Jul 13 13:48:58 2015 UTC,If you're using random gen you might have hit an ore vein attached to a cave. Otherwise it sounds like you're in navezgane.

7daystodie,3d4gtj,bufu619,5,Mon Jul 13 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, nor am I having problems. I'm just saying that in Navezgane the ore is random. In Random gen it is specifically restricted to caves. So, your example doesn't work for anyone playing random, unfortunately."

They dug into the side of a hill, put two wooden doors up along the main hallway in, made the inside two blocks tall and stacked chests inside. They had a ton of stuff in the chests.

You have a book for arrows and one for the bow and for the explosive arrow. Then you also got a book with all this information and you learn almost all semantic from a single a from a bit more rare book.  Just like in real life no book contains the same information and many books have about the same information."
7daystodie,3d7ynl,liiliiliiliiliilii,3,Tue Jul 14 15:49:01 2015 UTC,I agree it needs to be simplified but lowering it to 6 books is a little too much I think

You still need; Leather tanning the leather armor books iron armor books steel work steel armor books a  book for all the molds mini bike book forge ahead book  there's 9 more already... I'll add them in to the original post.... I apologies I thought that would be obvious...
7daystodie,3d7ynl,MCRoadkill,3,Tue Jul 14 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"Why not make it like a MMO game, that you can craft better stuff through progress. I mean they already have a lvl and XP system why not have a crafting skill bar.  I'm taking example from Guild Wars 2 crafting system with the only difference your not locking into only two crafting trait/skills.  Let's say we get the ""Leather Tanning"" book, wich enables you to process leather. You can start of by turning hide into leather and leather in to strips, some basic leather pants and stuff. Each time you craft something from that subgroup your XP in that craft trait increases what let's you craft better items over time. So that way you can't craft the best item when you find the book. Make ppl work for their stuff.  The same could go for wood, weapons, etc, etc. Maybe even a clothing/tailoring skill book.  Sure making plant fiber pants is cool, but IRL I wouldn't know where to begin. And since we're on the subject I would like to be able to craft denim pants, we have cotton, why can't we craft denim pants.  Colour your clothes? yeah why not, you could start out with white denim pants from cotton and colour them with in world found materials/dyes. Charcoal for black pants, berries or blood for red pants etc.  But that raises the question to we need a workbench in this game to craft higher lvl items. Make a two stage crafting system, you can craft arrows etc. from you backpack, but the more intricate items require a workbench to craft."

7daystodie,3d7ynl,Togfox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:16:46 2015 UTC,"e same could go for wood, weapons, etc, etc. Maybe even a clothing/tailoring skill book. Sure making plan   I agree the end game needs work, but not at the cost of illogical roadblocks. I really don't need a book to tell me how to smash nails through a baseball bat, especially since one doesn't exist in real life. Once I know how to make a 9mm bullet, I'm pretty sure making a 10mm isn't all that different that i'd need a whole other book to learn how to do it. Pretty sure if i know how to make an ax made from stick and iron, I could probably know how to make a hammer. It would be logical that if I knew how to take apart and build a rifle, it's probably not to far fetch for me to take apart / put together a hand gun. If I had all the parts in front of me, and enough time, I probably wouldn't even need the book to be honest. But you know what isn't logical... I wouldn't have a damn clue how to turn moldy bread in to antibiotics with nitrate and a beaker... not a damn clue. Yeah, I'd definitely need a book for that. Not only would I need a book to show me how to build a ""good"" splint, but probably also how to set the bone etc.   I understand it's a video game and you have to suspend disbelief in the name of balance and fun, but frustrating randomness and bad luck is frustrating.  AT THE VERY LEAST, once you read a book you should be able to put the book back or keep the contents or pass the knowledge on to someone else. Then you could make ALL books super rare which would change the dynamic of the game quite a bit."
7daystodie,3d7ynl,kings_hound,2,Wed Jul 15 01:37:16 2015 UTC,Ppl need to realise that every new book that is introduced makes your chances of getting FORGE AHEAD a little bit slimmer.

7daystodie,3d3mcg,ExplodingJesus,2,Mon Jul 13 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"To the first part, unfortunately the zombies really don't do anything to damage bases anymore. They only try to reach you and will avoid obstacles in the way (rather than trying to break through them) This is most noticeable when you have a door they can break down. They will go around everything just to break that down. But say you use frames to get into your base and then take them away, the zombies will just kinda sit around the walls from whatever side they came.  Not sure if this is intended but its quite lame.  For the second part, I have noticed they are harder to get around. Even placing a frame on top and standing on that frame will sometimes give me damage. I've gone with not using doors because of this (either you spike next to it and take damage or you don't and your door gets destroyed) and just using frames to get into my base. Unfortunately, I don't know of such an xml file."

My friend and I dug deep into a mountain to create a base.  We littered the front and sides of the base with all sorts of spikes.  We thought we had done a sufficient job of protecting ourselves until the Z's broke in through the back on Day 7 and obliterated us. They dug through a ton of rock as opposed to taking out the couple rows of spikes at our front door.

I'm paranoid about my GPU temps right now so I always run MSI Afterburner and check it every now and then and I've noticed that the times my frame is skipping my CPU (note: not GPU) is maxing out at 100%.  I often see frames of half of what I know I can get (from 60 to 27) when this is happening.  It appears to have almost nothing to do with my graphics settings, I can see this on maxed out or low-balled settings similarly.  This happens mostly in towns, and I believe it's AI pathfinding.  It's the worst when I'm inside homes and they're trying to get in, but can be bad as they begin spawning in as well.  I do believe this is a CPU bottleneck issue.  Check your CPU load when this is happening if you're able and see if it's the same deal with you- I have an inferior processor by far (so it might not be your actual issue).

When you make simple L's of things like in your screenshot, it makes perfect sense.   When you make a whole building, it's like it picks the weakest possible connection for any block or something."
7daystodie,3d1d30,Portlandian1,2,Mon Jul 13 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"Here's an example using wood.  http://i.imgur.com/U9EoC3d.png  Trussing around the outer edge, and one truss down the center under it. Since they're not connected to the side of the truss, it only supports the weight of those above it. Make sense? The game only takes into account what is connected to the side, and everything above is counted as weight, unless it too is connected to a side somewhere.   http://i.imgur.com/DMNQ6sD.png  Note the missing leg. Zombies attacked while I was building. It stood.   http://i.imgur.com/z8zxWpt.png Each flat level only takes into account the concrete block in the corner supporting it. The Max load of the floor is divided by each side block.   I can build things like this. http://i.imgur.com/ZPhSvnx.jpg  I'd have to see what you were trying to build and recreate it to see where it's failing. Got any screenshots?"

7daystodie,3d1d30,CasperHarkin,2,Mon Jul 13 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"In my experiences building in Alpha 12, the structural integrity seems different but not wildly so, it is the game not seeming to apply the test promptly or evenly. So sometimes things will hang or half fall, the other half will fall eventually, you just might need a block update or some time.   I have a large 10x10 tower I am building,  started replacing the walls of a prefab with reinforced concrete and steel, just replacing one block at a time, after completing the bottom 5 layers, the roof and upstairs all collapsed. Was crazy, I thought I had lost all my chests, luckily wood debris where just covering them. What I think happened, is while I was working away, the game asked for checks on the integrity but wasn’t timely, so by the time the checks were ready, I had heaps of blocks replaced that need to be checked."

If their voltage is under 12v for extended periods of time they do degrade, and the lower they are, the quicker it happens.   The lead plates develop a coating that prevents the chemical reaction needed for charging. It is reversible, but takes forever and wastes electricity in the process. If really isn't a reasonable option. Oops, off topic.   But a battery that reaches a level incapable of running electronics is usually unharmed as long as it does not stay at that level for extended periods of time.

7daystodie,3cz2ia,I_EAT_THOUGHTS,7,Sun Jul 12 02:11:44 2015 UTC,"Now you really are forced to go and explore for parts or caves to get the things you need. We just spent the night trapped in a gunsafe room whilst zombies tried to dig into us whilst at a town trying to get antibiotics for my buddy who had dog aids. We dug under and out of the house in the morning in time to find the pharmacy.   I must admit I'd prefer to be able to mine and find other ores, even if it was less common as in A11.6. We dug a long tunnel to a water source and it took us maybe 4 days of digging but we only ever saw rock. I felt we should have seen a bit more, kinda like on minecraft when you come across a few bits of iron, coal etc.  Find a cave though and you will be sorted, keep digging behind the gravel and you find loads of ores.  Also.. Day 80+... we finally found the forge book! :D celebrates"
7daystodie,3cz2ia,croppergib,3,Sun Jul 12 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't having gear - it's not hard to get enough ingots from scavenging to get fully kitted out in iron armor and the best quality tools you can make for your level.  It's not difficult to scavenge enough scrap to keep a steady supply of metal strips for repairing your stuff.  These are not major concerns, even now.  However, a single stack of rebar frames requires ~60ish iron ingots.  A single stack of anything is hardly enough to build a complete structure.  64 blocks makes for a rather cramped shack, at best.  Getting the things you need isn't an issue, not even with the current system.  It's the creative game play that is severely hampered by the current state of things.  I would understand hiding lead ore and potassium nitrate in caves - that stuff is used for ammo creation.  Scarce ammo is perfectly understandable and forces the player to come up with more methods for dealing with zombies.  Iron however - 5 stacks of ingots can evaporate in the blink of an eye trying to build with any material other than wood, whereas you only need a little bit of it to make all of the gear you need and keep it maintained."

The building aspect of this game is by far it's best feature, yet to properly build up a very reasonable base takes so much time and useless grind. Minecraft isn't this tedious, even Rust isn't this tedious, and their structure building isn't nearly as good as 7DaystoDie."

7daystodie,3cz2ia,jack_danger,0,Sun Jul 12 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for this suggestion.  I wasn't aware that worldgen parameters were that accessible.  I'll have to start over on a new world to do this, but it makes me feel a little bit better.  Now if we can only get our lakes and rivers back...  I guess the only issue will be eventually finding a good pvp server where resources are configured this way and bases can't be destroyed while I'm logged off.  I love PVP, but I don't like PV-Logged Out.  Not sure why so many of these survival games insist on player-versus-loggedout/at work/asleep mechanics, but I guess it's a genre convention at this point albeit a stupid one."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Tendoncs,10,Sun Jul 12 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"Well, this particular game was not actually made for or intended to be pvp."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Tendoncs,2,Sun Jul 12 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"If what you say is true, then it's surprising how amazingly good the PVP was regardless.  The gritty stealth/stalking mechanics made for a truly awesome experience.  I loved literally everything about it except for the offline base-destruction being on by default.  Not sure how things are now, with the resources and quality mechanics.  I could see high-quality armor reducing lethality too much, or high-quality weapons providing too much of an advantage - before, you could grab a hammer and get the drop on a well equipped player and kill them without taking damage, if you played smart."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Tendoncs,2,Sun Jul 12 04:34:16 2015 UTC,the pvp in this game is bad. Once someone gets a good+ sniper rifle then copies it over and over. they hides them in chests around. They mode their game files and can see you from super far away because they changed your player model. Or just the good old put a flare above your head like a supply drop. Or God/fly/invis modes.    it sucked ruined a good game for me =(  I hate hackers they ruin all games sooner or later.
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Rock1monkey,2,Sun Jul 12 09:41:39 2015 UTC,"I clocked 300 hours on a private PVP server during Alpha 9 and Alpha 10.  Since it was private random hackers weren't an issue.  It was an absolute blast aside for when people who couldn't hold their own in a fight would just wait for you to log off to go and wreck your base.  Then again all of that was before quality levels on equipment was a thing.  I had suspicions that might wreck pvp balance, and that might be another topic worth discussing.  I don't think you can base an objective evaluation of the quality of PVP in a game off of the existence and actions of hackers.  They aren't playing the game as it was intended to begin with."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Jeradox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:02:06 2015 UTC,Good points. I agree with most. Did pvp used to have more then one hit? the PVP I played in Alpha 11 it was whoever shot first won and that was the person who had every setting maxed and a sniper rifle.   What I wish the game had was a range of times that base raiding was allowed. I have been thinking about modding this. So you build up each week then Sat and Sunday at noon to 8pm people can raid the base claim block areas.
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Jeradox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"As far as one-hit KOs went, it would depend.  A headshot with a rifle was likely to kill.  Pistols would take a multitude of hits.  A shotgun at medium range would be two or three.  At close range and well-aimed, one.  Snipers would only 1hKO on headshots as long as the target was wearing iron.  A sledgehammer was a 1-h-KO.  More than taking shots/shooting, though, the PVP was about sound and awareness.  Being aware that every action you take - eating, drinking, walking, running, opening your pack, looking at your map, switching your weapon, looting a container, putting something on your toolbelt, using a bandage - all of it results in audio cues that can be heard by other players.  So the point was not to be heard, and not to be seen.  This led to a degree of competitive strategy I've not seen in a shooter in a really, REALLY long time.  It was downright exhilirating - for example, being hunted by three players, and leading them into a snow biome and timing your movement so the sound of your footsteps is exactly the same as the plodding gait of a zombie, and ambushing them one-by-one as they spread out following the sounds of zombies walking thinking they're you.  You hear one open their pack or switch out a weapon and you know they're close - and you hide in a small depression, popping out as they walk past to nail them with a sledgehammer.  Freaking amazing shit."

I haven't played since alpha 9 and so far I'm liking the older game more than this new iteration. Oh well, its alpha so I hope they figure out it was a bad decision and put it back in at some point."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,FromTheDuDe,2,Sun Jul 12 06:39:52 2015 UTC,"What you are wanting is something that's not really possible while we still have a system where what you want to build with trivializes the game content.  Well, outside of creative mode that is.  While you are correct that you can easily gather enough scrap to make basic gear, having easy access to enough resources to build anything you can dream of with little to no effort, also means enough resources to just keep trying again until all gear is perfect.  It also means being able to build anything you can dream of which is a problem in and of itself for a survival game that is supposed to have some challenge to it.  The example you give is the hardest and most durable material in the game, so it's obvious you aren't wanting to be creative so much as impregnable.  That is still possible, it's just going to require more work now, and that's a good thing if you are actually trying to play the game.  The sooner and easier you can have the best items and the best building materials, the sooner there is nothing else to work toward and you get bored.  There is a creative mode to satisfy your more elaborate creative urges, and there is the regular game where you can play a fun game and still be a little creative, just within the limitations of a system that doesn't ruin the game.  I'm not saying the balance is anywhere even CLOSE to perfect yet, just pointing out that the massive builds you are talking about make the rest of the content in the game pretty pointless when they are done, and use the same materials in much higher quantities than gear does so enabling one breaks the other.  It's going to take a lot of changes before you can have what you are asking for and we still have any sort of challenge in the game.  I think one problem is that there even is a ""best"" material in the game for building a base.   We need new zombie types that chew concrete like tissue paper but have problems with wood, and others that have similar strengths/weaknesses with other materials so that no base design is ever zombie proof, and all materials have their uses."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,IncoherentOrange,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"What you are wanting is something that's not really possible while we still have a system where what you want to build with trivializes the game content.    Iron cannot be used to make guns in Alpha 12, if I'm not mistaken.  If I am, it would be simple enough to make molding gun parts impossible and force them to be scavenged.  Lead isn't used in building. Put it exclusively in caves.  Coal is a valuable fuel and without potassium it cannot be made into gunpowder.  Put potassium exclusively in caves.  Voila.  ""Not really possible,"" - sure, if you spend zero time thinking about mechanics, nothing is possible in design.   The example you give is the hardest and most durable material in the game, so it's obvious you aren't wanting to be creative so much as impregnable.   Tungsten.   Creative mode   I want to play a game.  If I wanted to play digital legos, 7days is clearly an inferior option.  I bought 7days for a survival sandbox experience with an emphasis on creative construction and possibilities when compared to things like DayZ, Rust, et cetera.  This is how the game is marketed.   just pointing out that the massive builds you are talking about make the rest of the content in the game pretty pointless when they are done   You're never going to design a progressive single player experience where the player cannot ""render the content pointless"" at some point in their play.  Restricting play styles is a mentally deficient way of addressing the problem.   We need new zombie types that chew concrete like tissue paper but have problems with wood, and others that have similar strengths/weaknesses with other materials so that no base design is ever zombie proof, and all materials have their uses.   Those exist, they're called ""Other players""  - I can pull the same trick as you dismissively telling me to go ""creative"" and I can say ""Go PVP if want to whine about things being too easy eventually"".  But you don't want to play that way, do you?  And if you expect to have a choice about how you play a sandbox game, that's a reasonable expectation as the whole purpose of a sandbox is to let the player make decisions about how they approach it and the challenges it presents.  You can choose to play this game as a cooperative experience or a singleplayer experience, and within those two subsets you have a wide variety of options as to your play-style - and other people will play the game very differently from the way you choose to, just within those two subsets of play modalities.  In a PVP experience, it gets even more interesting - the potential options players have for achieving their goals and progressing widen significantly, as do the variety and sources of potential challenges.  However, it's perfectly reasonable for someone to not want to play a sandbox that way.  That's what makes a sandbox so great.  Sandbox games provide lots of different kinds of fun to lots of different kinds of people.  That's why, in a sandbox game, eliminating entire playstyles is harmful to the strengths of sandbox gameplay as a design motif.  Period.  You want mechanics that widen possibilities and allow players new options.  A very robust sandbox eventually gives rise to emergent gameplay and players coming up with possibilities even the devs hadn't considered.  7days is moving further away from that with subsequent releases, as opposed to closer.    Putting iron in the ground does not break the game.  It breaks a play style.  Period.  It's trivially simple to make easy access to iron completely balanced.  Building large structures out of non-wood materials was never easy before - now it's absurdly grindy to the point of being unfeasible."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Devils_-_Advocate,3,Sun Jul 12 22:46:06 2015 UTC,"Iron can't be used to make guns, but as soon as you can use iron it is used for tools, armors, and melee weapons which is why I point out that there is a need to balance between enough access to build and so much that you can easily make 100 trash items to get the perfect craft as high as you are capable of getting.  The leveled crafting system is pointless if there are so many resources easily obtained that you can just mindlessly click craft until you get the perfect item.    There is also the fact that every other system has been moving away from being able to just race to the top within days, building is supposed to work the same way.  It's not intended that you can use the strongest materials from the beginning, and it shouldn't be.  At least not in the game portion of it.  The XML files let you change this if you so desire, they let you trivialize the game in a lot of ways if that's what is fun for you.  I even mentioned that I don't think the balance has yet been found, a lot more needs to be implemented and fixed before that's really possible, but what you want makes the rest of the game pointless.  If it's much easier to build with the strongest material (that can make anything but keystones) in the game then you have to purposefully gimp yourself to have any fun doing anything but building.  I don't think the system is perfect yet, but I do think that being able to jump right to the strongest possible builds is a horrible idea for the game, that is what creative mode is for.  If the game has a chance at being fun in the long term there needs to be a reason to spend time building a wood fort, because at that point in the game you will need housing for a long enough time to make it worth the effort.  If you can stick to a hole in the ground long enough to get setup in a reinforced concrete bunker styled to look like Castle Grayskull in the first game week then nobody but people wanting to make stuff will play for very long.  You keep mentioning how eliminating playstyles is harmful, and yet that's what you are asking for.  Actually you seem to want to eliminate play entirely.  If the materials are common and everyone else is massively fortified really quickly then doing anything else becomes stupid in the extreme, especially if you are playing pvp.  It becomes all about the building and nothing else.  The mechanics already exist for you to have exactly what you want, without even resorting to creative mode (which for some reason seems to upset you to even have mentioned).  Servers can be setup the way you want, and you can make your single player game (or any multiplayers you host) work exactly the way you asked for.  For some reason after being informed of that though, you still want to eliminate the possiblity for others to play their way, with an actual game that requires progression and doesn't fast forward to the end."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,Devils_-_Advocate,4,Mon Jul 13 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"The game changes dramatically with every alpha version, for the better.  It takes a little bit of effort to change your playstyle to adapt, but it seems like you were more willing to pull out hyperbole and threaten to ragequit than to put in a modest amount of reevaluation.  I think your conclusion is correct, you should come back when the dust settles."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,snowdogJJJ,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:29:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your delightful contribution to the topic.  Am I correct in interpreting your post to mean that you think creative and building playstyles don't have a place in 7days?  Everyone has to play the game the way you think they should, right?  No one should have an option to do anything differently, then?  Restricting the player's options and eliminating playstyles is a good thing?  I can neither agree with your implied premise, nor your dismissive and patronizing tone."
7daystodie,3cz2ia,mooseeve,3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"The creative/building playstyle is totally awesome, and more importantly quite feasible, if you actually put some effort into figuring out what you need to do under the changed conditions.  It's just that you weren't willing to do that, but you were willing to come here and complain and act like the game is ruined.   So yes, my tone is dismissive, because even if we all help you I feel like you will come back in A13 complaining that something isn't the way it was in A12 and therefore the devs have lost their senses."

I play on a high zombie count server, if I'm the only person on by the time one zombie has decomposed to the point I can destroy the gore another 5 or 6 have spawned near by and are wondering towards me. Basically I just ignore gore blocks now until the next day where the damage has already been done.  I like gore blocks, I like that they are hard to get rid off, but making you stand over each body for an in game hour is sort of pointless. Zombie gore should behave like animal gore, once you loot it it turns to gore."
7daystodie,3cz90c,droznig,7,Sun Jul 12 08:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they nerfed this pretty hard rather than fixing the actual problem, the awkward goreblocks.   So what they did is make it so the blocks add up slower than they used to and now they also break slower than they used to. But also you need to be closer to destroy them in melee.   I don't have a better way, I'm just agreeing that the goreblocks suck now and the devs are not fixing the problem.   All in all it's far from a game breaker but it's irritating."

It monitors players looking for evidence of hacking/griefing, it will arrest for pvp and players can send new players to timeout if they are causing problems. We have villages managed by the bot, players can be mayor and add/remove village members. Players can set up base protection without admin help. It is like a forcefield which the bot manages completely.  We also have many features nobody else has since we can code them ourselves. We are often full and have a great community. The bot is also on 2 other servers if being full is a problem for you."
7daystodie,3cxr9y,JakeStant,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:16:52 2015 UTC,What is the economy like. Can you buy items from Other players with in game money?
7daystodie,3cxr9y,Smegzor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:26:20 2015 UTC,"We created a currency (zennies).  The players have run with that and trade stuff for zennies amongst themselves.  We also have an ingame shop where they can buy items with zennies and gamble in a daily lottery.  There are also pvp zones in which kills are awarded zennies although we changed that today so now only the first kill is awarded zennies.  After that players use their own zennies to place a bounty on another player.  We are adding quests controlled by NPC's which can award players with items, zennies or a teleport.  They could also spawn zombies."

We have signs, NPCs coming soon, quests coming soon, party mode coming soon, treasure hunts, player ownership of large tracts of land, teleportation to POIs, base and a central tradepost we call the Library."

7daystodie,3cxr9y,gl1tch,0,Sat Jul 11 20:31:44 2015 UTC,I want features that require an active team of admins to enforce but I want little to no admin intervention.
7daystodie,3cxr9y,elt,2,Sat Jul 11 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. No admin intervention is needed for any of this except for cases of hacking.  Settlements are created and run by players.  With the ability to imprison other players, a moderate-sized initial group of players should be able to fend off all griefers.  If griefing/raiding becomes a non-viable career choice, people will begin to trade/build/etc. for fun.  This leads to a natural, emergent economy.  How do we know this can all be done? /r/Civcraft, /r/CivilizatonExperiment, and several others have already done it in Minecraft. It would require a few custom mods.   One would require a means of imprisoning people. The popular Minecraft mod that does this is PrisonPearl (previously PrisonBed). PrisonBed would allow players to bound another player to a bed, which would usually be located in a handmade jail. New players could be raiders, but it'd take a long time to make a good enough jail be effective.  The second mod would simply be an expensive crafting recipe for the reinforcement blocks. Or a cheap recipe for reinforcement blocks, but they reinforce only a small area.  Having admins be our dear leader in their own sandboxes is a really bad solution to what a few mods (or future game features) could very easily fix."
7daystodie,3cxr9y,elt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"So you're looking for a server that would require mods that haven't been written for this game yet?

I never cook at night now.  i just crouch and craft in the middle of the upstairs and all hordes have ignored me except the day 7 horde.  So for what i was going to use as a temp base i may just be beefing it up and staying put.  i lucked out with 3 caves and a water source nearby.

7daystodie,3cvz8m,gunduzyavuzer,6,Sat Jul 11 06:03:57 2015 UTC,"I would love to see this kind of stuff. My one pet peeve with playing SP/MP is that it feels like you're the center of the universe. At least when playing on a server there are other people and other buildings.   Other possible additions could be hearing gunshots and screams from inside a building as you approach, and when you go inside, there's a corpse and a handful of zombies. That way TFP wouldn't have to actually animate the 'scene'."
7daystodie,3cvz8m,procrastinatorgrrl,2,Sat Jul 11 09:10:00 2015 UTC,"As someone said in the other thread, the problem with this is in PvP servers it would be kind of shit."

7daystodie,3cvsb4,rezanow,2,Sat Jul 11 17:16:02 2015 UTC,Interesting. The visibility of the mines must rely on your graphics setting. We saw them clear as day on our server.
7daystodie,3cvsb4,F6Knight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:08:39 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the surface they are generated on as well.

IIRC they break down into 2 scrap metal, which isn't worth bothering with considering they used to break down into 8.   I've never bothered breaking fridges, but I may just to get rid of the annoying, never ending sound that can be heard from the other side of town.  Also I wouldn't recommend taking med kits out with you whilst looting. Chances are you're not going to lose THAT much health and they're best saved for more desperate times IMO. Best to use the first aid bandages instead, if you've been lucky enough to find aloe."
7daystodie,3cvfmy,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"This is the very time you actually need med kits - when out in the world.

7daystodie,3cvfmy,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, actually. I'm just in the habit of saving them for horde days, for example, because I've based in a desert so I have plenty of first aid bandages that I use instead."
7daystodie,3cvfmy,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"I feel you can go out with less. Pain killers seem kind of pointless now with the good food / health regen buff.   Also if you drink your yellow drink followed by some stew, you are set for a long time. If you really need to eat /drink again before coming back there is always plenty of both to be found.  I've stopped taking the pick. The block damage just doesn't seem worth bringing it along for an extra spot. The fire axe does the trick.  Melee is a rough sell in this game. Crossbow (cross bow / shotgun when in harder areas) is a much better mid game setup.  Liked the tip about brass. Going to keep my eyes open for that."
7daystodie,3cvfmy,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"Did they change the block damage to metal objects then? Last i checked a purple axe takes 2 hits and a pick takes 1. I've not really had much of a chance to play since A12 hit, so sorry if i am a little behind on the tips :D   I do agree with not taking food / water if you eat / drink at home and the fact you find more while looting, but my point was if you specifically go for just the scrap, you won't be looting cupboards and other stuff."
7daystodie,3cvfmy,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:40:40 2015 UTC,Ya the axe goes through rock and metal at about the same speed with my tools (green) as the axe.
7daystodie,3cvfmy,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"All the below times are with a flawless pickaxe so bear in mind that sub par picks will take a considerably longer time.    The big difference is that i said Flawless pickaxe. A flawless fireaxe will take 2 swings to destroy a fridge, a flawless pickaxe will take just 1 swing, which is twice as efficient."
7daystodie,3cvfmy,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"I'll still bring the axe. Not worth the spot. Maybe if for lockboxes, but they seem to be full of trash anyhow.  After getting used to having to swing 20-60 times at something, 1 or 2 isn't a big deal."
7daystodie,3cvfmy,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"When you're short on iron, which you would be if you're needing this guide, then wasting metal strips on repairing the extra durability you have used on the extra swings is a waste.

7daystodie,3cvu21,TribalDancer,2,Sat Jul 11 08:53:36 2015 UTC,"Your first response was kind of dickish, and probably the only reason your second comment is also being downvoted.   By day 8, there is really no reason you shouldn't at least have moved on to poor quality tools.  Surviving until day 8 pretty well guarantees that you can craft poor quality items.  (""Your level"" X 10) ±50.   If you have been killing/crafting to survive, make new tools. If they suck, toss them and try again. Stone axe materials are not exactly rare. Same goes for bows and wooden clubs.   Using sub 100ilvl items when you have the ability to craft 150ilvl is intentionally playing at a reduced efficiency.  Don't settle for the average or below. (Your crafting average will be just ""your level"" X 10).  Try to get a good chunk of that random +50."

The big hospital is a really sad one for us--it's huge, even has a big attached parking garage, but the lag makes it impossible to play, so we always have to skirt around it.  This time around we have found some prefabs that normally don't create lag problems have begun to. For instance, the rural fancy house, with the stone wall and planted garden was so laggy we had to leave or die when a horde came on us and we couldn't move easily. It's a shame, I love that house!  Anyway, be aware.  Does anyone know, is there a way to simply identify and remove the troublesome prefabs?  Edited to add: lag aside, we still install it every time because it really adds so much fun to the game for us, as we are big explorers and scavengers.

This has also been talked about often, and some people are even suggesting you be immobile while reloading. In any case, the current reload looks a little too effortless for the damage it does."
7daystodie,3cw7tc,cellfoneguy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:13:41 2015 UTC,I guess i could see your point but its pretty much an over glorified bolt action.  Why not atleast expand its ammo types? And introduce a mid-late game spring to extend the range of the bolts?   The hunting rifle either needs a buff or the crossbow needs another slight nerf to make the hunting rifle a more valid option.
7daystodie,3cw7tc,rezanow,2,Sat Jul 11 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"I believe someone mentioned that the crossbow will be updated like the wooden bow was this time around - quality, ammo types. Just hasn't happened yet."
7daystodie,3cw7tc,drazgul,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:15:34 2015 UTC,How does the damage compare to bow w/ iron arrows?
7daystodie,3cw7tc,cellfoneguy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"Xbows have no quality modifier, while bows do. A bow with iron arrows has a very very wide damage range. In general, Xbow is better in most regards until (i think) you get blue/purp bows."
7daystodie,3cw7tc,drazgul,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm up to yellow craft quality now and the xbow did seem better. Even took a bear down in just 4 shots, which is nice."

7daystodie,3cve3z,rezanow,2,Sun Jul 12 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"I think now it is always midnight, it's just when the morning starts that changes? At least that is what we experienced when we played with it. We changed our lettings to 20 on our server, so now midnight still is when the music plays and they start running, but ""day"" sounds and walking return at 4am.   However, it doesn't change when the sun goes down or comes up, or how fast night passes. So it's scary dark still at these times, and we still have 4 in game hours to sit on our hands if we don't have specific tasks to perform (like right now, we have no forge, so we don't have a lot to do yet).   I preferred the night as percentage better, so we could have the night/dark hours simply pass faster if we wanted, and have all the daylight to scavenge and build.  Especially now that it is sometimes prohibitively dark even during the day on my computer with the new weather effects and no gamma adjustment available, I need the precious daylight hours to get stuff done."

7daystodie,3cs25k,dointhestankyleg,2,Fri Jul 10 12:55:03 2015 UTC,"You only go back to inventory when you scrap something, and that I think is related to the craft timers.

7daystodie,3cs25k,littlemokey,3,Fri Jul 10 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"That means something else is being crafted or scrapped.  Even if the previous scrapping finished, it doesn't pull the output until the next time you enter the crafting menu, so it still has it in there when you try to command it from the right click menu."
7daystodie,3cs25k,ConfessionsAway,2,Fri Jul 10 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"The very best part is that if you have scrap metal/cloth/etc. on you but a full inventory you can now pick up scrap-able stuff by just scrapping it straight from the container and putting it in your already existing stack.  You don't have to keep that extra space to put it in your inventory to THEN turn into scrap.    So much better this way.  My one nitpick would be that if you're unable to craft/scrap because you're already doing so I think the scrap thing should show up with an hourglass or something on it (currently the option to scrap just doesn't show up).  This is just polish stuff for later, though- not like a big deal."

Unless you pick up and right click to put one down at a time.   Also I miss right clicking and being able to divide the stack in half right away. Faster when you need to share gear with a buddy and zombies are near. It would be great if they added something to turn OFF right click function.

Otherwise you could just lower their health to a more manageable point.  I changed a lot of item and entity values to speed the game up as I found it too grindy as well.

7daystodie,3cp26h,r34nimated,16,Thu Jul 9 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"so through bits and pieces of dev posts on the forums, it seems like their issue with this is that the zombies cannot follow you through them reliably.. any reimplementation of this feature will likely include allowing the zombies to do it as well. or at least implement it in such a way that it doesn't buy you time around the lootable containers in the structure while zombies are bashing at walls trying to get to you.  which is a shame, because the reason they took the feature out, is the same reason that everyone wants it back. so even if it comes back, it's likely nobody will be really happy with it.  i guess they want you to have either successfully snuck into the house (unfollowed) OR to have killed all the zombies in the immediate area.  Maybe they will change their mind, or maybe they will come up with a way to bring it back without cheesing the zombie AI (let the zombies crouch and crawl through the 1x1's too)."
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,30,Thu Jul 9 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"It seems sensible that some zombies, like crawlers and spiders, could pass through 1x1 openings, and other zombies could not reliably pass through.  I dunno, it just doesn't seem that traditionally zombies with their rotting brains have been known for their powers of deduction.  Simply blocking players from crouching through a 1x1 (meter? yard?) opening is about as ham-fisted and inelegant a solution as they could devise.  It's not that it's ""not realistic,"" but it breaks a certain logic of the in-game world. It certainly breaks my sense of immersion to (arbitrarily) not be able to pass through an opening that, by every objective measure, I should be able to pass through.    This fix would be like making guns cease firing when aimed at a zombie clipping through a wall --- it's heavy handed.    If the Pimps want to ""fix"" this ""issue"" to remove the slight advantage this might afford players, then fix the issue with the flair and creativity demonstrated throughout the rest of the game.  It's not the player's fault that zombies cannot yet navigate a 1x1 hole, so why punish the players and break the game's logic."

7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,3,Fri Jul 10 17:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know that they actually support it as a design decision for release. Keep in mind it's alpha still, you would expect them to be trying out ideas, watching what we do with them, get some feedback, tweak stuff.  And who knows, maybe they plan to have zombies be able to crouch and get through them in 1.0 too, maybe they will ditch the idea completely and decide that it's fine for players to do it but not zombies.  It could be on a list for some distant sprint to allow zombies to crouch and the ban on players moving through 1x1's is a temp duct tape fix to play with balance.  All we know for sure is that the debs claimed moving through 1x1's was not intended, considered a bug, and fixed. And the reasoning they gave was that they felt it gave players too much advantage while looting cities.  It IS really easy to abuse it and make yourself quite a bit safer in carefully crafted situations  That said. I don't have a word in favor or against it personally. I just see the posts saying ""they broke it!"" And felt as a good citizen I should pass along that they feel differently about it.  Game design is both highly iterative, and highly subjective. Minds change constantly amongst dev groups and you don't code finished stuff one piece at a time. You make something basic and simple, you play with it, you chat about it, you tweak it, you play with it some more, it's a process.  Let them know how you feel about it and then don't get too upset over it, it will likely change five more times before beta even."

If you also had the proper tools, you could then raid every house in the area without poking your head outside once. So, we'll have to see. I think the stealth in the game is the key to making the players have a disadvantage for going around smashing doors and windows open. It would be cool if they developed a stealth based tool--such as a crowbar--to open doors and whatnot without attracting zeds. Or, for example, if you break a window the zeds in a specific area will swarm to that particular spot because breaking a window makes more noise. Something like that would add a risk to breaking a window and hopping inside the home."

Right now I feel like legolas, taking out a hoard of baddies from all directions while standing out in open ground. I would really like to see the combat get to the point where you REALLY don't want to do that, instead using base defenses as a primary tool of combat, and relying HEAVILY on stealth to move around in city areas.  To that effect, it would be cool if whacking at buildings, walls, windows, steel doors, caused MAJOR zombie attention and along with that came a stealth breaching ability. Maybe using a crowbar, while stealthed, would allow a quiet way into a building at the cost of time, and being vulnerable and unable to look around/behind you while doing it.   I also think you shouldn't KNOW you lost stealth if you haven't seen or heard a zed around you yet but that's me being silly."

7daystodie,3cp26h,ferith-,6,Thu Jul 9 17:38:14 2015 UTC,I think they've just been working more on the environment and mechanics that are on the aggressive front instead of the stealth side.

It had little to do with them being able to follow and more about it being the easiest thing to break to get in.
7daystodie,3cp26h,lifelesslies,3,Thu Jul 9 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"or maybe make it so when you do pass through a small opening you walk through it very slow, like half the speed of when u are crawling. which would make sense as your are being very careful not to lose your balance."

7daystodie,3cp26h,lifelesslies,4,Thu Jul 9 20:23:46 2015 UTC,well I used to use it when i was sneaking. I think the right approach would be that you can only do it if you aren't being hunted.
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,2,Thu Jul 9 17:51:21 2015 UTC,Interesting idea. Effect: If you enter a house by a 1x1 hole and find a zombie you cannot leave the house through that same hole again - So it is up to you if you want to use that feature. I would love to see that threating me.
7daystodie,3cp26h,adam123453,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:43:47 2015 UTC,yup. You are essentially risking being trapped inside with zombies.
7daystodie,3cp26h,zdss,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:20 2015 UTC,I kinda like that idea..
7daystodie,3cp26h,adam123453,28,Fri Jul 10 00:45:44 2015 UTC,This right here. Removing this option was pointless and damaging to the immersion and overall gameplay of 7DTD.
7daystodie,3cp26h,zdss,19,Thu Jul 9 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"Yup. If there is a horde of blood thirsty jerks chasing me IRL, try and stop me from crawling through a broken window to buy some time"
7daystodie,3cp26h,adam123453,-6,Thu Jul 9 17:13:00 2015 UTC,The point is that the bloodthirsty jerks should be able to do it too.  No zombie movie allows safety to come in the form of ducking at doorways.
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,14,Thu Jul 9 20:35:23 2015 UTC,That's because movies are stupid. Zombies are dumb and don't have spatial awareness. A good escape from zombies is to get somewhere they can't fit so they have to break down whatever's in front of them.
7daystodie,3cp26h,Muriako,-11,Thu Jul 9 20:58:59 2015 UTC,So what you're talking about is some alternate form of zombie fiction separate from everything that's been portrayed in media before now based on the idea that it requires intelligence in order to do advanced maneuvers such as crawling?  Zombies are exactly people sized.  There aren't places people can fit but zombies cannot.
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,6,Fri Jul 10 00:30:22 2015 UTC,"No, what I'm talking about is a clearly established form of zombie fiction corroborated not only by many well-known media forms such as the Resident Evil series, in addition to common sense and a basic understanding of human intelligence. Strawmanning will get you nowhere."
7daystodie,3cp26h,GenerallyObtuse,8,Fri Jul 10 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't have a problem with them being able to follow me in. I just wish they hadn't removed the mechanic, with no statement as to whether it will be re-implemented.   This is not game-breaking as is, it's just like to see it come back. Even if it's server optional."
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:41:08 2015 UTC,Best comment of the thread right here..
7daystodie,3cp26h,Guyonbench,9,Fri Jul 10 01:00:25 2015 UTC,"This has been a highly debated point since the release of A12.  The reason behind its removal has basically been that because it was not an intended feature it didn't have any risks or consequences associated with it and TFP felt that was imbalanced.  Personally I don't think even the unintended implementation was game breaking, it undeniably gave us an advantage and made getting into a POI quicker but realistically not much more so than we can still do now.  For me it just was not imbalanced enough to justify removing an ability that was obviously extremely fitting to the game.    That being said, it's not the fact that it was removed that really bothers me.  I can enjoy the game all the same without it, my real problem with it being removed is that they haven't said they will re-implement it properly in the future.  The only official word I've seen on this has been that maybe it could end up being added, but that they considered adding in their Kickstarter goals and what not more important.  I'd be fine with it taking a year to get that ability back, I just want a guarantee that it will be back, the game simply will not be complete without it and I think treating it as a potential side feature is a mistake."
7daystodie,3cp26h,rezanow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. It wasn't all that game breaking in the example of city looting.  Abusing it for base building however was clearly not intended. Being able to build a fort with no door or hatch, that you could freely enter and exit, but that a zombie still had to break down to get through was definitely NOT intended. Between a few layers of walls like this, using the 45degree rotated base (so the corners pointed in cardinal  directions), and building tall enough, you could almost trivialize base defense.  But again. It's not that much more broken than just walking up completely and using frames to scale the wall.  I'm sure at some point it will come up the priority list and get talked about and maybe something will change. Maybe it won't.   I sure enjoyed it though."
7daystodie,3cp26h,iamandrewhall,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"Abusing it for base building however was clearly not intended. Being able to build a fort with no door or hatch, that you could freely enter and exit, but that a zombie still had to break down to get through was definitely NOT intended.   You still can.  You can dig a 1-block hole through stone and crouch-walk your way in.  If you make the entrance to your base in a stone cliff-face, this layer of defense can be quite deep.  You can place a wood frame in front of it to stop crawlers/dogs from just wandering in.  When it's time to hole up for the night you can pop a stone block or two into place and dig your way out in the morning.  I don't consider this any more cheap than the fact that zombies can hear me open my backpack when I'm separated by 10 layers of concrete from them."
7daystodie,3cp26h,TribalDancer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"I was more referring to building a funnel using the single block opening (or useless doors) to herd them through pointless obstacles. Pay no attention to spikes along the walls, you must get to that hole that will lead to me.. I promise it will..."
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,4,Fri Jul 10 22:33:08 2015 UTC,Should bring it back as a skill when skill trees get implemented. Id put a point into being able to move through a 1x1 space when crouched.
7daystodie,3cp26h,TribalDancer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:47:38 2015 UTC,I hate that I like this idea so much. It would have to be a L2 option or it wouldn't matter much.
7daystodie,3cp26h,chrisver,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:26:34 2015 UTC,I like this a lot!  Great idea!
7daystodie,3cp26h,DisgorgeX,3,Fri Jul 10 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Here is a scenario where being able to crawl through a tight spot helped.   I discovered my first town, and was thoroughly excited. I had 40 arrows on me, and a stone axe. Let's do this...  So I clear out about twenty zeds from around the first house. All is going smoothly. I break down the door and my axe is down to about 60% health. I put a couple wood frames in the door to keep out the dead. I start searching, but realize most the other doors are locked. I realize I need another axe, but am out of supplies. I turn to go outside and there are around 5-7 zombies trying to bust in. I reactively turn to the nearest locked door and realize that the lower half is already busted! I crouch and crawl through just as the bust down my crappy blockade. This buys me just enough time to find a reinforced club in a desk and clear them out. TL;DR Being able to crawl through a one-block space saved my skin as I got trapped in a house."
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,2,Thu Jul 9 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get the reasoning for ""fixing"" this, unless whatever gave us that functionality was breaking something else (which I haven't heard that it was). It makes sense to me that I would break the smallest opening I could to gain entrance to a room to try and deter zombies from following me. If they want to get to me, they can bash through the wall as well as they ever could, so it's not like all danger is gone!"
7daystodie,3cp26h,rizzlybear,5,Thu Jul 9 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"We as players think about the game in terms of pure gameplay.  I imagine the convo at pimps shop went more along the lines of ""here is all the workload implications of fixing the things we consider unbalanced about this. Do we want to spend the man hours now? Or just make it impossible again and come back and talk about it later?""  I bet we have much stronger opinions on its impact to game balance than they do at this point. I would expect their decision is an attempt to manage feature creep more than anything else."

7daystodie,3cp26h,PM_your_randomthing,2,Fri Jul 10 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"I have a counter proposal that I probably haven't realised all the unforeseen consequences of but bear with me as it relates to breaking and entering and the current need for a two block high opening to pass through. The first breach is necessarily hard since I have only one surface to attack with my tool - the front. Once I have that one block hole, I can now attack two surfaces of all the surrounding blocks and so it should require less effort to breach the second block. Just like IRL, once you remove the first brick from the middle of a wall, the rest follow more easily. Thoughts?"
7daystodie,3cp26h,Blaktoe,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:16 2015 UTC,I used to use this feature to crawl in basement windows. Now I can't. :(
7daystodie,3cp26h,Ender94,0,Fri Jul 10 00:44:37 2015 UTC,"This is another great point, many prefabs with basements have pretty good loot (gunsafes for example). You can bypass plenty of danger that way. Certainly not intended."
7daystodie,3cp26h,ravenze,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:04:31 2015 UTC,"I think this gets somewhat balanced out by the fact that you are dropping into a basement blind. That means there is a non-zero chance that you dropping in behind a steel reinforced door, or other barrier. Essentially keeping you stuck for a period of time that is dependent upon your tool quality.  Banging away on the door in these situations has lured in zombies on more than occasion. So as soon as get out of the room in question, I walk into a room that is full of zombies, and depending on weapon quality or my ability to skirt around them, I live or die  TLDR; just because you can get into a room, didn't mean you can get out. I'd like to see them play with that mechanic in future builds."
7daystodie,3cp26h,kwirky88,2,Fri Jul 10 14:57:13 2015 UTC,i think you can safely assume people carry frames with them and can get back out the way they came. if not.. shame on them for not carrying some frames with them.
7daystodie,3cp26h,ravenze,2,Fri Jul 10 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, i really miss it and dont see why they took it out.  I liked the feeling of breaking the bottom block and sneaking in as if i would if I was really entered some abandoned house.   Anddddddd it's gone."
7daystodie,3cp26h,drNovikov,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:33 2015 UTC,"I want this back in a bad way. I've been wondering how I can modify my game to put it back in. I used this in every building, also was nice that i didn't have to use as much tool wear."

7daystodie,3cqiam,SirNanigans,3,Thu Jul 9 23:32:46 2015 UTC,YES. So yes. I own a compound bow and have taken down a deer in one shot. My cousin has taken down bear in 1. Yes its a compound bow but some bows can do as much damage. It bothers me that it takes sometimes 3 head shots to take a zombie down.
7daystodie,3cqiam,littlemokey,3,Fri Jul 10 01:19:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the support. It's very enlightening to get into archery and especially bow making in real life. Lots of people only have experience with bows in games which magically kill opponents after so many hits.   Bows and arrows are a lot more convenient when landing a critical blow. They are silent, light weight, can be made in the field if necessary, and still drop the target with one well placed shot.   On the other hand, arrows are significantly less effective outside of those kill zones. They shred less tissue, especially without a broad tip, and don't have nearly as much shock value or stopping power.   Hopefully we will see at least some movement toward unique archery combat instead of just bow-shaped guns."
7daystodie,3cqiam,littlemokey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"It would be even better if you could make the bow and then learn how to make a compound bow,  or even upgrade the normal one.   My cousins and I have made bows for fun and they worked close up. Like 20ft LOL and for just a pointed stick it worked actually fairly well.   Later on we used more stronger wood and even heated the wood to make it more solid etc.   But back to game mechanics yes,  I wish they could make the bow more damaging. I've only shot a cross bow once but from my experience my bow constantly out shot my uncles cross bow."
7daystodie,3cqiam,Akaishen,2,Fri Jul 10 05:31:26 2015 UTC,I really like the suggestions here. It would be great to see them added to the game. Thanks for taking the time to write your thoughts out! I too hope the developers give it a read. :)
7daystodie,3cqiam,FuZhongwen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"My pleasure. I was inspired buy all of the bow and arrow balance complaints.

I had to leave me two cents (more like tree fiddy) and request a more intuitive way to balance bows with guns."
7daystodie,3cqiam,Fetti4MyYeti,2,Fri Jul 10 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"I am a bowyer as well and I'd love to play just one game that gets bows right. I would also like to actually feel like I'm making a bow in a game, not just clicking and pooping out a perfectly functioning bow. I know there's a line between realism and fun in a crafting game, but making a bow is fucking hard and that should be reflected somehow in the game. I want to feel some sense of satisfaction in a game when I make a bow. I want to feel like that bow is mine, I put effort into making it, and I have a connection to it.   I don't know how this can be done in a game, but that's why I'm not a game designer. I'm a bowyer. I make bows. Its all I do. When I'm not making a bow in real life, I want to make one in a game. Make this happen."

Midpoint of the branching path is a deep cave (1300N, 200W) leading to a single large chamber indicated by the home icon. This is my bolthole with a chest of emergency supplies, if my home is ever overrun I can retreat (or respawn) down there. There are some iron, lead and potassium nitrate deposits. I've been mining surface deposits for coal.   There are four tent camps in the immediate vicinity, along the gravel paths. The house in the top left is a cabin with a forge which helps keep the heat away from my home. The buildings in the top center are a Born and Noble with a Pass-N-Gas spawned inside of it (not the best scenario but there were some bookshelves left (don't pick up the couches)) and across the street is a large tool store.  There's a snow biome to the south with an isolated metal garage (600N, 135E) which is easily fortified and which I plan to use as a waystation for raiding the hub city.

Just northwest up the road is a town 2128N/1472E with a bookstore, pharmacy, and hardware. To the west of that town, down a road, is a gun store and grocery 2519N/568E.   There's a half dozen caves at 718N/1559E, some of them interconnecting, with cabins around the area.   There's a town to the south with a hardware store, gun store, and grocery 561N/1966E.

The nice thing about that spawn is the distance between POIs makes it a bit easier to fully clear one, even on Day 1. The first one I took over was a small one, and I've been spending my nights building it up a bit since I can't gather the resources to make anything much better.  I finally found a cabin with a forge in it, but that POI is pretty annoying to fortify so I'm planning a trip there with all of my scrap metal on Day 6 to make iron arrows and ingots. I don't have much scrap though, so it's not going to be much. It's pretty exciting."

It's town after town with each town within 500 or so blocks and you had the city +3  towns within 800. I think it would be great for multiplayer you could do Factions with groups owning different places. Only problem I had was since they are towns there's no shotgun messiah, but there are the other stores.  Some of the towns cut into awesome sheer cliffs (which are frequent) and you can fly directly into town from them."

Here is what would probably get it going for you.  In your serverconfig.xml files (File that tells the server wtf to do) you are going to want to make sure the following to items are set to whatever your LAN game is.   <property name=""GameWorld""                 value=""Navezgane""/>     If RandomGen put RandomGen there <property name=""GameName""              value=""My Game""/>           What you named your randomgen seed or >navezgane world in LAN   Ok so what is this seed and WRU saved world?  The default save USED to be in DOCUMENTS however with A12 I believe it was moved to users/apdata/one of those folders in there sorry not at my home so can't confirm.  In there you will see a folder called saved pop in there and you will see random gen, navezgane or maybe both.  Head to the one with the world you are looking for we will say random for this example in there you will have a folder with the name of the game you and your buddies are playing.  Open that guy up welcome to your world.  MAP/REGION will contain the world.  Player will have the saves of the people that have been playing on the LAN.  So once you get your serverconfig.xml setup with the correct game mode and seed name.  Fire up the dedicated server let it generate the world on it's own first.  Confirm that you have the same file structures on your dedicated machine (rented or otherwise) once you do shut it down.  Copy the map and region folders from the seed on your PC over to the dedicated one.  If you want to copy over players copy that folder to as well as the MAIN.ttw and players.xml if it is there.  Restart the server and you should be good to go."

7daystodie,3csojw,jellocf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:25:12 2015 UTC,You don't have to install steam but I would highly recommend downloading the dedicated server using steam (Library>Tools) or without using steam by using SteamCMD  The directory structure looks the same but there are some different files in the dedicate server than the client that will allow you to make use of Allocs Fixes which is a valuable tool set for server admins.

7daystodie,3csojw,jellocf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:48:06 2015 UTC,Shouldn't have to log in so long as you downloaded the dedicated server files from steam/steamCMD.    Once you launch the batchfile that fires off 7daystodieserver.exe shouldn't bother you for anything.  Can you clarify are you running a .bat from the directory or are you using a steam shortcut with the parameters attached to that?

7daystodie,3csjxl,jellocf,2,Fri Jul 10 13:57:54 2015 UTC,I think walk speed is now in the hands of the physics side.  You can modify the run/scared/night speed of zombies and critters still but it doesn't look like you are able to change player speed.  Had people asking as well maybe something will come up @ a later date but it sure does feel slow as hell.
7daystodie,3csjxl,jellocf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"I just looked through the blocks.xml and doesn't look like it is there.  I'll probably just make one of the buffs increase speed through the speedmodifier stat and move it to 1.20.  I rarely use coffee so maybe I'll try altering that one and have it set for an entire day. I noticed the speedmodifier value can be set (.6,.8)....as an example.  I wonder if that is (walk speed, run speed)."

7daystodie,3csgk5,Brandalf_the_grey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:48:56 2015 UTC,"Watch the console. Wandering Hordes happen randomly throughout the day and night. Those are nothing like the Day 7 Hordes. The Wandering Hordes start at a position as far away as you can currently see, and travel in a straight line to the other edge, passing right through where you were located when the script started. You'll hear their footsteps long before they see you. Just stay mobile, or stay hidden, and they will pass you by. Be especially careful on Day 6 as they are completely dogs for the Wandering Hordes."
7daystodie,3csgk5,rezanow,2,Fri Jul 10 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"There seem to be significantly more though, more than double. I've been trying to teach my friend the basics and even on the lowest difficulty, we can't go five minutes without at least a few zombies showing up. Also, the wandering hordes previously didn't smash your building just because they were passing by, so I assumed that this was more than random hordes."
7daystodie,3csgk5,Brandalf_the_grey,2,Fri Jul 10 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the configuration of the building. If they see it as an obstacle, they will smash their way through it. But, I've watched time and again where they smash through and keep on going.   The important part, I've found, is to remain quiet. Don't even open your backpack. If you are Sensed, they will look where they think the sound came from. In metagame terms, this means they think the sound came from x/y coordinates. So, quietly move somewhere else (without being seen) and wait the 60 seconds for them to lose interest.   If there's something else going on, I haven't detected it in the console. Sometimes I wonder, with all the strange glitches, that people are playing a different version of the game. lol  I give my paranoid, overcautious advice with the caveat that your mileage may vary. Good luck!   Edit: If it helps, when I play coop with my wife on Scavenger and Low spawning, the results seem to be the same, just with smaller Wandering Hordes."

I died *in a 10-15 house town dogs were too close... and I backed into a fatty I died *near a barn there was one dog and 2 zeds... looked out back and saw a horde coming my way they didn't see me then I hit a freaking cactus and die just the same...    over all I have been having a much more enjoyable time playing. it adds something when you have to actually try to stay alive and I love it

7daystodie,3csgk5,rabidwolf5,2,Fri Jul 10 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"I've watched the console and I haven't gotten a Feral zombie with the Day 7 horde. But, they do appear with the 14 and 21 (haven't played further).   Theoretically, you could sit quietly on Day 7 and they'll have no idea where you are. Unfortunately, unlike the Wandering Hordes, they will try to break things to get to where the script originally told them you were. So, if you're hiding in your base, they will try to break through to get to where they were informed you'd be.   This is completely different from the Wandering Hordes you'll encounter during the day or night. The Wandering Hordes start at a position as far away as you can currently see, and travel in a straight line to the other edge, passing right through where you were located when the script started. The difference being that if there isn't an unreasonable obstacle in their way, they will pass around it. If they don't detect you, they'll keep on going.   This all goes to shit when a Feral zombie shows up. That fucker can smell you. He'll know where you are. And he'll tell his friends. The only defense I've found that works is to fucking hide in a cave. If you're far enough below them, they won't smell you. Wait for 6am, then hit the surface to kill anything that remains at movement speeds you can handle."

(1800, 1900, 0000 will be night)   In my experience, the 12, 15, 18 hour days equates to 1800 (6pm), 2100 (9pm) and 0000 (1200 midnight).    Caves: they exist    They do! Rare as they are, I've even found in my travels that they sometimes spawn in groups.     Trees/Gravel: now mining and chopping is a constant life or death struggle. I recommend you sprint back every time you break something down lest they smash your pinky toe (kills you).    After having read about this (and despite the hotfix claiming to have fixed it for trees), I tend to mine/chop at the maximum range the tool will allow, just to be safe. You'd be surprised how far they reach (especially considering the limited reach of the melee weapons).   Hordes: ... There are a LOT of them and they can come throughout the day in waves. There's too many hordes atm, at least 1 sometimes up to 4 in a single day, when it's not even the 7th day.   I watch the console often and I see that the game will spawn ""Wandering Hordes"" throughout each day. It seems, as the days go by that they get bigger. At first, it was 3 wandering to the location you were at when the script started, which means they'll be heading in one specific direction. Be always mobile when scavenging, it may be dogs! Later, I would see 10, 20 and sometimes even 30 wandering by. Never any Ferals, so if you're in a building stay still, don't even open your backpack. Keep in mind that they form in packs and that the first bunch could be the dogs, then fast movers, then the slow movers, and then the crawlers. I always forget the damn crawlers when I go back to looting.    Gaps are a zombies worst enemy. They still can't voluntarily jump a 1 block gap (can be accidentally pushed) so a ditch or gap (recommend 2 wide for safety) is the best defense against zombies (rather than a wall.) Be careful zombies will use spikes as a jumping block as well as any gore blocks so make your walls/ditch a minimum of 3 (strongly recommend 4 or 5) high/deep. If you can jump onto something with sprint, chances are they will find a way to do it too.   This is how I have survived many a first day/week. http://imgur.com/UYwtenu or something like this http://imgur.com/ZPhSvnx. I do my best to look for caves now, if you're deep enough even the Ferals won't smell you. And, as you noted elsewhere, they remain on the surface elsewhere. I can handle fighting them during the day! lol"

This needs to be fixed or else you literally cannot make anything.    Forest biome cabins have forges.  The forge book is not a huge gate.   Guns (SMG in my case) will lose durability after hardly a clip (even if flawless). I fixed by upgrading a part of the gun.   This is a normal game mechanic.  If you have one crappy part in a gun the gun will degrade very quickly.
7daystodie,3co5ib,rezanow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"Haven't found a forest biome cabin. Haven't found Forge Ahead. Can't make anything.

But to go into a hardware store and only find terrible weapons because I am personally unskilled makes no sense to me.

Did some more testing on the guns. It is a specific part which will break (in this case it is always a faulty magnum barrel) It is odd because if you have a good barrel and the rest faulty parts the gun will not break in 6 shots. Only when the barrel is faulty will the gun break. This would also explain why the repair kit fixes the entire gun (durability is 6). Cool, I knew crappy parts obviously broke the gun faster, but I didn't know each part contributed differently."
7daystodie,3co5ib,TribalDancer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"Each part has it's own durability.  So, if you have 4 parts with 600 durability and 1 part with 50 durability, your gun will break when the 50 durability part breaks.  So, if it takes 1 durability per shot, 50 shots will break your gun."
7daystodie,3co5ib,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:00:43 2015 UTC,Yup that's the conclusion I found. Though I feel in that case it makes total durability (hovering over the weapon itself) useless. As the only thing that matters is the durability of the weakest part.

I think it only works with the first one because it is using the id 'cannotBreath' , which is an existing mutex that is expected by the game code.. idk."

Thankfully its close enough to the edge that you can run in a get it and only lose maybe a quarter of your hp (at 100 wellness) Just be sure to have enough inventory space that you can just run in a grab it and run out, rather then having to pick and choose because you cant grab everything."

I do agree with the spin around every 5 seconds thing tho."
7daystodie,3cmx0i,Kieroshark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"I played for several hours last night and I think you might be right.  The low end bow with stone arrows was still not as powerful as A11, but it might be a little too much for a low end weapon.  I'm sure they will tweak it some more, but given that it was worse than just throwing rocks before, I think its a good step in the right direction."
7daystodie,3cmx0i,SirNanigans,3,Thu Jul 9 12:42:48 2015 UTC,"I think that zombies ought to die with one shot to the head of any piercing weapon. Body shots are a different story, but head shots with arrows the ought to be a sure kill against normal zeds.   I think the advantage of guns comes from having sights/scopes, a greater range, faster firing rate, and more damage for body shots. In reality, any time you can hit someone with a bow as easily as a gun, you might as well do it. A broad tipped stick and stone piercing your flesh might as well be a bullet as far as damage is concerned (barring hollow point).   To make bows more challenging, they should tweak the consistency of their shots. Rather than nerf it to the point that sending a triangular stone through the cranium of a zombie fails to stop it, the idea that not every arrow goes to exactly the same place is a bit more realistic. This makes the primitive bow appropriately less useful outside of close/medium range."

Unless you mean to introduce wind blowing an arrow off course, which isn't what I'm talking about at all. Wind blowing an arrow off course seems neat, but I'd hate it as a player who just wants consistency."

7daystodie,3cobr2,Arik_De_Frasia,2,Thu Jul 9 16:26:03 2015 UTC,I haven't had any issue with melee. Are any of you guys changing your Field of View?
7daystodie,3cobr2,rezanow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:14:37 2015 UTC,This.    Zombie swings and hits me.  I swing back and am too far away to hit.  That's a rigged game.  Add in infection chance and wellness loss from taking even minor damage and melee is unviable regardless of item quality.
7daystodie,3cobr2,mooseeve,2,Thu Jul 9 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"You have to walk forwards just close enough to hit them, bop them once on the head and then sprint backwards (shift-s) the sprinting back will allow you to dodge their attacks. So long as you are only fighting one at a time you can use this method to kill them even with a stone axe without taking any damage. Also I hear the arrows are buffed again."
7daystodie,3cobr2,bobdylan401,4,Thu Jul 9 15:36:20 2015 UTC,This right here. Melee is a game of backpedaling
7daystodie,3cobr2,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"Which is actually kind of weird and immersion-breaking, if you ask me- you don't see people fighting that way in real life.  Personally, I'd prefer it if you automatically pushed the zeds back when you hit them.  That way you could easily handle one zombie at a time... but the more you have to fight, the harder it would get.  You could even make it so that the larger zombies can't be pushed back."
7daystodie,3cobr2,WasabiBomb,0,Thu Jul 9 19:47:49 2015 UTC,Yes that's how it worked before A12.  Now zombies have a longer range than you so you get my example.
7daystodie,3cobr2,mooseeve,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:57:17 2015 UTC,"Why people are downvoting a legitimate concern is beyond me. I have always been a very skilled melee player. I loved going with a spiked club into a town and seeing how long I could fight in close range before I had to switch to ranged weapons. I know all the tricks.   Since 12, I get hit by them pretty much 100% of the time and couldn't hit them back 75%or more of the time. Also, despite aiming right at their heads, my strikes were clearly being registered on the body. So not only did they have a longer reach than me, the head hit box was either moved or shrunk or bugged.  I haven't tried melee since the patch because I didn't see that their reach range was changed (so thanks for posting that /u/Arik_De_Frasia ); though I did see they changed something about the hit box gap between the head and body, which may have been the issue I was experiencing?.

No ammo and no sounds so you can control the fight.  They broke melee in A12.  Someone said the melee range changed in the files with 12.1.  Nothing in the patch notes.

7daystodie,3clw72,Cragvis,18,Wed Jul 8 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"As a former archer I can tell you that missing the target on a soccer field or similar during a competition often means that the arrow partially or even fully goes under the grass / dirt. It's pretty common for arrows to get lost during competitions.  Now imagine doing that in a forest or plains with much taller grass.  I don't mind loosing the arrows which don't hit the target. And as others have pointed out, it helps the game run smoother / easier if it only has to calculate if the arrow hits or misses.  They can however implement a rather simple solution for partial arrow recovery which I don't think would take a lot of extra coding or make the game run worse. If an arrow hits a zombie then there could be a % chance that it is added to the zombie's inventory so that when the zombie dies, you can loot some of your arrows back from the body. Several other games use this mechanic. It's very basic but it works."

But if you're looking for a more technical reason... the mechanic to incorporate this would require the server to track each arrow fired  and control the physics to figure out where the arrow landed how it would stick out of an object so you could SEE the object and pick it up. Taking in to consideration what surfaces would actually let an arrow ""stick"" in it, vs ricochet and/or break. How long would an arrow be allowed to be reused? Would arrows then be given a durability metric? This would greatly effect performance negatively.   I really have no idea I'm just guessing, but I think it sounds plausible."

7daystodie,3clw72,Guyonbench,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"I think that's totally fine for the simplest arrows, but I would like to have a chance to recover arrows (at least ones that hit) for better arrows that take a little more effort to craft. I would quite like the idea of actually having to invest time to learn how to craft some really cool arrows that take a little more effort to make and do a lot more damage and/or fly more true, ect... And to also concern myself with making my shots so that I can preserve those arrows instead of all arrows simply being disposable.  That's the part I like about making arrows more reusable. They become less disposable and a more important resource to manage. As is I just automatically turn all feathers and bones into arrows or bolts as I have no other use for them, and little other use for the small stones once I get iron."

7daystodie,3ckony,Syncyy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"2: i think the best way they could do this is to have a radius where they could spawn, but make it ""flow"" like water or something, that way it couldn't spawn within a building with you, or withing a secured building, but could spawn just outside the wall even if that spot is within the normal spawn-free area.  I'm really bad at making pictures in paint, so I made a really bad one with a pen.  Shaded areas are the safe areas.  The little trapezoid would be a hole in the wall, and the ""safe"" flowing out  5: I've had large (125 at least) hordes spawn in 10.4, but haven't played with the high spawn rate since."

7daystodie,3ckony,Pm_me_some_dessert,2,Wed Jul 8 23:16:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see damage from falling debris balanced by material type as well as height it fell from. I'm sure that's in the works.  I'd really like to see fishing/trapping/crab traps etc. Project Zomboid added fishing and I loved going out and building a little shack to keep my fishing supplies in, going out and fishing and fighting off zombies when they found me. It would be so much more fun in this game, where instead of a shack you would need a fortified, booby-trapped fishing bunker in case of roaming hordes.   I'd like to see zombie spawning make more sense... it would be boring if you could jsut clear an area permanently, but I think there should really be a span of hours before anything respawns in an area you cleared. Like maybe you missed a corpse during your sweep, or one dragged itself from under some debris; those things make sense. Zombies materializing down the road from you moments after you clear out an area around a house you want to loot, that makes no sense.   Finally, I'd like to see them shift focus towards creating new prefabs, new items and crafting options, etc. In fact, I would love for the game to sustain itself after release by selling feature packs of X number of prefabs, crafting options and items for 5 bucks or so every few months. I think the base game they have going is the absolute best of the genre, and they deserve to continue profiting from working on the game they so clearly love."

I love that the game is starting to be sandbox-y, and would like to be able to build more furniture, find more decorative stuff for my house. Like in minecraft, we always collect creature heads to mount as trophies - it would be cool to have maybe more paintings, the ability to make fancier stuff (like currently there's the old couches vs. leather couches), that sort of thing.

7daystodie,3ckony,giltirn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:43:09 2015 UTC,I would love to see the heatmap take into consideration the nearby players levels when attacking.  Early game if there are a couple low level players with a campfire send something smaller then 3-4 50+ lvl players all cooking away in their safe base.  It would also be interesting if somehow the success of a previous hoard also factored in. If it's completely avoided and not killed then send more next time/have them be more aggressive? If it killed everyone maybe it's a little too hard? Something like that!  Of course before any of that i would like to see the melee combat improved a bit. Right now it's down right deadly getting near zombies.

I get that not everyone enjoys them - heck, I don't enjoy them either - but without that threat of, ""oh shit, there's going to be a horde in a few days"", the game just becomes another lazy builder where zombies can be avoided and become little more than a nuisance."
7daystodie,3ck0r4,smarttrigger,5,Wed Jul 8 14:46:39 2015 UTC,Hover your mouse over an item to check its stats. Compare the stats of different qualities of items. You'll find your answer quickly :)
7daystodie,3ck0r4,papachabre,4,Wed Jul 8 14:53:13 2015 UTC,"Quality affects a lot of stats, including max durability, max entity and block damage, and possibly also degradation rate.  Making new items as you level and repairing your lucky high quality items are good ideas in the long run.  I like to burn/scrap all my old tools and bows and whatnot just to get maximum use out of them.  The durability on your club barely increased because as a purple item, its max durability was probably in the 600 range, while a single metal strip will only repair 10 durability.  You can hover over items that can be used to repair and it will tell you how much they repair."
7daystodie,3ck0r4,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:42:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's about what I would have expected but wanted to be sure. What about bows then? They do not have entity damage and arrows do not have quality. Will their damage increase with a better bow? I have seen that I can see which item I need for the repair but I wasn't aware that it shows a number (most likely because a stone axe only requires 1 stone at my quality level).
7daystodie,3ck0r4,dointhestankyleg,3,Wed Jul 8 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"I think bow quality affects damage, not entirely sure though.  I know the arrows have a big impact on damage, so upgrade to iron arrows as soon as you can."
7daystodie,3ck0r4,Pm_me_some_dessert,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"Bows definitely seem to have a high impact on damage done. Between starting to use the mid-level arrows and getting up to a blue quality bow, I can now one-shot zombies again, sometimes even if I don't get a head shot. This was not the case the few times I used an orange-quality bow with the mid-level arrows."
7daystodie,3ck0r4,MystPhoenix,3,Wed Jul 8 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"This is probably more technical than you'd want but it's a breakdown of how the game calculates how 'good' everything is.   How well your item performs is all based on the amount of damage said item does, and damage is split up into two categories in the game: entityDamage and blockDamage.  Entity damage is against any, well, entity. So zombies, animals, and other players. Their are modifiers for striking the head, and from looking through the .xml files, it looks like they are going to add a fatal crit for hitting the chest of other players.  Block damage refers to any placed blocks and their are modifiers for what type of damage group it falls under, like earth, wood, stone, metal. This is how an iron pickaxe is good for stone but not for wood. This particular pick does 10 block damage, with a 0.4 modifier against wood, so if you hit a tree it only does 4 damage to that blocks total health value rather than 10.  Now quality changes that entityDamage value. In the game code, it's written out as two values as a minimum and a maximum number. Every item is assigned one of six qualities, but more specifically its gets a quality value ranged 1-600 with 1-100 being faulty, 101-200 being poor, 201-300 being good, 301-400 being fine, 401-500 being great, and 501-600 being flawless. The game takes that number value and calculates it against the min-max to get the final damage number.   Lets get our theoretical pickaxe again, its blockDamage level is 2,12 so at worst quality (001 Faulty) it will do 2 damage to stone and metal and dirt, and 0.8 to wood. At a 600 Flawless quality level, it will do the maximum 12 damage against stone, metal, and dirt, and 4.8 damage to wood. Any other quality level will be a scaled value in between those two numbers.   The last thing to mention is that every ten levels you ""upgrade"" your crafting and looting skills. This lets you craft into the next tier quality, and it also affects the chance and quality of different loot you'll find when scavenging. (Imho this is kinda unbalanced because as of A12 it will be very rare to find a flawless or even fine quality pickaxe at the start of the game, and by the time you hit level 30-40 you'll most likely be established and self sufficient with little need for looting. It makes the start-game too hard and the end-game too easy. This is all balancing though and can be easily fixed.)"
7daystodie,3ck0r4,MystPhoenix,2,Wed Jul 8 17:05:33 2015 UTC,Ha thanks for that. There is no too technical description for me :). That's exactly the extensive explanation I was looking for.    I assume that the same scaling applies for resources required to repair the item?
7daystodie,3ck0r4,Tabudragon,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:42 2015 UTC,Yup! With better quality you get a higher durability/health value. Metal strips for example repair I think 10 points each by default so better gear = more durability = more material for repair.
7daystodie,3ck0r4,rezanow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"In green it will tell you what you need to repair an item when you mouse over it. The purple club you found probably requires 10 metal scraps, which explains why 5 scraps didn't seem to help."

7daystodie,3clw0l,MystPhoenix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"You can find it in the items.xml file in 7DTD/data/config/ folder. Just look for the item you want and edit the 2 EntityDamage values under the attributes property class. The two numbers determine the min/max and the actual damage value scales based on quality.  I'd also suggest getting notepad++ for editing, it makes the .xml files soooo much easier to read ;)  Ninja edit: on second thought just edit the DamageBonus.head value from 6 to maybe 4? Its a multiplier against EntityDamage"

7daystodie,3ckman,Doctor__Krieger,3,Wed Jul 8 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"Haha! I found the numbers in the misc.xml file under the 'noise' column. The noise level is dependent on how far the noise travels I believe, or at least to where an entity will take notice?  44 Magnum - 70 blocks  Sawed-off Shotgun - 60 blocks  Pump Shotgun - 50 blocks  M 136 Rocket Launcher - 35 blocks   Pistol - 50 blocks (why is this more than a fracking rocket launcher???)  SMG - 50 Blocks  Sniper Rifle - 35 blocks  Hunting Rifle - 50 blocks  Crossbow - 5 blocks  Should also note that there's a 'heat-map' system involved so when you do something noticeable, it leaves a footprint on the map for a period of time. So if you fire off a shotgun, anything within that 50 blocks will most likely come to investigate wherever it is you shot. For all the weapons minus the crossbow that interest lasts 120 seconds (the crossbow is 1 second).  Edit: Missed a value"

7daystodie,3ckman,Pm_me_some_dessert,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"To players, virtually all weapons are very loud, but if you need to break down anything with an axe, they can hear it from 1km+, can hear you looting objects from very long distances, opening doors, etc, so your weapon's noise won't really matter at all when you're raiding.  To zombies, you need to use something silent and powerful (crossbow) to avoid alterting all of them, but beware with the latest update they may just spawn right on top of you anyway. :)  Either way, I would have little concern for the noise your weapon makes, as it makes little difference because of the spawning mechanics and the distance sound travels, but your best bet is either a high quality bow with good arrows or a crossbow."

In other words if you are forcefully killing the server task/process (using task manager on windows or kill on Linux) then the day will reset to the last time it was successfully shutdown & saved the day.

7daystodie,3cjdho,Elduriel,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"dude, you made the typical movie mistake with running in the very direction the tree was falling. Otherwise these mechanics are bullshit as they are. Now tree chopping is artificially made more tedious and boring with the backpedaling every time. And I'd say gravel killing you when falling on top of your head like in A11 is legit, but not this version. Tree damage I believe is hardcoded in physics so it can't be modified by xml tweaking."
7daystodie,3cjdho,Elduriel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:31:55 2015 UTC,"I was running away ok from them before, but that one in particular slid towards me and I didn't have enough time to see which way it was going to fall. Now I take down only small trees :D  But I've died from trees sliding towards me too, sometimes its random. Sometimes they do cartwheels and flips or go straight through the ground, and sometimes just picking up the logs can kill you too.  In A11.6 gravel would injure you only, you'd need a fair bit to fall on you and kill you - which is how I think it should be.  So you can't nerf the tree damage? What about the dirt/gravel?"

7daystodie,3ci0ng,ShadowRam,6,Wed Jul 8 01:45:31 2015 UTC,It would be nice to have some sort of success mechanism to clearing an area out.
7daystodie,3ci0ng,TheNotSoEvilEngineer,5,Wed Jul 8 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Maybe there's a nest per biome or something.  The density(and spawning rate) of zombies in that biome depend on the state of that biome nest. (maybe different themed nests based on each biome)  When the nest is gone, it'll be a couple days before another level 1 nest spawns somewhere else in that biome.  At least then we could concentrate and work on destroying the nest, and the reward is having a day or two to clean out of town or build.  How crazy would it be if the next nest spawned in the bottom of your base? (Now you have a real hard choice. Let the local nest grow to epic proportions and attempt to defend against it? Or destroy the nest and risk having a small one erupt inside your base)"
7daystodie,3ci0ng,TheDmac,2,Wed Jul 8 14:33:04 2015 UTC,Should post this on the forums for the devs to see. Really good idea! Maybe limit them to the cities. Kind of reminds me of 'The Strain'

7daystodie,3ci0ng,Jeradox,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"Specifically I think that if a player puts down a claimblock, and they are offline for 3 days. The claim block degrades in to a ""zombie block"" that spawns 1 special feral zombie and uses player clothing. So if a member of your group is offline for 3 days it's like having someone die in your camp. The zombie is persistent in the world until killed and actively seeks out any closest player on the server.   The loot for killing this zombie? A Claim block. (put directly in to inventory of the person who initiated the killing shot, unless inventory is full then it appears at their feet like a dropped item. A special sound effect is made for that person so they know it's there.)  If the player has multiple claim blocks on the server in close proximity and they go offline, it spawns a ""nest"" and takes over the base of said player."
7daystodie,3ci0ng,PwntIndustries,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"So, what you're saying is, (if your idea was to be implemented) don't play this game if you want to ever go on vacation? Sorry if that sounded a bit crass, but there are times when I might not be able to log in for a few days due to things happening outside of the game. The only thing that should alter my base in any way (since I play on a PVE server) is a map wipe due to a new alpha version."
7daystodie,3ci0ng,Jeradox,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:21:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, guess I never thought of that =\  My bad. Maybe your claim block could be reclaimed after you log in some how? But that's how the game is currently anyway, if you're offline for 3 days (by default) your block looses effect."
7daystodie,3ci0ng,PwntIndustries,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's an interesting idea, but the idea that zombies could take over my place after not logging in for 3 days; I'd be pretty pissed to see my work beaten to hell from the inside.

7daystodie,3ch5fm,Arik_De_Frasia,6,Tue Jul 7 21:56:40 2015 UTC,I had no idea it was so bad until I started single player for Alpha 12. Once I had bears and a dozen zombies all around me it just became clear as day that the audio wasn't right.

In A11 a friend fired off a SMG burst into a horde. I was well over 1&1/2 biomes away and i could still hear it .

7daystodie,3ch5fm,KungFuHamster,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"I like that others can hear what I am doing (unzipping your bag, for example), and I understand why it would seem loud to me (I have the pack practically held to my face). However, I definitely agree that these sounds need a significantly smaller range.   I can hear myself unzip a backpack over quite some noise, but it shouldn't travel much further than 50 feet, especially in the presence of other sounds.   There's a fun fact about audio in real life that's fully overlooked in this game: higher pitched sounds are clearer and easier to hear over other sounds, but they travel shorter distances. When thunder sounds, only those in the immediate vicinity hear a loud crack, but for miles and miles the rumble continues on.   If they plan to make the audio more realistic then I also believe that at least the higher pitched noises of inventory/tool use should fall off far sooner than they do."

7daystodie,3cgiul,Cragvis,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"Would love to be able to fish in any bodies of water.  Maybe make it so if water is X blocks in diamiter = produce X size fish. So that gives you incentive to find larger bodies of water, otherwise fishing in a tiny pond will only feed you with goldfish and minnows. lol  Fishing rod would be like 5 sticks in diagonal, with 2 or 3 threads (crafted by tearing apart cloth) and either a wooden hook carved from a stick, or a metal hook from a forge.  Wooden hook has a very low durability and will probably break after a few catches or one big catch.  Metal would obviously last MUCH longer.  no bait required, and if you dont use any it could take a loooong time to catch something, or you will get a sickly fish that can cause dysentery.  Using bait, like a worm found randomly when digging in dirt, or a piece of meat (putting any raw meat in craft window will let you produce X chunks of meat) will speed up the process and enable you to catch healthy big fish.  the rod would also take slight damage when a fish bits and pulls before popping into your inventory.  Better quality pole = more durability of course."
7daystodie,3cgiul,Secateurs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:38:23 2015 UTC,I like all this.. but I honestly think it would be a lot more fun with physically being able to see the fish... would you be able to? I'm not sure by speculating your comment.

7daystodie,3cgiul,gl1tch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"Fish trap:       A fish trap is a trap used for fishing. Fish traps may have the form of a fishing weir or a lobster trap. A typical trap might consist of a frame of thick steel wire in the shape of a heart, with chicken wire stretched around it. The mesh wraps around the frame and then tapers into the inside of the trap. When a fish swims inside through this opening, it cannot get out, as the chicken wire opening bends back into its original narrowness. In earlier times, traps were constructed of wood and fibre.

And before it's asked, these are on the default game settings.  I started Alpha 12; first thought was, dammit, they made this game impossible!!!  Restarted 5-6 times; raged quit a few :)  But then I thought to myself...this is survival zombie horror, right?  It should present challenge.  The leveled loot system meant nothing to me in A11, because I was destroying regardless of quality.  All I needed was one iron bar --> Forged Steel --> metal bars --> enough metal strips to repair all my weapons for many many ingame days.  Frankly...it was easy.  Now...arrows are weaker...maybe..just maybe, a little too much, but I accepted it.  Found myself a blue spiked club; holy shit!  One shot hits to the head!  Bring it on!  Built myself a crossbow and haven't looked back.  But I got a little over-confident a times.  Completely decked out a nice forge cabin I found; log spikes, metal sheets, a small hole/safe house.  Then comes 23:30...day 6; blood moon is coming.  I go outside for a quick look...I spot a spider zombie.  Crap, better take this guy out; place a poorly aimed shot and missed.  Scream.  24:00 hits as this happens.  Over the hills comes waves of zombies...running now.  It was like straight out of a film.  Bad luck I suppose.  I book it back inside; by the time I make it to my staircase, I turn around.  Like a knife through butter.  The cabin was breached; I was dead.  11/10, would 100% play that shit again.  In the end...the bugs?  It's alpha.  Expected.  I can deal with balance adjustments, pop-in's, biome glitches, weather improvements.  These will be constantly improved upon and in the meantime, are faaaaar from game-breaking...for me at least.  Due to the increased difficulty, it's a little less of a grindfest for me, even if the goal of farming/crafting/hording remains the same.  I feel a bigger sense of accomplishment surviving and actually feel like my character grows stronger now with the balance changes thus far.  I'm excited to see what they bring with the first patch (supposedly today?).  And trust me; I've lost bags of loot, a minibike I worked to build, graphic issues, etc.  I have all the reasons I need to be mad.  But I'm not.  I'm impressed.  At it's core...I've put 130hrs in so far for something I paid $25 for.  I plan to do much more.  I can't complain."
7daystodie,3cgcq9,Aegineer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:25:47 2015 UTC,"Have to say, I as many others, had it rough when alpha 12 dropped. Two of my first worlds were not so good, because I thought I could take on the new challenges without messing with the difficulty I'm used to. Turns out, I was wrong. Having turned down the difficulty now I'm back on my feet in my third world and absolutely loving it.  My biggest concern in alpha 11 was the lack of POIs and the need to travel biome through biome just to find a biome/POI worth looking into. The transitioning feels so much better now and the map blends in more naturally.  Currently I just survived Day 14 feral horde (bearly), at level 22 equipment still mostly yellow but some nice finds around the world and the hub city. I even got my first legit minibike almost put together. My prefab base got pretty wrecked up which was expected, but at least I survived the night, and killed 4 feral zombies with a yellow bow and iron arrows. So don't come telling me the bow sucks (the bleeding effect is actually very helpful).  I'm even considering turning the difficulty back up a notch once I get more settled. Turns out alpha 12 isn't such a shocker after you just get adjusted."
7daystodie,3cgcq9,cnokha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:42:21 2015 UTC,"My issue with A12 is that the game is removing itself from it's best mechanic, the crafting and building. The variety of pieces you can craft and build houses, towns and forts with is amazing, and unlike Minecraft, the zombies are hard enough in this game that making a well fortified base and watching it resist an onslaught of zombies is actually satisfying. Instead, this game is going towards it's weakest points, it's mechanics. The gunplay in this game is mediocre, the melee is downright terrible, the zombies themselves are mechnically annoying as they have impossibly unfair reach and hitboxes. It's not fun fighting the zombies in masses because their mechanics makes them difficult to actually play against.   This game could've been very good if it focused at least an equal amount on the building aspect, encouraging big servers to run communities, towns, forts and really make this rich and vibrant zombie filled world for huge player base to interact with and explore. Instead, it's going towards a more singleplayer small co-op focused gameplay which will never garner it as much attention and success as the other survival crafting game it's competing against."
7daystodie,3cgcq9,SpectreFire,2,Wed Jul 8 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"Why all the past tense? It's still in development, plenty can&will change."
7daystodie,3cgcq9,Branaghan,-1,Wed Jul 8 13:10:32 2015 UTC,"Are we playing the same game?  Alpha 12 is a  snoozy grindfest.  They totally fucked this update beyond belief by adding a bunch of stupid grind to the early game.  Early game weapons are nerfed, zombie spawns are ridiculous, there's about a dozen bears per square mile.  Try to loot a building and you'll just get gangraped by zombies who spawn out of nowhere and somehow manage to have more reach with their arms than you do with your arm and a club.  Early iron tools are pointless because you just use them up just trying to keep them repaired.   All they've done by adding steel and nerfing everything else is made early iron pointless, at least you can keep a stone axe repaired easily.  It's stupid imbalanced.  There's no real sense of progression, you just grind and grind until the RNG gods smile upon you and you find an auger and a chainsaw and then it's back to the same old easy mode.    Sure the minibike is awesome and I do like the new weather effects, but they keep making the early game super difficult to the point where I don't even feel like playing anymore.  It just feels like cheap mechanics to delay progression into an entirely shallow endgame.    Maybe we just value different things in a game but this update sucks ass and I hope the pimps get their shit together because all the physics and weather effects in the world can't make up for imbalanced progression and a shallow endgame."
7daystodie,3cgcq9,Arm-the-homeless,12,Tue Jul 7 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the complaints.  I think it is more balanced than it was previously.  I like that I can't just make a bow and charge in and own everything day one.  I like that I had to scrounge through trash piles and backpacks and duffel bags and actually scavenge for a couple days.  I like that I had to really fight to clear out a shack to spend the night in.  I don't like the zombies popping in out of nowhere and the near guarantee that everything you find at low level is horrible.    I didn't really have any problems with bears because I started in the desert, but they're not really that hard to avoid, and pretty easy to mod their spawn rate down.  Repairing tools isn't that big of a deal, and I make new ones every few levels.  You can usually scrap down your old tools for enough scrap iron to make one or two ingots, so it's not really that bad.  How do you imagine the early game being?"
7daystodie,3cgcq9,dointhestankyleg,9,Tue Jul 7 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"How do you imagine the early game being?   Something other than ""Rummaging Simulator Z"" would be nice.  This game doesn't reward you for playing smart anymore.  If I'm nailing headshots while zoomed in with no crosshair I should be rewarded for that, but in this update, I don't even bother to zoom in because it doesn't make a difference.  Either way it's going to take a bunch of arrows to take down one zombie until you get lucky with the RNG and find the right book to make a better weapon, so why develop your skills?   If I'm grinding away at collecting iron so I can make a pickaxe, when I make one it should be worth making.  Instead it's just very slightly faster than a stone axe, less durable (!) and it takes more effort to to repair.    That's not rewarding me for my hard work, that's punishing me for my effort.  You may think it's not a big deal, but to me it's killing my enjoyment of the game.  When I work at something I want there to be a point to it.  A path to further progression, not a path to a hamster wheel until I get lucky.  The mob spawning in this game shouldn't be so fucked that it makes more sense to just keep creating new worlds until you spawn in a desert so you can avoid one of the shiny new additions to the game until you hit the RNG lottery and are equipped to deal with them.  If you're happy with it, good for you, but as far as I'm concerned this release is a steaming pile of RNG shit wrapped up in some shiny new weather effects and biome blending.  Which is also broken, by the way.   It's not fun to play, it's not rewarding, it's just punishment for its own sake.  Even if you do manage to progress, it's not because you achieved something, it's because you got lucky with the RNG.  Whats the fun in that?  I'm sure they'll get around to balancing it more.  It is an Alpha after all.  I just wish they'd spend less time fucking with established game mechanics, and if they're going to do that, at least make sure they're balanced before they release.  I don't have a problem with early game grind as long as I can progress out of it through hard work.  I don't mind some RNG, survival certainly should have a bit of luck to it, that's realistic.   I do have a problem with imbalanced progression and a shallow endgame, and there being no sense of achievement.  All they're doing is making the early game take longer through luck of the draw.  It's not more difficult, it's just more grindy for its own sake.  Sure, it makes it take longer to reach the endgame, but it also makes it less rewarding and interesting.  When I'm cruising around on my minibike from town to town, gathering resources for my nearly impenetrable fortress, I want to feel like I earned it.  Not like I just got lucky with the random gen and rummaging."
7daystodie,3cgcq9,Arm-the-homeless,7,Tue Jul 7 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"I don't feel it's as bad as you claim, but maybe my experience so far has been different than yours.  First off, let me lead by saying I'm playing on average difficulty.  Sure, the bow sucks when you start.  It takes like 5 headshots with stone arrows to take down a zombie.  But, with a poor quality bow and iron arrows I consistently one headshot kill normal zombies (not fatties).  I don't know what you mean by ""why develop your skills?"".  You still need to headshot enemies to avoid wasting ammo, you still need to level up to make better things, and you still need to kill zombies for xp.  All I can suggest about the axe is to wait until you're higher level to make one or keep repairing.  Sure, it would be nice if lower quality items had better base durability (like they added to the stone axe), but it's not a game breaker.  The path to progression is to kill zombies and loot things to get better stuff so you can kill more zombies and loot more things so you can get better stuff.  That's the progression of every game like this.  Again, I've had no problems avoiding bears when I travel out of the desert.    You still haven't offered how you would change things.  Instant kill headshots with level 1 crafted items?  Gloriously crafted tools on day 1?  All bears trapped within fences at the zoo, awaiting their reckoning from you?  Edit:  You complain about how everything is RNG-gated, but how would you propose managing progression in an open world randomly generated game with no external objectives?  How would you control spawning and crafting such that a player could progress at an acceptable pace, while still maintaining those aspects of the game?"
7daystodie,3cgcq9,dointhestankyleg,5,Tue Jul 7 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"A few changes:   Make the bow more inaccurate when not zoomed in to the point where headshots are near impossible.  I'd be okay with them getting rid of the crosshair altogether.  ADS for accuracy.  Make a sight craftable for the bow out of metal strips and duct tape if carebears want a crosshair. Stone arrows - 6 or 7 body shots, 2 or 3 headshots for normal zombies;  12 to 18 body shots, 5 headshots for big ones.  Better arrows should be more lethal, sure, but an arrow is an arrow and a headshot is a headshot.  5 headshots for anything that doesn't have an abnormally large head is retarded. Iron Tools - Base durability should start at 3x that of stone and get better as the tool quality increases.  I don't care if a faulty iron pickaxe is only slightly faster than a stone axe, but it should last longer no matter what. Zombies should never spawn in a cleared and secured room or building.   It is immersion breaking and cheap.   Zombies spawning anywhere in your line of sight or right behind when they weren't there a moment before is immersion breaking and cheap as well.  I'd rather have a random chance of them running during the day than this.  These aren't quantum zombies, they shouldn't pop in and out of existence before our eyes. Early progression books should be more plentiful.  Make later game progression books only available in big bookstores or special locations (weapons books in a shotgun messiah, etc), make those locations rare, and fill those locations with mobs to make them difficult to acquire, instead of making it random.   Perhaps add a mechanic to learn skills on your own through trial and error if your player reaches an appropriate level.   I have more, but its dinnertime, and you're not a dev so its kind of pointless to go on.   Note that I'm not asking for things to be easier, as your dismissive comment at the end suggests.  There are plenty of ways to make this game more difficult without turning it into a freaking slot machine."

Better arrows should be more lethal, sure, but an arrow is an arrow and a headshot is a headshot. 5 headshots for anything that doesn't have an abnormally large head is retarded.   Bow quality has a pretty big impact on this too, how should that be balanced?  Is that 2 or 3 headshots with a faulty bow?  How would you balance that well enough to where it doesn't feel like you're firing a pea shooter at start, and at the same time make the upgrade to iron (and steel) arrows still feel substantial?   Iron Tools - Base durability should start at 3x that of stone and get better as the tool quality increases. I don't care if a faulty iron pickaxe is only slightly faster than a stone axe, but it should last longer no matter what.   Again this has to take quality into account.  What quality stone axe vs. what quality iron axe?  I agree with your premise though.  An iron axe of a given quality should have more durability than a stone axe of a given quality (probably not 3x as much, maybe a flat +100 across the board)   Zombies should never spawn in a cleared and secured room or building.

What if you explore 5 cities and don't find a bookstore or any of those other special locations?  In my experience, as long as you're killing and looting, you should find all of the early progression books.  Playing with unmodified spawn rules, I have found so many early books and schematics in trash piles, including the forge ahead book.  Learning things without books would have to be relatively difficult and wasteful enough that it should be seen as a last resort for the terminally unlucky, instead of encouraging players to turtle up for weeks, but I have no real problem with the idea.    Also, I haven't downvoted you.  I actually upvoted a couple of your posts because I enjoy the discussion."

Make better quality arrows/ammo have better penetration/range.  Better quality weapons have better accuracy/durability (and penetration w/ the bow).  Instead of an Iron arrow magically taking down a zombie in 1 headshot instead of 5, make stone/iron arrows pretty similar in regards to damage.  Maybe make the iron ones recoverable.  There's other ways to balance this that do more to reward skill and progression.   Again this has to take quality into account. What quality stone axe vs. what quality iron axe? I agree with your premise though. An iron axe of a given quality should have more durability than a stone axe of a given quality (probably not 3x as much, maybe a flat +100 across the board)   I don't have specifics and I'm not proclaiming to.  I just know that under no circumstances should a stone axe  made out of twigs and plant fiber last longer than an iron one.  And an iron one should last a LOT longer than stone.   It would make sense that a stone axe could cut wood quicker than an iron axe, since it's actually possible in the real world to get a sharper edge with stone than iron.  But it shouldn't be more durable, unless maybe comparing a flawless stone vs a faulty.  Even then I think it should be just about even.    This makes things just as much RNG based.

That's a question of balancing the chances of those things appearing then.    As it stands now you have just as much chance of finding a sniper rifle schematic in a bookshelf in a random house as you do in a bookstore or a weapon store.  That doesn't make sense.  If I'm trying to survive and I want some better weapons, I know I need to find a place that has those weapons, like a store or an army depot or something.   The chances of finding a schematic for a sniper rifle in some random home should be almost nothing, and if it exists, it should be found next to a cache of weapons, ammo, and information on how to make all sorts of stuff.  Like some gun nut's wet dream, because really the only people who are going to have gun schematics in their house are the kind of people who also hoard/make guns and save their spent shells so they can reload them.  I know zombies aren't real so asking for realism is a fools errand but it should at least be logical.  Taking down a big gun store or book store should be a big deal, both in challenge and reward.  It should be hard, but it should be worth it.  Right now it isn't.  It's no harder than just wandering the streets of a town and while you have more of a chance of getting something valuable just on account of the extra bookshelves, you're just as likely to find a bunch of common stuff.   So it's just random, it's luck.  No sense of achievement, no guarantee of reward.  They just give you a couple extra dice to hit that lucky number with.   The game to me just feels like it's moving further and further away from progression into randomness, where your chances are more determined by luck than by skill.  And to me, that's not much fun at all.   I don't have a problem with difficulty, but make it sane, and make it rewarding.  Right now it's just difficult - or rather, grindy - and random, and as a result, it's boring."

I mean the entire world is made up of destructive, craft able materiable, plus the addition that they clearly want to add in themed prefabs (hence the various specific store prefabs.)  What I'm trying to say is that a ""steaming pile of RNG shit"" would be maybe something like Rusts concept which isn't even placeholder where basically the only way to find blueprints are by destroying trashcans and barrels and getting completely random loot. Like completely random.   In 7 days what loot you get is already predictable, (egs and feathers in birds nests, blueprints and recipes in bookcases) even in this still very early age of their RNG balance. They can't really balance it accurately until their random gen includes larger prefabs (military bases, airports, ect) so you have to keep in mind that this is all place holder, and like Mole said in his post its nowhere near done, but its nice to see it start to come together, which I personally think that it does."

They shouldn't spawn AFTER you enter the building, and right next to you. Zombie spawning needs to occur BEFORE you reach the building.  Also, the sound bugs are EXTREMELY SORELY in need of addressing.

7daystodie,3ch9cx,KungFuHamster,3,Tue Jul 7 23:39:49 2015 UTC,"I was kicking around this idea for a game I am working on. You can have night go by quicker as the % of players in beds goes up.   Lets say night takes 10mins and you have 5 players playing. If all players are in beds it takes 1min for night to go by.  It would be a logarithm like this.   in bed : Time 1 Player : 9 min, 2 Player : 5 min, 3 Player : 4 min, 4 Player : 2 min, 5 Player : 1 min  That way players Have to get rest but can pick when.   edit, fix formatting."

Also 7dtd has the mechanic to speed up time so it would not be hard to code.  Check count of beds. if after 10pm and before 6am X time by y speed until 6am.

Some nights, especially early game where your shack isn't properly fortified, attempting to use that time will bring hordes upon you.   Being able to sleep should pass time quicker (on single player).    A problem I see is this. Sleeping shouldn't make you immune to zombies.  At what point should you awaken?  When zombies attack your fort?  If so, what is considered ""your fort"".   Maybe only double the speed of time passing, and make the wake option manual.  That way it is your choice to get out of bed to defend your fort."

One way it could be used would be as an optional way to get a small increase in health or wellness regeneration.  Basically trading your night, and potentially your safety if you're not smart and vigilant about it, to recover.  It sounds like a nice little idea, a lot of people just hide away over night anyway and it would even be useful in MP this way.  It would probably have to be an extremely small benefit though, something that someone would use if they were just going to be hiding in an attic anyway but not so beneficial that somebody who would rather be actively playing feels the need to spend their time sleeping for 20 minutes just to get the benefit from it."

7daystodie,3ci0ol,dumfrey,7,Wed Jul 8 13:18:55 2015 UTC,"No I do believe he means bullet tips, because that's what they are called ingame. You need bullet tips, gunpowder, and casings to craft a bullet."

7daystodie,3ci0ol,dumfrey,0,Wed Jul 8 14:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yes sorry. What's bothering me is the game being cagy with it's terms, not the OP's comments. It's just one of those things that drives me a bit nuts. That and the bizarly inaccurate sky in this and many other games. Do that many people really never look up? Why don't the stars move in the sky the same as the Sun? Why do we see stars right through what should be the dark part of the crescent moon? The moon becomes a crescent because part of it is in shadow and dark, not transparent. I guess all this seems like mere nitpicking, but to me they just seem glaringly wrong. It's like a slap in the face and pulls me out of the game.  Granted in this case the game's far from finished and lots of stuff could just be called placeholder. And ultimately I'll enjoy the game even with weird oddities like this. I just don't like them. Triple A games do the same things and with less excuse... bother the heck out of me. ;3"

7daystodie,3cigf1,jasonkostempski,2,Wed Jul 8 04:02:37 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on the refund thing? Steam does not refund stuff out of the blue. Somethings fishy here.
7daystodie,3cigf1,scorcher24,3,Wed Jul 8 04:12:15 2015 UTC,"It all started with 3 separate emails about refunds for the 3 games I've bought. The emails all came at the same time which is obviously odd so I logged into Steam to see what was up and got the notice about fraudulent activity. The games were bought days/weeks apart, each on different cards (maybe that looked suspicious to them?) all of which have since cleared (so no declined charges).  A friend of mine who has used Steam for years suggested maybe someone hacked in, requested refunds for all the games (based on the new refund policy) and hoped maybe the charges would refund to my Steam Wallet. But I've played all the games well over 4 hours, so it wouldn't be possible to request refunds. I guess I won't really know what's going on until/unless I hear back from support.  Edit: I tried looking at my transaction history on Steam but there are no clues about how the refunds were initialized.  Edit 2: The ""Date Confirmed"" in the emails are each 2 seconds apart which, I think, implies an automated process of some kind."
7daystodie,3cigf1,doomed151,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:26:19 2015 UTC,"Why not try contacting Steam support? They should have the IPs tracked. Also, Steam Guard should make it impossible to login to your Steam account on a different device. Did you disable it?"
7daystodie,3cigf1,doomed151,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:40:30 2015 UTC,"I did contact support including ""Proof of Ownership"", just waiting on a reply.

7daystodie,3cigf1,jellocf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:18:41 2015 UTC,Steam Guard is Steam's two-factor authentication. It will ask for a code sent to your email when logging in from a new device or browser. If you didn't get an email then it's not likely that your account has been hacked. I hope you'll be able to get this resolved. Best of luck.
7daystodie,3cigf1,Wedge129,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:36:22 2015 UTC,Now I don't work for steam or anything but so take this with a grain a salt.   What I do know is when  dicks do jack accounts they are used to buy steam gift games with either stolen cc info or possibly stolen b info for bank info on the account.   Buy tons of steam gifts move them to various accounts and what not.   Maybe the fact that it was different cards and not much else activity wise is what set it off. I would try hitting the steam support discussions board if you haven't already on top of any emails you may have sent out.   Sorry you are having difficulties hopefully it gets sorted out soon
7daystodie,3cho54,chabo_son_of_chabo,3,Wed Jul 8 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Our game seed is ""Fort COD"" and it's been the best I've seen. Good desert, mix of biomes, caves, varied towns to explore, lakes, water sources, ores on surface, ridges etc.  Previous ones had crazy glitched out map generation but this one has been perfect. I've yet to find the wasteland on our new map though... still so much to explore!"
7daystodie,3cho54,croppergib,3,Wed Jul 8 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"It's so exciting when you find a good map and a lucky start! Mine has been ""test1"". I spawned in next to a two story cabin and a deep cave where hordes pass right by (roughly 1520N/1750E). Just up the road to the north is a small town with a bookstore, hardware store, and a pharmacy. About the same distance away, to the west of the town, is a grocery store and a Shotgun Messiah.   My only frustration was not finding the Forge Ahead book in any of those locations. I wound up finding it in a random garbage pile in the wilderness while running back home after a day of scavenging."

Nope. Entire house spawned as I was inside of it. I barely got out alive, as I got stunned almost instantly."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,kyuss80,4,Tue Jul 7 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"Is this a glitch with the game, or a lag of sorts? The closest I've gotten to zombies spawning on top of me is running towards a POI and having them 'appear' as we got close. In fact, my wife and I have used this function to help us determine if they building has refreshed it's inventory (if they zombies don't spawn, the loot hasn't either).   I wonder if it has something to do with multiplayer vs singleplayer. My previously noted tactic doesn't apply when I'm playing SP. Everything loads at max distance."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,rezanow,8,Wed Jul 8 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"That is one of my few qualms with the game. Near me doesn't bother me much, it's when they spawn on me. I was outside my base and was killed by a feral. Nothing had broken into my base yet so I spawned on my bedroll so I could grab my backup weapons and couple other supplies from the crate right next to my bed. I spawned, then 3 cop zombies spawned on me before I could open my inventory and a terrible case of zombie police brutality ensued. I rage quit that session. Pissed me off so much."

I should be able to go into a town, clear it and the surrounding areas of zombies, and not have to worry about zombies for a good long while as I loot things. That should be my reward for diligently killing everything in the town, some peace quiet and safety. Instead, zombies just keep constantly spawning on ridiculous timers and within terribly close radius. It completely pulls you out of the game."

7daystodie,3ce8pk,shithoused,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:38:06 2015 UTC,Yep it's happened to me twice in two different cabins. 5 zeds spawned in the room and many more outside! I died then ran back with no gear to get my bag. There were at least 20-30 zeds in and around that cabin. I spent half of that day luring the zeds far enough away that I could run in to get my bag. I've seen zeds spawn in mass countless time in the last few days. I'm always worried when I enter a building that it's going to happen

7daystodie,3ce8pk,Industrialbonecraft,0,Tue Jul 7 17:00:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the spawn range is stupid. They added some really cool things to this update, and then either broke some core mechanics, or changed them so they became gimmicky and artificial and the name of 'so uber hardcore difficult'.   Until they fix everything they fucked up, I don't really have any desire to play this game."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,-8,Tue Jul 7 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"I like this feature. It's a constant source of jump scares, and it forces me to stay alert and aware of my surroundings. It doesn't let me relax and feel safe. I think it really enhances the combat and survival aspects of the game. It puts all my skills to the test. It makes perfect sense. In the real world death doesn't always give you a warning before it defies your expectations and fucks up your plans. Sometimes it just comes out of nowhere and you have to deal with it. Keeping your head on a swivel can mitigate some of the danger, but you can't eliminate the risk entirely and learning to cope with unexpected chaos is the hallmark of a survivor. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,rezanow,10,Tue Jul 7 06:53:18 2015 UTC,"Meh. They can do that without gimmicky metagame shit. If they want to surprise you, have certain zeds make less or no noise. They could create a rare zed that has a touch more intelligence. Set the AI up where it has a slight variant on the heat system where it's basically stalking you based on where you frequent, waiting in the darkness for the right moment to strike.   But, spawning like that? No, thanks. This game is good enough without that sort of thing."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,travo5100,6,Tue Jul 7 07:09:25 2015 UTC,I like how you clear an area and you think you are good then a horde wanders in from the countryside. That is nice because it keeps you on your toes. I have also watched them spawn in front of me which is not nice.
7daystodie,3ce8pk,rezanow,3,Tue Jul 7 13:38:29 2015 UTC,"One is clearly good game design, the other is not."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,-2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"I know some people will have different opinions and I understand why it can be so annoying, but I think the unpredictability is what really keeps the mechanic fresh. No matter how well I understand zombie behavior there's always that element of surprise that I can't defeat. I usually see folks trying to figure out how to make themselves safe. My approach is to get used to being vulnerable and accept that fear and danger are an inevitable part of life. If a sudden appearance seems a little incongruous I just take it as an opportunity for role play. Ok, so there's no way that damn dog could run all the way from behind the barn in the two seconds I wasn't looking. It ruined my armor, but that doesn't mean I have to let it ruin my game too."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,rezanow,3,Tue Jul 7 07:36:24 2015 UTC,"I understand. I like the elements of surprise and suspense. This game keeps me on edge. I just think random spawning is cheap.   For example, you hear footsteps while you're looting. You remain still anxiously waiting for them to pass. You realize you're in the back bedroom, and the only quiet way out is downstairs. You decend the stairs, turning the corner into the dark living room. And that's when you get smacked.   Did he spawn there, or was he one that happened to wander in? One is cheap, the other is random bad luck and far more like real life. I don't mind if shit happens relatively realistically. I do mind if shit happens because of poor game design."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,ExplodingJesus,3,Tue Jul 7 14:00:21 2015 UTC,One scenario is being careless or too loud and attracting in a zombie you missed. The other is being struck by a meteor and dying because if it were lightning you'd at least have a warning and countermeasures like 'don't be outside in a thunderstorm'.
7daystodie,3ce8pk,ConfessionsAway,5,Tue Jul 7 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"If I take the time to carefully clear an area I don't expect to get boned for it.   In the real world death doesn't always give you a warning before it defies your expectations and fucks up your plans.   In the real world if I clear a house corner by corner, stuff doesn't miraculously spawn just to screw with me.   It's not about adapting. If the game started dropping bears (uber meta) on you behind your defenses you wouldn't think ""ok, I'll adapt"". You'd think ""why the hell are bears dropping on me, this is broken"".  When I clear a house I normally circle it to see what entrances are open. If none are, I jump from the porch or whatever and go in through a window. I cannot be followed without a huge commotion of them breaking through a wall or doors as they certainly won't be jumping to that window anytime soon. So if I do that and then clear the house... why should a zombie ever just miraculously appear?"

7daystodie,3ce8pk,Djpalko18,4,Tue Jul 7 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense.   This is the problem, it doesn't make sense. The game is attempting to simulate a post-apocalyptic world infested by zombies, not one where enemies magically blink in and out of existence before you."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,2,Tue Jul 7 12:41:40 2015 UTC,"That's not a feature. Its just bad bugs. There is a difference between challenge and bullshit.

7daystodie,3ce8pk,Blank_VII,2,Tue Jul 7 12:53:11 2015 UTC,I'm having severe graphical issues and I'm still playing. I don't agree that the spawning is a problem. I've never been killed by it.

7daystodie,3ce8pk,Blank_VII,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"Meh, shit happens. It strikes me a sign of insecurity, like I'm presenting an obstacle to a hazard they're desperate to clear and so they're attacking it in a blind rage. Folks who don't have survival experience tend to obsess about the physical dangers, but the mental game can really beat you down and is really one of your biggest threats. People crave security and ask themselves how they can prevent bad things from happening to them. The answer is, you don't. You learn to keep on keepin' on when you're tangled up in blue. They have a right to express their concerns to the developers and if it makes 'em feel better to lash out, so be it. I'm already over it."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,Nymall,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that this is a survival game and should therefore have a huge sense of survival. I definitely agree, but that should be in the form of huge hordes or slow, tanky zombies. Ones that seemingly teleport and spawn next to you is unrealistic and it would never happen in real life. Especially if you check a house corner to corner, clearing it out, you hear no zombie sounds and then suddenly you're stunned by a newly spawned zombie.  The new update seemingly made zombies take numerous headshots from any weapon - That alone is hard enough to survive against, minus the fact said zombies are usually in huge hordes. We have enough of a problem fighting off very tanky hordes, we don't need invisible ninja zombies to back them up. It's definitely hard already.  People on this subreddit have a right to express their concerns to the devs, and have a right to agree/disagree with any opinions. However, it's extremely unfair to downvote someone into the ground just because their playstyle is different to theirs.  As long as you're enjoying the game, great! But i feel like the zombies spawning next to you is an unnecessary 'bug' and should be removed from the game. As i said - the tanky hordes make surviving hard enough."

7daystodie,3ce8pk,Djpalko18,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:10:03 2015 UTC,True that. Forge ahead took me and my SO about a week in-game to find. No weapon other than the crossbow seems to get consistent kills with headshots. The blunderbuss is now useless.
7daystodie,3ce8pk,SirNanigans,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:17 2015 UTC,"Okay let me try to explain myself then.  This is supposed to be a survival, adventure, action game right? Right. And it is just that. So we paid for a fun game that would have fair challenges GRANTED that it is in alpha. So yes it will have bugs.  That doesn't mean we are banned from being vocal or upset about those bugs.  A bug is not a feature. Bugs are either funny, weird, and/or unfair. If they are unfair they are certainly a problem. I'm not saying it's weird that you play with the bugs but it is weird that you praise ones that are no fair to a play.   If there were ninja zeds to sneak up on you that would be different and would actually be really cool. If there were teleporting zeds that LEGITIMATELY could pop out of nowhere at any time, that would be different. But in this game, there is mostly normal zombies with some special infected. I did not buy the game for magical teleporting zombies. I bought it for an interesting survival experience with tons of stuff to do. I don't play games that constantly punish me for playing.  Basically games need to have some sort of order to their own chaos. This game's order is a bit broken right now, so it does not interest me right now. I have faith in the Fun Pimps."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,2,Tue Jul 7 23:15:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a feature, and I would put money on it being fixed.   An alternative way to ensure that players need to stay aware is by having zombies spawn barely inside of a player's render distance with a tendency to wander inward toward the player. Make noise a guiding force in where they wander as well.   Then make zombies wander a bit more and moan/mumble less, and you have a game that keeps you on your toes without being cheesy.  If you hang out in your base for long enough, you may open the door to a few unexpected guests who just happened to be passing through town when they heard you forging."
7daystodie,3ce8pk,contarious,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt they're supposed to spawn right on top of your head. I didn't say the system was perfect, just that I liked it. I could be wrong but the fact that they always spawn out of your field of view led me to believe that it was designed to provide those unexpected moments of panic. Wondering how the hell they got there also contributes to the sense of doubt and creeping paranoia.   If I'm really immersed in the game I don't write it off as a poor mechanic, I start questioning my sanity. ""I know I just cleared the house. Didn't I? Am I infected? Is my brain rotting? I just don't know what's real anymore."" I start feeling like a tweaker peeking from behind the curtain every five seconds. That's the sort of unseen enemy you'd really have to face in a survival scenario, and keeping your shit wired tight isn't as easy as you might think.  ""It's alpha"" seems like a tired excuse but it's still valid. Looking back on earlier versions you can see the same rough edges on a lot of aspects that feel much more polished now. There's always room for improvement and I know they're working on the AI, hopefully they'll be able to strike a balance that doesn't upset people so much. Still, it seems rather silly to me to complain that the zombies are making post-apocalyptic life too dangerous and won't let us loot in peace."
7daystodie,3ch4o2,FatMaul,6,Tue Jul 7 21:34:33 2015 UTC,I believe crossbow bolts have a drop off value now just like arrows.
7daystodie,3ch4o2,Tabudragon,2,Tue Jul 7 21:37:35 2015 UTC,I wish I could see where they hit/land although I think they were overpowered before.  I used to get rabbits from so far away it was ridiculous.
7daystodie,3ch4o2,Zillaracing,2,Tue Jul 7 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"Can't confirm, but seems like i read that they were going to apply physics to bow and Xbow."
7daystodie,3ch4o2,DibsArchaeo,2,Tue Jul 7 21:37:42 2015 UTC,Anyone have issues shooting nearly pointblank range and doing no damage with the crossbow? It just thuds and leaves a little dusty dot without doing damage for me 5% of the time.
7daystodie,3ch4o2,Blaktoe,2,Wed Jul 8 05:09:14 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I was shooting zeds from a rooftop and you can see where the bolt strikes the ground on a near miss. Accounting for drop is definitely needed on long shots.
7daystodie,3ch4o2,Nohealz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:30:25 2015 UTC,Yes definitely had drop now.

7daystodie,3cee75,travo5100,4,Tue Jul 7 09:17:55 2015 UTC,Two crossbow bolts? If I could find the forge ahead book that would be great at day 18. It took me about 10 rifle rounds to drop one the other day. Some of them may have missed but it was an expensive kill nonetheless.

Far sooner than zombies, you have to kind of find that sweet spot and have the bear end up closer to the zombies. Usually takes me a few runs through thehorde to hit it. Totally worth it though to watch him tear down zombies for you."
7daystodie,3cee75,TheFlyingDharma,3,Tue Jul 7 21:14:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't survive early game without bears. They kill a billion more zombies than that first bow.
7daystodie,3cee75,gl1tch,2,Tue Jul 7 11:53:07 2015 UTC,They are way too common. I saw three of them all in the same vicinity within the first 10 minutes of the game. Sorry but there most certainly needs some tweaking.
7daystodie,3cee75,khanbob42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:02:35 2015 UTC,"By what standard is three ""way too common""? They are large predators in a post-civilization world where they would naturally spread out and dominate the food chain.  Personally I think pigs in the desert way too common, but nobody's complaining about that because they're not literally the only early game threat other than dogs and night hordes.  Seriously, just walk around them until you can kill them... or drop their spawn chance and realize later that the food economy is balanced such that you'll be spending twice as much time farming and hunting because you took an early game shortcut."

I keep hearing people say ""just back up, just move"".. How to move and avoid death after already dead? i watch the tree fall animation happen AFTER I'm dead and waiting for the timer to be up.  Also, i've died maybe 2 or 3 times in many dozens of tree's cut. it was a rare occurrence for me, difficult to repro in a reasonable amount of time.  that said, i can usually cut down tree's in about 2 chops with a flawless fireaxe, and using cheats to obtain one i've tested this again, and found it's RIGHT as that second blow hits that i die, and this in single player, which pretty much removes the chance that lag is making it SEEM like it happens right away.   be thankful you've been lucky thus far."

There should be no doubt that tree physics are buggy. I have seen trees disappear into the ground (leaving no loot behind too), and seen trees fly up into the sky doing flips..."

7daystodie,3cee75,zdss,3,Tue Jul 7 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"I rarely get hit in melee. Unless there are dogs involved, I can take down entire hordes with wooden clubs.   Keep distance at a maximum and as soon as you swing, step backwards.     If attempting this early game, have a few clubs on your hotbar. You will break 2-4 in the process of killing the horde.  It takes a chunk of time, but it works.   On default difficulty, a non fatty goes down with about 4 headshots with a faulty club, and fatties drop at around ten hits.   Aim for the head - They are zombies after all.  Seriously. What's with the downvotes?  It isn't false info and I even gave you guys a strategy to accomplish this yourselves."

7daystodie,3cfj6s,doomed151,3,Tue Jul 7 15:53:12 2015 UTC,I can support this idea seeing that this game is also considered an RPG. Only in RPGs are where your equipment decides whether 10 hits or 2 hits kill the enemy. Might as well display a health bar for the enemy you're facing.  Good examples would be Fallout 3 and Skyrim.
7daystodie,3cfj6s,Palin_Sees_Russia,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:13 2015 UTC,How is this game an RPG?
7daystodie,3cfj6s,Palin_Sees_Russia,2,Tue Jul 7 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"I think just by definition, RPG or Role Playing Game, it sort of makes sense since you're role playing as a survivalist.  It also offers up a lot of RPG mechanics like leveling up and finding recipes for crafting.  However, it's not really an RPG in the sense that there is no decision making with NPCs."
7daystodie,3cfj6s,doomed151,2,Tue Jul 7 21:27:35 2015 UTC,"In every single game, you are playing the role of somebody. And the leveling is barely on the same tier of RPG's, there are no skills to choose from or anything, you just go up a level. Its an RPG in the same sense as Minecraft is an RPG. And a crafting system is not exclusive to RPG's either, I have tons of games like the Long Dark which implements a crafting mechanic and is no way a role playing game, you wouldnt call DayZ or Unturned an RPG would you? I would categorize 7DTD as an open world survival sandbox. Maybe in the future when it get's out of Alpha, not as of now though."

The floating bubbles would be a bit much for me.  I do like the idea of having a log or somehting so you can easier see the XP gained. What about an XP bar next to the health, hydration and stamina, that way you could hover at any given time to see your progress?"

7daystodie,3cgqfg,jack_danger,2,Tue Jul 7 19:55:08 2015 UTC,I found a house that was floating above a cliff (30+ block drop). I started using wooden frames to bridge out to it. As soon as a frame touched the house the whole thing started to crumble and implode out of existence. I noped out of there. It was surreal.
7daystodie,3cgqfg,gl1tch,2,Tue Jul 7 20:12:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't risk it. We were playing on a private server with some friends when my boyfriend found a small village of floating houses. Suddenly zaaambies started to spawn in the houses and they all started to crumble.

7daystodie,3cgqfg,Tabudragon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"If you are to try, your best bet would be to find the exact middle of the POI, and build up to it.  Pretty sure verticle weight in a non issue, so any type of block should work.    The problem is that the horizontal weight very much matters.  Even if you find the center and support it, the horizontal length away from that center block needs to be distributed properly which you can't do without forcing a block update.  So just build a support post to the middle and cross your fingers.  Might want to make a 1 block overhang to hide under attached to your support post for the likely crushing damage of falling blocks."

7daystodie,3cfpk6,darkpitt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:14:12 2015 UTC,Try looting everything out of a box then exit it and move the mouse off the box and then wait 2 seconds. Then check the boxes again.

When I moved my food from my first fridge, I opened it up and pressed R to take everything out.  Immediately after that the fridge was untouched, opened it up and found two bottles of water.  It's almost as if you have to open the container, press R (to take everything out, even if it's empty), and then it'll be untouched when the container window closes..."

7daystodie,3chap3,Nohealz,3,Tue Jul 7 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"I was curious about this too, and I poked around the items.xml file to see what the deal was.  Turns out that stone arrows do ~7 damage by default. Iron arrows do twice this much (12.5) and steel arrows twice that of iron (25). Crossbow bolts do 50 damage.  The missing part of this equation is that the wooden bow provides a damage modifier to the arrows it fires. Im not sure how this is applied... it could be either a raw bonus or a % modifier based on bow quality.  Another interesting tidbit... all arrows, including bolts, have a 6x damage multiplier for headshots. Hence why body shots with a crossbow to a normal zed need 2-3 hits depending on difficulty level."
7daystodie,3chap3,Professor_Juice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:38:02 2015 UTC,Interesting indeed.
7daystodie,3chap3,HabitualAardvark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"I like that it takes a ton of shots to the body to kill the zeds with the bows, what're you even hitting that's killing them by basically stabbing them with a knife over and over from far away.  Once you get used to how the bow aims (I don't really ever zoom it in, I've gotten good enough to just 'hipfire' the bow at most distances) it's an amazing weapon. Cheap to make, ammo's cheap to make, shoots fast (I was getting almost 3 shots per crossbow shot from my friend in combat, didn't test it under laboratory conditions) and kills with headshots."
7daystodie,3chap3,aholetookmyusername,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:54:05 2015 UTC,"I've had similar issues, bows and arrows rated at 0 damage, even steel tipped arrows.  Zombies just soaking them up, bears too :("
7daystodie,3chap3,ExplodingJesus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"Headshots are critical. At first it would take me 4x headshots to kill one.  As you level up you'll be able to make better bows. Even getting to a ""poor"" bow and levelling up got it back down to 1 headshot for me."

7daystodie,3chap3,UhhNegative,6,Tue Jul 7 22:28:06 2015 UTC,Well after 15 head shots on a crawler i would argue that they don't do damage.
7daystodie,3chap3,drazgul,3,Tue Jul 7 22:36:50 2015 UTC,Interesting... I've not had this experience at all in A12 on the middle difficulty. 4 headshots at the most in my experience.
7daystodie,3chap3,The_JackelN20ZX10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound right, they're terrible early on that's for sure, but I rarely need more than 5-6 for most zombie types. I'd imagine a flawless quality bow with steel tip arrows is another thing, entirely."
7daystodie,3chap3,FlatusGiganticus,2,Tue Jul 7 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair i was using just standard arrows (rock,stick,feather,) but still 15 head shots and no kill. Tried some of the new arrows with the metal fragment tips 3 head shots no kill."
7daystodie,3chap3,UhhNegative,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:52:52 2015 UTC,I much believe the arrows don't 'register' properly on the crawlers.  I can't get headshots.  Other models work fine.
7daystodie,3chap3,FlatusGiganticus,2,Tue Jul 7 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"It is possbile that it is not registering properly. However, i can confirm that crossbows oneshot head shot crawlers, as were body shots require 2 shots. With Wooden bow that was not the case for me."
7daystodie,3chap3,UhhNegative,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:52:45 2015 UTC,I gave up and changed the damage levels (A12) for arrows after shooting over 30 arrows into a zed with no apparent damage.  Ended up beating it to death with a club.  In A11 I could kill a zed with 3-4 arrows to the body or 1-2 to the head.
7daystodie,3chap3,FlatusGiganticus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"That's weird, maybe your bow quality was really low? I haven't had that issue with arrows at all."
7daystodie,3chap3,UhhNegative,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm sure it was low, but that many arrows should do SOMETHING.  It was one of the red dress zombies, so she wasn't even that strong.  I tweaked the arrow damage until it was about how I remembered it on A11.  I'm hoping it was just a bug that will get resolved in future versions, or if it is working as intended, an explanation from the devs so at least I understand what is going on.  As it stands out of the box, I can't make arrows fast enough to kill even a few zombies, which just doesn't sit right.  Also, I think the head hit box on several zombies is bugged.  I can never seem to head shot some of them even at very close range since A12, where I was able to consistently do so before.  The arrow just seems to pass right through.  If it was just dropping due to gravity, I'd expect a body shot."
7daystodie,3chap3,FlatusGiganticus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that doesn't sound right, but it's worth noting that just because a strategy was successful in A11 doesn't mean it will be successful in A12. That doesn't mean it's broken, just different. My friend and I have had a lot of success using wood log spikes. You can simply get a big train of zombies to follow you then lead them into a wood log spike trap. Very effective in terms of resource cost. Later when you get the crossbow, better arrows, or guns you can take the zombies on directly. I've also had a lot of success using melee weapons."
7daystodie,3chap3,UhhNegative,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"No doubt.  Actually, just last night I set up a zombie trap similar to that.  I went into a large concrete building and lit a camp fire in the middle of the second floor to draw them in.  I filled the bottom floor with log spikes.  That night was the day 28 hoard.  Amazingly effective strategy.  The gore pile was literally up the ceiling in most of the room.  It was so full, I had to hack my way back out the back wall.  It was glorious."
7daystodie,3chap3,HabitualAardvark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:04:14 2015 UTC,Haha that's awesome! Yeah I've been loving using wood log spikes. Unfortunately the cabin we were using got overrun eventually at day 10. We also made a metric shit ton of the regular wood spikes because you level up quickly and they are decent outer protection to at least slow them down and kill a few so there's not so much gore on the main spikes.
7daystodie,3chap3,Tabudragon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:46:00 2015 UTC,I wonder.  Do we get points for killing with spikes?
7daystodie,3chap3,rezanow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"I think we don't. I could be wrong, but it makes sense because it's lower risk than fighting directly so it would be too easy if you leveled up that way."
7daystodie,3chap3,Muriako,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"It really sounds to me like something is wrong connection-wise here, I just logged into my server and with a faulty bow and stone arrows 2-3 headshotted most zombies (I think I got a 1 shot headshot kill on a crawler but he was amongst cacti and so that's not a perfectly scientific case) and with the exception of the bloated hawaiian shirt guys iron arrows were a 1 shot headshot kill.  Have you tested it in singleplayer?  EDIT: Bow's quality is 71. EDIT AGAIN: Clarified 2-3 shots as headshots."
7daystodie,3chap3,croppergib,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"No, only on a multilayer server... Ill look into this, good research. I can probably chalk it up to weird connection issue."
7daystodie,3chap3,The_JackelN20ZX10,0,Wed Jul 8 02:38:40 2015 UTC,I believe the damage modifier comes from the bow itself.
7daystodie,3chap3,The_JackelN20ZX10,3,Tue Jul 7 22:21:14 2015 UTC,That could be but i shot a crawler in the head 15 time and it didnt die. I think there is a problem here.

7daystodie,3cdfc4,ExplodingJesus,3,Tue Jul 7 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"As for the forge ahead book: you can find prefab forges in cabins and I think some other prefabs. That's there to counter the new difficulty in finding that book.  As for infection, I think they intend for you to just run and avoid zombies at first. It's counter-intuitive after playing A11 as you could just slay away with the bow or whatever. Now you really have to weigh if it's worth the encounter.  The melee range on longer weapons like a club absolutely needs to get extended. I guess they want to make it challenging and risky to walk up to them... but if I'm swinging a club or whatever I expect to get a little range."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,ExplodingJesus,2,Tue Jul 7 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"You bring up some great points. I actually found a forge on my first world but I died so many times that I couldn't continue the file.  Melee is so bad in the new update. It just seems random now. I've swing at zombies and I've missed, then the zombie will swing and then they miss. Then I'll back up to dodge an attack and I'll get hit. So the zombies reach extends randomly and can cause massive damage. This has happened about three times so far, so it doesn't seem like it's a small issue."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,Feycat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:20:10 2015 UTC,Is that on SP or MP? I've personally had a terrible experience with P2P's performance and MP via dedicated server is much better... but sometimes that little bit of lag that comes up will wreck your chances of successful melee.

7daystodie,3cdfc4,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:51:02 2015 UTC,That would be fine if we could pick them up and carry them... but the chances of finding that prefab are actually worse than randomly picking up a Forge Ahead.
7daystodie,3cdfc4,GenerallyObtuse,3,Tue Jul 7 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"I'll second the zombie reach thing.  It's ridiculously frustrating early on, you can't hardly get a swing in without getting hit, because you don't have the strength or weapon to knock them back, so you many hit them, but they're still swinging back.  I feel like I get better reach without a weapon equipped, just punching them.  Now since I've been hit a few times, I am infected, and I can only swing a handful of times before I have no stamina.  No stamina means I don't do hardly any damage per hit.  I can't run away either.  Might as well die and start over at this point, because I'll never find any antibiotics.  Concerning your second point a little, the safe needing ""broken"" open is really frustrating.  Early game, it takes well over 100 hits (it took me 140 hits on one!) with a stone axe to break it open, and you don't even get anything worthwhile!  Woo, a couple weapon parts.  There has to be a way to make them less accessible than to waste half a (game) day to get nothing.  Alerting zombies?  spawning some outside?  Something other than wasting a ton of time and a ton of hits on the only tool I have on day 1."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"For the safe, I think requiring it to be broken is okay, it should just be made a bit less durable.  Something like 15 seconds of beating with a good quality pickaxe at full stamina?  That still probably doesn't translate well to a faulty stone axe, but the player should get the hint.  In addition, it could also generate a huge burst of heat when opened or smashed."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,GenerallyObtuse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"If they're going to make us work that hard for it, it should have a better loot table.  Spending all that time and effort breaking into a gun safe and just finding some pistol parts and a sawed-off shotgun stock (both faulty, of course) makes me very annoyed."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Maybe make loot from locked safes spawn 1-2 tiers higher, or as though your player were 10-20 levels higher?  If possible, it should follow normal spawning rules on respawn though IMO."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,GenerallyObtuse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"In general the level-based loot system seems wonky.  Why would there be more flawless steel pickaxes laying around later?  It was a game-changer when you'd be looting something early-game and you'd find an iron pickaxe (pre-item-quality).  I'd do a little dance and start smashing boulders everywhere, now that it doesn't take 27 hits to do it anymore.  Now we're in the situation where when you need help there's nothing and when you're set up and stable it'll give you things you don't need anymore.  That seems like an odd choice.  I am not very deep into A12 yet, but so far it feels like it's going to be very, very linear and grindy with no sudden windfalls.  Edit: I wonder if the 'right' meta-game choice now is just to hole up on day one with 100 logs and go through making wood spikes, breaking them down to planks, then making frames (IIRC).  You lose wood but the xp gain was pretty nice in A11."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,SirNanigans,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"It is a little wonky and a little unrealistic, but I think it really does break the game too much to have too good tools too fast.  I would give bonuses to loot from certain locations, like the bonus to safe loot.  Maybe have the crates in big stores have a bonus to their loot levels, same with the loot from police officers, etc.  You could even have items looted from a big city have a bonus compared to items from a small town, that way players are forced to enter more dangerous situations to get better items.  You do run into sudden windfalls still, but they're more rare and less glorious.  Finding a good chainsaw in a car on the first day and great pistol with 43 rounds in a purse on the 2nd were both windfalls IMO, but not big enough to really break the progression of the game for me.  Windfalls should be rare enough that they actually feel like a windfall, and there should be different forms, such that you don't feel cheated when you find a flawless spiked club on day 2 when last world you found a great iron pickaxe day 2."

The exact same scenario you brought up happens all the time. Once you're infected you should just give up unless you have all the equipment needed to make the antibiotics (I still can't find potassium). I haven't come across a safe yet, but I've heard they're really messed up."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,Feycat,2,Tue Jul 7 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Lots of these issues are real and many agree with you. However, just keep in mind that the direction the game is going in right now is ""to completion"". Sometimes this will mean making early game harder, sometimes making late game buggy, and sometimes making only aesthetic changes.   The game actually doesn't exist yet, because it isn't complete. We're playing q collection of objects, textures, and codes that will eventually be part of 7 Days to Die, but are current just aj incomplete pile of stuff. When the developers focus on one aspect of the game now, it's because that's what they chose to build next, not because that's what's most important to them. Also, these new things will be buggy as all hell, and more buggy with the size of the update.  Don't be discouraged about the direction of the game or the apparent priorities of the developers. As an incomplete game, there will be updates that baffle and disappoint the players who aren't directly involved with development and simply can't imagine why they would do such things. Do, however, voice your concerns about bugs and problems as you have. That's why they invited us to play their incomplete game (and maybe also funding)."
7daystodie,3cdfc4,bobdylan401,2,Tue Jul 7 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"Talking about luck. On my current game I spawned near a hardware store, gas station and book store. The hardware store had crates with over 30 rebar frames, 60 wood frames, fire axe and pick. Forge ahead and many others in book store This was in a wasteland so there was plenty of cement for me to start building reinforced cement blocks on the first day.   It was incredible."

7daystodie,3cf2hy,ExplodingJesus,4,Tue Jul 7 12:22:40 2015 UTC,You need to have the book for the particular weapon you want to make/break. Each weapon needs a different book.
7daystodie,3cf2hy,denhal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, ok. I could swear I have the pistol book but still can't break down pistols. But maybe I've got my maps mixed up.  How will it manifest in the crafting menu? Would something along the lines of disassembly show up in the right click menu for a pistol?"
7daystodie,3cf2hy,denhal,2,Tue Jul 7 12:55:54 2015 UTC,On the right hand side there is a recycle symbol. In that menu there is a breakdown option. Any weapon or bullet goes in the OUTPUT slot. For weapons you get all parts back. For bullets you only get 1 piece back.

7daystodie,3cf2hy,Stargos,2,Tue Jul 7 13:05:43 2015 UTC,You can definitely disassemble the pistol without knowing how to put it together.  See the great quality pistol parts just waiting in my chest and the poor quality pistol in my inventory...

7daystodie,3ce2mc,MCRoadkill,3,Thu Jul 9 08:30:02 2015 UTC,"Nights 35 and 42 were brutial for our group. 35 was us stuck in the top floor of our base shooting every shot from every weapon we had into the mass of zombies below then waiting  till sunrise  as they destroy every chest and everything we own ;(. Then we hop down around 7 only to meet up with the teeth of several dogs that chased us down. .... Death loop begins until I punch the last one to death.   42 was spent 30 blocks to the side of our base and 30 blocks in the air.  This time watching the horde tear down the ground level.  Chest in basement survived. (I'll never keep them on the ground level again ) The night ends and we all storm the 2nd floor of the wooden fort via the cat walk focusing the dogs and cops first. A few of the brave souls jump off the roof in an effort to draw away the dogs each with mixed results... But we heard each of them scream out in pain a short while after jumping.  Just as we get the last few cops, ferals, and burning zombies cleaned up and decend into the mess that is the rest of our base we see them running up the hill about 11am a daytime dog horde! 15 of them at least. A few of us scramble to the roof others were not so lucky...  So far I've learned there is no way I can have enough ammo. We need as many walls (not of wood) as we can manage. And finally never put the chest/storage anywhere near were a zombie will be swinging to try and get to you because they will be destroyed even through solid walls.   Tldr : watch for dogs and keep chest far away from swinging zombies."

7daystodie,3cdtsb,congoman365,6,Tue Jul 7 03:24:06 2015 UTC,Once you find the Gas Can recipe you can break down oil barrels.   They smelt for a decent amount of scrap as well.
7daystodie,3cdtsb,CasperHarkin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"Decent is quite an understatement. Each barrel yields 54 scrap, which is 9 ingots. Easiest iron harvest ever. It seems like a bug, but since you're sacrificing precious fuel the temptation does present a difficult survival choice."
7daystodie,3cdtsb,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,2,Tue Jul 7 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"Hahaha true enough, its a lot of iron; the value of gas still outweighs the value of iron by a mile in my mind tho."
7daystodie,3cdtsb,CasperHarkin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, I absolutely agree. Iron is everywhere if you're willing to put in a little work, that's what makes the choice so devious. This example may not have been intentional, but I love TFP because they seem to have a really good grasp of what survivalism is really all about. They have a way of forcing you to change the way you think, and punishing you for falling back into that pre-apocalyptic convenience store mentality. This is no longer a soft world of comfort and immediate gratification.  I think that's one of the things that sets 7DTD apart from all the other cookie-cutter survival games on the market. As the vast number of corpses who though they'd be safe behind a few scraps of wood nailed across the door could attest, doing things the easy way is bound to cost you big in the long run. Life isn't going to be handed to us on a silver platter, and if something seems too good to be true it probably is. Everyone thinks rationing their supplies will be easy... until their bellies start to rumble."
7daystodie,3cdtsb,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,2,Tue Jul 7 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, they seem to have tapped into my subconscious to grant me a game both devilishly demanding yet godly in its sense of reward. Some people complain about the game being too hard, or the beginning being too grindy with the new loot system. I personally love it, I should have to strive to survive, and I want serious consequences for mistakes. If I design my base badly then I deserve to be raided, if I am inpatient and run through the hub city, I deserve a hunting rifle round to the back of my head. At the same time, if I see a base that has obvious weaknesses I will raid it, if I hear someone running around I will murder them unless they announce themselves as friendly. I cant wait for the hot / cold system to add immersion as well, I really liked it in Don’t Starve.   TLDR; I like the game, I like how hard it is, I like the tough choices, the consequences for bad design / habits and the constant fear of death."

7daystodie,3ce0a8,danaere,3,Tue Jul 7 05:06:02 2015 UTC,"Just run it on your own computer. It's super easy, as 7 days comes with a server tool.   In steam go to Tools and download the 7 days dedicated server.  You can run the server here by launching the start server config. But the better way is to use a server manager like frontrunner tek. There's another online server manager, but I'm too lazy to look it up.   Then add Allocs server fixes.   Then just start the server and play the game. Doesn't cost you a penny and as long as you have a decent internet connection and computer shouldn't have any issues.   I don't mind doing a write up but only if there's huge interest. Otherwise just google it. FrontRunner Tek has a how to video.   EDIT: I play with 3 other people. I would bet that less than 7-8 people should be ok running on your computer, but if you plan on running a huge server to the public you are gonna need to outsource it."

My friend and I did like 16 hours (real time) on our new map since we started up alpha 12 late yesterday. The entrances don't seem to be as big or obvious as they were before. Look on your map for black specs (black, not dark ""enter color"" but black). We did a huge sweep around our house and I ended up going 2.3 kilometers away from our house because that was the only spot on my map that looked like it could have even possibly been a cave entrance. And it was, but much later I tried going to some miscellaneous small specs on my map (and yes they showed up, so I just walked right past them without noticing earlier in the game when I was walking around) and they were all caves, they were just super small so I thought nothing of them. But again, make sure they're black, not some dark colored patch. You've probably walked past a few. I tried another map quickly just to see if the abnormally small entrances were map specific or not, and they werent, I found a few super small entrance caves immediately."

I tried to sneak into the city hub before I was ready and got mauled by dogs, so no night 4.  I've found bears pretty trivial to outrun/avoid/kite around objects.  Honestly, I'm not seeing an increase in difficulty.  We'll see how that changes once I get myself settled and invite a horde to play.  I have noticed a distinct lack of rivers, though I've come across quite a few small ponds.  I've also seen some really wacky roads (shooting up the side of a mountain, meandering all over the place with no real purpose).  I also haven't yet found (in 3 starts) any neighborhoods.  Just tent camps, lone multi-story cabins, and an army base (strafed into land mine, derp!)  I've followed roads from spawn to 0,0 hub in each start without seeing anything that would even pass for a truck-stop town.  Edit:  One thing I have noticed, however, is that stealth is WAY better.  I can sneak past zombies much closer than I feel like I used to be able to."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,GenerallyObtuse,7,Mon Jul 6 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"Well said. This is the only game I know that actually is about survival. Most other games use that as a tag line to cover their arcade shooter/deathmatch elements. With A12, me and my friend are playing with high zombie spawn rate, have ~60 wellness, haven't built a forge yet (day 10) and it's difficult as hell. And we've never had more fun! I spent a full day just travelling to a ""nearby"" forest cabin to use its forge to get us a bunch of iron and brass ingots.      Sure, there are things that need fixing, but difficulty-wise the game is at its peak. It's no longer a Minecraft zombie tower defense, it's an actual survival game. I'm hoping for a hotfix addressing the lighting issues, otherwise it's all good."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,SKEW_YOU,4,Mon Jul 6 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"I'm good with lots of zombies (adds to the frantic-ness and more survival less FPS feel), wooden bow being shit (It's 6 sticks and some grass, it should be shit), hell even stun lock (if you get touched by a zombie in a zombie apocalypse, you should be boned).   What I'm NOT good with is insta-dying because a shovelful of dirt fell on my head. Shit's pretty weak. That's about my only complaint- debris damage should be far more balanced."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,chabo_son_of_chabo,4,Tue Jul 7 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"I want to quote you every time I see someone complaining about the bow being nerfed. You're right, it is nothing but 6 sticks and some grass lol."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,contarious,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:59:25 2015 UTC,High zombie spawn rate is nuts. I can barely handle it at medium by myself and I even turned it down to low for the first couple days. Crafting is a little easier now so maybe trying to make that stone axe while being chased by 5 zombies isn't has hard anymore.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Stargos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"It's just a bunch of stupid grind in the early game to distract you from the fact that the endgame is every bit as shallow as before and gated off entirely by RNG.  There is no progression.  Moving from stone axe to iron tools doesn't even make sense before ~ lv30 because you'll just be on a hamster wheel of using your iron tools to gather iron to repair your iron tools.  With a stone axe, any extra time spent hitting a tree/door/whatever is made up by the fact that the materials to repair/make new are abundant.  So now if you're smart you just slowly struggle along with a stone axe and play ""Rummaging Simulator Z"" until you get lucky and find an auger, chainsaw or some better tools.   And then you go right into endgame easy mode, just like before.     Yes, it's more difficult until you get lucky with RNG, but progression is entirely fucked.  Survival shouldn't be just luck.  If you play smart you should progress accordingly.  Right now you don't.  You just suffer until you hit the lottery."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Arm-the-homeless,7,Tue Jul 7 19:45:29 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying the new update as well, only complain is that I haven't seen the sun in 11 game days....who knew I miss daylight LOL But that's minor, has not kept me from playing, and as a past ""damn my melee skills are SHIT"" I have been improving on that as well!"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Floralblanket,3,Mon Jul 6 15:59:55 2015 UTC,Lol melee is a lot rougher now. If you go to the desert you should have plenty of sun. :)
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Floralblanket,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"Omg! Want a good laugh? I looooooove the desert, and that's where I set up temp base (and then realized halfway to city and perm base so worked well) and I have no sun in the desert. My perm base in woodland and raining all the time there too! Lol  Funny enough was exploring more in desert and hit patch where take two steps and rain stopped, sun peaked, take two more and back on downpour - I had a good laugh, thought I was in a cartoon!"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,drewoncampus29,3,Mon Jul 6 16:36:58 2015 UTC,I live in the desert IRL and this actually happens.  It's pretty weird.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Floralblanket,2,Mon Jul 6 23:52:48 2015 UTC,I live in FL and rain here & not across the street is pretty common lol

7daystodie,3cb1v4,recruiterguy,7,Mon Jul 6 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm enjoying this patch so far. I just made my first poor quality pickax and faulty hunting rifle and it feels like big accomplishments. I did get super lucky and found a forge ahead book on the first day though.  The bears...I love the bears. I will circle around a town and get the zombies to follow me, then I run them into a bear and let them kill each other."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,kyuss80,5,Mon Jul 6 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you.  My only complaint about this update is how dark the game is now - even during the day.  It's not so dark that I'm not playing, however.  For me, this rivals the excitement I had when playing Fallout 3 for years.  Love it."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Fix_Lag,4,Mon Jul 6 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. I'm really enjoying how much harder the game is. It's a bit tedious ... took me almost a week to find the first Forge Ahead book, of course, now I've found half a dozen  But for the most part I am happy. I have a few issues with tree's having a weird sprite-like bug at a distance, floating buildings in random gen worlds (which provided a REALLY fun experience last night where my friend and I dared each other to run through a floating barn while it was collapsing), zombies leaving their feet in slow motion physics when you kill them, the issue with guns floating in air and being seen through walls...  I'm not getting 7 day hordes on any increment so far, so that's kind of disappointing, I may need to restart the server... anyone having problems?  Other than that I really like alpha 12, none of these bugs are game breaking, just distractions."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,kyuss80,3,Mon Jul 6 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"I was really mad when no horde showed up on day 7 just like in Alpha 11, which was broken.  But then it showed up on night 10 and I had loads of fun with my friend as we tried to barricade the door while killing zombies, only to be chased onto the second floor and then out into the woods as our defenses failed.  That was the kind of experience I play this game for.  7th day hordes are definitely not behaving like they should, though."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Lucullus76,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:23:17 2015 UTC,We got a horde on day 27 last night and it was awful. We weren't even prepared. I was out in the street playing with the mini bike I just bought. Our defenses weren't ready and we were just casually talking.   We both died twice. I got pinned under a stairs vestibule while retreating backwards. Feral and many more. It was crazy intense.   I almost wish we had a way to have random horses attack after a set range of days. Would be less predictable.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Van_Tek,5,Tue Jul 7 13:12:17 2015 UTC,Apart from the bugs and lack of rivers/lakes I love it.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,rezanow,6,Mon Jul 6 15:45:25 2015 UTC,Just gotta get some of dat tasty tasty toilet water. Fill up your empty jars with it and make some toilet wine on the ol' campfire!  Mm-mm good!
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Van_Tek,3,Mon Jul 6 18:13:55 2015 UTC,waitwut? I can fill my jars there?!?
7daystodie,3cb1v4,rezanow,2,Mon Jul 6 19:11:35 2015 UTC,My exact reaction when my g/f told me about it lol
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Van_Tek,2,Mon Jul 6 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"I've killed so many toilets for the bars. I'd have left one in the building we took over if I had known. =(    It's ok, though. I found that the water mechanics are a bit of a mess and that I can refill water jars infinitely from a pool of water. So, I grab a bucket of water, take it back to my house, and make a pool. Then I can gather all the water I want without leaving the house! lolz"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,chaos0510,3,Mon Jul 6 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's how I used to do it, but the toilet thing is much easier on a fresh game, cuz you can do it almost right away and then boom, infinite water supply!"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,lrdm,4,Mon Jul 6 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"I really don't get the bear hate. I've never had them agro unless I was 10 - 20 ft from them. Never tried taking one on in a fight, but they are easy to run from. I do think however that the spawning frequency of bears is a tad bit high, but then again I haven't really been in too much danger around them.  I do think that the newest patch added some much needed difficulty. Just like you, I was getting atleast a thousand or so kills per life. Now, I've died 5 times in the just in the early game.  As always, I trust TFP to listen to the community and make whatever changed they feel are best for the game."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,chaos0510,3,Mon Jul 6 16:21:26 2015 UTC,I like bears. They drop a lot of food. Bear Stew is currently one of the best meals in the game.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,ExplodingJesus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:15 2015 UTC,Bears are man's best friend. Obviously not dogs because they'll kill your ass in this game.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,chaos0510,3,Mon Jul 6 18:05:05 2015 UTC,They're muscle for hire. They cost one arrow from a roof and it gets you a bunch of dead zombies. Pretty good deal imo :P
7daystodie,3cb1v4,ExplodingJesus,3,Mon Jul 6 18:45:16 2015 UTC,You mean like firing an arrow from a rooftop to draw them closer? Sounds perfect.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,chaos0510,3,Mon Jul 6 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If they're really far away it might take a couple shots. But for that easy zombie removal, not bad.  ...provided they don't accidentally flatten the house you're hiding on :D"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Stargos,2,Mon Jul 6 19:29:16 2015 UTC,You....You're a genius. Thank you for the tip good sir. May your nights be undead free and your kills be swift
7daystodie,3cb1v4,ExplodingJesus,2,Mon Jul 6 19:32:19 2015 UTC,Bears do a lot of damage to wood structures. I had one chase me into my brand new log cabin and he tore down at least a dozen blocks in a minute.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,threecatsdancing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"You should be good as long as you're far enough up that the bear forgets you before runs out of zombies. But yea, they really mess up wood if given the chance."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,SteveEsquire,2,Mon Jul 6 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah bears are rarely an issue for me. One gave me the hug of death because I got excited about a supply crate. I didn't see the bear, just heard him so I thought I was in the clear. Nope. Chuck Testa(bear)."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,chaos0510,2,Mon Jul 6 16:45:28 2015 UTC,I haven't died once. Yep. I'm awesome.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,ShadowRam,2,Mon Jul 6 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any real issue with them (I just run away). But the spawns are a little crazy. I live in a very wooded area. I see about 6 deer a day and I've never once seen a wild bear. I know it shouldn't be completely realistic, but it's a little dumb seeing bear after bear after bear."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Stargos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"The patch notes said something about longer respawn time for animals...but they upped the spawn rate? Lol, I can't walk through the desert without hearing a rabbit get impaled by a cactus every 10 seconds"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,UhhNegative,4,Tue Jul 7 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"There was a bear in a grocery store...  I broke in, start stealing and heard it, and thought it was outside.  Open up the back room, and there it was.  It ignored me, until I pulled some raw meat out of a box.  Bear chased me out of the grocery store.  The start of this game is now much more challenging. (as it should be). I'm liking it so far."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Blaktoe,2,Mon Jul 6 17:07:28 2015 UTC,lol that's great. I love stories that end up in having to leg it like that. It's refreshing after playing all the one-man-army-savior-of-all types.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,TheXenocide314,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:21:22 2015 UTC,I noticed that zombies seem to now be spawning inside locked rooms to surprise you. I walked by a metal shack and heard some banging from the inside. There was about 4 of them in there.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Blaktoe,3,Mon Jul 6 21:19:14 2015 UTC,I agree I'm having a lot more fun this update. A friend and I played a full 7 days in our first session and managed to survive decently (I died thrice) with a very liberal usage of wooden spikes. I'm loving the difficulty now and the zombie spawning seems a lot better.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Van_Tek,25,Mon Jul 6 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"You're not in the minority. The real minority is the complainers; the vocal minority. The players that are happy, or simply have patience to wait for bug fixes don't make a lot of forum posts."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Lock1454,9,Mon Jul 6 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"patience to wait   Im fairly new to 7days. How long do you usually have to wait for a hotfix after a large update? This new update is unplayable for buggy reasons.   (i know you can go back to previous versions, but i really wanna fight some bears)"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,rstallard91,4,Mon Jul 6 16:02:01 2015 UTC,Patch 11 released on 04.02 and the first patch came out 04.04. As the initial few days was a holiday weekend I would expect a patch within a few days.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,mrbudha1456,5,Mon Jul 6 16:46:44 2015 UTC,"Funny thing was, the people who went ballistic on A11's release just kept being rude after that patch came out, even though TFP stuck around and worked on the weekend to get it done.  Basically, people who complain about this game just seem to enjoy being nit-picky.  Personally, I think the devs are smashing it left and right! Any time a bug comes around that really puts a bone in peoples' craws, they work their asses off to fix it so people can have fun while testing their game.  The complainers really need to take a look at a BAD alpha game in order to appreciate how amazing this one is. I recommend DayZ Standalone! I bought that game a full year ago and the zombies were a broken mess of glitches, teleportation, hitting people even though the zombie's on the ground floor of an apartment and the player's on the 5th floor, not being able to be hit by melee weapons because the zombie isn't actually where your screen tells you it is, etc etc etc. People complain about it every single time they announce a new update and it's still nowhere close to being fixed.  Now take the latest major bug from 7 Days, the leg-breaking bug. People complained about it constantly from the start of A11 and the devs fixed it ASAP. Took em a few tries to get it figured out, but that's how it goes."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,merlinfire,3,Mon Jul 6 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I also enjoy that many of my dislikings for the game can be editted to be more in line with what I'd prefer.  There were too many bears for my liking so I knocked the spawn rate down to .15.  I hate feral zombies & dogs so I put them all the way down at .01 (ie never going to see one).    The ferals probably have something to do with my only being with the game since the summer sale and not having the know-how to build a proper base, I found it annoying that ferals just come beating down my squatting cabin's door even though I'm hunkered down in the dark with absolutely nothing happening :(  But if I'm too slow in getting back to my cabin before sundown or if I'm cooking up a storm in there I'm still getting some miffed runners knocking at my door."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,threecatsdancing,3,Mon Jul 6 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"It's really not that bad if you take is slowly from the start. I found a water tower and just whacked the side of it with my stone axe. Water spilled out, now I have a decent source of water."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,CasperHarkin,3,Mon Jul 6 16:07:49 2015 UTC,"My issue was I was having so much damn fun previously.  I've only had the game a couple weeks but I had finally got the hang of it and started building my base.  Then the update drops and I have to relearn the whole game.  Still super fun I just feel like I had just worked my way to some freedom in the game to explore and find cool shit and now I'm back shitting my pants in an attic.    I bet there are other people in my spot, summer sale just ended and it had to have added a good amount of players."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,eyewant2believe,3,Mon Jul 6 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"i will say i'm feeling a much greater degree of challenge, but all the challenge is still front-loaded, it is just front-loaded a little harder and longer than before.  this will be punishing for newbies"
7daystodie,3cb1v4,ExplodingJesus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:55:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. Once you get the forge and can crank out iron arrows it's much closer to A11
7daystodie,3cb1v4,nemesishaven,3,Mon Jul 6 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"I couldn’t agree more, I am loving Alpha 12 and I haven’t even got to the point where I have a bike.   This game should be hard, bears without humans f’ing with them would profligate fairly well in a zed apocalypse, hard to kill and protective of cubs so I like the idea of the countryside being overtaken by them.   Also love the new locked safe idea, I admit I didn’t at the start, and then again at the start I didn’t have a decent pickaxe."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,threecatsdancing,3,Mon Jul 6 23:16:25 2015 UTC,just uninstalled out of frustration of dying 5 times in a row to a single stunlock after almost getting somewhat of a start. 2 frustrating 4 me m8
7daystodie,3cb1v4,CasperHarkin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:48:45 2015 UTC,I got ruined a couple times in a row to a night 7 horde. It was rough going.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Arcturus519,3,Tue Jul 7 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"I loaded up as soon as the patch came out. My initial impression was that all of the new stuff was great. I loved the menu's new convenience, more books\schematics and all that.  Then I died trying to play like A11. Like... a few times. And yea, I hit bugs like infinitely spawning dogs (at least a tree hasn't killed me... yet).   After getting frustrated I tinkered with difficulty and zombie spawn settings. Now it's back to being very enjoyable but with all of the upgrades, new additions and new gameplay. It's very enjoyable again.  Meanwhile I have a friend that QQ'd because he got schooled and uninstalled it without even trying to fiddle with settings.  Yes, it's different. Yes, it's a bad feeling as the house you're on is torn out from under you. No, I don't like spending 20 minutes trying to open a gun safe only to find junk parts (I just skip them for now, until I can get some better tools). But simply tweaking those readily accessible settings on launch makes it just as much fun as the A11 experience... but with all of the new stuff and without being end game on day 4.   I was also a bit put off by how long night lasts with how hard it was at first. Quit at nighttime -> time scale to 10 minutes -> Quit at daybreak -> time scale to whatever up to 120.  The last part is a bit BS'ish and wouldn't really work on a server or with a group. But it's made it more enjoyable for me. I was just sitting and letting the game run while I played on my phone so I don't really feel too terrible about short-cutting with the alternative being just not playing."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,xblindguardianx,3,Mon Jul 6 15:17:46 2015 UTC,I've been doing the exact same thing with Night/Day management. Otherwise I'm just sitting on a rooftop waiting. That may change as I progress but in early game it's just way too dangerous to do anything at night.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,ironplated,2,Mon Jul 6 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"What many people dont realize, is that if you set the cycle to 18 hours, night doesnt start until about 11:55pm. You can do shit until around 11/11:30pm and you're fine."

Dog day 6 was insane! Day 7 was silent as the lambs. (think they trolling me), day 13 was not dog day and day 14/15 was the same as any other normal night.  20 deaths in 15 days. A+++ would die again."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Secateurs,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:21 2015 UTC,love the game! I havent played in months though because I'm waiting for a point for maps to stop resetting after every patch. it's so frustrating playing for hours then there is an update and wipes my game.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,IAmPartialToRed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:36:06 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. I've heard talk that server map resets are not going to be a thing anymore but can't confirm for sure. So this may be your patch!
7daystodie,3cb1v4,GotBetterThingsToDo,2,Tue Jul 7 05:49:55 2015 UTC,"For the most part I love the game.  The things that I don't like are related to graphic issues (darkness in forests, weather glitches) that are expected since it's alpha and ever changing.  I like the difficultly, and I am excited about the idea of hot/cold survival that's planned.  I just want the things that are in the game to work as intended when it is finally finished.    I'm currently on day 13, level 15 with 2 deaths due to the dogs on day 6.  I killed the first wave, but wasn't expecting a second and third pack later in the day.  I've got a decent starter base set up in a three story brick POI.  I walled off the bottom floor, tore out the stairs and installed ladders to reach the second floor, with a ring of metal reinforced wood frames to keep spiders from climbing.  I dug out 2 rows around the building and filled them with reinforced spikes for defense. I've found quite a few schematics and books, but still searching for the forge ahead book.  I've found three towns that I've been ferrying loot from back to my main base.  I managed to find a shit quality spiked bat a few days in, which I constantly repair with pipes turned to metal strips.  I watch my stamina before fighting and it usually takes only 2 hits to kill a zombie with it.  The first few days I avoided fighting, and I still try to avoid a fight if I can.  Waiting to get a better quality bow before I start using one as I found early on that the low quality one and stone arrows are shit.  In past games by now I'd have a reinforced concrete bunker and be thinking about starting a new game."

I'm a very experienced player and I play cautiously, but it's ridiculously hard to survive where I spawned, and I haven't found better places yet.  I'm on day seven. I've been counting bears for posterity; in seven days while only looting/foraging a very small area I have seen 59 bears. I've been killed by them six times; one senses me and I'm done, because I don't have the stamina to outrun them.  I've been killed four times by random spawn dog hordes which pop in within 50m of me and beeline for me. No chance of success there, either.  I've been killed twice by zombies, which are ever-present despite me clearing a wide swath around my encampent every morning. I have 257 zombie kills, all with a iron reinforced club. I have found a sniper rifle schematic, all of the parts for a magnum and both sawed off and full shotguns, and some for a SMG and hunting rifle, all which are useless because I can't figure out apparently how to assemble four parts for a gun without a blueprint. I have found a schematic for leather gloves as well, also useless because I haven't found the book to make leather.   I have not found a forge book, so I am using a stone axe, a week in. I have found a forge in the world in a building but there are currently four bears milling around outside it, so it's not something I can actually use.  Zombies in towns seems logical. Large counts of zombies in the wilderness is silly and overblown. I can't loot many of the out-in-the-wild buildings near me because there are too many zombies, day and night. I kill them, they respawn almost as fast as I kill them.  I have died thrice this game from chopping trees which sometimes wall oddly. twice they dropped through the stump to the ground on the final cut and instakill me regardless. Once the tree hit the ground and began to spin wildly and ended up on the far side where I was, killing me and destroying my backpack. Lost my only iron tool find that way, a shovel.  I have lost my backpack on six other occasions, all of which were the bear attacks. I assume that when they kill me they stomp the pack too.  I found a deer stuck against a rock wall today in-game. I decided to see if I could down it with arrows from my beginner bow. It took 37 arrows from five feet away to down a deer. That's ridiculous.  So, I'm glad you're having fun. The issue most of us seem to have is that the limitations seem to be RNG-based, and there is a lot of imbalance in the game right now. I've been playing for a year, and have over 900 hours logged. I know how things work, I am careful. I should not be struggling this badly in a game I know this well when I'm doing everything ""right"", from a survival perspective.  tl;dr: YMMV."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,drewoncampus29,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:27:35 2015 UTC,That sounds even more brutal than what ours has been like. What's the seed you are playing on?
7daystodie,3cb1v4,rezanow,2,Tue Jul 7 12:29:52 2015 UTC,11alpha. I know it's 12 but I wanted to see the difference in the map with the same seed I used for 11.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,drewoncampus29,4,Tue Jul 7 16:17:07 2015 UTC,"I love this patch and I'd have made a post like this if I wasn't so immersed in playing it currently. There are still a lot of old bugs along with new ones, but that shouldn't surprise anyone.  I have a feeling the people complaining about every little thing on day 1 are the vocal minority here. If they'd play the game instead of tweaking the difficulty or ragequitting I think they'd understand and enjoy it more. Thankfully most of them will have quit soon and we'll start seeing more positive comments. It's already happening."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,rezanow,2,Mon Jul 6 14:57:49 2015 UTC,I am loving it. There are lots of bears though. My buddy from Chi-town says there are never too many bears.  Dying from a tree falling on me was so shocking and AMAZING!
7daystodie,3cb1v4,CasperHarkin,2,Mon Jul 6 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"I also like the way the current game plays. It's a lot less picking through garbage and looting, and a lot more crafty and strategic. I have had a lot of fun being infected and having to risk life and limb going through the city climbing in to an apartment building scouring the bathrooms for antibiotics, only to be saved literally in the last hour I had left from an airdrop. Hiding on a roof doesn't guarantee safety from zombies, I have literally had to jump from rooftop to rooftop to stay alive. I have had to get creative with dodging zombie dogs chasing after me as I run in between cacti to slow them down as they get hit so I can get away. The challenge level is perfect for me... for ME.   That is the problem, I have over 700 hours logged in this game and consider myself pretty much an expert from a PvE perspective. I'm not a new player...  I have convinced 3 people to buy this game (during alpha 9), and even gifted it to a friend during a xmas sale. None play this game any more even after alpha 12. So I asked them why they don't play here's what they said. It's too hard to start out, and to easy once you get established.   Which brought me to the following conclusion. This game isn't going to continue to be successful if new players don't buy the game and or enjoy their ""new game experience"". For a new player there's just too much that can kill you initially and detract from the enjoyment for a lot of people. They need to implement something that won’t negate the challenge of the game and won’t give experienced players an insane advantage.  Players should start off with a bow and arrow with 40 iron arrows or something to give them a leg up. Minimum wellness should be 100 until you reach level 5?   As for the end game, make feral zombies stronger with damage they deal, not damage they can take. A Feral zombie should be able to smash through base defences but still be killed with 2 or 3 head shots, not the 8 to 10 it's at currently. If your base defences are breached it adds to the end game challenge. Have the burnt zombies set any wood bases on fire? Also, ADD MORE VERITY OF POINTS OF INTEREST!!! Put in another airborne threat that walls can't protect you from; more bees or I don't know, zombie pigeons.   Bottom line, TFP aren’t going to work for free and since the business model has no micro transaction mechanic or a way for regular players to continue to financially support this amazing game, new players and server fees (if TFP are even getting a cut of that) are pretty much it. So we need more new players, which means we need positive new player reviews, and the game needs to be FUN from START to the unending ""END""."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,Blaktoe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"And in that regard I do think a bone needs to be thrown to the new players to an extent.   Demons Souls/Dark Souls are known for their difficulty but have a very devoted and sizable fanbase for it. So I don't think difficulty should be cut.   I think the Navezgane area is great for learning those basics. But all the same it would be nice to see a couple dedicated servers intended for newbs that are strict PvE and have the bumpers up and the special helmet on as far as difficulty settings (never run, start with inventory, easy loot rates, low spans etc.) But I feel that none of this should come at the expense of the defaults for RandomGen PvP servers. Just like the defaults shouldn't hold back the hardcore servers that are set to constant spawn, always run, etc."
7daystodie,3cb1v4,CasperHarkin,3,Mon Jul 6 17:44:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that new players need a little more assistance. What the game really needs is a Tip or Tutorial system.

7daystodie,3cb1v4,Cerus,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:23 2015 UTC,Man I totally know how you feel. Lack of knowledge. I died more times than I want to admit the first weekend I played due to going at it like a traditional FPS. A noob server. I have actually been thinking about that and am considering starting one up.
7daystodie,3cb1v4,threecatsdancing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"Games have changed so much in the last few decades. I used to be you'd get a little assistance, but were locked into a certain progression. Now, you get no help, and it's up to you to trial and error a progression. I find that frustrating, while at the same time enjoying the choice. Unfortunately, I hate finding out that my choice of progression is retarded. ""Lolz, you have what skill? Dude, that's not even meant for what you're doing.""  This is especially tiresome in MMOs where you don't get to start over.  I've restarted in this game many times, which I rarely do in any game. Speaks volumes of the sort of gameplay you'll find here. Still, simple little things like knowing about the toilets, or the ability to repair an item (or why you'd want to), would make a big difference in a first impression. Understanding which tools are which, and which appropriate materials they work best with. Knowing (and understanding) upgrading, which tools can do it, and which are better (Repair tool worse than a claw hammer?). Not even knowing that you're ignorant at the beginning - I wish I had a list of what I have and haven't read - so I knew what books/schematics to look for (and why).   I think that's the two part thing here. It's not just about how, but also why. Sure, I know how to make a steel pickaxe. Why should I? (That question is legit: at faulty level, it's an almost negligible difference. Seriously, people need to be told to wait at least 10 levels before trying. Just not worth it. Same goes for opening safes.)  Anyhow, time to go back to the game."

Now the developers will take this input and put it into a patch. This will make the game closer to being complete. I understand that it sucks but it is good that you found it in alpha.

Once you find a few mines you will have more coal and nitrate than you know what to do with (I'm always limited by brass for bullets). I know tallow can be used to make gas but animal fat seems very common now with bears. Cloth can be a pain unless you salvage all the spare clothes you find, I usually end up salvaging health kits for it.  They can be useful for defense during a large invasion. You can light up a bunch at night easily. Sometimes they run around pacing or in circles at parts of my base which can make it very difficult to get headshots, I may end up sinking 3-5 bolts into one .

I decided to put a few wooden frames together so I could climb up and pull them up behind me.  As I'm climbing I notice that there is an AC unit on top, my thinking is ""if it's lootable, there is a way to get to it."" so I do one final lap around the building to look for a way the Zed's could get up. Sure enough, I find a ladder attached to a wall. I knock the bottom rung out, bambam* the top two instantly topple on my head and kill me like. 100 wellness, full health, instantly to zero. Fml."

I really hope to see a balancing of debris damage. As it is now, I don't see how anyone has the balls to mine anywhere.

7daystodie,3c973d,Feycat,20,Mon Jul 6 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, you got downvoted but it seems you are correct. I'll attempt to explain, if I'm wrong in my analysis at any point please correct me.  Here's an example of the weather settings for the forest biome:  <Temperature min=""-10"" max=""101"" prob=""1""/>   <Fog min=""10"" max=""40"" prob=""1""/>   <CloudThickness min=""10"" max=""70"" prob=""0.1""/>   <CloudThickness min=""70"" max=""100"" prob=""0.9""/>     <Precipitation min=""100"" max=""100"" prob=""1""/>   <Wind min=""10"" max=""20"" prob=""0.9""/>   <Wind min=""20"" max=""100"" prob=""0.1""/>     Each value is a set of probabilities whose odds are a percentage of the sum. For example, there is a 100% chance that the temperature will be between -10 and 101 degrees. There is a 10% that the cloud thickness will be between 10 and 70 intensity, and 90% chance that it will be between 70 and 100.   (To illustrate, these percentages would would remain the same if the values were 0.2 and 1.8 - since the sum is 2 and .2 is 10% of that, and 1.8 is 90%. Any numbers can be used, but having them add up to 1 makes it a little easier to visualize.)   In each case it seems there is a 100% chance that it will precipitate with 100 intensity, but since precipitation is also dependent upon cloud thickness being above 70, in the forest example here there is a 90% chance that both conditions will be true. If you want thick clouds to only precipitate half of the time you would have to add another line and change the probabilities, like so:  <Precipitation min=""0"" max=""0"" prob=""0.5""/>   <Precipitation min=""100"" max=""100"" prob=""0.5""/>    You could change the min/max value to produce varying degrees of intensity (although I don't know what affect this might actually have on the rain), or you could set the rain probability to zero to shut it off entirely. I think setting the minimum and maximum to zero with a probability of one would do the same thing, but I'm not sure how the scale is limited, so I'd probably go with the former option.  If you want thick clouds that always precipitate but are tired of it being dark and raining all the time, change the CloudThickness probabilities to something more to your taste. To shut off precipitation entirely you could also keep the clouds from ever being thick enough.  Setting it to something like this:  <CloudThickness min=""0"" max=""10"" prob=""9.0""/> <CloudThickness min=""10"" max=""70"" prob=""0.9""/>   <CloudThickness min=""70"" max=""100"" prob=""0.1""/>    would result in generally blue skies 90% of the time, light to moderate clouds 9% of the time and heavy storms 1% of the time.  The plains biome has a single cloud thickness setting which explains why it precipitates less often there:  <CloudThickness min=""10"" max=""100"" prob=""1""/>   And never in the desert:  <CloudThickness min=""5"" max=""50"" prob=""1""/>   There are multiple ways which these values can be tweaked to produce similar results, and a lot of flexibility at your fingertips. You could live in a world where it snows everywhere all the time, where the mountains are always shrouded in an eerie fog, or where the sun always beats down and bakes your brain relentlessly. Sliders in the menu would be easier, and may be in the works, but for now I hope this explanation has provided some insight that will help folks adjust the weather to their liking.   If you come up with something really cool, or just bizarre, share your settings and some screenshots with us!"

I just used 0.5 because it's easier to see the percentage at a glance if the sum is equal to one. If there is only one range for a variable the probability will always be 100%. If you have to choose one apple from a pile of one apples, you're always going to get the same apple."

It might be too much of a performance hit, but for the sake of immersion and aesthetics that would be the ideal. Oh, and lightning. I want to get hit by lightning. XD"

I played it for the first time mid last week then a12 came down. The difficulty makes for rewarding gameplay. I'd say it's about as difficult to survive initially as don't starve. Maybe a little harder if playing on default settings.  On another note it's much easier with friends. People can take up specialized roles and make a lot happen very fast before a 7th day horde comes.  I had a thought today: what if skill books were rare for multiplayer gameplay and players started a barter economy for finished goods and components. That'd be very cool.
7daystodie,3c99mh,kwirky88,2,Mon Jul 6 09:26:26 2015 UTC,"Our community is a ""Bartertown"". People trade goods depending on their needs. People are builders, defenders, scavengers, miners, etc.  This patch will add in even more aspects, with people being able to ride far away and come back with more trade goods. Mines being more rare and more sporadic allows for more opportunities. It is great all around."

Hilariously, He did this all night, until eventually the dawn approached, at which point he noticed a particularly impudent zombie on the edge of the road, which he chased down, leading him to another zombie in the forest further away... and further away...  When dawn finally came He had left us... but we remembered our Glorious Protector and Savior still..."
7daystodie,3caamo,wolfiechica,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:51:04 2015 UTC,"I wish I had as noble of a story to tell of the bear savior. On the last map my friend and I did on alpha 11 we kept planning out the best moat ever (spikes, landmines, with water on top of it because at the time the water didn't delete the spikes or mines, it just left them unaltered under water). Not sure about that now however. Then, before we got far enough to gather all the supplies for a moat like that, alpha 12 came out. And the day it came out I saw a post on reddit showing bears actively killing zombies, coupled with the fact that they spawn almost excessively.. so all I though was... screw the landmines, bears. Lots of bears. Bear Moat is still incomplete unfortunately... it's day 22 for us and shit just keeps going down, keeping us from completing it."
7daystodie,3caamo,anotherbigassbrick,2,Sat Jul 11 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"I use bears as weapons whenever possible in the early days of a game. You can plink at them with your bow - don't worry, it won't hurt them ;) -  and they come running. But they have a really short memory. So just if on the ground just run through or past the zombies and sometimes they'll outright attack it in time and draw aggro, or h e'll go back to idle and then fight them anyway. It also works great if you're trapped on a roof and can draw a bear in to clear some of the ground floor."

The ends and corner pieces stack separately; ends don't burn for very long, IIRC, and corner pieces are about the same as middles. They are so helpful in the early game when I don't have any logs to spare and all I'm cooking is tea/meat.  Speaking of logs; I've found that two frames burn for longer than one log (16 planks per log, 8 planks per frame). It takes a little extra time to craft them but two frames will burn for over four minutes, I think."

Maybe they could implement a spear weapon type. Gives good distance (more than arm's/paw's reach) and is simple to make. Perhaps even later on add in the ability throw spears (+50-100% chance of damage for body/headshot)  Stone: sticks, plant fibers, stone.  Iron: sticks, leather strips, iron.  Steel: sticks, leather strips, steel.  This would make a new alternative to everyone going LET'S GET A BOW as they did before while still making it challenging as it is a melee weapon and if you don't pay attention, you'll get overrun.

Surprise zombies: Zeds that make no noise and don't move until player character is within sight radius. Makes searching houses et cetera more risky.  Fast zombies: Zeds that always run (and maybe run extra fast at night). Can be wearing track suits or some shit.  Radiated ants/moles: Some radiated creature that lives and tunnels underground. No place is safe.  SWAT zombies: Similar to cop zombies, but have protective armor; have very very high HP but drop equipment.  Jumping zombies: Can jump over and/or up a 3 block distance.  Smoker zombies: Some smoke-screen effect, either when killed or as an ability to hide zombies.  Ultra-radiated zombies: When you get near the end of the map (and it stops you, saying there's too much radiation to continue) it can spawn a super beast, giant, scary freak zombie. As game gets later, ultra-radiated zombies will appear further in from the end of the map.  Adjustments to zombies: Remove climbing ability from spider zombies and replace with giant, radiated spiders (nightmare factor); Fat zombies leave extra piles of gore and set gore to attract more zombies.  More general zombies: Wheelchair zombies, slow like crawlers, but drag a wheelchair because cripples are zeds too (wheelchairs can give steel/iron/wheels); Granny zombies, slow, weak, with sad faces and pajamas on; Children zombies, little, quick like cheerleaders, and walk in randomized, zig-zag pattern."

7daystodie,3c70co,cnokha,5,Sun Jul 5 13:33:11 2015 UTC,"Tip to avoid combat:  When you see a few buildings with Zeds around, run around the building to attract them.  Then kite around a bit to gather them into a horde, sometimes may be up to 20 Zs.  Then lead them off towards a hill; it may take about 1-2 in-game hours to get them far enough away, but walking speed is sufficient to keep yours distance.  Then sprint around the backside of a hill out of their range, and WALK back to avoid attracting more Zeds.  There are usually a few stragglers left to kill, but better than a bunch hording on you at low levels.  Edit:  You can also throw small stones to distract the zombies too, but not as effective.  I usually played on Survivalist, I had to back down to Warrior."
7daystodie,3c70co,Minotard,3,Sun Jul 5 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"This is my go-to strategy for towns. Run around gathering as many zombies on my tail as possible, pull them away and circle back. Otherwise you'd be fighting them all day just to clear it out."
7daystodie,3c70co,nept_r,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that once you lead them away round a building, crouch in a safe-ish place till they stop hunting you. (60 seconds on on default) then you can sneak back and loot the building while still crouched. Crouch looting takes longer but makes less noise. Also, don't press 'R' to loot all, rather select items one by one then close the container withc Esc, this also makes less noise."
7daystodie,3c70co,contarious,5,Mon Jul 6 04:25:17 2015 UTC,"I had no idea there was a stone shovel in this game, thanks."
7daystodie,3c70co,Mikekekeke,9,Sun Jul 5 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"Funny how diverse starter tips from veterans can be. I hate the desert. It is harder to get wood, it has no cotton, no golden rod, annoying cacti...  Usually I just start gathering materials for basic tools and a bow. I search every container for usefull stuff and head for the next town. Broadleaf forests and pine forets are fine for a settlement. I avoid snow, desert, burned, destroyed or any other biom if possible. A street with 2-3 building would be best, because the bow in A12 is something special now. I kill the zeds with my bow and never go melee. Infections and stunning zeds are not worth the little faster kills with melee weapons. I keep my stamina for emergencies too. I strip the buldings and use them as shelter (the higher the bulding, the better). If done right, even day 6 and 7 hordes can not touch you. Once established in a (if possible) stone building (beton or bricks), search for the next town, kill zeds, find recipes and repeat.   So far my first and only death goes to a tree, which crushed me in an instant at day 1. I even have proove. I recorded my livestream.   In sum this makes two quick possible ways to start 7dtd."
7daystodie,3c70co,Ulfgar88,7,Sun Jul 5 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, there's a way of their own for everyone and everyone's play style differs greatly. You can't just follow a guide and think you've mastered the game. But all those tips from others combined can lead to some great knowledge and it'll be easier to figure things out on your own. That's what all guide's should aim for."
7daystodie,3c70co,chaos0510,3,Sun Jul 5 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of stairways is a good way to survive the night unscathed. Like you said, the higher the better. You often have much more time to think and act if they are breaking into your structure."
7daystodie,3c70co,gl1tch,3,Sun Jul 5 15:42:54 2015 UTC,no cotton   Tents are common in the desert and yield cloth when destroyed.   no golden rod   Goldenrod is of no use until you find a pot or craft one. Yucca fruit and juice are available in the first minutes of the game.
7daystodie,3c70co,Ulfgar88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:48:35 2015 UTC,"On the way to the first town to kill zeds for XP and loot to all the usefull stuff from houses and cars, a pot is practicly included in the first minutes of the game, aswell as alot of jars and water, golden rods and cotten (for emergency bandages), which is why the way arround in deserts is kind of funny, because the town includes everything one would need for survival."
7daystodie,3c70co,gl1tch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"In A11 I would agree, but the changes to bow in A12 make clearing a town on day 1 a process that is much more time consuming and less fruitful than previously.  With that said, there are many different ways to play the game which is awesome for replay value."

7daystodie,3c70co,giltirn,3,Wed Jul 8 11:54:24 2015 UTC,One important tip not mentioned by the OP for tackling cluttered POIs early on- spike traps. Lay them out and stagger them for softening up targets and then get the last hit with a bow/melee. Also very good for sectioning off areas in case of dogs. These are your best offensive tool early on now that bows are garbage.
7daystodie,3c70co,giltirn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"Great tip, and pretty easy to make. Spikes only require sticks and you make quite a lot of them. They can also be repaired. They just used to be garbage, breaking instantly."

7daystodie,3c70co,deadline_zombie,2,Wed Jul 8 06:46:16 2015 UTC,"Bows definitely take effort to make work now, but if you are willing to keep crafting them, by the time you get to yellow quality you're down to two head shots to kill average zeds, even with simple stone arrows. Burn the crappy quality bows in your fireplace or forge."

7daystodie,3c70co,Feycat,2,Mon Jul 6 06:49:22 2015 UTC,"Also, the absolute best shelter is a prebuilt cave. They go down at an angle and no zombies will ever find you down there. You can craft, forge, build, and cook all night and they can't do anything about it."
7daystodie,3c70co,FromTheDuDe,2,Mon Jul 6 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"Caves are great early on but also tempting to explore further, get lost, and break a leg. My tip for caves is that don't explore too far, or at least mark your way back up. Caves as themselves often are decent enough for shelter but you should make sure nothing can get behind your back and take you by surprise."
7daystodie,3c70co,Feycat,2,Mon Jul 6 06:46:27 2015 UTC,"The caves on my world are single tunnels that end at a large room. Never once have I seen a zombie in one. Of course you need to watch your step but as far as a safe hideout, they cannot be beat."
7daystodie,3c70co,FromTheDuDe,2,Mon Jul 6 12:37:26 2015 UTC,"I've read a few threads on this reddit complaining that bows don't do damage now which is not the case. They have been nerfed, this is true.   The quality of the bows simply determine how long you can use them before they stop firing. (Bows don't break at zero durability anymore, you just can't release the arrow anymore, and they can't be repaired.)  The damage you do depends on the arrow you use.  Stone arrows - 3 headshots to kill a normal zombie on standard difficulty. 9 for fat zombies. Iron arrows - 1 headshot to kill a normal zombie on standard difficulty. 3 for fat zombies. Steel arros - 1 headshot to kill a normal zombie on standard difficulty. 2 for fat zombies.  I haven't tested fire arrows yet."
7daystodie,3c70co,Feycat,2,Mon Jul 6 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"The reason ""the bow"" sucks is because it has alternative ammo support. So they had to balance the arrow damage. Also hitboxes have been refined, maybe to account for upcoming motion capture zombies. You just need practice and be precise, don't rush your shots."

Meaning that the bear in this case has a higher chance to spawn than the rabbit you can add that line to each of the animals if you like or just the bear.  Change that value to whatever you want .02 would be even less so I suggest test that out.  As for ORE same you can crack open BIOMES.XML and fart around in there.  Some ORE types are simply set to only be available in caves.  See the below for example values have already been changed in this one.

7daystodie,3c9m8n,MeyerSeed,5,Mon Jul 6 04:19:53 2015 UTC,"I build something similar to this on Day 1, Day 2 if I can't finish it. Craft a few stone axes until you get at least a 30+ quality (top, at L1, is 50 or 60, I believe). Use the others until they break, keep and repair the best one. Gather many small stones as you go (later, by breaking boulders), you'll be tearing that axe apart. Start chopping down trees.   http://imgur.com/UYwtenu  Start with this pattern (looking down from above), preferably on a solid surface (I prefer roads).   xxx x x xxx   Leave the middle empty. It's unnecessary, and you may later decide to put a ladder down and dig.   You'll build this up a total of 5 times. At the top, you'll later want to put an overhang on it to protect from Spider Zombies climbing up. But, if you'll low on material, you can skip it for now.   From the side it will look like this, including the overhang.  xxxxx  xxx  xxx  xxx  xxx   Cover up the center hole (but don't upgrade the frame so you an remove it later). You'll be doing some fancy jumping (or placing wood frames and picking them back up to get on top) from the staircase. It should look like this. Make sure to give yourself 3 blocks separation between the base of the tower and your stair case (a two gap difference between the overhang and the top of the stairs).   xxxxx  x  xxx   xx  xxx   xxx  xxx   xxxx  xxx   xxxxx   Around the base you'll be adding Wood Log Spikes. These must be upgraded at least once. I've found that the zeds will one-swipe away non-upgraded spikes. I've considered using the stick version of spikes because this is temporary and they do more damage (but breakdown) for Day 1, but I've survived my first Day 7 horde with this setup on a few different play-throughs.   You can go with a single layer of log spikes to start, and in later days add more. The 's' are your Log Spikes.   xxxxx   x   xxx    xx   xxx    xxx   xxx    xxxx  sxxxs   xxxxx   It takes almost complete focus on gathering on Day 1. You're not hunting for books, or gathering anything else. Avoid zeds and bears, and just get wood. 1 Wood Log makes 16 Wood Planks. 8 Planks per Wood Frame. So, each log nets you two frames.  I prefer to put wood stairs so you don't have to jump. It also helps me maintain enough speed so I don't fall in my own pit (my wife despises this setup because of that). If you're aren't the jumping type, always carry two wood frames to fill the gap, walk over, and pick them up.    xxxxx   x\   xxx    xx\   xxx    xxx\   xxx    xxxx\  sxxxs   xxxxx\   In summary, you'll need the following...   38 logs for the frames and planks required for the tower and stairs 16 logs for a single ring of spikes around the tower.  9 logs to upgrade all 71 wood frames to at least Old Wood. Double that for Reinforced Wood (I highly recommend this, but you have to balance your time and materials).    Conveniently, this is a total of 64 Wood Logs (a neat, single stack!).   Later on, you can add a second, and even a third ring of spikes. You can also dig down the center shaft of the base (the empty space you created) and mine out the stone for gravel/cement creation.   Most importantly, don't get attached to this tower. It might last a horde or two, but you'll need to move on.   Tips  Stay crouched and hope they don't see you. If you want, you can put a frame in the hole, one layer below the top level so you can hop down inside to stay out of sight. Most wandering zeds/dogs will just pass by (as long as you don't make a sound, even opening your inventory will alert them). Here's a cutaway, ""f"" being the frame you stand on.   xx xx  xfx  x x  x x  x x   Looking from above, you'll want to walk the outer ring (if you are seen) as the zed AI will attempt to walk directly under you. If you're anywhere in the middle of your base, they'll hit the tower. If you're on the outside, they'll do their best to get under you. If you slowly walk (stay crouched) around the outer ring, you can ensure that your tower remains standing, and spread the gore around evenly, (instead of in one spot). In addition, sometimes the zeds will attempt to break the gore (seeing it as an obstacle) as they try to follow you. Use this to your advantage.  Again, from above...  ooooo oxxxo ox xo oxxxo ooooo   The 'o' is the overhang, and the route you'll walk on if you're being ""hunted"".   If you can afford it, later I would suggest upgrading the frames to Metal Reinforced Wood, and further adding metal siding. This will require much Scrap Iron.     Another idea, using the same logic, is to build a ""table"". I took an existing building and built out from it. At the corner of a building, I built two pillars as table legs and used the building to support the other two corners. Stairs to jump on. I metal reinforce and metal siding each pillar.   Bxxxxxxx  x\ B     x   xx\ B     x   xxx\ B     x   xxxx\ B     x   xxxxx\ B     x   xxxxxx\ B sss x   xxxxxxx\   And from above...  BBBxxxxxx BBBxxxxxx BBBxx xxx BBBxxxxxx BBBxxxxxx   Over that empty space, you place your spikes. As with the tower, you'll want to pace around the circle if you're seen, drawing them onto the spikes.   I hope these strategies will help you get the ball rolling in your games. Good luck!"

7daystodie,3c9m8n,Jeradox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"here's how My friend and i were able to live through a 7 day hoard.   Step 1 dig a hole, 3x3 about 10 blocks deep.   Step 2 Fill the first 3 or 4 layers with wood frames and fill them.   Step 3 Build a ladder and a hatch.   Step 4 Make a back door about 25 - 30 blocks away, with another hatch.   On night 7 get in your hole close the hatch and get out your repair tool of choice. Wait for the hord to come and just keep repairing until daytime. Exit out your back door. Kill zombies, repair damage to hole. You can get through the first 4, 7 day hoards that way, then you start to get feral zombies that pretty much 1 shot hatches. Good luck!"

7daystodie,3c9m8n,Nymall,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:38:01 2015 UTC,"Use wooden log spikes, upgrade them and fortify your position. Let the zeds do most of the damage for you. If you have enough wood and some time, you can just make it so that the only area up to you is covered in spikes.  This strategy will only do a little against spitters or spider zombies, but for most of the rest of the horde it should take some of the sharpness out of the bite."

I wish they would completely stop with anything relating to graphics right now and just focus on upgrading the actual game.   I feel like its been so long since there was an update that really added a lot to the entire games playability. I don't care about rain/snow, altitude, prettier graphics. I just want the game to be more enjoyable and interesting.   Every update I go ""ooh, this should be neat"" then I play for a little while and find myself completely bored because the game hasn't had anything interesting added to it. The bows just nerfed, and day/night cycles make it a little more interesting but not enough for me to stick around.  New zombie types ( that make encounters more interesting, and later game more difficult.All we have right now are dogs,cops,spiders, burn and that crazy strong one really), something to make underground bases actually have horde attacks, zombie animals that will fuck your day up, ratio of zombies and their strength upped every week so that later game is actually difficult (by time your a few weeks in your lvl is high enough, and your resources bountiful enough that zombies aren't a real issue anymore), random lesser horde attacks during the nights (so that nighttime is actually interesting on some other nights than the 7th, and it keeps you on your toes), Something, anything that makes close range combat worth a damn, as of right now you risk everything just to kill a zed in close combat, there is no point besides if your in a terrible situation, maybe make food capable of spoiling so that you need to store it in a fridge/freezer or cure it (this would also add necessity to quickly cook raw meats or else they spoil in your bag), Make farming more difficult at least on a lvl of not getting 4 seeds for every one you harvest, or make some of those seeds not sprout, it's not as big of an issue but definitely again makes end game too easy, give the option of all ""survivors"" starting near each other instead of randomly scattered (just an issue I know a lot of people have),   this is all just off the top of my head."

A larger updated starter map with realistic layouts and new POIs, different food crops that are harder to harvest and zombies or animals go after them (ie rabbits), more weapon types, etc.  Right now it's about updating quality, but the quality was fine to begin with. Sure it wasn't the prettiest game out there but there will always be a game to one-up everyone else. Right now I want quantity within the game, more stuff to do and more things to do stuff with. I appreciate the effort that was put into this update with transportation, bears, and weather effects, and I do believe that was a great step in the right direction, but I hope that the next major update gives more biomes, more mobs (passive and zombies), more building types, more POIs, etc."

I just always get to a point in the game where I can indefinitely supply myself with weapons/ammo/food/water/shelter with extremely little effort. At that point.....what is the point? There is nothing else to do besides travel and build more bases, which have really very little point. I always get to this spot really early on too. There is nothing making the ""endgame"" fun, or challenging. The only possible next step is turning the difficulty all the way up, and trying to survive in the city. That ends up being kind of boring and repetitive too. Plus, underground bases and waterbases kind of break the game. I can easily survive if I just dig straight down. That's all it takes. Dig straight down far enough, and put a hatch at the top and you are golden."
7daystodie,3c67w8,TribalDancer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:08:55 2015 UTC,I started a thread on what we 7dayers want to see added to the game. You have some great ideas and I would love for you to comment with some! heres the link

7daystodie,3c67w8,Defttone,3,Mon Jul 6 17:58:06 2015 UTC,I think to add a bit of diversity we should make it so people can throw the spears as well.
7daystodie,3c67w8,Pawun,2,Sun Jul 5 07:42:55 2015 UTC,I mean diversity from Rust.
7daystodie,3c67w8,itwurx4me,3,Sun Jul 5 07:43:15 2015 UTC,Since last 2 or 3 patches you can throw spears in Rust.
7daystodie,3c67w8,Palin_Sees_Russia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:39:59 2015 UTC,"Throwing probably takes more work to put in, just adding a stabby weapon would likely take less work. Throwing can come later and maybe do +50-100% more damage depending on headshot or bodyshot."
7daystodie,3c67w8,Palin_Sees_Russia,3,Sun Jul 5 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"Great idea!  There seems to be a curious (if not suspicious) lack of somewhat obvious weapons, such as spears.  Seems like one of the first things one would make, really.    Other weapons that seem to me notable in their absence:    Bullwhip (like a dozen or more leather strips in a spiral on the grid) Quarterstaff (2m long metal-tipped hardwood staff) Macuahuitl (obsidian sword) Machete (a staple of the genre) The aforementioned Katana (or swords in general)   Mace, flail, two-headed axe, glaive . . . there's the entire history of weaponry to geek out with, isn't there.  Perhaps we'll see an expansion of weaponry in the future, with the introduction of skills.  Skills that grant bonuses to craft and use classes of weapons (pole weapons, bladed weapons, pistols, shotguns, rifles . . . what have you) could help delimit the access to, and usefulness of, groups of weapons."
7daystodie,3c67w8,TribalDancer,3,Sun Jul 5 14:25:56 2015 UTC,How the hell are any of those weapons considered a conspicuous absence? As if I'm going to be stranded and the first thing I think of to make is a fucking bullwhip.... Katana?? Obsidian sword? What game do you think you're playing dude? These would totally kill the immersion.
7daystodie,3c67w8,TribalDancer,2,Sun Jul 5 20:17:10 2015 UTC,I think the machete is a viable weapon that fits perfectly. Maybe a slightly longer reach than the hunting knife with roughly the same damage?
7daystodie,3c67w8,autowikibot,4,Sun Jul 5 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, machete sure. But a bullwhip? or a mace, flail, two headed axe??? This isn't Chivalry. That's very silly and unrealistic. Why on earth would I have a freakin mace in the middle of a zombie apocalypse? This is a hardcore zombie survival, not Dying Light."
7daystodie,3c67w8,Zephyries,0,Sun Jul 5 20:30:34 2015 UTC,"I can think of lots of homes in my college town that would have those types of weapons (archaeologists LOVE bullwhips). Though seemingly unrealistic, a fair amount of people have odd weapons in their homes. Maybe a comic store or a nerd/gaming geek house can be implemented? Even Michonne from The Walking Dead found her katanna at the geeky next door neighbor kid's house. Museums would also have the odd weapon type, maybe a new POI museum could be implemented for the odd mace or sword?  These weapons all sound weird and out of place, but they give a chance for new POIs: museums, comic stores, nerdy bedrooms, etc. I for one would LOVE to see museums added with new uncommon weapons, armor (be it from a suit of armor or just modern day soldier armor), etc."

Never even heard of this, let alone where would one get an obsidian blade?  I agree with machete, and WAY more obviously missing is a freaking baseball bat! How about a tire iron, with all these cars lying around? Maybe a crowbar? Metal pipe?  I also think all our tools (pickaxe, shovel, fireaxe) should be able to used as weapons, but maybe make it so that they degrade very quickly when used in this manner. I suggest this to discourage using it is your primary melee weapon, but still keeping it as an option in a pinch."

The name is derived from the Nahuatl language. Its sides are embedded with prismatic blades made from obsidian, which produces an edge far sharper than even high quality steel razor blades.   The weapon was used by many different civilizations in Mesoamerica including the Aztec, Mayan, Mixtec and Tarascan. The Macuahuitl was the standard close combat weapon together with the Tepoztli and the long range spear thrower Atlatl. This weapon was used also during the campaigns of the Spaniards in Mexico by their Tlaxcalan allies.  One example of this weapon survived the Conquest of Mexico and it was part of the Royal Armoury of Madrid until it was destroyed by a fire in 1884. Its original design survives in diverse catalogues, among them the one created by the medievalist Achille Jubinal in the 19th century.

7daystodie,3c5sfh,kyuss80,3,Sun Jul 5 13:50:22 2015 UTC,I think the bear ai is messes up. I aggrod one running too close and it chased me for like 2 secs then it ran back to its spawn area. I go a little further and start fightin a couple zeds and hear a huge roar and turn around to the bear charging me from what seemed like a good 30 40 blocks away.

7daystodie,3c7ler,Feycat,6,Sun Jul 5 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people aren't necessarily happy about that change.  It seems that it was an unintended bug, one that was a very nice addition to the game, but TFP felt it was causing some balance issues in making it easier to break into buildings and not leave a path that zombies could follow.  There's been quite a lot of complaints about it being removed but it seems TFP is pretty adamant that it's best left out for now and are hopeful that they can add it back as a proper, more balanced feature in the future.  I'd love to see them revert the change and just leave it in as it was until they can add the better version but I wouldn't be holding my breath for that."

7daystodie,3c64x7,Gravehog,63,Sun Jul 5 04:50:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the difficulty is a result of poor mechanics, such as the whack-a-mole, cheap-stunlock-filled, overly-simplistic, boring melee combat system coupled with glitchy zombies and bears out the ass.  People aren't complaining about the difficulty, they are complaining about the cheapness. A game can be hard and still enjoyable, because you have ""ah fuck I should've done this instead"" moments instead of ""a zombie stunlocked me after one hit and now I am dead"". 7 days at the moment, however, is just frustrating, not hard.  EDIT: clarity"
7daystodie,3c64x7,Laeryt15,9,Sun Jul 5 05:14:03 2015 UTC,Simply removing the stun lock would do wonders for melee combat. I like finding a house and going balls to the wall with my stone axe for some sweet loot. I don't like getting stunned because I didn't see a crawler and then getting raped by his buddies.

7daystodie,3c64x7,r34nimated,6,Sun Jul 5 18:52:10 2015 UTC,I always kinda liked the stunlocks. It's encouragement to seek out ranged weapons and avoid close quarters encounters with large groups of enemies.

7daystodie,3c64x7,SKEW_YOU,-3,Sun Jul 5 10:44:13 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but most of the complaints are mechanics/bugs as you brought up. I fear that these issues will be lost, and drowned out by ""the game is too hard, turn it down a notch"", and the end result will not be favorable."
7daystodie,3c64x7,PhD_in_internet,7,Sun Jul 5 05:19:02 2015 UTC,It's not hard though.. There are a few unfair mechanics issue at the moment (obscene attack range on zeds if you aren't careful) but that can be overcome with a little skill.
7daystodie,3c64x7,Industrialbonecraft,6,Sun Jul 5 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think the attack range being 'hard' is even the problem, it's just flat out unintuitive, which makes it frustrating. If a zed swings at you and the fist glides through the air a foot away from your face... you don't get hit. End of.   Hell, I was turned off by the fact that I could do the same thing to them. There was no way I should have been clock some of them in the face from the range I was at, but I did. And that just takes me right out of the game. You should be able to reasonably intuit what you can and can't hit, and also what can and can't hit you."
7daystodie,3c64x7,TribalDancer,5,Sun Jul 5 11:58:42 2015 UTC,"This is true. Also, they are 100% just arms and fists. I have a weapon, which SHOULD give me some more range to strike from keeping me out of the range of their attacks if I tine it right. Right now, they have changed something where I have to get in closer to hit with my weapon, and they can hit me from further away than they could before. I am also finding that even though I aim for the head clearly with my crosshairs, either the hit box is smaller or they are moving somehow but I am not getting headshots consistently any more (400+ hours, I know how to aim for and hit a head with a melee weapon, so when suddenly I am not hitting them all over the place, and I have to ask myself why/what changed?). Plus the zeds are hitting faster--they seem faster/smarter about striking us this time around--so before I can even get a hit in I am hit and stunned.   If this is an intentional change in game mechanic, I am upset about it and would like it tweaked. If it is a lag issue between my action and the reaction, or their head 'moving' programmatically before I can see it visually, I am frustrated and hope that whatever has slowed this down can be repaired. I am not asking to be able to run through with a club and take on a huge horde single handedly. But right now I can't even take on one single zed with a reasonable weapon without being stunlocked and killed before I get my hits in."
7daystodie,3c64x7,Industrialbonecraft,6,Sun Jul 5 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"Do they ever get the hit boxes right? This seems like it's been a problem for quite a while. It can't be that hard. Head hit box: Cover. The. Fucking. Head.   ""Buht thus 2 eeze!""   No it's intuitive and it works. More to the point, it's fun. If they want to make it harder put some of them in armoured hats and masks - like riot police or something. make some more of their gaits affect thier head movement. There's that lurching zombie that is slightly irritating the deal with, because the head bob is so erratic. That's not bad, It's organic! You can point to yourself as the reason you didn't shoot it in the face. Or, if they're wearing armoured head gear, you can understand why you'd have to shoot them a couple of times in the head to kill them. If you shoot a nurse in the face but the arrow sails clear through her forehead, that's unintuitive, needlessly frustrating, and bad design.   The stun needs to be nerfed. It's a stun, not an arm bar. It doesn't need to last for more than a second and a half. If they want to make that more punishing, it's not difficult, just some extra work in the shape of more effects. For instance:   Knocked down; speaks for itself. Player is prone, lasts a short while move speed reduced to crouch, before you get up. Grabbed: stops you backpedaling. Hit the zombie once or twice to break the grab.   The point of these examples, of the top of my head, is to illustrate that they do not need to needlessly punish the player, as the current mechanics seem designed to do, but to give a person an intuitive sense of consequence for their actions. At the moment the stun drags on just a bit too long for it to feel like it was deliberately designed to frustrate."

7daystodie,3c64x7,HP_Strangelove,20,Sun Jul 5 13:41:24 2015 UTC,There's a difference between difficulty and arbitrary tedium compounded by poor mechanics and design. Some of the changes introduced in the latest patch definitely lean toward the latter.

7daystodie,3c64x7,SpectreFire,3,Sun Jul 5 05:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hell, the headshot thing would be fine if shooting them in the torso could deal at least a reasonable amount of damage, but the torso to headshot damage ratio is ridiculous. And the iron sights on the crossbow continues to be entirely broken and mis-aligned. The bow's not better either. It's almost impossible to get medium range headshots with those unless you crouch and use the sense icon as a crosshair.  And don't even get me started on melee in this game."
7daystodie,3c64x7,TribalDancer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:45:43 2015 UTC,So the hitbox did change?? Because I am struggling to get a whack in with melee weapons--hits that SHOULD have hit their head but acted like it didn't. Then stunlock and I am dead.
7daystodie,3c64x7,Bitsand,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:51:09 2015 UTC,Not sure if intended by dev but they need to change it back asap.

Zombies aren't scary because they have great mechanics, they're scary because their terrible hit boxes and awful twitchy animations, combined with mediocre gunplay makes them annoying to kill due to almost purely mechanic based reasons.  The rest of the game is just tedious. Probably more tedious than a lot of other survival crafting games.   You know what game had fantastic zombie combat? Left 4 Dead. Killing regular zombies was in equal amounts fun, satisfying, and on occasions difficult. The melee was satisfying, the gunplay was satisfying. The zombies never had an unfair amount of reach, took an unfair amount of damage, or were simply impossible to hit because their hitboxes and animations were just plain garbage."

Yes I suppose if I beat on a safe in real life it will open eventually...but the tricky part about safes before was the time commitment. It feels like it takes years to open a gun safe in a11, and you couldn't just stop in the middle...whereas with beating on it, it feels safer. I can stop anytime without losing progress, kill a zed, and go back to hitting it."
7daystodie,3c64x7,rezanow,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"It could be argued that at least with the new mechanic you are doing something. Call it, ""Interactive"" or some shit. And, as you've noted, you can also stop and come back to it later.   I prefer it this way, except for the idea that now I am not only spending 40+ seconds trying to bash that damn safe open, but I am also kissing my tool's durability goodbye. All for some random faulty weapons part or another schematic that I have read already.   I dislike leveled loot. If I were the first man on the planet, and everything was created by me, it would make sense. But, someone much higher ""level"" than me existed at some point and already created a gun safe to safely store guns.   Rather than an arbitrary pat-on-the-back blow-out-the-candles birthday level, I'd like to see the game reward you for your effort - not only in skill, but in time and materials. In real life, it's not just about skill at cooking, you need an income to acquire the tools and materials to be able to cook. And when you enjoy your bacon, eggs, and that cup of coffee first thing in the morning, you know you've earned it.   tl;dr I don't mind some of the tedium, if it pays off."

Them being strong or fast isn't an issue. I like new areas being dangerous. But if I kill every zombie in the area it should be safe for a while."
7daystodie,3c64x7,SirNanigans,3,Sun Jul 5 08:37:22 2015 UTC,"Zombies should spawn just outside if a player's view distance and wander around a bit more.   This means that you will encounter zombies normally while on the move, but zombies have to physically move back into an area where you are camping out. Horde AI can have a particular direction in mind when spawning to make sure they reach the player but otherwise spawn the same way."
7daystodie,3c64x7,TribalDancer,2,Sun Jul 5 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Hrm I have noticed that there seem to be more zombies relentlessly nearby, but I have been able to clear an area with dilligence. The trick is not kiting ones from further away into the zone you are trying to clear. But I am not seeing respawns in cleared areas, are you?"
7daystodie,3c64x7,KungFuHamster,5,Sun Jul 5 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"This right here. If I put it on the easiest settings, I shouldn't spawn into 10 zombies around every POI and bears every 20 feet and arrows that just piss them off.  I have no problem with hardcore players having a more hardcore experience, but don't have a difficulty slider that doesn't help."
7daystodie,3c64x7,TheWiredWorld,-1,Sun Jul 5 12:42:53 2015 UTC,On the same server? That is exploitable and dumb.

7daystodie,3c64x7,partisan98,7,Sun Jul 5 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"Here is the prospective of someone who purchased this game last Saturday the 27th. I played a bit, got my asked kicked but realized it was because i didn't know wtf to do. Watched a few videos and had a small hut with spikes around it by monday with a pistol and about 100 scavenged rounds and survived to day 9 dying about 5-7 times.    Then the game updated to A12. I proceeded to get killed 2 times before i found a freaking road. Then i found a road and started to make a house. Day 2 a horde spawned and destroyed what little i had built while i fled. Day 3 i have a small basement to hid in so my in progress base wont get destroyed. Day 4 a dog horde spawns kills me 2 times before they vanish. Day 5 run into a dog horde run for my life and escape 3 minutes later run into another dog horde get killed 3 times trying to get my gear back. Day 6 3X4 wood house with spike pits around it built horde shows up at 1300. Fight off that horde lose most of spike pit while repairing a dog horde arrives with a zombie horde following proceed to die. Night falls get run down 3 times by zombie hordes and killed.    Final death toll in a week of new game 11 mentioned ones and 3-5 unmentioned because i cant melee well without getting stunlocked.    I have given up on this game until either changing difficulty actually changes difficulty and stops 10-15 zombies spawning at every loot able building and lets me find not crap items or forever whichever comes first."
7daystodie,3c64x7,cprogger70,6,Sun Jul 5 09:26:58 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry you had this experience.  The game CAN be so much more.   One of the meat headed developers has a hard on for making it as difficult as possible and even likes to refer to players who don't like it as ""care bears"".

7daystodie,3c64x7,travo5100,3,Sun Jul 5 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"I just wish I could find an axe or a pickaxe. Another nice thing would be the ""Forge Ahead"" book. I'm on day 12 on the new rando gen and have yet to be able to craft anything more complicated than stone tools."
7daystodie,3c64x7,rizzlybear,2,Sun Jul 5 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"I found a ""Good"" iron club early on, and that really made a difference. I find that I have been exploring/scavenging much more now, especially on the outskirts of hub cities. (Looking for sports bags, backpacks, purses, etc.)"

Difficulty increased, and having an impenetrable fortress takes away the survival aspect I find, especially when you deck it out with a farm to make it self sustaining.  This playstyle supports the nomadic playstyle quite well as you dont have time/resources to build perma defences"
7daystodie,3c64x7,aholetookmyusername,3,Sun Jul 5 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand this stunlock/melee complaint. I've been stunned many times and rarely does it result in my death. If I don't have the armor and health to take a little punishment I don't engage at close range. If I do get clocked I've either got my hand clamped on Shift+S so I can retreat and regroup the instant I can run, or I have a weapon that can finish the job before my head clears. I don't take on more than I'm confident I can handle if things go badly, and I expect things to go badly. I'm not there to clear the town of the walking dead and become the new governor, I'm there to raid some supplies and get home in one piece.  You've got to think like a survivalist and have the humility to admit to yourself when you're in over your head, when the risk is too great for the reward. Be creative. Build traps. Use the environment. Cut the weak ones out of the herd. Use the stealth system. Run away. You can't just stand there in the middle of the street throwing dozens of bodies around like it's kung fu theater. Your number one priority shouldn't be kicking ass, it should be staying alive. If you know that you're an insignificant worm you just might have a chance. This isn't a brawler. If you want to feel like the bloodthirsty king of the world, go play God of War."

7daystodie,3c64x7,aholetookmyusername,3,Sun Jul 5 09:17:48 2015 UTC,"See references to ""tedious"" above. Don't just drag out craft times to introduce ""difficulty""--that would also be lazy."
7daystodie,3c64x7,TribalDancer,2,Sun Jul 5 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"Tedious according to some of the more hardcore players.  Not all players.  Not everyone enjoys the game the same way, nor does everyone have the same amount of time to throw at gaming.  A difficulty setting where low really does mean low caters to these people.  Enforcing a high setting will alienate a good portion of the userbase, and TBH the ""every setting should mean hard"" smacks of elitism.  I like the game to be difficult, but I also accept that others do not."
7daystodie,3c64x7,aholetookmyusername,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"I am far from a hardcore player. And I am in agreement that early game is a bit too hard as it stands (400+ hours into a game, I should not die 5 times in the first day when trying to play conservatively--I was NOT running and gunning, I was just hiding and running and was killed a bunch), and I think the dials turned down should get noticably easier.  But I still stand by the idea that using speed of craft timers as a difficulty metric is just plain tedium. YMMV"
7daystodie,3c64x7,aholetookmyusername,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:56:29 2015 UTC,The craft timers comment was intended half in jest.  I don't believe that forcing someone to wait a realistic amount of time to craft flax into a bowstring would improve the game ;)  One other benefit of providing a low difficulty option is that the game will become more accessible to those who might have difficulty gaming/using a computer - say someone with a hand injury or disability.

I've literally never been stunned by the first hit from a zombie unless I'd been running or fighting. (Or, once I'd died a few times early on, jumped a few times or something because my wellness was like 50 or 60).  I tested it a little bit just now and didn't get stunned from the first hit from 5 different zombies but did get stunned if I sprinted up to them and let them hit me."

Gameplay that forces caution and situational awareness will never be popular with those that want to just jump in on day 1 and feel like a badass. There are bugs but the stunning and poor performance of starting weapons isn't one of them.  Or like Blizzard put it once, ""We're not always going to build the game you think you want, but the game we think you'll play."""
7daystodie,3c64x7,HabitualAardvark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:49:43 2015 UTC,There is a difference between the effectiveness of starting weapons and weapons that do no direct damage. A bow and arrow would do a lot of damage to soft tissue. This bow and arrow does none with a 50% bleed effect.

7daystodie,3c7y05,croppergib,2,Sun Jul 5 21:24:17 2015 UTC,You will find the tree that kills you when collecting logs. Sometimes a tree can decide to somersault or go crazy... it flips out and takes you with it. Sometimes they just drop through the map and take you with them. You can't avoid it. Even on a slope they can go sideways and not downwards from the opposite place you cut it.

The game just underwent a MASSIVE new patch and it's incredibly unbalanced and buggy as shit right now. For mac users it's completely unplayable, with a complete and utter lack of textures for 75% of the game's environment. I'm sure The Fun Pimps will get it sorted out, they always do but it's going to take some time. The game's difficulty has been ramped up significantly, mainly due to faulty game mechanics and less so because of any intention of changing it.  That said, if you want to try loading the older build (Alpha 11) It's great fun. Would highly recommend playing on a multiplayer server. Either PVE or PVP whatever your preference is. You heard right this game has a ton of new features and mechanics. Mainly in the areas of crafting. Forging metals to make tools is locked by a book called ""Forge ahead"" now. So your first major obstacle in the game is finding that book so that you can make some decent equipment. Most weapon crafting and tool crafting is locked by skill books which you have to scavenge for."

I've had a hard time finding the forge book as well though. Me and my friend found one after about a week in-game (1 hour long days). Do note however, that a lot of the forest cabins have forges in their fireplaces. So you're not completely helpless.  I actually enjoyed this quite a bit - I had to spend a few in-game hours travelling to a cabin we found during the first day just to smelt some iron and brass. It's fun when you can't craft everything from the start."

7daystodie,3c8ai2,khurune,2,Sun Jul 5 22:14:56 2015 UTC,well it just seemed weird that ferals would have 28x the health of a normal zombie... also I didnt know they had such a good loot table.  I'm going to adjust it back to original value and live with it :p  Thanks for the input guys.

You'll have way more feathers than you need long before you can make a bow worth firing.  Not that I mind it this way, making a useful club should be easier than making a bow that works as it should.  It had a learning curve but 9 days into my single player game and I'm loving A12 now.

7daystodie,3c6gir,chrixian,3,Sun Jul 5 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, while I used to race to get a bow crafted on starts, now it's a race to get to an iron club, the bow comes much later.

It would be kinda cool to get some bird nest items from trees though, because logically you probably would end up finding nests in there IRL."
7daystodie,3c6gir,Van_Tek,2,Sun Jul 5 09:37:45 2015 UTC,Feathers maybe but not Eggs. The eggs would not survive the fall of the tree.

Also you get 5 arrow per feather rock and stick as opposed to 1:1 it use to be in a10. personally i still do the bow as its far easier to shoot and run then to constantly manage stamina running and swinging melee.

Course if youve used either long enough its pretty easy to kite backwards and shoot for headshots.

7daystodie,3c6fwp,Jeradox,3,Sun Jul 5 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"This isn't that far off from what I'd been thinking about lately.  I would like to see this game eventually move towards a crafting and profession/skills system like Star Wars Galaxies had.  We already gather all our materials, but eventually it could expanded to include different qualities of raw materials that affect the final craft.  Also crafting and combat shouldn't just contribute to the same xp pool with crafting being the far lesser contribution.  In SWG's system (and what I think we should have here eventually) to get better at crafting you have to craft, to get better at fighting you have to fight.  I think your ideas about starting equipment are quite a bit over the top, just need to make the first day of any game much lower spawn rate of zombies and bears, higher for everything else.  By morning of day 2 you should be more ready even if it was your first time in the game ever.  Having professions and different starting gear is a good idea but lets keep it simple lower tiered items that fit with the specialty chosen. Then give each profession a set of recipes that while book gated for everyone else, they can unlock by leveling their skills.  Crafting based professions could start with a few raw materials, combat based ones still start with different weapons but not firearms on day one."

Honestly, given how much grinding and tedium they've added into this game, coupled with the recent release of the wildly popular ARK, I just don't see this game continuing to get a lot of new players. Players are just going to play for an hour or two, feel frustrated, and will probably refund the game.   This isn't even a great PvE game to play casually with friends because there aren't very many public servers available, and the developers are insisting that they don't want big servers for this game and that they don't care about that.  Games like ARK has tons of big public server, so it makes it much easier for people and their friends to buy the game and just jump into a server right away."

As it is right now, the game is to hard for new players. It's illogical to conclude that new players wont be joining this game just because others are being released...   I'm not sure what you mean by ""mechanically deficient"". I see no grind, other then the fact that it's a crafting game and getting good stuff takes time. It's not much of a fun game if you start off with KOTR is it?   I agree that new players will likely play for a couple of hours and give up to one degree or another. However, I strongly disagree with this not being a good PvE game. There was over 400 servers last time I did a ping count, and it's easy as pie to setup your own server if you want."

I proceeded to get killed 2 times before i found a freaking road. Then i found a road and started to make a house. Day 2 a horde spawned and destroyed what little i had built while i fled. Day 3 i have a small basement to hid in so my  in progress base wont get destroyed. Day 4 a dog horde spawns kills me 2 times before they vanish. Day 5 run into a dog horde run for my life and escape 3 minutes later run into another dog horde get killed 3 times trying to get my gear back. Day 6 3X4 wood house with spike pits around it built horde shows up at 1300. Fight off that horde lose most of spike pit while repairing a dog horde arrives with a zombie horde following proceed to die. Night falls get run down 3 times by zombie hordes and killed.    Final death toll in a week of new game 11 mentioned ones and 3-5 unmentioned because i cant melee well without getting stunlocked.    I have given up on this game until either changing difficulty actually changes difficulty and lets me find not crap items or forever whichever comes first."

If you open the map up and look for the black holes, those are often mines. Once youve got a sleeping bag, down there, campfire for making drinking water and gotten to know your surroundings, you should have a fighting chance.    Thing is I only play co-op with a friend, so things are a tad easier with my solution."
7daystodie,3c6fwp,Blaktoe,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"I see no grind   I have to respectfully disagree. I personally think the game feels too much like work at the moment. Husband and I used to play coop but that's fallen by the wayside as recent updates have sucked the fun out of the game. I agree it shouldn't be easy, but it should still be enjoyable. At the moment I think it entails too much effort early on, then gets boring once you reach abundance.   When I told my husband Alpha 12 was out, his response was: ""So what, more jobs? Have they put in a vacuum cleaner? Do I have to wash my dishes or risk getting sick?"" Which summed up how we both feel about the game at the moment pretty well.  I don't mind difficulty but it still has to be fun. I don't want to work all day and then play a game in the evening only to feel like I'm doing more work.  (For what it's worth, I absolutely adored this game when I started playing it, around Alpha 9. It was tricky but we could get up and running and actually enjoy the process.)"

But you're right the game change a lot to make it more difficult, especially for new players...   It's a lot less gather and horde and a lot more scavenge and survive right now. Before you find a cave or dig a hole, boom, iron for days makin it rain! Now? No caves to be found (for me anyway) and scrap iron? better start harvesting the scattered cars everywhere!"

7daystodie,3c7dnf,KungFuHamster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"I looked in the config files. Apparently ""rare books"" are on their own spawn table, which means not only is it a rare spawn but it's just one entry in a long table, so you're fighting the random number generator hardcore.  Also, uncommon items are more likely to spawn at higher levels. The game restricts drop quality based on your level."

Only thing it does to you is make you a better player for when the games fixed up and working as intended. Don't shirk a challenge just because its a 'bug' work your way around it and improvise.

Maybe try just digging yourself a hole/bunker with no visible building on top, apart from maybe a trap door or a frame to block things off. That way zombies should walk right over you."

The bow and arrow I've stopped using after the quality went to zero on my first one (haven't tried playing with the arrowheads yet if they do better damage). So far the deaths I've encountered have been from bears and gravel collapsing in caves.  I only play SP. If the tree and bear deaths are mainly from multiplayer, maybe it's ping related?

The only thing that annoys me is looting safes. I greatly prefer the loot timer. I hate wearing out my tools and making an assload of traceable noise only to be presented with faulty parts. Not worth it. At all."
7daystodie,3c54a0,TribalDancer,0,Mon Jul 6 06:20:29 2015 UTC,I think it is fine. Once you get better tools they open up quickly. The game would be boring if you could just run around opening 20 gun safes on day 1.

7daystodie,3c54a0,Moosepoops,2,Sun Jul 5 00:16:22 2015 UTC,In A11 I got the majority of my purple weapon pieces from safes. I check them every time.
7daystodie,3c54a0,hunkxdeath,2,Sun Jul 5 00:48:08 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the loot item level is relative to your character level as you progress.  Maybe it just seemed in A11 when I was around lvl 20 I was finding a lot of purple items
7daystodie,3c54a0,rezanow,3,Sun Jul 5 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"A11 the loot was random, A12 the loot scales with your level (or at least statistically it's supposed to, though you can still luck out and get dat purple drop)"

Until then it’s annoying, painful and unrewarding to open safes. Nothing worse than 100 hits with a crappy pickaxe to get broken pistol parts that don’t even come close to compensating you for all the metal strips you had to use to repair the f’er."

7daystodie,3c44qe,bigdeal69,23,Sat Jul 4 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"The combat overall is laughably poor and simplistic in its current form. It's the equivalent of zombie wack-a-mole. Hit, back up, repeat. If you miss or a zombie glitches out then you'll be magically stunlocked into place because the zombies have no other moves other than slap-chopping forward.   This is compounded by poor animation quality, jittery movement, and lack of general audiovisual feedback when fighting. Combat is one of the absolute weakest aspects of 7DTD right now.   A fun zombie game that does combat properly is State of Decay. Jumps, kicks, special moves, fluid movement, and zombies that can overwhelm and hold a player in place without an obnoxious pop-message informing the player they're stunned or debuffed. The combat feels fun and rewarding."
7daystodie,3c44qe,HP_Strangelove,6,Sat Jul 4 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"I wish the devs devoted a build to melee combat, I'd love to see it done like Dead Island has."
7daystodie,3c44qe,Jaskorus,5,Sat Jul 4 21:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the gunplay in this game is pretty awful, and only made worse by how frustrating bad the zombie animations and hitboxes are.  It feels like the devs are really going down the wrong direction by putting more and more focus on the zombie fighting, which is the game's worst aspect, and ignore the building aspect, which is really fucking good."
7daystodie,3c44qe,SpectreFire,12,Sat Jul 4 21:20:36 2015 UTC,I feel like the hidden system should be more bound to the eye of the zombies not just smell. When I attack a zombie with a knife from behind it should be a easy kill.
7daystodie,3c44qe,liiliiliiliiliilii,10,Sat Jul 4 17:06:21 2015 UTC,This problem is mainly highlighted by just how absurdly hard the beginning of this game is. I don't understand why a quality tier for weapons is necessary when loot scales with level as this only results in a way too difficult beginning and a laughably easy late game.

7daystodie,3c44qe,PM_ME_YOUR_A_CUP5,5,Mon Jul 6 09:06:55 2015 UTC,"Some Ideas / Suggestions to Improve Melee  I bet TFP are working on these as we speak but ill throw em out just in case.   Knockdown Effect: Our weapons should be able to proc knockdown (ragdoll) on zeds to the floor and stun them for 1-3 secs. Meanwhile we should be able to stand over them and bash their heads in with a 2x dmg multiplier. (ala Project Zomboid) More Player Moves: Kick, Melee Push/Shove, Dodge (sprint + move), Throw rocks/sand at zeds,  Longer Range Weapons: pointed stick + Bone shiv, Spears, Javelins  (give them less durability, slow aspd). Add some throwing weapons: Shivs, Kitchen Knives, Potted Plants, pots, hammers, hatchets. (ala Dead Rising)  Zombies should suffer greater recoil when headshot + sense of momentum and weight when they are hit cuz right now they are just like.... meh (ala dead island) Charged Melee Attacks = Hold click to wind and release. Running attacks - same + Sprint key(uber risky) (ala skyrim) Slow down zombie attacks: Zombies should have multiple attacks, quick and slow. Slow are dodge able and telegraphed but have high chance of stun. Quick attacks should have low chance to stun but good chance to bleed you. Give fatty zed a grab attack  Melee Stealth Attacks: Attacks with melee from behind should be instakill until we have a proper animation for it. Alt Fire Melee Options: ie. Bone shiv  [left click for slash, hold left click for stab, Right click for throw~]. Middle mouse for gun bashing/pistol whipping.  Weapon swing arc: Right not it feels like our melee only hit the crosshair, almost like shooting, i think weapons should have a swing arc and if anything is in the arc its going to get hit (trees, walls, zeds). I would like to differentiate between: Fast nimble weapons and slow wide weapons. For example, if you are in a house, it's going to be harder to use that 2handed offbalanced fireaxe then say... out in a field. Swinging a fire axe indoors would probably result in hitting the walls and ceiling unless you really tone down your swings. I would probably opt to use a machette or hammer indoors since its faster and more agile than an axe. Although an axe would be better outdoors. TLDR: different types of weapons for different types of scenarios would be cool  Gunplay Durability: Rework durability to affect chance to Jam/+Reload speed/-Mag Size   instead of damage. These dinky pistols that take 8 shots to kill a pig are silly and boring. Having one bullet left in your pistol should be awesome and tactical (think The Road) - it should make you feel powerful for that one shot.    Games that did combat pretty good: Skyrim Redone + Locational Dmg Mod, Dying Light, Project Zomboid ( :D ), State of Decay (might be too arcady), Mount n Blade Warband (swing arcs, throwing weapons), hard to think of other 1st person melee games  Also please take a look at zombie spawning - its not fun atm."

In every zombie movie I've ever seen, being within grabbing distance of a zombie is the absolute worse case scenario for a survivor; if you're beating on zombies with a melee weapon, something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.  This is counter-intuitive from a design standpoint if you're trying to keep risk/reward balanced, but why should they be balanced?  Why should we get any incentive for fighting up close other than not having to burn ammo?  That said, I wouldn't say no to the combat system overall becoming a bit more fluid. It is extremely clunky right now, to the point where I mostly feel like I'm fighting the combat system rather than the zombies."
7daystodie,3c44qe,BlaineTog,2,Sat Jul 4 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's a survival game, not a zombie beat-em-up.  Melee combat is the method of last resort, not something you should be rewarded for.  (At least beyond the reward of not spending ammunition.)"
7daystodie,3c44qe,zdss,2,Sun Jul 5 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, the only way it feels like you can win with a high chance of success is if you have a purple spiked club...  I think the damage of melee weapons should largly be the same across the board regardless of quality. Quality however should greatly impact how quickly an item degrades when used.   If I smash something in the head/face with a club vs a baseball bat weather it's wood or metal, someones head is going to be just as mushed.   Maybe give defective or low quality items a chance to insta break at random (lowish chance - say 8% of the time?)"

Some bears can be dangerous, sure.  Most dangerous encounters with bears are the fault of people startling them or goading them but in the true wild areas hungry bears will certainly stalk and kill people.  That said, the most dangerous bear in North America (the Polar) has only been recorded as attacking people 20 times....ever.   The most populous bear in North America (black) killed a whopping 27 people...from 1900 to 1986.  The 7days bears are horrifying, ravenous beasts that often hunt in packs and will chase someone for miles to feast on man-flesh."
7daystodie,3c4crq,SlothOfDoom,2,Sat Jul 4 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"It's also worth pointing out that brown and kodiak bears, the kinds that typically attack people, tend to be very territorial and are not pack hunters (black bears are not as aggressive). When they do attack, it's typically because they are protecting their young or a fresh kill. They are usually scared off by noise and prefer to avoid confrontation, if possible. So, realism probably isn't what TFP are going for."

7daystodie,3c4crq,Bonkus72,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:24:43 2015 UTC,Playing with the XML files can really help further customize your game. In A11 I changed my server to spawn packs of rabbits instead of the zombie dog packs. I'm going to try to leave all of this default on the current build unless I get excessive complaining from my friends.
7daystodie,3c5kty,cdavis66,3,Sun Jul 5 00:42:48 2015 UTC,Cool narrative. These are the stories that this game allows that make it so much fun. Keep surviving!
7daystodie,3c5kty,UhhNegative,3,Sun Jul 5 01:07:40 2015 UTC,Day 10. Still no forge book. The dogs and bears are limitless and are learning to work together.   A bear just stole my minibike.

7daystodie,3c5qr1,Devisioned,2,Sun Jul 5 03:03:24 2015 UTC,I am getting killed more by trees than anything else right now.  Tree deaths 2. Bear deaths 1.
7daystodie,3c5qr1,137946,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:41:51 2015 UTC,I think there should be a special defense for lower levels against bears other than hoping you have enough sprint to run far far away. Maybe throwing meat/food could distract them for 5 or so seconds since real life bears do enough the occasional pick-a-nic basket.
7daystodie,3c5qr1,DibsArchaeo,2,Sun Jul 5 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"Falling trees is an awful killer. We've had to set down beds nearby before we've settled down just in case we die. The dog horde amount is insane. We also find that zombies seem to be spawning within about 2-3 blocks of us, almost as if they're teleporting. We've not had much trouble with actual hordes just yet, but if we run in one direction for a while we find a huge group of zombies every 150 blocks or so. Sometimes this includes a dog, which is basically a death sentence.  The biggest issue right now is not being able to handle the hordes because you just can't kill them. The melee seems to have been nerfed, and arrows go right through their heads about 60% of the time so unless you magically find a gun at a low level, you're screwed."
7daystodie,3c5qr1,Blank_VII,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:12:49 2015 UTC,Aim ever so slightly to the left of their heads. The aim on the weapons is off a little. It's pretty annoying

7daystodie,3c5qr1,GotBetterThingsToDo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:50:44 2015 UTC,"I've noticed before the tree falls it will switch 'texture' some, and become a dead falling tree, but usually stay up for enough time for one more chop. (that isn't needed).  Could be your hitting them all an extra time, maybe depending on your tree graphics level this is easier to spot or not."
7daystodie,3c5qr1,Arcturus519,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:55:59 2015 UTC,"I have graphics on full resolution and high quality. The problem is that sometimes the tree drops on the ground before falling over, and every time it does that it will instakill the player, regardless of which side they are on."
7daystodie,3c5qr1,GotBetterThingsToDo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yes you have to back away from the tree every time and don't facehug it while chopping it (chop at max distance), just keep your distance and back up soon as you get the last chop needed.  I've felled gotta be ~200 tress not since this version (played all weekend), only died once due to my fault. (I ran over on top of it to soon)"
7daystodie,3c5qr1,Arcturus519,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've mostly been doing that. I usually manage to escape the trees, but half the time i get an insta-death no matter what. Thanks anyway!"

It takes about 4-5 headshots to kill a zombie now with a faulty bow.  So, unless you luck out and find a bunch of feathers right off the bat, you're boned.  Melee is pretty much a death sentence, so getting into places to loot is nearly impossible.  Also, zombies just appearing out of nowhere.  I found an empty bookstore to hunker down for the night and as soon as it turned to dusk, the entire place magically filled with zombies.  One literally popped up in front of me, detected me and had the entire town swarm on me.  And with such low stamina starting out, I got wrecked."

7daystodie,3c5uvc,Overman315,4,Sun Jul 5 02:53:09 2015 UTC,"I feel that I kind of agree, but also don't.   I believe that a survivor in this world would hear things from far away. The lack of cars, highways, etc. would make it much easier to hear shit from far away. So maybe you hear things that aren't close, but your ears would still be busy trying to sift through the echoes and close by shuffles of zombies.   I would make it so the sounds did match-up, though. Why not have dogs howling instead of wolves, because we actually have dog hordes?"
7daystodie,3c5uvc,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:38:48 2015 UTC,Good point. The howls aren't even attached to existing dogs. They're random.

It is a fact that the man is blind. A very successful blind man at that. By going on this justice brigade you're victimizing the handicapped, pitying them and setting them apart of society. Everyone gets teased a little, it's all in good fun. The mention was in no way cruel or ill intentioned.  TL;DR- Shut up. No one cares. You would embarrass your blind friend in public."

I could also do without the HDR in the game, I play in fairly dark room on a 50"" LED tv about 3ft from my face so my eyes have to adjust to changing brightness level IRL and don't need my games simulating it.

7daystodie,3c3kqz,No_You_Hang_Up,4,Sat Jul 4 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"It's not a gamma issue. The game uses the sun/moon as a light source, because of the way the source travels, there is a period where light won't be generated due to it's elevation in the game. If you played in the caves in A11 at sunrise/set you would see the whole thing light up, The Forest (which uses the same unity engine) does the exact same thing. The problem with this release is that the new elevations are so much higher than previous game builds (the world was really flat and very close to the starting point for the light source). I was standing on a hill with a POI, and went to the roof. I could literally see the sun miles below what should have been the horizon with a cosmos type skybox.

They should add that back in, IMO. You'll have to gain quite a lot of weight before you can't fit in a 1m² hole.  Besides, smashing windows to enter houses was fun, and now you have to break the actual wall of the house to enter - which I'm sure isn't practical in the real world. You'd smash the window."

If anything (though hard to implement I imagine) make it so you can only crawl through 1x1 holes that are on the same level as the character (ie: crawl through a 1x1 hole that is floor level but can't jump through a 1x1 hole while crouched, like a window)."

7daystodie,3c3qgn,Rock1monkey,3,Sat Jul 4 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"The settings do, tho. Simply turn down the difficulty and spawn rates."
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Van_Tek,3,Sat Jul 4 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. Even on lowest settings for spawning and difficulty, there are a shitload of zombies around every POI at the beginning."
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Halon5,0,Sat Jul 4 19:23:06 2015 UTC,They're supposed to spawn there. I have definitely observed less zombies spawning on the lower levels.
7daystodie,3c3qgn,InfectedHeisenberg,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:51 2015 UTC,i turned everything to lowest and easiest and im still feeling like its a bit too much
7daystodie,3c3qgn,BlaineTog,3,Sat Jul 4 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"Back in Alpha 9 and earlier it was so easy that i could walk around the hub city without any weapons and loot all buildings when all difficulty settings were set to easiest... but now i can't even start out a new game in a normal biome    What parts of that version of the game made it fun and challenging to you? I mean, what you're describing sounds boring as hell to me. Why not just play in sandbox mode?"
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Arcturus519,0,Sat Jul 4 14:56:12 2015 UTC,the random dogs in the city and the random hordes were a welcome challenge but there was no real constant thread that prevented me from doing stuff  i don't play in sandbox mode because i want to fight stuff but the start-game now is impossible hard for me even at easiest difficulty settings :( there is just no more fun exploring while killing some random zombies ... its just a wall of death at every poi and there are NO USEFUL WEAPONS to fight it
7daystodie,3c3qgn,droznig,2,Sat Jul 4 15:07:30 2015 UTC,It's a matter of taste and balance. I think the game becomes more fun the more difficult they make it. I even cranked up the spawn rate to high when starting with A12. I think it's great fun to have to run around and dodge your way to the loot. Being OP from day one is neither a challenge nor any fun.
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Maulgrump,0,Sat Jul 4 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"""It's a matter of taste and balance.""  thats why i feel it is to hard because i can't set it up to fit my taste  and its not being op but being able to do anything"
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Halon5,3,Sat Jul 4 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"Walking around in the most difficult area of the game completely unarmed and looting everything seems a bit OP to me. Or at least the environment was underpowered back then.   I don't think it's too difficult, but on the other hand I'm not playing the game as a shooter either. I can quite easily loot all the hunting cabins and camping sites that are located outside the cities. It's just a matter of luring the zombies away from there and then run back to in quickly grab all gear. There is no need to attack them. Maybe that's what you're struggling with?   I still love playing the older Resident Evil games because they were more about survival than shooting everthing. Is it too difficult to engage in combat? Then just move around them! They are slow and dumb for a reason.   Your last resort might be to start off your game with cheat mode enabled. That way you can spawn with any gear you see fit for a new game. Then just disable cheat mode and go on with your day."
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Halon5,0,Sat Jul 4 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"well its the fact that the game offers me weapons in dufflebags etc. BUT those weapons don't do anything to the zombies... i could as well beat them with my fists, would take longer but otherwhise exactly the same experience"

7daystodie,3c3qgn,Warlord42,3,Sat Jul 4 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"Use a bone shiv for early melee, works very well"
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Van_Tek,3,Sat Jul 4 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"melee doesn't work in general, if one zombie hits you (from 3m away -.-) you get stunned and hit again and again until you die or give up and run away from them  the only way to kill them is with ranged weapons and those were also nerfed (bow and crossbow) to unusability"
7daystodie,3c3qgn,SpectreFire,7,Sat Jul 4 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an honest L2P issue. If you are getting surrounded, run away and come back when they have dispersed.   I have pretty much cleared every zombie wave (4-5) with a Stone Axe because ducking in and out, hitting the head, then retreating for stamina is the best option.   I suggest practicing more. This isn't being rude, I am being honest. I had to have the same conversation with my friends."
7daystodie,3c3qgn,Bad_Karma21,2,Sat Jul 4 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Even if there's a L2P issue (and there really shouldn't be -- there's no reason the game can't accommodate all levels of play with enough difficulty setting tweaks), there's still a question to be answered on whether the game does a good job of allowing players to learn to play.  The difficulty curve in 7DtD is honestly a brick wall.  If you don't know exactly what to do and exactly how to do it with near-perfect efficiency, you're going to reeeaaaalllly struggle when starting out.  It would be really nice if there were a ""starter mode"" switch you could hit which would allow the difficulty to rise gently over the first few days for the players who want some chance to catch themselves when they drop into a new world.  It's great that you're happy with the current difficulty, but there's no reason whatsoever that TFP can't add a bit more onto the lower end of the difficulty scale (and heck, they could even add even more difficulty options for people who really want the challenge)."

I used to use melee all the time, before it was a breeze but now it seems like it's rare to be able to kill anything without also getting clocked as well.  I still play on a hardcore server but even with the massive nerf the bow is by far the better option. It's just tedious. I've tried the hunting knife and a variety of different clubs, they are all equally disappointing."

Finish the fucker with my bow taking around 20 head/bellyshots and the ravager is down. Grab the meat and get out of the hut ASAP. I need water, bad.  Trying to sprint with infection and reduced stamina, while fighting and fleeing can be challenging. It took some strategic running, pausing and maneuvering zombies to finally find a pond of water. Or more like a puddle. Christ. ""It's all I got"" I thought and filled a whole 4 cans with that shit water. Boiled it up and drank a few cans. Awesome.  But I was hungry too. Well, well, well, Mister Grizzly was a pleasant surprise after all. Before I realize I've grabbed the nutritious and smelly meat and stick'em in the camp fire.    Smelly.    Smell radius 20m.

I do really like the new animations they added. For example, in this case my character just curled into a ball and started sobbing. 10/10, would lose all hope again!"

Tree physics takes the terrain into account. The tree fell away from me, but slid down the hill at the same time.    Edit more:    The bow sucks when you first craft it. Makes sense, though. Just know that it sucks.  They should change the name to Bears vs. Zombie Simulator.  The new sounds make it quite immersive. Some ore veins now spawn visible on the surface.

Some ore veins now spawn visible on the surface.    I like that actually  Here is one more:   Spawned next to 2 bears, got killed Player does not fit through a 1 Block hole anymore when crouching."

I didn't think the crossbow was OP before the previous patch, if it ever took more to kill something than 2 headshots it wasn't even worth to use anymore. On harder difficulties crafting enough arrows or bullets to fend off invasions becomes a HUGE chore even with 1kill/headshot (granted you may even miss 30% of those)."
7daystodie,3c130x,Lock1454,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:16:29 2015 UTC,Oh I concur entirely.  But on the other hand it was also somewhat absurd that within 60 seconds of starting the game you used to have a weapon that can pretty easily carry you through the apocalypse on its own :P

I'm sure subsequent patches will fix half of these ""issues"".   Minibike   Movement seems to be a little choppy. Hands don't match the turning movements of the handlebars. Minibike audio could use more variations, e.g. revving up. Physics are still a bit clunky. No crash or fall damage to the bike or rider. Crashing into a zombie will kill it at the cost of some fuel and damage to the bike. Vision glitch causes my camera to go behind my player's head. Not sure what caused it. It eventually fixed itself after getting on and off the bike multiple times.  Environment   Day time sky looks great. Could be a little lighter of a blue shade. Night time sky needs to be a higher resolution. Looks a bit pixelated on my 1920x1080 resolution. Moon movements are a little choppy. I don't know how to explain it other than ""it doesn't feel right"". A falling tree (even a small one) will 1-shot kill you. Snowy biome looks cool as fuck. Hehe. I don't hear any weather noises though. I see the snow blowing around through the air, but no environmental sounds. Only my feet crunching snow beneath me and night sounds (which are pretty creepy). Explosives blow blocks into smaller chunks that are affected by world physics.  Zeds   Ragdolls are pretty cool. Ragdolls are not true ragdoll. Explosives do not affect dead zeds. All zombies seem to make the same ""spread eagle"" ragdoll animation.  Graphics   GFX look significantly better. Does anyone know what the different Anti-aliasing options mean?

The frame rate hovers around 20 often, but sometimes goes as high as 40 for a while? It's so confusing, and cranking the graphics to their absolute minimum seems to solve nothing.

So if you imagine the sound defined as a sphere in the engine, all the sounds seem like the sphere is right over the player, rather than at the zombie. Furthermore, if the player is at the edge of the sound sphere, the sound is the same as when the player is in the middle of it.   Another thing they could do would be sound damping for things like walls: you know how a nightclub sounds from outside? You can replicate that kind of thing in an audio editor by running either a high pass filter, or a low pass filter (I forget which one). I should basically give the impression that the sound is filtering through a surface, rather than just open air.   Edit: Sodding hell, my grammar is atrocious. 'They're setup' - really?"
7daystodie,3c130x,Industrialbonecraft,3,Sat Jul 4 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"Lowpass filter. Cuts out everything above a certain point, giving it that muffled sound. A highpass filter would cut everything below a certain point, which would be a highly strange effect for real life sounds lol"

You will lose any custom settings in the ServerConfig file however, such as custom server name/password, zombie settings, block hardness, etc. Those are easy enough to recover though.

But that's what I got in A11. Sitting out A12 unless I hear about performance optimizations.  To OP, 8GB RAM is generally considered the par for gaming these days. It's probably bottleneck in that 970. Not sure what i7 you have though. Shouldn't be a problem if it's at least a 2600 (not i7-970 basically)."

7daystodie,3c1lxb,rizzlybear,7,Sat Jul 4 02:43:52 2015 UTC,"There was a post that mentioned something bout it making looting too easy.   I guess the thought was that the zombies didn't know how to follow through 1x1's which made it possible to funnel them through a path where they would have to spend considerable time breaking through extra blocks, while the player looted and took off through an escape hole.   The ease and speed at which you could break through the green sheetrock and leave a fun house for trailing zombies pretty much meant that some method of that tactic was employed by almost everyone at some level.  It's not terribly more broken then building a spike pool next to a town and kiting the zeds through it to wipe the spawn. though the lack of prep required in hostile terrain could i suppose be seen as unbalanced. as long as you have a fireaxe or chainsaw you can pretty much carve a little fun house out of nearly any building.  not sure i feel like it was broken enough to fix.. but hey, it's an alpha. Now is when they get to try this stuff out to make an informed decision."
7daystodie,3c1lxb,procrastinatorgrrl,5,Sat Jul 4 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think it made looting too easy at all. Easier, yes. But it added an element of tension when you're inside a house and you can hear the zombies bashing at the door, and you know they've only got one block to break before they're in. Instead of them being able to hypo-detect you and know exactly which room you've gone in when you enter a house. You have to work quickly, but once you get back outside you know they're going to be waiting for you."

The two libraries didnt have the two most important books so we are on day 8 still without leather tanning or a forge. We can't really do anything without the forge.   The weak bows make things more scary now, theres still tension, when before it was gone when I had a bow. So it makes the game feel more dangerous than before.   The weather system seems funky because it is way too dark too often, the book spawning/town spawning seems off because I have searched almost half the map. I cant crouch through things anymore so I have to waste more time breaking stuff with my stone axe.   Overall its more ""real"" and dangerous but I'm having less fun."

I think the issue that most have is the bow you can craft at level 1 coupled with stone arrows doing shit damage is so terrible and drasticly different than what we are used to that people are just giving up on it.

The new one is just way too weak, there are way too many zeds everywhere, just die die die..   what's the point of even having 100 wellness to start now?   May as well just make 50 the default.

The only way I managed to survive a single night was digging a hole.   And the night was so LONG, I was already getting so bored sitting in the darkness I was ready to quit but then the zeds outside somehow magically knew where I was anyway even though I was undetected and doing -nothing- and started digging for me...

Here I've changed the range to 0.75, and altered the buff chances to reduce infection and stun chances as an example:  <!-- AttackAction -->             <property name=""Class"" value=""Melee"" />             <property name=""Delay"" value=""0.8"" />             <property name=""Range"" value=""0.75"" />             <property name=""Sphere"" value=""0.4"" />             <property name=""Block_range"" value=""2.5"" />             <property name=""DamageEntity"" value=""10"" />             <property name=""DamageBlock"" value=""2"" />             <property name=""Sound_start"" value=""swoosh"" />             <property name=""Buff"" value=""bleeding,infection,stunned"" />             <property name=""Buff_chance"" value=""0.1,0.07,0.1"" />             <property name=""DamageBonus.glass"" value=""25"" />   The block_range value is for attacking terrain and structure blocks, and should probably be left alone to allow enemies to hit blocks slightly above their heads."

7daystodie,3c2f95,Stormin318,9,Sat Jul 4 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"Here's a post by Madmole I found on the 7DTD forum:  ""The problem is you guys are trying to be heroes on day one. The old arrows did 30 points damage. Now stone arrows have been nerfed but iron arrows do 25 to 45 points damage, so at low quality they are at about equal to the old arrows and at high quality are much better. Then there are steel arrows which do 25 to 55, and flaming arrows even more. So my advice is not to mess with a bow but make a club or iron club. They are improved from a11 and do more damage. Zombies are not stunned as easily but if you move in hit and back up you should be fine. Only engage them when your stamina is over 50 and your chance to stun them is higher, they cannot attack back when stunned.  You cannot run into a POI and just raid any more. You need to craft some things, level up, make some cloth armor by gathering. Make a wood fort, you'll gain some exp points. Just hide and survive the first day or two. Once you have at least all the cloth armor pieces try to take over a small tent POI or an old shed. Don't go for a larger POI they have too many zeds.  If you insist, here is an easy way to kill z's at level 1. Chop down a few trees and make 4 spiked logs. Line them up in the street. The z's will walk over them to reach you. Circle around the logs and clear out a lot of zombies. Then you can loot all you want. The trick is to reach about level 5-10 and then start to engage the enemy. Until then you should lay low building frames and fighting a single zombie with an iron club.  We might address the arrows, I didn't realize they were nerfed so bad but I wanted a place to go with them, they do a LOT of damage when your a higher level. Right now at level 1 they will kill a z with 4 headshots. That might be a little too hard. An iron club will kill most z in 3-4 shots to the head at level 1, if you wait til level 5 and get lucky to craft a 100 quality one, you will do even better. Craft everything you can to level up a bit and you should be fine. But I'll look at level 1 stuff again and make some tweaks. Hang in there it is REALLY fun once you get over the hump and start gaining levels and finding better loot. The problem is people expect alpha 12 to play how alpha 11 did. It's harder on day one, but more rewarding if you stick with it."""

Animals are hard to hunt, and they should be, especially considering the wellness boost. In A11 I usually had a mess of bacon and eggs within the first couple of days, and it was never an issue after that. Now that POIs are so hard to approach at low levels even gathering a sack of canned food is a challenge. I'm back to scrounging for berries and rooting around in trash piles for a few wretched scraps. Shamway stores used to be that place filled with crap where I'd stop for a six-pack, now I sit outside and drool, wondering if I can slip past the zombies and escape with a can of peas.

FOUR headshots to kill a single zombie? The problem wasn't that the first few game days were too easy, it was that the later game days were. You don't fix that by making early game harder.  I can totally understand the intro - don't try to be a hero on day one.

I've hunted a with homemade bow and arrows IRL and it really is a frustrating experience. With this release there are a lot of changes, like more items gated behind books that are harder to acquire, which pushes that ""end game"" scenario even farther out of reach. It's a carrot on a stick, and we were never meant to catch it.  I think his point is that 7DTD isn't supposed to be about feeling powerful and secure, it was always about immersing yourself in that sense of desperation and living one day at a time.

Your arrows are likely far from balanced, with fletching that serves more as decoration than actually succeeding in making it fly straight.  And being an alpha we don't really have lore to work with, it's possible this particular flavor of zombie has really tough skin to boot, or the skin is squishy and rotting but the bones got super hard.  Plenty of realistic (at least as realistic as it gets in this context) explanations for the current system, and pretty much zero that make sense for a novice being able to make their own bow and arrows to shoot for their first time ever and getting kills in 1 and 2 shots consistently."

7daystodie,3c2f95,Rock1monkey,2,Sat Jul 4 03:44:08 2015 UTC,Bone shivs are incredibly useful for melee now. I never used them once in A11 and now they're saving my life.
7daystodie,3c2f95,Grave-Bait,2,Sat Jul 4 03:44:36 2015 UTC,Yes I have started using them as well. Especially since you cant make arrows out of the bone anymore.
7daystodie,3c2f95,CcrLyaSrtIatLy,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:48 2015 UTC,really? I find they don't stun at all and have such a short range that dodging back after a shiv strike is quite difficult

(A nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the  ends of worms and an oozy smell.) I've been having graphical issues so I'm generally avoiding POIs for now, but I've found it's been a significant challenge to even take over an old camp site. Try picking off isolated zombies to gain some levels until you can craft better weapons. Raid what you can and run for the hills.  I had been playing on insane/max spawn on Alpha 11 and I've had to crank things way down again. I like it, it's a refreshing change from crafting a Bow of Doom™ in the first five minutes and clearing a whole town before the day is done. My advice - don't give up. The most important battle for survival takes place in your head and you have to keep reminding yourself that it will eventually get better."
7daystodie,3c2f95,ConfessionsAway,3,Sat Jul 4 03:45:34 2015 UTC,Yep very much agree. Its that damn ammo. If I could just find some iron arrow tips or happen upon forge ahead. I was able to make a poor quality bow but that does ke no good with crap ammo. Lol. Im also on Day 3.

I've got all of one iron arrowhead I found on a zombie, I don't think it's going to help much. I just stumbled across my first bone and made a shiv though. I see several others have already mentioned it, and with an entity damage of 12 it beats the heck out of the old rock-on-a-stick.  I just tested and it doesn't seem that bears respond to smelly food in your inventory, so at least we've got that going for us. XD"

The terrain gen and weather effects look amazing, I love the [Esc] pause feature (at least on single player) and I ""have enough food to slowly heal"" after stepping on a cactus. I'm getting pretty decent performance on max settings with a rather weak system, but we'll see how that works when it's tasked to render more than blackness.

The only thing causing them to kill anything right now is probably the 50% bleed chance on the arrows.

7daystodie,3c1awo,croppergib,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:03:47 2015 UTC,This is why I'm kind of skipping the bow until i'm able to male better arrows.

Going to take me time to adjust. Also on the regen maps you see some absolutely crazy shit... gonna need some tweaking!"

7daystodie,3c1awo,PhD_in_internet,-13,Sat Jul 4 06:31:33 2015 UTC,You need to build a new bow. Yours is broken. Its quality will increase as your character levels up.  It does take a lot of shots to put one down though. 3 head shots it seems.
7daystodie,3c1awo,Jeradox,5,Fri Jul 3 21:21:43 2015 UTC,My bow is not broken. It was a brand new bow.
7daystodie,3c1awo,jebemvamkurcineadmin,-11,Fri Jul 3 21:40:38 2015 UTC,Crappy bows break really fast.
7daystodie,3c1awo,lmayyyo,5,Fri Jul 3 22:34:37 2015 UTC,Please listen to me when I say that the bow was not broken. Why do I have to keep writing this fact before it is understood that thit is not the problem. The arrows have zero (0.0) entity damage. This means that they do zero damage. Any deaths that occur will be from bleading damage.   Edit: spelling

7daystodie,3c19ze,snuffles324,2,Fri Jul 3 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"My understanding is this type of error is when the game is expecting to find something (a value for an entity, or perhaps the entity itself) and it can not (it only finds a null value). In my experience this can randomly occur from any number of things. I've personally had it happen to me when i am messing around with containers/forges/fires....If you can figure out what might of caused the problem, you can try to resolve it yourself...For example, when i took the cooked meat off the fire, it started happening, in this case, get rid of the cooked meat."

It's now not a level 1 weapon that you use the entire game. Bows now have quality too, but I'm not sure if that affects damage. Early game is difficult, yes, but it's been more fun in my experience so far."

Current strategy is to get a couple arrows in each zombie, hope bleed has taken effect, wait for their health to drop, and then crush their skulls with a pipe."
7daystodie,3c44sz,PhD_in_internet,3,Sat Jul 4 17:21:28 2015 UTC,"They do damage, the tooltip is just bugged. Stone arrows just do Crap damage. Iron arrows actually make the bow feel useful and steel arrows even more so. Even a poor QL bow becomes handy once you can reliably craft iron arrows."
7daystodie,3c44sz,PvtHopscotch,2,Sat Jul 4 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"I checked the XML and the regular arrows do in fact do a base damage of 5, iron is 15 and steel and fire are 25.  It is the Tool tip that is messed up.  All Arrows have a head shot modifier of 6 so on normal difficulty it will take 4 head shots per Zombie with the regular arrows."

7daystodie,3c44sz,TheFlyingDharma,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:29:18 2015 UTC,I have a hard time telling since I can't seem to get a headshot to connect with the bow. Even melee headshots are flakey at times but doable but I'll be dammed if I can get an arrow to register in a zombie melon.

7daystodie,3bytjf,Mediatekk,3,Fri Jul 3 14:08:45 2015 UTC,Steam is fast with the updates. When Ark updates the game (which happens multiple time a week) they usually go out within the hour it is announced.

7daystodie,3bytjf,Stargos,3,Fri Jul 3 18:21:07 2015 UTC,That's good I would just have to save up the $400 (or so) so I can get something like that.

7daystodie,3bytjf,partisan98,5,Fri Jul 3 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yes madmole did say in one of his most recent posts that he believes he has solid framework in A12 to do smaller updates for months to come with no wipes, unbarring any huge unforeseen bugs which are always a possibility in an alpha. This is going to be a really good one, I am very impressed with his dedication to get us this motor bike, and random gen 3.0 is a huge bonus and well worth a wipe. I do hope that he has prefab packs built into it as I found multiplayer servers with prefab packs MUCH less barren than the single player random gen worlds.  Yes this is the biggest reason why people stop playing is they don't want to invest too much time into a wiped project. But this is going to be an update that will bring back more sustained life in that regard as there are no big wipes in the foreseeable future after this one. I'm more worried about the fps taking a noticeable hit, as the game is just now post a11 >60fps on my entry level gaming rig. Low FPS was my biggest reasons of leaving the game in the past but it is manageable now though I hear those with a laptop have been in trouble. We will see in A12."

7daystodie,3bytjf,TribalDancer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:23:10 2015 UTC,I believe the devs did mention that they are hoping to end that cycle. Luckily it seems to be a few months in between each major patch.

7daystodie,3c1soq,thejeran,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:28:50 2015 UTC,Is this on dedi servers too or just when a friend is hosting. I was getting bitch slapped by a zombie from the otherside of a roof but not sure if that was because of my 225 ping.  We bought a server through gameservers but they've been awful with the new update - restarts don't work so the servers been unplayable since the last release.

Bugs are to be introduced with Alpha releases, the main objective of alpha releases is adding content, and they did that, we have the first vehicle, bears, rains and a new world random gen."
7daystodie,3c3o9c,jcmais,-14,Sat Jul 4 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"Never expected finished. I watched worth a buys video and 7 days to die was recommended as the best survival, crafting game with good combat. I hated dayz and after a few hrs of playing 7dtd i loved it."
7daystodie,3c3o9c,sylocheed,20,Sat Jul 4 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose the game is called 7 Days to Die, but I didn't expect it to go in the direction of death upon picking up a fallen log, bears every 20 metres, dying from a piece of dirt falling on your head and having zombies with apparent hologram heads you can shoot straight through.  Real shame what's happened to it.   Son, the point jcmais is trying to make is that an ""alpha"" in software development means that features are still being added to experiment with things. New features often bring new bugs, and frankly software development best practices say it should be that way—release early, release often.  Look, it's okay to raise complaints about new bugs. That's what alpha access is for, and if they are experimenting with game balancing and stuff, this feedback is really useful to developers. Software development is often two steps forward (awesome new environment engine), and one step back (too awesome, all the time isn't actually ""fun""). People should definitely be voicing both what's good and what's bad about the new release to help prioritize bug fixing.  However...  You're not going to find tons of sympathy if you express things in the ""Real shame what's happened to it"" attitude that reeks of entitlement because you've been personally wounded and you're interpreting these changes as an intentional and personal attack by the developers. That they don't care what your feelings are—hell they don't even care if their game is any good—and they wanted to make the game you loved so much into a shit game that's not worth your money anymore.  No, the real shame is that folks don't understand that 7DTD is probably in the top 5-10% of early release softwares, and it's a real shame that these folks don't understand that what distinguishes good early release software and bad early release software isn't about whether there are new bugs or that new releases may break shit, but it's whether the developer gives a damn to keep building things, to keep improving the software on a regular basis... even if it means each time there will be an ungrateful whinefest from people who don't understand alpha software."

I wouldn't say it's just a couple of bugs and balance issues too.. what I posted is just my own and a friends experience within a couple of hrs playthrough. There's probably much more.  I doubt they will be ""fixed"" too, many of these issues seem to be the developers creative vision being brought into the game, like the amount of bears (they might love bears), rainy weather, dark environments etc. Maybe thats what they prefer and maybe some of the community too. I just know from the guys that I play this with, none of them have an interest to continue at the moment.  We've been looking at Ark but we were happy at 7DTD and our server before the update. We don't even have a server hosting company who can provide a server we can connect to at the moment... the updates fucked up a lot."

Give them a few days to fix the bugs, tweak the balancing (I see the bow and bears being messed with), and the Server Hosts will also sort it out.

Before it was abysmal with sunlight lighting up underground. Now it is much more atmospheric.   character textures glitching out - goes all black or distorted 7DTD logo texture everywhere  biome loading can glitch out, or load over the top of an existing biome. E.g. insta-snow covered lands in a second.  bears, bears & more bears - they're everywhere, including deserts  crazy weather - never seen so much rain.. in the desert.  game weather or effects not synched to players in MP, one can hear lightening or have it raining, but its not the same for the other player  insta-death by picking up log from fallen tree  insta-death by 1 dirt falling on head (just happened to a friend his little hole, he lost his backpack too, he's since ragequit)   I am sure those bugs/problems are getting addressed one way or the other.   Arrows can pass through zombies heads - a bug we find regularly. Really bad hit boxes. Enemies have a 3 metre reach when attacking! If they swipe from 5 metres away then you'll take damage.    Despite melee being a big risk in this game, that is not true. When they can hit you, you can hit them. Time your attacks better.   longer night cycles   Love it. Makes nights more dangerous. You can adjust it though.   Bow nerfed to fuck. Now the damage to durability ratio means you need about 100 arrows to fight 10 zombies. Then you will need to make a new bow.   That needs to be addressed I agree.  But all in all, I don't understand why you are so upset."

I suspect that if someone made a bow at yellow quality, they'd be getting results similar results to Alpha 11.  The game isn't perfect, but improving with this update. People have to understand: I want that challenge. I don't want to start up a game, and have a crossbow, forge,  bacon and eggs, and a pistol by day 1. It get's boring.

A lot of the new content needs to be looked at for balance, but that's exactly why it's been given to us. Now they collect our opinions, and slowly modify things to suit what the community believes is the most enjoyable version of 7dtd. Do you know why we even have half the shit in this game? You're new to it, relatively speaking, but the developers have done a bang-up job of listening to the community and adding or changing content according to our collective preferences. You don't like some of the stuff in the update? I hear a lot of people saying that, and I can guarantee the devs do too. They'll change some stuff, and add some stuff, and you'll find yourself enjoying alpha 12 more and more. Don't be hasty, don't jump to extremes, because these devs do an insane amount of shit for us whiny bastards, rest assured in the coming weeks you will be satisfied once again."

Though I just forwarded 26900-26902 TCP/UDP. You can change what ports you want it to use in the serverconfig.xml file. It'll use that port +2.

Should be fine though, I have set up dedicated servers for both Killing Floor 2 and Terraria the last month so I know what I'm doing.

7daystodie,3c0f5d,UnremarkablyWeird,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"I had the same trouble setting up my server, the conflicting information is because port 25000 used to be default until A8 or A9, after which default was changed to 26900."

7daystodie,3c0f5d,UnremarkablyWeird,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:21:10 2015 UTC,Yeah... That wasn't what I asked. I want to know what ports I should forward and it doesn't help me to see how dedicated servers are set up.
7daystodie,3c0f5d,Jeradox,0,Fri Jul 3 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's more important since the server config makes it easy to change the port, and people do. So you can't reliably open the correct ports with a blanket port forward operation. Instead, read the port of the new server you want to play on and open that port."
7daystodie,3c0f5d,Jeradox,3,Fri Jul 3 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need to port forward when you're connecting to someone else's server, only when you're hosting on a local machine and want to allow outside connections.   SKEW_YOU asked what the current default ports are when you set up a server to host because online there are many different ports listed because the default has changed over different builds.  On top of that, just forwarding that one port you see in the server list won't give you enough information. Why? Because the server will request that port +2 sequential ports, and the server browser window also doesn't tell you if it needs to be TCP or UDP or both."

7daystodie,3byyxs,Wedge129,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:09:56 2015 UTC,"Even though all of the following early access survival games can be compared and categorized in the same genre, they all have their own niches, as well as different stages of development making it hard to compare. Having played most of them extensively, here's my 2 cents in chronological order: (features>the bad>the good)  DayZ: Zombies(if there are any). No building (yet), perma-death, realism, vehicle(s), static map, indestructible world. Poorly optimized, bugs, de-sync issues because poor netcode and reasons (engine, etc) but one hell of a thrill if it does work as intended. Hackers/cheaters/dupers are not so common, but tough to deal with as there are no private servers yet. Probably has the most types of loot items of all games.    Rust: Modular base building, no perma-death, semi-realism, no vehicles (yet), static and/or proc-gen map (sort of limited), indestructible world. The servers start lagging badly 3 days after wipe and makes PvX near to impossible. Relatively little hacker/cheater problems on modded servers. But, who didn't love Rust legacy? ""New Rust"" surpasses its legacy with it's unique style and features. Graphically optimized and playable. I would say the most authentic/original non-zombie experience.   7D2D: Zombies. Voxel based building, no perma-death, semi-realism, vehicle, proc gen/static map, destructible world, crafting/character leveling system. I got to hand it to TFP, they did a fantastic job and this remains my favorite zombie-survival game to date. Even though the PvP is poor, the depth in base building/crafting surpasses all others and the PvE is one of the-if not the best out there, especially on P2P or singleplayer. The game is pretty balanced, has one of the best atmospheric environments and is graphically optimized/playable. Cheaters/hackers can easily be dealt with on modded servers with admins and back-ups, not a big issue. I only have 1 wish for this game: large pop servers with good performance netcode-wise.  H1Z1: Zombies. Prefab building, perma-death, semi-realism, vehicles, static map, indestructible world. Lacks balance in risk-rewards and base building. Big hacker problem. A real shame, because this game prolly has the best netcode of all, especially when taking scale and server pop in consideration. Graphically optimized and playable.  Space Engineers: Asteriods. Voxel-based building/worlds, perma-death (optional), semi-realism (optional), vehicles, proc-gen and/or infinite (optional) map, destructible world (optional). This being mostly a sandbox building game I wasn't sure whether to include it, but recently the dev's have started to put more time into expanding the survival mode and is growing to be interesting enough for a mention. Currently not worth to play PvP (below average netcode), but an upcoming patch should fix most of the problems there. PvE is basic, although being improved upon. I have yet to see/read/hear about hackers in this game. It's you in the vast nothingness of space, mining for resources on asteroids, trying to stay save from meteor storms, keeping your oxygen levels up and your reactors fueled with uranium. Think Minecraft, in space, with way better graphics(DX11).    ARK: Survival evolved: Dinosaurs. Limited, modular base-building, no perma-death, semi-realism, vehicles(riding dino's), static map, indestructible world, crafting/character leveling system. Average netcode. UE4 (amongst things) takes a toll on most consumer PC's and makes the game poorly optimized. Graphically the most beautiful game if anyone could run it on maxed settings. Group-play is promoted heavily with gaining bonus XP by crafting/doing stuff near group (tribe) members, making solo-play rather tedious, but not impossible. Balancing of many aspects of the game could be improved upon. Little to no hackers/cheaters unless private(home-made). This game takes progression to the next level with its MMORPG-like leveling system. Great PvX experience.   In the end it will come down to personal preferences and the overall experience YOU have with these games.  I think PvP is as important as PvE in this genre, but unfortunately almost all these games fail at handling either properly or have other problems that render them (-close to) unplayable. So the standard and thus my expectations are lower by default.  Note: When I mention ""netcode"" I refer to the communication speed/stability between server, clients and back (If bad causes lag, warping, delay, etc). When I mention ""graphically optimized"" I refer to the game being graphically optimized for an average(mainstream) consumer PC relative to the state and time of development."
7daystodie,3byyxs,vergaerd,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:24:50 2015 UTC,I dunno about the best survival game. I like 7d2d but for me the forest is the best survival game. 7d2d isn't really a hard survival game once you find a gun with some  ammo.

7daystodie,3bxyop,SirkTheMonkey,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:39:37 2015 UTC,They're on his computer. He'll need to find the save file for the world you're playing on then the files named for your player profile (based on your long-form Steam ID number).  I had this problem happen recently on a friend's game that he was hosting and playing on.
7daystodie,3bxyop,DibsArchaeo,2,Fri Jul 3 10:40:30 2015 UTC,He needs to go to C:\Users\YOURNAME\Documents\7 Days To Die\Saves\Navezgane\MAPNAME\Player and delete the map files. You will lose progress on the mini-map but everything else will be alright.

7daystodie,3bubpx,TribalDancer,9,Thu Jul 2 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"Taken from the blog post:     Here are some random shots of my legit long term game I’ve been playing. I have to say, and I know I always say this but it feels like a whole new game all over again, and this is the best the game has ever played. The minibike is a great long term goal and is a big game changer. Oh its going to be dark soon I better head back to my base… wait no screw that I’m looting until the sun goes down then I’ll ride home. Oh crap I got infected and I’m slow… oh wait it doesn’t matter I can drive home just as fast infected as I can healthy :)  The minibike feels pretty balanced. I will have a gas issue soon, what fuel I had saved up prior to making it is starting to dry up. You can run zombies over with it, but it takes damage. And yes you are pretty safe at night, but I got a little to cocky last night and heard a bear and thought I need some more bear stew so in the dark I parked my bike and killed the bear, and as I was trying to harvest him a bunch of running zeds attacked me. It was a frantic firefight in the pitch black, but having a good quality shotgun with flashlight attachment does have it’s perks. I killed the immediate threat but heard many more footsteps on the way so I got on the bike and left, and didn’t get the bear meat.  Another incident was when I got the minibike stuck on too steep of a hill and snow zombies were running at me. I had to back out of the steep wedge and took some hits and barely got out of that one. So be careful driving at night, or stay on the roads. I’m building a nicer garage for my bike now. I can’t wait for remote garage door openers and bigger doors. It fits through a door just fine but I want a super fort with big garage doors dangit and I will have them!  I’m having a blast playing 7 Days to Die, and I’m building a nice steel underground bunker at the bottom of a cave. I’m really enjoying the leveling, the leveled loot and looting. Everything is starting to feel more like a finished product and coming together. No that doesn’t mean we’re done working, it just means a lot of systems are coming together and feeling polished. There is a lot more to do and a lot more polishing to do in the upcoming alphas.   Also the team is committed to shorter builds for a while. We’ve done enough frame work to support this, and even though we’ve added a lot of content in the last several weeks as I’ve played this save game we havne’t broken it. So I’m confident we can start patching frequently without breaking save games, and update about once a month from now on. We’re really excited and should ship Alpha 12 very soon as long as no huge bugs show up."

On my 4th I fortified one of the three story brick buildings with reinforced concrete and a moat of spikes with the car out front serving as a bridge. After a few 7-day hordes I decided I was ready for some harder settings. That's when I noticed A12 was coming with better terrain generation so I'm definitely planning on starting a new map. I just don't want to build a giant castle only to have to restart in a matter of days.

The last couple of years the game has, to be honest, looked outright bad with low detail models and textures. But it looked consistent - all parts of the game had the same level of quality. Back before the terrain was smoothed there was a certain charm to the look of the game.      Now that you've managed to move to Unity 5 and have done great improvements with the sky, speedtree, terrain generation, updating character models and a lot more, it becomes a even apparent how bad certain aspects of the game actually look.   Therefore I think it's more important than ever to keep improving the visuals, because it will look really weird if some parts are left untouched and end up looking like they did three years ago.      I'm confident the game would take a major leap in looks if the terrain and flora textures/models got an update. But as always, there's a prioritization between adding new features and polishing/improving existing ones."

7daystodie,3bth6d,OctoberBrigade,7,Thu Jul 2 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"That's how I felt with the normal game. My group and I worked to build a great defense, and 15 days in, the challenge dropped off significantly. We had zombies turned up, our difficulty turned up, etc. though when night came, we sat in our reinforced base with multiple escape plans setup only to have 5 zombies attack. :(  We jumped into the XML modding and changed all that. Now, huge hordes of zombies attack every night. If you're caught outside, you'll die. Further, during the day, lots of zombies spawn, far more than the normal game settings allow. It has really helped make the game a ton of fun as the threat is real.  My suggestion is to take a look at XML modding. You can change the XML a bit to have zombies attack more frequent and be more challenging. Alas, I don't have any knowledge of modding the XML stuff, this is just what my friend (host) ended up doing. Good luck!"
7daystodie,3bth6d,Akaishen,4,Thu Jul 2 01:00:58 2015 UTC,Get your friend on here! I'd be interested in a tutorial.

7daystodie,3bth6d,rezanow,3,Thu Jul 2 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"I believe you can. We have a drop everyday, which I believe my host setup via the XML files. Not sure my friend Reddits, though I'll let him know. :)"
7daystodie,3bth6d,Akaishen,3,Thu Jul 2 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"Continuously scaling difficulty past the 7th day would be nice. As for zombie attacks 7th day hordes have usually been really large in my world. Usually have tons, 40+ maybe. We actually spent about 200 shotgun shells and several pipe bombs on our first 7th day horde. I did increase zombie spawns to 125% and set day/night cycles to be 90 minutes with 30 minutes of night. With so much activity at the base we get a good amount of spider zombies that call hordes in."
7daystodie,3bth6d,bufu619,9,Thu Jul 2 03:37:14 2015 UTC,"I recently picked up The Forest out of curiosity. The crafting and world generation in 7days is far superior. The cannibal AI in Forest however is entirely more dangerous. Obvious we cannot have zombies zip around with a measure of intelligence, but we could have halfway zombies, people who are infected and slowly turning, but not quite there yet. This worked really well in Dying Light.  For those who haven't played The Forest, don't bother. The game is tiny and gets boring really quickly(it is alpha though). But the cannibal AI is really good.  Basically the cannibals patrol the island. You can avoid them if you back off, stay hidden, stay silent and do not attract them by making large fires and I assume noise would also attact them. Some will come close to you and then back off, do charging attacks to scare you off. Circle around you. Climb up trees and jump down. All in all, they are scary as hell - especially at night.  So for 7days I imagine you could keep the game dangerous by adding new NPC.   Regular uninfected humans. Some bandits, some helpful(quests, traders). Infected humans. Will attack, possibly back off only to attack again as the infection takes control. Will show some measure of intelligence. Regular zombies, keep the current variety of spider, fatties, cops etc. etc. Feral zombies, they need to be more dangerous and not just harder to kill. Perhaps program them to be more sneaky. Elder zombies. These are the toughest ones. They're dumb, but they are hard to kill. They come with adds. Something like the boss zombies from Dead Island or Dying Light. Tough and dangerous. Special abilities like wielding traffic signs as melee weapons. Imagine Usain Bolt, on fire, wielding a melee weapon and charging at you. That'd be scary. Rare zombies, but with better loot.   I don't know. Just some stray thoughts there."

7daystodie,3bth6d,TribalDancer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"You are completely wrong about The forest, besides the impressive AI the immersion you get in that game is unbelievable, I'd say its up there with modded Stalker and Amnesia in terms of putting fear in you.  I really like both games but personally for me its 7daystodie that gets boring and bland after a while, I play on the highest difficulty and delete my worlds after dying, the recipe to succeeding in this game is the following: chainsaw + fuel, once you get that you're invincible and the game gets stale."
7daystodie,3bth6d,Jaskorus,2,Fri Jul 3 01:36:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting, how am I wrong? Obviously game preference is individual.  What I've seen from The Forest is, the island itself is tiny. Trees are probably the most valuable resource and they do not regrow? You have a book with 15-20 items that you can build and nothing else.  It's a very limited game. 7 days lasts a bit longer, but the potential is already much larger in my opinion. The Forest has potential, sure, but it's much quicker done with."

Even 4 players draws a big crowd. Some of our fights (no modding) lasted until noon the next day.   But I do wish the hordes escalated with time. We were on day 300+ and felt like we could stand mid-Hub City at night and never break a sweat.   I think we need to see Full-Feral Hordes, only Cops, Dogs, and Ferals. Or something. The stress you have the first few days is the peak of the game play experience. There is something very fun about digging a hole and putting a wood frame over your head just to survive that you don't get 100s of days later when you are sitting in your office chair on your killing deck."
7daystodie,3bth6d,obuw,2,Thu Jul 2 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think the game needs a lot more content that encourages you to leave the safety of your base. Different metals you need to mine, different crops that grow in different biomes, resources from different animals you need to hunt, etc.  Right now, you just find one cave, mine for an ingame day or two, and you get enough metal of all 3 kinds to last you for life.  This isn't really a problem inherent to 7DTD though. Same thing exists other games, like Don't Starve for instance. You just get past the learning curve of figuring out how to survive, and then there is no challenge left.  I'm looking forward to full modding support, as that will likely be the time we will be able to see a huge influx of content."

It also depends on the server settings & population, if you are the only ones on the server chances are that you will have more zombies to deal with than if you are one that has 10 other people and a lower zombie spawn rate."
7daystodie,3bth6d,Dardoleon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"we run our own server, so when it gets boring we just crank up the zombies :P"
7daystodie,3bth6d,AshenMoon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like at that point, you may want to find a harder server or start trying to draw zombies to your base for some action. When my friend and I are bored, we start up all our forges and campfires right before nightfall, and since we are usually one of a just a few people on the server, we usually get a decently sized horde at night to fight off until close to morning. The zombies are still pretty hard on the server I'm on, and while we have a decent amount of ammo and guns, we don't normally stray too far from our base."
7daystodie,3bu3l1,Lock1454,6,Thu Jul 2 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"No worries. Let's go down your list...  Wood Frames are your basic wood based building block. The best part is that they're temporary. You can place them, and pick them up at will.   But, once you've decided how you want it built and you've placed the frames, you can use a tool to upgrade (and make permanent) the frame into Old Wood.  After that, you can upgrade again into Reinforced Wood, and again (with Scrap Iron) into Metal Reinforced Wood.     Metal Trussing is a support material, and is the strongest (in regards to construction, not defense) in the game. Use it to build a wide floor/roof. For simple purposes and early game, I'd save your metal. Head into creative mode to test build things to see how wide it can go, and how much weight it can hold.   The structural integrity system has been a fun topic for me to look into. I'm still learning it, but I'm figuring things out as I go.   First off, I learned that the important factor is the block to the left of whatever beam/floor you're building. Here's an example. These are the longest beams I could build without them crashing down. The supporting block on the end is the important factor. As I said in my post a few days ago...   The structural integrity is based upon that block the beam extends from. This is the important distinction. On the near one, it's extending from the side of a concrete block. While a concrete block has an integrity of 6, that number is calculated assuming you're building more concrete on it (Mass of 15, Max Load of 90). Since the trussing has a Mass of 20, 4 trussing is 80 Mass, one more and you're past the 90 Max of the concrete block it connects to - so, it falls.   Don't get too caught up in the other elements though. I've built some strange things because the physics system isn't perfect. In that last image, zombies munched the leg while I was building, and it still didn't fall. All the weight of the structure is still well supported by the other three pillars.     You'll feel far more confident building if you take some time to practice build in creative mode (or enable the cheats on a Survival SP map). Good luck!"
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,3,Thu Jul 2 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the write up :) So with regards to that photo with the trussing, do you then go and 'repair' the trussing to upgrade the block much like you would the wooden frames?  For walls with concrete, do you just craft and then place concrete blocks or do you do some sort of magic where you 'fill' an already placed frame block?"
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,3,Thu Jul 2 13:38:55 2015 UTC,"Trussing has no upgrade.  Concrete has no upgrade.  Reinforced concrete starts with rebar, upgrades with wood to look like a plywood mold, and then you pour cement mix inside and wait for it to cool. One of the best materials against the zeds, but expensive and time consuming.   Clay turns into Brick, which is strangely weak. But, combine the Brick with Fertile Soil to make Decayed Brick and it's as solid as Concrete (and potentially easier to acquire if you have clay near you)."
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,2,Thu Jul 2 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"Think I'm grasping it more now.  I was a bit confused due to my watching a random video from a streamer who was placing frameworks of some sort and then placing some kind of grey block (stone, concrete, dunno!) on both sides of the frames.  It made me believe that to place actual building materials they had to be attached to a frame piece. For example  ---XOX---  Where - is empty area, X is the stone and O is the piece of framework.  If you didn't place the O in between the other blocks it just wouldn't build/work."

7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"I could see why that was confusing! They could be doing it for aesthetics, but more likely they were doing it for structural integrity. You see, the span of any material you are able to make is partly dependent on the block it is attached to. So a line of blocks attached to the side of a wood frame cannot span as far as a line of the same blocks attached to the side of metal trussing. So it may have had a practical purpose as well."
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,2,Thu Jul 2 22:39:12 2015 UTC,How would this all go about if you were building a vertical beam on top of a horizontal layer not directly supported by a pillar under the new vertical? ------y ------y ------y --xxxxxxx --z------z --z------z  Is the new vertical y column fine and dandy assuming the x row was  structurally sound before y was placed?  Or does y place additional stress upon the x/z and would hence need direct pillar support underneath y? (will try to have this be my final question :P)
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,2,Thu Jul 2 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"No worries about final questions. I get sad when my inbox is empty. lol  If you build like this...    y   y   y czzzd x   x x   x   Then you are putting the weight of all the Y blocks AND the Z blocks on the C and D support. But...  y   v y   v y   v czzzd x   x x   x   Building like this means that the Y blocks and V blocks are completely removed from the integrity equation. The only question now is if C and D can support Z.  Seriously, X could be made of SAND, and you could still build a rock solid floor above it. As long as the corner anchors are strong enough. For example...  http://imgur.com/w2KrMan  That Concrete platform was built on sand.   Here's another floor added.   http://imgur.com/z8zxWpt  I know it gets more complicated that this. These are simplistic and minimalist. Real examples, with storage chests, forges, campfires, etc. may push the envelope too far."
7daystodie,3bu3l1,Hockeybeard,2,Thu Jul 2 14:43:36 2015 UTC,Got ya.  Makes me think that the you're going to need to use a ton of pillars to make any room bigger than a bathroom :(
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,2,Thu Jul 2 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"No, that's where trussing comes in. It's super strong.   http://imgur.com/FpJIeFe   I originally build the floor with concrete, and it failed. Too much weight in the middle. I retried with wood. The wood will support itself, but the holes are where I fell through (built it while flying, but tested it by walking on it).  http://imgur.com/tfGhQF6 But, there are limitations. Even with that extra trussing beam across the middle, the wood isn't strong enough to hold my body weight."
7daystodie,3bu3l1,Hockeybeard,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:21 2015 UTC,Is the effect of the trussing here that it provides a closer point of support along the perimeter for the middle floor to be anchored to (as opposed to the 4 corners)?
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:07:39 2015 UTC,"I think so. This is where I am still experimenting.   http://imgur.com/U9EoC3d  I ran across the entire floor and those are the only ones that fell. So, even the nearby truss beam made no difference. I need a better understanding of the math behind this."
7daystodie,3bu3l1,rezanow,2,Thu Jul 2 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that if there is a cave system underneath your supports, they will act strangely in relation to what they normally can hold.  I've tried building right on top of a cave mouth and soon realized that one side could not support any additional blocks no matter how many pillars I made below it since the structural integrity is dependent upon the pillars connection to the bedrock below - if there is any space then you are relying upon adjacent blocks and THAT connection to bedrock.  It's all very complicated and honestly convoluted.  i appreciate u/rezanow's efforts to fix up the wiki to clear things up."

7daystodie,3bu3l1,Shang_Dragon,2,Thu Jul 2 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"from my understanding it is never ignored (at least not currently).  If the space directly above bedrock is empty, and every space above is filled, it will still act strangely (I know that is vague, but I can't every anticipate what will happen with my structures if this is the case)."

Those 4 Crushed Sand will forge into ~5 Glass Jars. (The Glass Mold holds 0.8 mass, and each Crushed Sand equals 1 mass.

Simple as that, if they find your base, then it will be raided, even if you kill them they will wait until 4am in the morning to try again. – Personal experience  Making a pimp base and waking up to find someone has taken TNT to it while you slept is disheartening.   The outer shell of your base should be reinforced concrete, then clad that in decayed brick or something that contrasts well, use redwood for the floors to add a luxurious elements to the room, use paintings and black leather couches, make an alcove for your kitchen and put down a fridge. Minimalism is a good element to design, don’t clutter the space, make sure you have room to move around.   I will post a picture of my latest pimp cave when I get home to show you what I mean."

I build it up a little, add a few unlocked chests, unlocked door, make it look a little pleasant to loot. People will still destroy it regardless. Usually all that will be left are ruins, and that's okay. A little bit away, underground and hidden is a ladder deep down. No land claim blocks. That shows people you're around.   So I dig down as far as I'm comfortable, then set up my real chests and sleeping bag. I never place my forges in the same den. People can hear those. Rather, I've got another hidden den I dug out under a river. How many people cross rivers frequently and decide to dig under them? Not many, I've found. Again, hidden entrance. Got to dig out some clay to see the entrance, like 3-4 blocks of it. I don't have any underground paths connecting either of these places. So if one is compromised, I can be sure the other isn't. Even in my dens, I dig out cubbies with chests, and hide them behind stone blocks, if there's something valuable I want to keep.   When I go to log off, I dump my inventory, climb to the surface with just a pine seed, and plant it on top of the entrance. How many people thing to look under a tree for a base? (I add 3 blocks of dirt down over the entrance in case people like to dig out trees instead of chopping them).   And aside from that, I put my base in a more secluded are. And because I know some servers have maps you can view, I explored a few biomes around my base in every direction too so cloud its location just a little.  Little paranoid, yes.

Let us set more than one waypoint and name them.  Let us share waypoints when near another player.  It would even be more realistic this way.  If I'm a survivor using a map to navigate around I'm definitely going to be marking important places on it, and I won't be erasing old ones every time I find something else I want to mark on the map.  And if I meet up with another survivor and we aren't trying to kill each other at the time, it's quite likely I'd use my map to show him how to find something which he would jot down on his own map."

The randomness needs to be truly random, not just a matter of player experience.

Considering every shotgun I have crafted in this game still looks like a cheapy $250 stevens I can tell you first hand it isn't nearly as accurate, or tight as a mossy or a fancy tactical shotty.  Have two shotguns one of which is a stevens the other Benelli M1  similar in length but worlds apart in performance.  I know it is like comparing apples to porches but you know what I mean.  I understand 7 days isn't a mil/sim survival game (DayZ) so either way doesn't matter but it is sure downer getting owned by a shotty on PvP server from an absurd distance away ."

All I'll say about the subject is that in video game shotguns are always the same, short - med. length smoothbore barrels and always loaded with buckshot.  Gamers expect a shotgun to function a certain way across all games and devs. need to manage those expectations."
7daystodie,3brawh,Bonkus72,4,Fri Jul 3 03:34:59 2015 UTC,"Sawed off shotgun is crap.  It should either be buffed or removed.  The regular shotgun is a great close-in weapon.    I would actually like to see the sawed off by replaced by a double-barreled shotgun.  Twice the damage,  50% more spread.  But you have to reload after every shot."
7daystodie,3brawh,Worstdriver,2,Wed Jul 1 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"Okay so RE: shotguns. I always hear people say they prefer the pump shotgun to the sawed off shotgun. Some say they prefer it for ""close-in"" combat. I guess it depends on what you want it for close-in. For me, when I am being overrun, I want the greatest chance to hit and hit quickly without aiming carefully. I want more spread. Far away, I want accuracy--I have time to aim more precisely when zeds are not on top of me.   So for me, the pump is my preferred weapon. But honestly? They are the SAME WEAPON in every other respect. Only the ""rays spread"" has a difference of .2  Range, reload time, entity damage, block damage are all the same. I would like to see them be a bit tweaked to differentiate, but anecdotally so far I have preferred the sawed off for close-in. Interested to hear other thoughts.  Edited to add: if I had my druthers (and I do, I could edit the XML, but...) I would have the sawed off have a shorter range, but higher damage. So keep the spread wider, but you need ot be closer to see results. This is how Hollywood always taught me sawed off shotguns worked, after all! You wanted to whip that bad boy out in close quarters and it would slam whoever was close by and shred them. But don't go and try sniping from a rooftop because it has no range.

The full version was released for the PC on May 31, 1997.  The game follows the story of Caleb, an early 20th century gunslinger seeking revenge against the dark god Tchernobog. It features a number of occult and horror themes. Blood includes an arsenal of weapons ranging from the standard to the bizarre, numerous enemies, and liberal amounts of graphic violence.  The Blood franchise was continued with two official expansion packs titled Plasma Pak (developed by Monolith)  and Cryptic Passage (developed by Sunstorm Interactive). Later, a sequel entitled Blood II: The Chosen was released on October 31, 1998. The game was released on Steam along with its two expansion packs on July 14, 2014, utilizing the DOSBox emulator to run on modern systems.

Most importantly, though, is to make sure the block that you're attaching the metal trussing to in the pillar is metal trussing, like this. That picture came from this post, so credit goes to /u/rezanow.  I'm nearly positive you don't need to add more pillars for an 8x8, however adding a pillar in the middle of each side (2 blocks wide for aesthetics if you don't want them off-center) might give you some peace of mind. If you want to be even safer you can make the metal trussing floor 2 blocks thick for added strength."
7daystodie,3bqtbj,OnceIthought,2,Wed Jul 1 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure the upper and lower layers of a 2 block thick wouldn't matter to each other, except to add weight to the layer below it, assuming it wasn't supported by it's own anchor.   Still, I'm super excited to see my stuff being shared! This community has been great - I am happy to give back!"
7daystodie,3bqtbj,rezanow,3,Wed Jul 1 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"Someone made a video from Alpha 10 that did a pretty extensive comparison and testing of structural integrity, with a very in-depth explanation. What I took away was that each surface of a block adds to the structural support. For example, if you were to add a parallel row of trussing to those pillars in the image starting from one of the sides of that same origin trussing you'd be working with double the original available structural support. While weight is added to each of the blocks the added support is greater, making for a net-gain in support.  The example was using both wood frames and metal trussing as the building material out from the column. I'm not sure the weight would of reinforced concrete would hold up the same in this equation.  *Edit: On second read this is more complicated than it was in my head, so I made this picture to quickly explain what I mean."

7daystodie,3bqtbj,rezanow,2,Wed Jul 1 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"I've never put anything under the soil. When you drop it, it kinda floats and you can plant right in it. You'd expect it to kinda pile onto the ground but it doesn't.  I've also only ever done it in rows with a walkway between... not all contiguous dirt. I could be wrong, but planting right next to each other seems to get a bit wonky.  How much your platform can support will depend on what you built it out of. You might need support pillars somewhere between that span of 8, that sounds a bit aggressive to me."
7daystodie,3bqtbj,ExplodingJesus,2,Wed Jul 1 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"it was a bit ambitious, I'll admit.  How big of a soil roof can you make?"

Normally concrete on the roof... seems fairly strong.   I'm trying to remember what I've really got up on some of them... I want to say maybe 30ish plantable slots total spread out across a few rows? I believe on one map I have 3 rows of 8 and then a couple smaller rows where I was filling in awkward spaces. That's on the flat roof of a 3 story brick building. I think I've done similar things on stop of some of the stores; also big and flat.  Again, I leave spaces between rows. That's for my sake more than the roof so I don't know if that contributes. More than anything I think setting up shop on top of a strong material is why I've never had it collapse."

It's important to consider what your building the platform out of. Trussing has by far the highest structural integrity, so it can support the most blocks horizontally if you want to preserve the ""corner only pillars"" aspect of your build.  If youre building out of wood or some other material, you can simply add more pillars for support. Try going from 4 pillars to 8 or possibly even 12."

7daystodie,3blt9i,NuttyIrishMan93,5,Tue Jun 30 09:42:37 2015 UTC,Hopefully there is way to prevent this mini bike from running if you do not want to. This to prevent other players from stealing it.

7daystodie,3blt9i,chrismilk,3,Wed Jul 1 01:04:44 2015 UTC,Under what rock have you been? They always release major updates in intervals of 2-4 months. It's soon been 3 months since alpha 11.
7daystodie,3bmm55,Nunsofjamaica,2,Tue Jun 30 13:11:01 2015 UTC,Update fellow redditers-  Well.. Alpha 12 has rolled out. I had to do a complete wipe of the server. (That part was to be expected with a new release)   Currently waiting on the prefab mod that I installed previously to be updated for the new version that came out. Until then the server is up and running after a bit of tweaking. I did a few modifications to the zombie spawn rate and day/night length cycles as I noticed the game was progressing much faster than before the update.  The server name and IP address are the same. I would love to play with those of you I saw previously before the update came out as we had a killer base!  Based on feedback I put a password on the server. The password is redditrules  I don't think we should have any issues with a hacker from the post here vs someone just randomly joining servers from the game list. If we do I'll change it and you can add me on steam for the new password. My steam name is the same as my name on here :) hope to see you guys soon!

7daystodie,3blagy,zdss,2,Tue Jun 30 09:19:43 2015 UTC,I gotta try that center block thing tonight. A loudly buzzing sign in front of the bookstore is stopping me from moving into the building next door. And I don't have any oil barrels yet.

7daystodie,3bo9xf,moremysterious,2,Tue Jun 30 20:30:10 2015 UTC,I think you should test some admin software first.  Otherwise you'll have hackers on the server with no way to know for sure what they're doing.  Too many A-holes out there to open it up with awesome admin tools.
7daystodie,3bo9xf,ravenze,2,Tue Jun 30 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"it only takes a few a$$holes to mess up a server, I went to a white list, I was not happy about it but they Asians kept coming on and destroying everyone's bases.  They had some kind of hack that let them script and find claim block or so it seemed to us.  If LCBs could be set to indestructibly on a select few  I might open the server back up but I didn't read anything about that coming in the next release"
7daystodie,3bo9xf,snowdogJJJ,2,Tue Jun 30 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"If you got the resources to spin up a decent firewall and get it setup you will eliminate most of the asshats that come from overseas while allowing your server to be open to the ""public"" so to speak.  Add in some good administration and backups and you will be able to withstand the random rage idiot who goes on a bender then restore the damage. :-)"
7daystodie,3bo9xf,jellocf,2,Tue Jun 30 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"Unless you want asshole griefers, no. If you do, make it a very select few that you personally screen before giving them the password (do not leave it without password protection)."
7daystodie,3bo9xf,Arik_De_Frasia,2,Wed Jul 1 02:51:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty much easier to just play private with a bunch of friends you trust on private as a team of suvivors and then maybe once you all get bored in the end, you can start trying it then. I don't know but I think there is a way to easily save your world so once you think you've progressed enough, you could save the world and then open it to the public for PvP. If you ask me just keep it PvE and keep on playing till they come out with some neat system for stopping hackers from attacking you in what way possible."
7daystodie,3bo9xf,RichieEB,2,Wed Jul 1 03:49:48 2015 UTC,If you're looking to get more people its not bad if you can keep hackers out somehow.  BTW isnt destroying someones base part of pvp? or do you just mean the hackers are the jackasses.  Another thing you could try is asking on here and selectively picking people from this sub so you dont get random hackers.

7daystodie,3bncvi,hunkxdeath,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:01:12 2015 UTC,One thing I noticed is that if your backpack disappears trying checking a higher area. So for you it would be at top of tunnel at ground floor directly above where you died. For some reason it does that. It happens a lot at doorways. The backpack will be at the roof or something.

7daystodie,3bnowb,Taikatohtori,5,Tue Jun 30 18:02:28 2015 UTC,That's normal behavior for an attacked door. Doors unlock before they are destroyed completely. You cannot re-lock them. You have to replace the doors that were broken through.
7daystodie,3bnowb,superkuh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, I wonder why they destroyed some doors completely.. Oh well good to hear it was a legit raid."

7daystodie,3bnowb,Fastidious_,3,Tue Jun 30 19:09:59 2015 UTC,Unfortunately servers are rife with hackers.  My base was once deleted completely and there was bed rock all over the place (WTF?).  Luckily a backup restored it.
7daystodie,3bnowb,WaterWaterH2O,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:14:11 2015 UTC,The land claim block doesnt make your stuff invincible it just strengthens it.  Basically someone could have just bashed the hell out of your door with a fireaxe until the lock broke.
7daystodie,3bnl08,ravenze,5,Tue Jun 30 17:34:45 2015 UTC,Generally in games you can one of two things. You can have a weight limit or you can have a volume limit. TFP chose one and I doubt they are going to change it.
7daystodie,3bnl08,Blaktoe,6,Tue Jun 30 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"Floors will break if you put too much weight in containers.   Go into someone else's base, put a bunch of cheap heavy crap in their unlocked containers/campfire/forge. Watch weeks of effort  collapse in an instant. Problem?"
7daystodie,3bnl08,gl1tch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:27:48 2015 UTC,Or bring your own chests and plop those down on top of their existing locked chests.

7daystodie,3bnl08,BlaineTog,2,Tue Jun 30 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't know.  Thanks for the clarification!"
7daystodie,3bnl08,ExplodingJesus,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting point about the forge, but that would be a good reason to put forges on the ground level anyway.    Containers should be locked anyway, and I believe the campfire only allows food in it...   This entire game is about the first several weeks anyway.  End-game is no fun, until that is resolved, I see no problem introducing reality in ways that make getting to the end-game more satisfying.  The WHOLE floor doesn't need to fall, have the varying containers spread the weight out to adjacent blocks for more stability."
7daystodie,3bnl08,TheZombieFish,3,Tue Jun 30 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"I get why this would be cool... but ok: now you can carry 4 logs OR 3 pieces of iron OR a couple buckets of concrete mix...  I don't know. Going full realism would certainly add some difficulty as it would take weeks to build something. But it wouldn't be fun.  And if you don't go realistic, you still have to arbitrarily draw lines about ""what's too heavy"", etc. I'm not really sure how to balance that.  That said, I'd love to have more slots in my anti-gravity backpack just to further flaunt the laws of physics with how many logs I can carry :P"

We don't even have electricity yet, and you're talking about anti-grav backpacks??!!!  ;)  You're right, but my assumption(hope?) would be a balance such that those spec'd to carry (STR, or whatever), can carry more than what we currently can, but those spec'd for other things would be forced to make-do with less."
7daystodie,3bnl08,TheZombieFish,2,Tue Jun 30 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah but his point is if it were ""realistic"" weight you would carry like 4 buckets of concrete and you would be full. Even if you reduced the weight to 1/16th the actual value you would still be struggling to have rebar and cement to build anything."
7daystodie,3bnl08,BlaineTog,4,Wed Jul 1 09:02:14 2015 UTC,its an interesting idea and not without it's value.   but i think when your this far along in development and the game hasn't been designed around the mechanic you have to look at it like this:  What problem does it solve?
7daystodie,3bnl08,BlaineTog,2,Tue Jun 30 18:33:19 2015 UTC,"uhhh... future disparity in the classes?  Yeah, that's it..."
7daystodie,3bnl08,sec_goat,2,Tue Jun 30 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"Well, really it's only adding problems."
7daystodie,3bnl08,BlaineTog,3,Wed Jul 1 08:59:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, but one block of concrete weights about 5000 lbs so now we need serious construction equipment to do any building.  That doesn't sound all that fun."
7daystodie,3bnl08,DireBeats,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:06:16 2015 UTC,"Actual weight in pounds is up to the developer.  I'm not sure how you're making concrete but with the molds and buckets I'm using, this seems rather reasonable."
7daystodie,3bnl08,vegeta897,6,Tue Jun 30 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"Actual weight in pounds is up to the developer.   It most certainly is not, not if you want to make things somewhat realistic.  A block in this game is about half as tall as a person, so let's say it's a cubic meter.  A cubic meter weighs about 2,300 kg, or about 5,070 lbs.  Since you only need one of the ""buckets of concrete"" that we can craft to make a block of concrete, that bucket probably weighs significantly more than 5000 lbs since it has water in it as well as cement and gravel.  Unless you're the Hulk, you're gonna need construction equipment to work with concrete.  Adding weight to items kiiiiiiinda works in games like Skyrim where you're only really worried about loot, but for voxel construction games, it'll slow things down too much.  EDIT: Also, I was originally talking about Concrete blocks, which can be crafted in the inventory screen.  They stack to 64, which means you can currently carry up to 10 million lbs of concrete in your backpack and another 2.6 million lbs on your belt."

7daystodie,3bl88b,cellfoneguy,5,Tue Jun 30 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for ~100 hours now.  I watched a lot of youtube videos before I committed to purchase.  I've got to say, I really enjoy this game a lot.  It's precisely what Minecraft should've been, with legitimate danger from your enemies.  All it needs at this point is electricity, in my eyes.  I'm loathe to turn up the spawn rate higher without something more than spikes to protect my compound.    As for pre-A12 plans, this is my first patch experience.  My group has made significant progress in the last two weeks, and I'm hoping I can preserve that progress by backing up files from the server."
7daystodie,3bl88b,SpotOnTheRug,3,Tue Jun 30 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"You won't really be able to carry over your Alpha 11 server to Alpha 12, the two versions will simply not be compatible with each other. What you can do is enable administrator/creative mode in your server settings that let you access infinite materials and can then just rebuild what buildings you had. You would even have the ability to place blocks that normally could not exist in your inventory, such as dried reinforced concrete blocks. Just be sure to turn that option off once the build is done.  Personally, I like starting over from scratch with each major patch, the early game where you're struggling to even make it past day 7 is fun too. :)"
7daystodie,3bl88b,Deathmckilly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:49:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with the legitimate danger part. Personally a bit apprehensive about electricity, but I guess all those lights and fridges are running somehow."
7daystodie,3bl88b,SpotOnTheRug,2,Tue Jun 30 03:36:52 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way.  Short of building an uber base (which I've done, hence the desire for backups) what are you supposed to do with all the iron and whatnot you mine?  I think it'd be really cool to have super rare schematics for things like solar panels and coal/gas powered generators, which can power flood lights and working refrigerators.  Couple that with a food spoiling mechanic, and you've just made the game much more difficult (which isn't a bad thing in my eyes).  I also feel like you shouldn't be able to run/wield a weapon while crafting, but that may be going too far.  I dunno, I really think this game has a ton of potential.  It's a shame it's kind of slipped under the radar."
7daystodie,3bl88b,rezanow,2,Tue Jun 30 03:42:30 2015 UTC,"Spoiled foods? I'd be ok with a generator to power a fridge, assuming said generator was fuel based and noisy. As an alternative, we should be able to can our own foods (using the jars, just like grandma used to do!)."
7daystodie,3bl88b,ExplodingJesus,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:55 2015 UTC,A smokehouse or salt curing (add as mineral in ground?) would work and fit well with the game.
7daystodie,3bl88b,TribalDancer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"That's true. The endgame is a bit lacking, especially in the high-tech end. The food spoiling mechanic may also benefit people living in or near POIs, where they can store their food in the working fridges before they build their own.   As for crafting, I agree partly. I think it's weird that you can do it, and doesn't make sense, but forcing you to stay still would require some significant balance tweaks.  Popularity of this game seems hard to judge.

7daystodie,3bl88b,trisity,3,Wed Jul 1 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"Airdrops should not be allowed to land in the radiation zone. I ran halfway across navezgane for one.     Random Gen.     Breaking a forge/campfire doesn't drop the mold/beaker/whatever, nor does it drop any of the finished output, or materials. That one hurt. I really, really needed those antibiotics.     Ah, but now you know. It's all part of the risk factor.     Mining in Navezgane is basically, scrounge along for scraps until you mine, but as soon as you start mining you have way too many minerals.     Random Gen.     On that note, what can I even do with 10+ stacks of lead/iron ingots?     That much lead is almost useless, but the iron is really nice to have. Especially if you're building out of reinforced concrete. You also need it to make weapon repair kits, or metal strips to repair tools.     Is there any use for the hunting rifle after you get a sniper?     None whatsoever. The sniper is 10x better. Honestly, you knew the answer to that one.     Is there anywhere I can get a steady supply of oil?     It would be nice if we could make it, but right now your best chance is to get it from Zs you kill and trash along roads. That's where I've found oil most. Also, always loot cars."
7daystodie,3bl88b,ConfessionsAway,3,Tue Jun 30 15:58:51 2015 UTC,Oil can be found in garages/random in general. Best bet is to look in the hardware stores

7daystodie,3bl88b,dointhestankyleg,3,Tue Jun 30 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"A12 is going to have a new menu system which looks really nice. Check out this video around 2:05 to get a look at how they're going to change it up. If you're worried about zombie speeds you can set them to always run. Makes it really interesting and forces you to play a lot more cautiously. Lead ingots are great for buckshot and iron ingots are great for making pretty much everything for example, short iron pipes, scrap iron, rebar frames(for reinforced concrete), hard metal doors, crossbows(from forged iron), etc. If you're nomadic then ingots aren't really for you once you've got yourself a crossbow it shouldn't matter after that. The hunting rifle is useless(to me) after you get a sniper. Oil is easily obtained by killing zombies and looting trash piles. As far as cities go, I try to stealth mode as much as I can and kill off zombies with a crossbow before they notice me and bring the hordes running in. I try to only loot the important buildings(shotgun messiah, born and noble, working stiff, apartments maybe) and get out as quickly as possible. Also, the cities are a great place to level up, just grab a couple stacks of shotgun shells and go wreck as many zombies as you can, guaranteed to get at least a few levels."
7daystodie,3bl88b,rezanow,2,Tue Jun 30 05:10:45 2015 UTC,"At work rn, so I'll check that link when i get home.   I tried always run, but got wrecked so hard...kinda wish there was an in-between. Like faster than player walk but a good deal slower than sprint.   I've got a lot of lead ingots. Like, 8 stacks. Is buckshot all it's used for?  As for iron, I don't really need to make all that stuff, lol. A few for pipes/strips for repairs, and some for rebar but not anywhere near enough to use 10 stacks of ingots.  That's pretty much how the city went for me. There were a lot of cops.  I think I'll try grinding levels a bit. I can never seem to get enough zombies though, I've heard it's instant respawn but none ever appear after i finish off the initial wave (usually 70ish zeds)"
7daystodie,3bl88b,Deathmckilly,3,Tue Jun 30 05:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the difficulty settings and zombie respawn settings really change how difficult the big cities in the wasteland biome are. I started out similar to you, would go in and wreck the 50-60 zombies and be good to loot everything and walk out without seeing another zombie. Now that I turned those up I can't clear the city at all. I've filled my inventory with sniper rounds and shotgun shells and came back nearly empty(of ammo anyway). 10-15 dogs every couple minutes and cops constantly spewing their acid vomit at me. It's pretty intense once you step away from those easy settings."
7daystodie,3bl88b,ConfessionsAway,2,Tue Jun 30 05:45:35 2015 UTC,"Day 1 on Medium spawn rate right now is rather hard actually in any biome. It's doable and after a few days you want that many zombies, but at first it's the hardest part of the game."

In the earlier alpha stages (Alpha 6 I think) I made my walls entirely out of trussing since they were the strongest blocks at the time, along with having a structural integrity of 15, though that has since been cut down severely as now there are much more expensive blocks that are rightfully stronger."

7daystodie,3bl63j,TheFatCupcakes,2,Tue Jun 30 02:56:34 2015 UTC,They removed it when they added the blunderbuss. I believe that was in early April.
7daystodie,3bl63j,BradburyMan,2,Tue Jun 30 05:54:56 2015 UTC,They removed it because it was worthless and it was so rare that nobody really noticed. You couldn't manufacture replacement ammo either. If you go into the items.xml and the loot.xml you'll see the references to it that you can uncomment to get it back into the game.
7daystodie,3bl63j,WeezulDK,2,Tue Jun 30 13:40:43 2015 UTC,I remember finding and firing one for the first time and being utterly disappointed at the damage it did.

See, wood is given a damage multiplier from zombies (AKA, zombies hit wood harder than non-wood equivalent; much like the fire axe). Make this by mixing your bricks with your local dirt, and watch the zombies struggle. Add a layer of reinforced metal siding, and you can snipe from the roof through metal trussing all day.  Plus, you can make bricks from clay. Perfect new-spawn material."

7daystodie,3bk2xe,Ratsmon,3,Mon Jun 29 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"I recommend building your base within a day's journey of the central city, if you can help it. Wood log spikes are better than regular spikes, in that they cannot be destroyed unless zombies attack them directly (doesn't happen often), but they do a fraction of the damage however.  Make your walls so that they are easily defensible, as even the strongest materials can be breached by even one zombie if they're left alone long enough. I've always built in spaces about 6 blocks above the ground so that I could fire outward from the safety of the walls. Put a ring of blocks around your wall about 2 blocks above the ground to keep spiders from giving you a nasty surprise.  A good supplement to a base would be to build a water elevator for it. Zombies cannot swim, and water that's 3 blocks or more deep will not generate gore blocks when zombies die in it.   Build a + shaped tower of wood or concrete with a reinforced and spiked base, and have an opening 2 blocks high at the bottom and another at where you want it to exit into. Make sure to dig at least 3 blocks deep around the base of the elevator and set wood log spikes around it. Upgrade everything once you're happy with the design (I strongly recommend testing it first).   To test and activate, take a bucket and fill it at any water source. Go to the intended exit into your base and empty the bucket onto the block level that's 1 lower than the floor or walkway you're on (inside the elevator). The water should fall down the tower and spread out from the lower entrance.   To take away the water for any reason, use the bucket at the same spot you used it on to activate. This will remove the source of the water.  tl;dr - Build base near city biome. Use wood log spikes. Build defensible walls. Try building a water elevator for your entrance."
7daystodie,3bk2xe,MethosTR,2,Tue Jun 30 07:10:18 2015 UTC,"Log spikes, upgrade them at least once. I like to build at least 2 rows of them, preferably the first row touching the bottom level of your base and the second row one block lower (and so on if you build more.) When you do that, if they die while attacking your base the other zombies will have to go through the gore blocks, so they (gore blocks) are almost an advantage."
7daystodie,3bk2xe,moremysterious,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"I built 3 rows of max upgrade log spikes, all 3 blocks below surface.  I lined the inner wall of the spike moat with 2 rows of reinforced concrete, and put a lip of wooden ramps to keep the spider zombies down.  The only things I can think of that's more secure is a fatal drop moat, where you have a hugely deep moat that kills zombies due to fall damage."
7daystodie,3bk2xe,SpotOnTheRug,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"Fully upgraded wood log spikes is the best way to go. Build your primary wall out of the most durable material you have available.  Build a lip to stop spider zombies from climbing your walls. Build this lip 1 block above where they can reach. So  if the zeds are standing at ground level build it 3 blocks up. If you have a row of spikes against your wall the zeds can stand on top of the spikes, so build the lip 4 blocks up and so on.  Don't use a door. Use a ramp with a drawbridge and a hatch. Zeds attack doors if they are available, so best to deprive them of that weakness.  Where is really up to the kind of server you play on. PvP? Best to just go underground and be invisible. PvE? I like to build out of site of other buildings. I also like the plains biomes for the great visibility."

The hardest thing to come by for bullets is brass. Because of this you want the most bang for your brass, which would be 762mm in a  Sniper Rifle or Hunting Rifle. A body shot will kill a normal zombie or dog, 2 body shorts or a single headshot will kill a police or fatty. Excellent for close quarters since you don't need need to aim for the head on regular zombies.  Pistols have a large magazine and rapid rate of fire. They are great for headshotting a lot of zombies very quickly, and you can fire off a few extra rounds quickly if you miss the head on a quickly approaching dog. Ammo and parts are very common and easy to find on Police. I usually loot so much 9mm that I never need to make any.  I deconstruct 10mm and 44 magnum bullets for the casings, and use that to create 762mm."
7daystodie,3bl57x,scorcher24,0,Wed Jul 1 01:43:44 2015 UTC,Obviously the Sniper Rifle. But I myself really like the Hunting Rifle. Would be awesome if we could use cats as silencers though.

7daystodie,3bhug6,Dardoleon,3,Mon Jun 29 10:13:18 2015 UTC,"Regarding projectile speed and range, it seems like it depends on where you read and what approach they had when they wrote it :P In the end I guess it comes down to game balance and not realism. I don't mind having them reversed if that's for the best.  The bow and arrow are governed by the archer's strength. So if the game has a strength attribute, that could be made to work together with that weapon. The crossbow is a bulkier and slower weapon to use, but its advantages is that everyone can operate them and you can load a bolt before you are actually going to use it.   Clearing gore blocks seems like a feature that should probably be removed... :)"
7daystodie,3bhug6,Dardoleon,3,Mon Jun 29 10:40:36 2015 UTC,could be fun to tie bow dmg to strength.  not being able to clear gore blocks would make everthing a whole lot harder.
7daystodie,3bhug6,DD2146,2,Mon Jun 29 11:25:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I hate clearing gore blocks. I'm pretty new to this game though so I had no idea a bow was useful for that.  I like your ideas on updating the mechanics of the bow and xbow.
7daystodie,3bhug6,PhD_in_internet,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:59:06 2015 UTC,"Realistically, crossbows fire projectiles at a greater velocity. to put it into perspective, in the early life of the crossbow they had to make the bolts out of harder and heavier wood so that the crossbow wouldn't just shatter the bolt upon firing. As such, the crossbow also has greater range than a bow of similar technological advancement.  Currently, the bow does still have some very good uses in later game. It shoots much quicker than the crossbow, so it's great to take to a heavy zombie spawning location to farm exp without wasting a bunch of ammo. Also, iirc, the bow is much quieter than the crossbow.  I currently love the differences between crossbow/bow. But I would like to be able to improve them as my character improves."
7daystodie,3bhug6,DJMu3L,2,Tue Jun 30 01:44:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely makes sense imo. This is how things are IRL and it's all about dat immersion
7daystodie,3bhug6,SirNanigans,2,Mon Jun 29 12:15:59 2015 UTC,"The differences between a bow and crossbow are actually pretty straight forward and they fit into their own roles quite easily in real life. For this reason, balance tweaks should be second to just adding more realism.   If the crossbow took 5 seconds to load, using both hands and sounding a few clicks and clacks in the process, then it would be obvious when it's not ideal.  A crossbow can be ready-loaded and left loaded without effort, which is its primary advantage. It can also have accurate sights and scopes attached. These things make it obvious when it is ideal.   As for ammunition, a crossbow bolt has enough force and mass behind it to be effective against light armor. However, additional force isn't going to do more damage when armor isn't involved, assuming that the ordinary bow is strong enough to also pierce the target. Against fleshy, rotted zombies an arrow should do just as much harm as a bolt.  If you need to fire repeatedly in a skirmish or stay absolutely silent, then the bow is the obvious choice. If you want to have a quick take-down shot ready when the time comes, then the crossbow is a better option. The only thing needed to make this true in game is more realism, not variable adjustments."
7daystodie,3bhug6,ChrisWorstMedicEver,2,Mon Jun 29 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about the crossbow and bow for awhile now. They happen to be my favorite weapons because they're silent. I wouldn't mind seeing bows and crossbows which you can find and assemble like the guns. It'd be cool having a silent weapon which has 5 shots or something for a crossbow as well as a bow with incredible aim. Scopes could even be added to the crossbow and a cool sight to the bow.   But with what you said, yeah, I'd have to agree that the bows in this game could use some change. It'd be neat if the current bow is the cheapest bow and then we can craft an even better bow which increases the range or damage. I like silent weapons, they're more fun and definitely a feature which would add to the games stealth system."
7daystodie,3bjolu,MeyerSeed,8,Mon Jun 29 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"I always have played this alone, well like 95% of the time i have. Its fun just trying to survive. I set my world settings realistically, slow time, always slow zombies and stuff. Its just fun living in the world."
7daystodie,3bjolu,Cragvis,4,Mon Jun 29 22:31:13 2015 UTC,It takes a little bit of time to get in but it's worth it. Minecraft gets blown away by this game because there is a constant pressure from zombies attacking you--which is very fun. It's still very early in the game as Alpha 12 is to be released soon but it's actually coming out to be my favorite survivor based game.
7daystodie,3bjolu,ChrisWorstMedicEver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"This game is Minecraft on steroids with physics enabled. I love the simplistic building-block atmosphere of Minecraft and it will always hold a special place in my gaming heart, but 7DTD is the answer to the sandbox-survival-gorefest that I (and many others) have been craving. I cannot wait to see what the future holds with better random gen."

When I saw this game I was like ""wtf is this?"" but it was like 5 bucks or something so I bought it and immediately realized its potential."
7daystodie,3bjolu,ChrisWorstMedicEver,3,Wed Jul 1 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"i have played the game 2 weeks now, but most of the time with a friend.  first i didnt liked it. its just another zombie survival with not so impressive graphics and a not so intuitive ui and of course i had no idea what i was doing except running around and looting stuff.  but once i took a good look in to the 7dtd wiki, got used to the ui and the graphics i was very impressed of how well balanced those more or less basic game mechanics work together.  i ended up a few times playing the game for an hour or two befor going to bed around midnight and the next thing i realized was the sun shining through my window.  the mix of exploration, crafting, killing zombies, minecraft like world/base building, challenging base defenses every now and then works very well.  also first i was like ""what instant respawn after a death? ist that a children game?""  but right now i think that it is so easy to die, a harder death penalty would reduce the fun.  a bit more focus on character development and the bad ui are the only things that could use some more love in my opinion."

7daystodie,3bjolu,UserPick94,3,Mon Jun 29 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"Like most of the comments have been saying, yes you can absolutely still have fun in single player.   But as far as your hardware goes, how old are we talking? What are your specs?  Because my old laptop with an i5 and GeForce 360m was barely able to play it on low. It runs, just not well. So you'll be able to play it fine, but you might not see the true beauty of the world without better hardware."

7daystodie,3bjolu,curciel,2,Mon Jun 29 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"The game is a lot of fun, but having played since A7 my friends and I have come back to the game after every patch, only to drop it hard a day or so later until the next one."
7daystodie,3bjolu,Solaratov,2,Tue Jun 30 00:25:09 2015 UTC,"I just got the game and have put in about 50 hours already. I don't know if you've played any other survivor games, but I've played The Forest and The Long Dark if you want a comparison. I love this game a lot so far because it allows me or rather forces me to be creative under pressure.   Once the day turns to night my FPS skill can only help so much which forces me to get crafty with building traps, choke points and the construction of my base.  It really does everything well fom the zombie killing FPS aspect, the Minecraft-like construction and gathering resources.  Let me know if you get the game and want to play with another while you learn."
7daystodie,3bjolu,Stargos,2,Tue Jun 30 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"First off, you're asking in the most biased possible location on the internet.  Every person in this sub is here because they want to be here because they like the game.  With that said, I love it. My girlfriend and I play tons. I have only one complaint about it and that is floating bases in multiplayer. I have heard rumor that they've changed the physics to disallow floating bases, though.  I would say that it is definitely more fun playing with somebody, or at least playing online with others. Building a base with two people is much easier than with one person though.  Also a new massive update (moving from alpha 11 to alpha 12) is supposed to come (I've heard by the end of this week). So now would be a very good time to join the fun. But if you do, I recommend waiting until alpha 12 update has popped otherwise everything you do will likely be wiped and some things that you learn may no longer be applicable.  TL;DR: Yes, I recommend it heavily, but wait a little bit until Alpha 12 update drops before you start learning the ropes."
7daystodie,3bjolu,PhD_in_internet,2,Tue Jun 30 01:36:40 2015 UTC,Definitely worth it and yes you can play it alone for a while. You can also find a server and try and meet some people on there if you dont know anyone else that plays it.  Or look for someone on here.
7daystodie,3bjolu,WaterWaterH2O,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:15:31 2015 UTC,"I've played this game for over a year now, 606 hours in, of which 95% is SP. I'd say it's great fun alone and better with friends. The game has quite a steep learning curve so I'd suggest getting familiar with it first with a couple of friends."
7daystodie,3bjolu,cnokha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:15:54 2015 UTC,"After reading through most of the other replies all of which are fairly spot on, I'll give my two cents and then some.  I have played the game for about 490 according to my Steam stats, and I am sure there are a lot of others with way more game time, but with this many hours I think I can give you a fair assessment of it from both a single player and multiplayer perspective. A lot of this time has been dedicated to multiplayer as this game with the possibility of co-op just seems natural.  7 Days overall is just like any survival game you have to struggle to survive early on and once you get yourself fairly well established with a base and some weapons the game then turns into what you make it.  By what you make it, I mean you have to be creative in the things you do and goals you make. I tend to gravitate to building cool bases...making forward bases...getting lots of kills etc.    Solo, I will say the game isn't nearly as fun, but it is still fun to play.  I set some goals I want, explore, kill, loot, mine and build things you would normally do in these type of games. I think of ways I can kill zombies with out shooting them, test theories of bases and set limits on things that I consider ""cheaty"" such as trenches and underground bases that I think take away from the game due to the AI limits.  Multiplayer/co-op is where the game shines to me. I have been on voice chat with 12 people on my server and must say it is great when you first start a new map on a Random Gen world with the spawn rate turned up and try and hook up with your friends. The talk of lots of zombies everywhere and the rush to build a temporary safehouse before nightfall is great.  Not to mention co-op building, raiding of towns/cities and various other multiplayer activity you can do.    I would highly suggest the game, I installed it once, tried it for about an hour and hated it. I then played it with some friends after giving it a second try I can say I thoroughly enjoy it.   I think others have posted on the PC specs required to play the game, but it does use the Unity 5 engine which can be quite taxing, but you may just have tone some of the video settings down. With A12 these settings are better and allow you to adjust even more to get more FPS.  Hope this help and hope to hear you enjoy the game soon."

7daystodie,3bj6iu,Quigleyer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"I receive the same error on my GTX 660 ti when playing this game, or a select few other games.  Actually my error states ""The display driver has stopped working but has recovered"", there is no specific driver name.  Thank you for the fix suggestions in the link, I'm going to try that.  As a side note, I get this crash mostly when I forget to close Photoshop down before I start the game.  If I get this issue it happens a lot of times in a row, UNLESS I restart my computer- in which case I have a long time before I start seeing crashes.  From the suggested fixes you posted just there #1 looks like a good option for me, and when I opened it I realized my settings were not optimal at all (had never seen that screen before).  EDIT:  Also note that I have had the game actually recover a few times by waiting ~30 seconds from the freeze-up.  If I click the game crashes, if I alt+tab the game crashes.  But if I just sit there and wait, it will occasionally just continue on at the point it originally froze.  EDIT AGAIN:  I started monitoring my GPU temperatures and started seeing some really weird stuff with higher temperatures (85+ C).  I was able to reduce it significantly (60-70 C) with Vsync and extra fan love- do you play with vsync on or off?"
7daystodie,3bj6iu,jellocf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for me, I tried all the steps, up the the hardware changes, and none of them worked.  I started monitoring my temps and it seems that the game crashes at around the same temperature every time, which leads me to believe that the GPU is overheating.  Something interesting also, my fan on the GPU doesn't really seem to kick into max at the temperature where it crashes so I'm hoping that adjusting the fan profile fixes this issue for me.  I'll have more about this later tonight after work."
7daystodie,3bj6iu,jellocf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"Let us know what happens.  Before I even played with the fan I had good luck with turning Vsync ON.  But now that my fans are going at a more reasonable rate I find I don't hit above 70 C (when I was hitting 80 C...) with Vsync OFF.   By default my 660 ti was set at a really weird fan power/heat correlation (like you, I was overheating before hitting 100% fan power).  It was set to kick in at 100% at 90 C (isn't that high?), and was set to like 30% at 50 C.  I turned it back so it kicks into 100% at 70 C, 50% at 50 C and it did wonders.  The default settings on my fan apparently weren't doing jack shit.  Since I spent a lot of free time figuring out this probably elementary stuff I didn't play as much yesterday- but I did get a solid 1.5 hours of crash-free gaming last night (my heat at 65-70 C).  That's not saying anything though, it does need more extensive testing.  I'm not sure how experienced with Afterburner you are, but that's what I used (for the first time, took me a while to figure out where to find stuff). If it's your first time using it too here's what I did:  On the bottom of the panel that opens when you run the program is a ""settings"" text to click.  Under that you'll find a tab labeled ""fan"" and in that tab you have a curve you can adjust.  After you set it as you'd like you go back to the main panel (the main program, the thing that opens when you run the .exe) and go down to the ""Fan Speed %"" bar and click the little gear-icon button on the right that says ""User define"" when you hover over it to start up your changes.  For me the change was immediate and did not require any kind of restart or additional hardware messing about.  Hope it sticks, and I hope your fix is as simple."
7daystodie,3bj6iu,jellocf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"I managed to get some time on lunch to play around with the fan profile.  Just like yours, the default seems terrible, it barely kicks in until the fan is passed 70C, so I changed the profile based on your suggestion of getting it to run faster at lower temps, then ran the game.    No. Friggin. Luck.   I'm still getting the same crashing scenario.  It doesn't even seem like the fan cools it that much when it's on full blast.  After work today I think I'm going to take the card out and clean it to see if that helps.  Maybe just taking it out and resetting it in the mobo might help.  I'm going to try DayZ as well to see if it's just 7DTD giving me this issue.  I'm also going to try to completely remove my current driver (up to date version at 353.30) and install an older version (347.52 as suggested by @jellocf).  I'll let you know!  I'm doing a LAN party tonight here at the office so I hope I can get this working.  I brought my laptop as a backup though, just in case."

7daystodie,3bj6iu,Gamorc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:22:32 2015 UTC,"None of these steps worked (up to the hardware changes) so that's unfortunate.  However, I think this may have something to do with my GPU overheating and crashing.  Is this even possible at ~75C?  I didn't think so, but maybe..."
7daystodie,3bj6iu,snowdogJJJ,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:50:31 2015 UTC,75c should be fine however as it is older perhaps the hardware is just to a point were it is failing?  But before you toss it out couple things to try 1) I have a hella bad time with the latest driver on my 970 playing ARK and BF4.  I have found version 347.52 to Be the most reliable at this point.  Try using DDU to remove everything and then install that version you will have to find it on the archives  2) If you are still having issues after the above then you can try a software GPU fan speed controller.  Preferrebly one that allows you to make custom profiles such as @ X temp crank up fans to 50% and so on.  MSI Afterburner was one that I used in the past and it didn't matter if you had a MSI card or not at least not when I used it.  If neither of those work and you are still getting that issue if possible swap video cards with another one.  Maybe borrow a friends or something before running out and buying one.

7daystodie,3bhluq,Arik_De_Frasia,2,Mon Jun 29 14:21:08 2015 UTC,You could build them PCs much better than laptops for around that price. The magic number for a decent starter PC is $350. Otherwise you are looking at a build with an APU or integrated. If you dont want to do this you should try to find something with an A8 or A10 but like the other guy said $300 is not really gonna get much.

It wasn't until a few years later I realized how much I was still missing (built in 1366x768 limit blows).   Whatever he does, he shouldn't go with the Intel HD laptops. Ugh. My, and my wife's, laptops have built-in Intel graphics, but thankfully are switchable to higher powered and high battery draining GPUs. I goofed a setting and it wasn't switching. It was devastating thinking that I spent $1300 on a laptop that couldn't even play Terraria. lolz  I am thankful that it runs on the Intel HD while not gaming though. Uses so much less battery."

Also keep in mind that the game is still under development and that performance optimization is generally done in the later parts of the development life cycle; the game is not expected to run well in its current state. Heck, I can't even run it at stable 60 FPS on the highest settings with my GTX 980 Ti in 1920x1080."

I spent $1300 on mine with the intent on getting a gaming laptop without spending more than $1500. It has an Intel Core i7 4720HQ, NVidia GTX 960M 4GB, 16GB Dual Channel RAM, and a 1920x1080 FHD IPS LED screen. I can play it, with middle to high settings at decent framerates (30-60 depending).

My oldest son built a system with the Radeon HD 7770 on it, and it runs 7Days about as well as my laptop. I think he spent around $600.

Locations: There's already a farm and military base location generated or you can find it in naz world.  Creatures: Pigs are already in the game and I reckon that's abit overdemanding of what animals to be in there, keep in mind zombies are infecting/eating them. Sheep would be nice though  ;) but I highly doubt the developers would add in NPCs of humans.  Weapons: There was a rocket launcher but I think it was removed, there are mines you can place, pipebombs and TNT.  Classes & Technology : I don't think people will agree on classes, it's what ruins the uniqueness in games and this genre. I agree with you entirely about adding more obsessive amount of content to create for end game such as the solar energy to create a very costly thing to generate electricity to give power to have lights powered on etc those stuff considered as high technology that takes so much to achieve to get to that area of crafting to add more fun in building bases and having technology with electric gates etc."

A nice balance between building and survival. You could certainly give it a try, or just look here and find a PVE server in the US/Canada perhaps. Some PVE servers are oriented towards building, with default, or slightly lowered, difficulty settings and more custom recipes for blocks, so you should also consider whether you want more of a challenge or not."
7daystodie,3bf85o,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:18:48 2015 UTC,"I have one if you want to play there.   It's harder but the handful of people who play there are friendly, and it has custom prefabs and a rare loot mod."
7daystodie,3bfx1n,annihilation2,5,Sun Jun 28 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"Cities in the wasteland biome with cops and dogs seem to have infinite spawning zombies, but if you're in a small city/town and they just keep spawning there might be spider zombies or 7 day horde. Sometimes with the respawn count higher it can take a lot longer to clear out even the small cities, but I could eventually clear it out."
7daystodie,3bfx1n,ConfessionsAway,2,Sun Jun 28 22:45:15 2015 UTC,Okay thank you. I was just thoroughly confused and definitely not prepared for it. I'll just make 500+ bolts and go to town (pun intended) on them
7daystodie,3bfx1n,Dardoleon,2,Mon Jun 29 00:57:04 2015 UTC,make more. especially if you're going alone. My current record is about 1000 hunting rifle shots in a day (had to retreat because I had no more ammo). Good exp that way.
7daystodie,3bfx1n,gl1tch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:17:06 2015 UTC,Holy hell!! Yeah. I'm going solo since my brother is home crafting and building. So is hunter rifle a better weapon for clearing?
7daystodie,3bfx1n,CLYDE_FROG68,2,Mon Jun 29 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"Hunting rifle will 1-shot normal zombies and dogs no matter where you hit them. 2 body shots or 1 head shot for fatties and cops. The reload time is about the same as the crossbow. Sniper does a bit more damage than hunting but still need 2 body shots to kill a fatty. Sniper holds 5 rounds before needing to reload and has a nice scope. Uses same ammo as hunting rifle.  Rifle rounds are kind of expensive, they take 3 gun powder instead of 1 for 9mm. After you find a mine with coal, nitrate, and lead then your limiting factor will be brass so it is not much of an issue. 9mm often comes free from cops though. 9mm pistol is about the same damage as crossbow (2 in the head for fatties), but you can fire off 15 shots before reloading.  Guns generate heat with every shot, but crossbow does not. Guns are easier to aim with, especially when not crouching. If you're trying to clear a lot of zombies fast then a gun is the way to go. If you're trying to be sneaky then keep to the crossbow."
7daystodie,3bgh1w,chabo_son_of_chabo,2,Mon Jun 29 00:37:34 2015 UTC,I had gotten confused by this when I first played Alpha11. On our random gen map I've noticed that I see large black spots on my map where the actual caverns are underground. Go down the tunnel till your in the cavern and then check the map to show in you are located where the spots are.

7daystodie,3bf8eb,jebblue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Its more of an increased spawn rate rather than increase in numbers. Your game/server will have a spawn cap that it sticks to, to keep your game running smooth. It will be just as easy to kill the zombies, they will just seem more relentless as more spawn in quickly near you."
7daystodie,3bf8eb,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:41:02 2015 UTC,Zombies are suffering from a disease that is rotting their flesh; they should get weaker the longer they are visible. They should never be able to tear down a brick wall with their decaying hands. :)
7daystodie,3bf8eb,Togfox,5,Sun Jun 28 19:23:08 2015 UTC,That would be a really boring game then. Imagine building a brick wall that no zombies could get through. Doesn't sound fun.

7daystodie,3bg4py,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,4,Sun Jun 28 22:45:12 2015 UTC,The shift to Unity 5 came with some squishy feeling physics. Pretty sure that's what you're talking about.

7daystodie,3bg4py,Thepher,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:54:51 2015 UTC,Well that's a major disappointment. Suppose i'll check on it again in a few more months. Movement is too unbearable for me to stand.
7daystodie,3bg4py,procrastinatorgrrl,7,Sun Jun 28 22:57:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is the first time I've heard someone complain about the way walking feels, aside from the speed initially. Though I can't imagine what kind of bug would cause it. Waiting a few months isn't necessary though, I would try back in a week or two, once A12 has been released. Maybe you'll find that a little better."

7daystodie,3bg4py,Kamiflage,3,Mon Jun 29 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"If you use vsync, that increases input delay and can contribute to movement feeling off."

7daystodie,3bg4py,Dardoleon,3,Mon Jun 29 13:17:31 2015 UTC,vsync makes the whole game feel more sluggish. At least it did for me.
7daystodie,3bg4py,CLYDE_FROG68,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:26:36 2015 UTC,"For me, it makes the game match the refresh rate of my monitor.  The FPS may be capped at 60, but that 60 in vsync actually looks better than 100 fps without because it's so damns smooth."

7daystodie,3bbafa,Palin_Sees_Russia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"Another feature of the server is there are commands such as /sethome and /home. which sets a location for a teleport, and allows you to teleport there for the cost of some zcoins, which are earnt by killing zombies and from time spent on the server. You can also set a second portal if you are looting a LONG way away, which allows you to teleport, (again at a cost of zcoins) back to the area you was last hunting. These teleports can only be used once every 30 minutes to stop abuse.  Oh also, it's Strictly PvE, if you attempt to shoot someone (which you can only harm them if they are not on your friends list, you get teleported to jail, in the centre city for 20 minutes, with no means of escape. including using teleports."

7daystodie,3bbix9,rezanow,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:45:21 2015 UTC,"there is a way, ive seen it posted multiple times. The secret is that the whole sign is one invisible block near the middle of the bottom. Build a support for it, and then remove it, and the game remembers the sign needs to fall.

7daystodie,3bdf12,trevorwobbles,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"Normal wasteland biomes dont have the green radiated spots with the dead bodies, or police zombies,  and also the ambient noise is different.  Thats the easiest way to tell, just listen to the ambience.  The wasteland sounds windy, and the actual city hub sounds more creepy, for lack if a better word.   There can be multiple cities as well.  All of the biomes have different percentages to spawn so you will most likely find more wastelands than cities.  Im not sure how the probability works in 7 days, as it seems to be a little bit strange, but the vanilla probability for a city is 0.05% and i think wastelands are 0.15%.  These can all be tweaked of course, as well as minimum/maximum block size of the cities.  ;-)"
7daystodie,3bcy0i,emerican_coder,3,Sun Jun 28 01:09:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen store towns, with a gas station, book store, and a poppin pills. Sometimes you see campsites on the side of the road almost anywhere. In deserts there little water towers that pop up. In the wasteland, there is a city of course.   You can also find lots of residential areas that can contain stores, prisons, or just houses   I don't exactly know if the wasteland and snow biome has the special POIs that are in it from Navezgane, but you shouldn't have much trouble finding the stuff above if you just walk the roads"
7daystodie,3bcy0i,pieboy136,3,Sun Jun 28 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"Wasteland sometimes has a factory. More rare than large city, lots of oil. There's a small forest lodge. A large fancy forest lodge. Cabin in the woods off roads. Random barns off roads. Just a gas station. Just the mansion with the pool.  Any of the stores can spawn in small groups. I found one burn forest had a bookstore, a large bookstore, and some other store and that was it.  It's pretty random. Too many towns from a couple patches ago."

7daystodie,3bcy0i,Lucullus76,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:12:18 2015 UTC,You can download packs on the official forums that add tons of more orefabs to the wilderness and towns.  I love it because it adds so much more to the game.  The vanilla prefabs get really boring and repetative after a while.

The only thing it has that random doesnt is the hostpital i think, which could most likely be out into random gen with the other custom prefabs.  Either way, random gen with the prefab pack is the way to go!  In my opinion, i think you're missing out ob a lot if you just play nevazgane.  There is so much...  I have over a thousand hours and in my last game, right before I downloaded the prefab pack and started a new world,  I found a vanilla prefab I've never even seen before.  Over 100 hours in that specific game and I stumbled upon a hotel with an inground pool in the desert.  I never knew that was in the game lol.  If you want to test it out before a12 drops, youre welcome to play in my server if youd like, to see if you like it.  Let me know if youre interested."

Built in every viable location you could think of. The variations in the terrain don't even compare to what you find in random gen. And with random gen 3.0 coming in A12, I don't think I'll ever be playing in Navezgane again.  Navezgane isn't a bad map though, by any means. It has some unique buildings which aren't in random gen, and the layout is more structured. But it's small, and get's too predictable. You just hit certain buildings, loot them, go somewhere else, build your base, and then defend it. That's it, really. There's no exploration to be done. Whereas in random gen, you might pack your things and hit the road to find a new town, only to end up spending the night in a hole because you're out in the middle of nowhere, without enough time to get home.  Basically, random gen is endless and exciting and infinitely more challenging than Navezgane."
7daystodie,3bbdmi,procrastinatorgrrl,2,Sat Jun 27 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"I can't be arsed to play random gen, it just makes me.. ugh.  It's not that it isn't fun to explore, it is, but I'll be damned if I could find a town. And with finding iron being so hard considering I have no luck finding houses, towns or such I'd have to spend lots of time digging downwards. It is very challenging. I guess that's the point of it.

But like people have already said, follow roads to find towns, and if you can't find a road, follow a river until you find a bridge..

7daystodie,3bbdmi,FurryFredChunks,2,Sun Jun 28 03:46:11 2015 UTC,"Naz is fun. For sure. It has cool and unique POIs and is designed to be more like a real world. But it is very small. You can essentially run from one side of the map to the other in a day. There are no caves, so to mine ore, you have to just dig randomly. Eventually you reach a point where you just say, ""now what?""  With random gen, everything is new. Exploration is a part of the game. Caves exist and have large chunks of ore. You can just start walking in a direction and never reach the end. The unknown factor is what keeps it interesting."
7daystodie,3bbdmi,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:38:07 2015 UTC,Well there comes a point in nav that you've finally seen everything it has to offer. The glory of random gen is that you never know what you'll find.

7daystodie,3bavmi,Stannis_teh_Mannis,3,Sat Jun 27 13:26:31 2015 UTC,Concrete is slow to obtain and stockpile. For first builds I'd go with wood because you can work in higher volumes. I like to go double thick on primary walls though.   It's a little slower but you can make wood frames using 4 pieces of wood planks instead of the normal 8. Just craft wood shingles and then break the shingles off with an axe. It can then be upgraded just like a normal frame would.   The trade off is time vs materials. It'll cost you less materials this way but take up twice the time because you have to chip away at each block. With a purple axe though it only takes 1 or 2 hits to clear off shingles.
7daystodie,3bavmi,Imakedo,2,Sat Jun 27 13:52:01 2015 UTC,Where can I see how many hits it takes for the blocks to be broken by a standard zombie? I've seen hardness and such things but which do I look at?
7daystodie,3bavmi,Ratsmon,2,Sat Jun 27 13:59:13 2015 UTC,What you want is Pure-Dur.  Reinforced Concrete is 214  Metal Reinforced Wood is 161
7daystodie,3bavmi,Imakedo,3,Sat Jun 27 14:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I found those numbers after you lot explained it to me, thank you. But I don't think those numbers are correct, or at least what I'm looking for. It would take 161 punches from a zombie to break my wood wall? Really? They seem to do it so much faster in my save."
7daystodie,3bavmi,Ratsmon,2,Sat Jun 27 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the variables are. Could be something in the settings, information could be out of date, or something else.   Reinforced Concrete is probably going to be your best bet long term but wood is easier to work with starting out."
7daystodie,3bavmi,Imakedo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:55:59 2015 UTC,I agree. It seems like that number flies in the face of the xml code showing the zombies to have a x3 dmg modifier vs wood.

7daystodie,3bavmi,rezanow,2,Sat Jun 27 14:32:22 2015 UTC,"For your first base, go with whatever is easiest. I usually build in brick, which is rubbish, but some reinforced log spikes make it manageable for day 7.   I make 2 building with a bridge in between. door in one, everything else in the other. You can make little towers to the sides as well, because brick doesn't take a lot of time to gather and place. side towers are awesome to divert zombies attention from the main building and to get a clear view. I can get some shots of my little base when I get home, if you like."

7daystodie,3b8l22,ctrl_all_del,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:00:24 2015 UTC,It is a very similar game in my view but many things are different of course.  Like 7 Days I'd say the core gameplay is more about PVE or cooperative play.  The building is more limited but they are doing an absolutely insane job supporting it sometimes patching 3-4 times a day (too much actually!).  If you enjoy 7D2D you'll probably enjoy Ark.

7daystodie,3b5w9i,Ratsmon,7,Fri Jun 26 08:14:10 2015 UTC,"Easy: make felling the tree require say, 80% of the damage it takes now, and make the log on the ground require the remaining 20%. Or whatever makes the most sense, so long as the durability cost is still the same."
7daystodie,3b5w9i,ThatOneGuy1294,6,Fri Jun 26 08:44:31 2015 UTC,"If you watch the video it appears that after he cuts the second tree it disappears after it falls (or at least part of it does).  So I'm not sure if it turns into wood at that point, but it if not it appears that the trunk you need to cut is smaller.  It would be cool if it was similar to the logs you find at the camps, but they would be different height/length depending on the tree.  So large trees would have thicker trunks and be 6 logs long, whereas small trees would be much smaller and only 1-2 logs."
7daystodie,3b5w9i,btravis72,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it'll add a different dynamic, the crafting system is already pretty immersive but I see they've changed it to be a little more simple since A10, where for example you had to harvest grass & then craft it into plant fibers, where now you just harvest the grass & it's already converted into plant fibers. So with the trees it seems they are going back to that a little bit.  But for all I know it might turn out to be annoying as you say, & if that's the case hopefully they'll change it. Time will tell."

7daystodie,3b5w9i,ShadowRam,5,Fri Jun 26 13:53:01 2015 UTC,That's why it's currently t speed could lead to a variety of bike and parts customizing.  The sound is repetitive but could use some more variety and decrease in volume...

If you can utilize the full aoe of a fully grown tree (drop it in the direction a horde is coming from and you could hit an pretty long line,) that's a ton of potential damage compared to the relatively short range of any explosives currently in the game.  Hard to say from just the video, but I'll definitely be experimenting with them. :)"

Sound is an incredibly important part of survival when you're in hostile territory or hunting/tracking. It's no surprise that after so much development to increase the accuracy and realism of line of site in games that one would come along and lift the bar for sounds as well.   If you are chopping a tree, you better believe that everyone in the neighborhood can hear it. When the tree falls, that sound is audible for at least a quarter mile. The game obvious wants people to understand these thing, considering you can hear people unzip their bags to open their inventory.  Now talk about a crappy combustion engine with no real muffler... oh buddy. You can't hear anything over that. The game is trying to emulate that reality by making the motor loud. Of course, to be truly realistic you would need an expensive audio setup to properly deafen your entire household when you turn it on."

In talking about it, what we'd really like to see would be the ability to control the passage of time by getting in bed to accelerate it. Each person in a bed after a certain time would make the clock a little bit faster until morning. Except on horde nights, where time flows normally regardless."

If I max all the settings currently I only get like 40 fps. The game is extremely unoptimized. There's also those dead trees that appear as giant gray rectangles at a distance. And even with all settings maxed the plane still doesn't appear in the sky but for a brief second when it comes within view distance.  There's a few settings that just bog everything down (can't remember off the top of my head).

7daystodie,3b57wz,sec_goat,3,Fri Jun 26 15:55:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  /u/snizzix, as near as I can tell, the entire integrity system is based around what block is to the left of your beam. So, for example...  auuua x   x x   x zyyyz k   k k   k   Ok, so uuu only affects a. yyy only affects z. The things on uuu have absolutely no effect at all on x, z, or k. Height makes no difference either. The uuu level is no more or less strong than yyy (assuming z and a are made of the same material).   Working on cleaning the house today for the birthday party, so I can't jump into the game. But, I don't believe the pillars even matter at all - x and k could be wood, and yyy and uuu be heavy concrete and the integrity would still be based on a and z. As long as a and z can hold it, the entire structure should be sound. I'll be further exploring this theory tomorrow! Now, to crank up Dream Theater and get back to cleaning!   Oh, and check this out (I snuck on the computer). http://imgur.com/pmzmF6F I've still so much to figure out about the maths in this game. lolz  (Another angle - http://imgur.com/nSdSCHU)"
7daystodie,3b57wz,sec_goat,2,Fri Jun 26 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"I think I may go and test this out myself. I'm especially interested in how reinforced cement works, because in my experience it would seem the structural integrity decreases when the cement in wet. Could be wrong, but I've lost quite a few rebar frames in my time.  Edit: Alright, so. Exhibit A. http://i.imgur.com/IllelMK.jpg  The wood started out as a frame, then I upgraded it once, then again. Each time it would only let me build out one block from it in trussing. I think we all know that you can build out more than one block when using actual wood, so it seems different materials latch onto each other differently?  B. http://i.imgur.com/pU8oJA3.jpg  The wood frames held onto the trussing without much of an issue though?  C. http://i.imgur.com/uePjcyz.jpg  The rebar surprised me. A lot. But as soon as I upgraded the first block to wood, it all fell.  I'm sure this requires extra testing from someone not as lazy as me, but there you go.   Bonus: http://i.imgur.com/acDhj5W.jpg  If I didn't miscount by one or two, I built out 15 blocks from each pillar. Trussing really is amazing. Especially when you consider that this (http://i.imgur.com/ltwDQPr.jpg) happened too. Don't ask, because I don't know. Physics were most definitely turned on."

7daystodie,3b58dh,notharley,2,Fri Jun 26 11:59:45 2015 UTC,"As for legitimate sources, prefabs are great (towns, bridges, etc). Lots of people don't realize you can scrap virtually everything from a house. Air conditioner ducts, metal shelving, sink faucets, toilets, metal siding, bridge metal, etc. If it's a lootable item (ie: air conditioner, locker, metal desk), I would suggest against destroying it. Most servers do not appreciate that and it's rude for whoever is going to come after you. Lootable things respawn, usually after a few game-days.  As for illegitimate sources, if you really want to just build a giant damn fortress, go cut down several stacks of logs, and mine several stacks of stone. Craft yourself a couple dozen Navezgane signs, and throw them in an iron forge. They produce a metric shit-ton of iron each. This has got to be a bug, since they require only wood planks and stone to produce, but it does work (or at least did very recently)."
7daystodie,3b58dh,SilentNN,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"As you said, I've held back on destroying loot boxes, even though i'm not on a server. The barbed wire harvesting netted me a good deal of iron, so I think if i'm in a pinch I'll try some other prefab sources.  As for the sign idea, I'll definitely try that. I have no qualms about it, seeing as how if I was on a RG map, I could find tons of iron just in the walls of caves. I kinda hope that mining is buffed for navezgane, or a few caves are introduced."
7daystodie,3b58dh,SilentNN,2,Fri Jun 26 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Personally I've never heard of crafting a navezgane sign, but I do know that you can concrete mix can be forged into iron. 2 concrete mixes is slightly more than 1 iron ingot. As a sidenote, if you convert stone to small stone to gravel and forge cement from that, you'll yield twice as much cement compared to forging stone or small stone."
7daystodie,3b58dh,Blakklink,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"About that actually, IIRC I've never actually seen a ""stone"", only a ""small stone"".

7daystodie,3b58dh,notharley,2,Fri Jun 26 05:44:49 2015 UTC,"Underneath the dirt, or whatever the ground is made of, you're mostly just going to find stone. Since it's navezgane, of course there might be some actual ore deep down there, but besides ore and gravel, it's basically all stone."
7daystodie,3b58dh,Rishijheelan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:49:51 2015 UTC,OK I've looked and don't see anything. How does one craft a Navezgane sign? What is the recipe?

7daystodie,3b3li3,elt,3,Thu Jun 25 18:59:41 2015 UTC,metal trussing 'windows' are great for that   Iron bars work a bit better. They are more durable and you can still shoot through them. Although they are a bit more expensive (4.75 iron pipes per block instead of 3)

Or they come around behind and punch tunnels into the base of the cliff.  Best bases I've found so far are just solid concrete with lots of steel bar windows to fire through and 3 rows of wood log spikes surrounding the whole thing. Also because of gore blocks, I recommend a lip around the outside edge to prevent zombies from making hills out of their dead and climbing those hills into your base."
7daystodie,3b3li3,Van_Tek,3,Thu Jun 25 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"The unfortunate part is once you've built this base, all that's left is hunting for better weapons and armor or standing around in your base defending against hordes."

7daystodie,3b3li3,Van_Tek,2,Sat Jun 27 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"I built my base on a bridge. Half the zombies end up directly under the bridge in deep water, and the others meet one of my two walls. Sides are protected because it's a bridge. The fort can be defended from inside as well (as to protect from the spider zombies and bees).  Since the bridge is made of iron it takes an extremely long time for zombies to claw through any of it. Every once in awhile I'll have to go out and repair one of the four beams that support the bridge and reinforce them, but that's pretty rare."
7daystodie,3b3li3,Van_Tek,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"I may still be okay because only the back of the base slopes upwards and don't have to build on that slope, only down in it. My initial wooden tower is at the base of the slope on level ground. Still I dunno, it sounds like you're saying that the zombies will see the slope as having vertical walls to punch through.   Maybe the safest thing to do is to build a fortress on flat ground away from the slope and just eventually extend the base underground to the cliff face like I want. Thankfully we can save map seeds so I can try different things."

7daystodie,3b3li3,elduderino197,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:09:57 2015 UTC,"Basically they need to be over solid material with no empty space under them if you're gonna go with something crazy like a base on stilts. If the base collapses, they're still on top of a solid pillar, so they'll be fine."

I would build an interior of metal reinforced cement under the dirt, so it won't show from outside, but is protected beneath that layer."
7daystodie,3b2t13,rezanow,6,Thu Jun 25 14:43:01 2015 UTC,Go in the main cave. Dig straight up and build a shelter around your new entrance. Build a watwr filled moat around the shelter and you should ne fine for some days. That was our start in a discovered cave. The original opening isnt much in use at all. If a horde is coming they try to engage us at our shelter. Due to the moat its quite easy to defend. I hopw this makes any sense. English isnt my best.  Edit: Even heavy forging and cooking wasnt a big deal. There were 3-5 spiders but its not a problem at all if u decide to fight them during the day.  We dont even have a ledge (?) against the spiders nor spikes in the moat so far. I have not discovered any z spawn in our cave
7daystodie,3b2t13,PraisethemDaniels,2,Thu Jun 25 15:09:05 2015 UTC,Why go through the trouble if you already have an existing entrance?
7daystodie,3b2t13,PraisethemDaniels,5,Thu Jun 25 16:50:48 2015 UTC,its way faster to climb a ladder as walking the way back to the original entrance. It serves as a second entrance and exit as well.

7daystodie,3b2t13,FurryFredChunks,5,Sun Jun 28 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"I like to build on the flat plains. My base is maybe 12 x 15. Near the center I will build a tunnel going down about 12-15 blocks. Then I go at a downwards incline until I it bedrock. I leave my bed in the base to help with navigating since the downward tunnel to bedrock would put me a small distance away.  I build a tower 3 blocks away from the wall of my base. I eventually put in 2 rows of wood spikes around the base. The tower has ladders on 2 sides. Around the top of the base (base starts out about 5-6 blocks tall) are wood frames to block spider zombies. Access to the base is by the tower and I carry 2 wood frames to walk over to the base. I remove the 2 frames to avoid zombies accessing from the tower.  At bedrock, I carve out an area about 20 x 20 just high enough for me to walk around without needing to crouch. One side in each corner is a campfire with a campfire in the middle (grill, beaker, and pot). The other side in each corner are forges stacked on top of each other (3 high, 6 total). Ideally putting the distance is supposed to minimize increasing the heat but not sure how it works.  So far I haven' t had a problem with zombies digging to me that I've noticed. Being so far deep, I'm sure it would take a while for them to do it. By having the bottom base tunnel at a slant, there is some distance to my exit so I should be able to avoid detection by zombies doing the initial homing on my location."

By day 4-5 I have my underground base built up and completed the walls and entrance towers. Because I'm afraid if zombies get through the wood spikes, a reinforced wood frame will be nothing. So I add concrete under the base before putting in the wood spikes.  I try to minimize the heat source of the underground base by putting forges and campfires on opposite sides. I doubt it helps much when stacking the forges. By going at a slant, I'm some distance away from my bedroll. In the off chance zombies get to me underground, I can spawn safely and have clothes and weapons ready in the chests."

It was completely built out of stone and dirt. i forgot to make pillars for it... over 4 layers of stone and dirt came crashing down on me. RIP... had to look for another base after that... in your case tho, damn i'd be pissed! All that scavenging for nothing :/"
7daystodie,3b1pbt,Raeffi,2,Thu Jun 25 07:05:56 2015 UTC,Thats why all my bases are on ground level with underground storage ^
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,2,Thu Jun 25 10:25:50 2015 UTC,Ya i had a pretty good collapse last week. Made 16 block tall pillars of reinforced concrete to build a floor on. All on top of my already 3 story tall tower. Had the basic frame made and started filling in the new floor when everything let go. Turns out one block pillars weren't enough to support everything. Just glad it didn't crush the levels below.
7daystodie,3b1pbt,oberhamsi,2,Thu Jun 25 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"As far as I understand the game-physics, the integrity of a structure is factored from the side of the block. A single block pillar...  x x x   ...as opposed to a 1x2 or 4x4, for example...  xx xx xx   ...should be as structurally worthy of holding up the above units. So, if your single pillars are the same Z axis from top to bottom, you should be fine, assuming you don't have too much of a gap between them.    My issue was this...  x           x x           x x           x zxxxxxxxxxxxz  x         x  x         x  x         x   All of the pressure was on Z to hold up everything above it, rather than on x all the way down."
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,3,Thu Jun 25 14:27:34 2015 UTC,the integrity of a structure is factored from the side of the block   care to elaborate? i don't get the example. i would have expected a multi block column to hold a wider roof than a single block column. just because with multiple blocks the roof won't have to span so far between columns. but i'm obviously not groking it.
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,2,Thu Jun 25 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm no 7Days wizard, but I think I'm getting a better grasp on the physics. I'll use concrete blocks as an example, because that's what I'm working with right now. Each block has a mass of 15. Each block can hold 90 coming out from the side.   Let's say you build up three blocks.  x x x   Ok, now, from the top block, you begin to build out.   xyz x x   Any of the x can support 90 mass on its side. Y is 15. Z is 15. The top X is currently supporting 30 mass. The moment you build out this far...  xyz1234 x x   ...the 4 equals 90, and yz1234 all fall down (the pillar remains, unharmed).   xyz121zyx x       x x       x   The difference is split here. Adding an extra pillar...  xxyz121zyxx xx       xx xx       xx   ...would make no difference at all.   From my experience, so long as I haven't exceeded that 90 mass limit, my structures have remained stout.   I invite anyone with a better mathbrain to correct me or elaborate further."
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,2,Thu Jun 25 18:32:58 2015 UTC,The reason a multi block pillar works better is because you have to build off 2 sides of that pillar assuming you're building some type of rectangle. having 2 blocks at each corner means your x axis and y axis (looking outwards in a top down view) are both supported independently. While the span may be much less than what it can also support you still have to factor in the weight of the floor that will be supported from that.  Hope that helps
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,3,Thu Jun 25 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"Let's see if I understand what you're saying. Looking from the top down, your L pillars look like this:  X XX   Right?   If so, you're building your horizontal beams like this...   Y X XXY   Which makes one of the three redundant. The weight of Y is completely dependant on the strength of the X it is connected to.   If I understand the system well enough, that means this will work just as well...  Y X  XY   The missing column had nothing at all to do with what is extending horizontally from the other columns and was unnecessary.   However, you make a valid point. Rather than split the integrity two ways (a single column has two horizontal beams attached), two columns would support their own horizontal beam. If I knew the formulas better, I'd calculate whether the extra integrity was necessary."
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,2,Thu Jun 25 22:38:06 2015 UTC,yup thats it. and no the middle block doesn't really do anything structurally. I realized that while building.
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:59:36 2015 UTC,it is necessary on my bas to have the 2 columns per corner because of the size of my base. i think my wider span is around 12-14 blocks wide
7daystodie,3b1pbt,SnawBoard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"Yes I gathered that from your other comment. I nearly did the same thing while constructing before. The issue i had came one block as a pillar on all 4 corners of structure. it was enough to hold the 4 cross bracers to connect them all, however once i started to add in the floor(made of stone so quite heavy) i got a few rows in and it was too much. To fix this i new 3 pillars per corner in an outward L. managed to built the floor completely without issue. You made a very good representation of how the physics works though. I'd bet there's some newbies out there could use it."

7daystodie,3b1pbt,UnremarkablyWeird,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:00:42 2015 UTC,the space between pillars is around 10-14 on my base. you need extra support when the span is that big

7daystodie,3b1pbt,RomanticPanic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:00:45 2015 UTC,you need it on both sides. If i had used a single pillar it would hold the single span from pillar to pillar. the problem comes in when you start adding a floor. the floor will end up at over 100 blocks added onto the side spans. that's what caused my first collapse. i got about 1/3 of the floor done when it fell. Just logged in and counted. I have a base 10x12. so a bit bigger than a lot of towers ive seen
7daystodie,3b1pbt,RomanticPanic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:10:32 2015 UTC,10x12? Made of what material?
7daystodie,3b1pbt,RomanticPanic,2,Fri Jun 26 00:50:48 2015 UTC,first 2 floors are solid reinforced concrete floors and walls. after that theres a mix of cobblestone decayed brick and reinforced concrete. I kept using the concrete on the corners the whole way up. i think im around 50-60 blocks high at this point.
7daystodie,3b1pbt,RomanticPanic,2,Fri Jun 26 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"Well, that explains a few things. The ""integrity"" listed on the wiki is the calculation of the mass/maxload. Concrete has an integrity of 6, while reinforced concrete has an integrity of 15.   http://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Building_Materials  It's also been noted on the Wiki (Structural Integrity)...   It is not possible to build a beam longer than 15 blocks. The 16th block simply drops and doesn't stick to the beam. It is unknown if this is a bug or intended."

7daystodie,3b1kr0,snizzix,6,Thu Jun 25 05:52:00 2015 UTC,"Small stones? Stone Axe, Stone shovel, Arrows, Crossbow Bolts, Forge, Gravel..."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,rezanow,2,Thu Jun 25 06:49:40 2015 UTC,"Haven't thought of crossbow bolts. I'll look into that! Thanks! Also, what is gravel used for?"
7daystodie,3b1kr0,wealthyspoon,3,Thu Jun 25 07:02:10 2015 UTC,"It's mainly used for making concrete, if you mix gravel with cement you get a bucket of concrete."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,rezanow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:44:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!
7daystodie,3b1kr0,OnceIthought,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:17:01 2015 UTC,"Gravel, when used with the proper mold, can be put into the forge to make cement. This cement can be combined with more gravel to form cement mix. Cement mix can then be formed into concrete blocks, or poured into a rebar frame, upgrading it to reinforced concrete, one of the strongest building materials in the game."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,rezanow,2,Thu Jun 25 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"It's concrete mix, but yeah, it'll become one of your primary building materials for anything that needs to take a hit. Taking Stone, breaking it down into Small Stone, then breaking that down into gravel and cooking it in the forge for cement seems to be the best return."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,trevorwobbles,2,Thu Jun 25 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, make sure you break the stones down into gravel before putting it into the forge. You can smelt Stone or Small Stone to get cement, but smelting as gravel nets more!  And thanks, /u/OnceIthought for catching my goof."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,rezanow,2,Thu Jun 25 16:49:42 2015 UTC,"I thought they changed that in the current version, so no longer does turning stone into small stone and into gravel increase yield? I may be mistaken. I'm pretty sure you get half as many small stones from a stone block as you used to, but I can't recall the forge weight of the gravel right now..."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,CasperHarkin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:50:08 2015 UTC,"1 Stone = 8 Small Stone  4 Small Stone = 1 Gravel  1 Gravel = 4 Cement  However, you can smelt Stone and Small Stone directly.   2 Small Stone = 1 Cement  1 Stone = 4 Cement    So, you can smelt 1 Stone directly into 4 Cement...  or  ...convert 1 Stone into 8 Small Stone into 2 Gravel, which will make 8 cement."
7daystodie,3b1kr0,TechStack,5,Fri Jun 26 01:03:43 2015 UTC,The main thing I use small stones for is making gravel.  Best food; venison stew is the best I have found.   Edit: Oh and to make a forge.

Even several weeks into a game I still craft hundreds of bolts, since you know... guns make a lot of noice. Crossbow is silent and accurate.   Best kind of food I don't know, but I do know that bacon and eggs are great. Just kill a few pigs and grab all those eggs you have from looting bird nests for feathers (you know, for arrows and bolts). The meal doesn't smell at all and is great for both hunger and wellness.   In the early game I pick up every small rock I come by and loot every bird nest I see."

I always avoid melee combat since I don't want to get infected. And even later on it's great with arrows or bolts for sneaking. I only use bullets when there are too many zombies.   The wiki on gamepedia.com is great for crafting recipes. I don't know how well updated it is, but should work rather well for food: http://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Food (try finding the best food, the grid is can sort each column).

They will one shot to head kill zombies silently and are accurate as hell. They are great for sneaking into places. Guns should only be used for the oh shit scenarios in my opinion.
7daystodie,3b46x0,ulvhund,10,Thu Jun 25 20:47:17 2015 UTC,He means that usually with that amount of zombies it's suppose to drain your performance but he had a good 10fps with 220 zombies all loaded in one direction at his location. Normally for people who lag with FPS of zombie spawns is the limit of like say 50 or so I never seen big hordes but 220 is massive. This means that basically he's saying the performance is great because usually before with that many zombies the performance would be quite literally 0..  In short he's just saying that optimization has improved and he has tested and it has.

7daystodie,3az02w,Chauserable,2,Wed Jun 24 22:34:17 2015 UTC,No. It's pretty soft. Not a defensive material. Max stamina and a flawless pickaxe takes them out in 3-4 hits. Reinforced concrete is 20+
7daystodie,3az02w,Blaktoe,5,Thu Jun 25 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"I do misc crafting and organize supplies. Figure out what's needed for the next day, come up with base improvements, pretty much the stuff you can't do while you're out scavenging.  We usually end up a good bit off the ground with no real approach. So I'll take dirt up and make a rooftop garden. So sometimes there is stuff to do with that.  And if it's been fortified against spiders we'll run forges and campfires while everything is relatively secure. I understand the whole heat index thing... but it seems like it doesn't really to matter if you're far enough off the ground and the spiders can't detect you. It hasn't been a problem for us, anyway.  If we're not in a populated area we'll still go out at night until the fog kicks up. I just don't care for seeing a zombie sprinting at me from 2 feet away."
7daystodie,3az02w,ExplodingJesus,3,Wed Jun 24 17:35:47 2015 UTC,How far up are you?
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,3,Wed Jun 24 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"I've been finding multi-story flat topped buildings and using those. So maybe 3 floors above ground level? Then I put up a perimeter wall a bit from the building and when possible spider-proof that, too.   So not sure how to turn that into meaningful units... but the distance would be that hypotenuse of the height of the building and the distance to the perimeter. Even before the outer wall it seem like the spiders struggle to really get to us.  I have a ledge at the top floor because it's easy. But I've been going around the second floor putting another ledge in and I'm hoping that will help even more. I've been making little spider-proof lookout posts out of second floor windows and I'm going to connect them all to make a secondary contiguous ledge so they are even further removed.  Because screw those guys."
7daystodie,3az02w,ExplodingJesus,2,Wed Jun 24 19:22:39 2015 UTC,I can totally visualize what you're saying and it's helpful since I'm new at this game. I had a base on a 2nd floor cabin and I kept getting sensed and then after the 7th day horde I had mini hordes every night until I restarted. If you don't mind answer a couple more questions. I'm trying to find a good first 7 day set up so that I feel like I'm on a good track and one that's above ground since I like the views. With that in mind what do you build the perimeter out of and how was this set up to survive the first horde?
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,3,Wed Jun 24 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"The cabin you speak of, is it the two floor one with a gun safe on the first floor and a roof of glass?"
7daystodie,3az02w,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:41:12 2015 UTC,The one with the gun safe.
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,3,Wed Jun 24 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"If its the one I am thinking about, simply blow out the windows and door on the first floor and replace them with wood frames upgraded to stage 2 (no need for iron). With no doors or windows, the zombies will just want to beat on whatever wall is closest. This is when you surround the porch with wood log spikes, two rows deep. All of this is cheap to provide. Make your main storage base and bed location on the second floor.   I then place my forges outside on the roof, because it looks cool. Place Wood Frames (not upgraded) around the second floor deck, then destroy the staircase leading up. This makes it impossible for the spiders to crawl up or for gore block stacking (it extends past the spikes). You can shoot through the frames with guns (not arrows).   How do you get into this fort? Build 5 wood frames up about 5 spaces away from the edge of the second floor deck. Throw a ladder on it (obviously missing the first rung to prevent zombies from climbing). Do not upgrade your bridge across to the fort. Treat it like a draw bridge and then pick the frames up at night.   Bonus features. Blow out everything on the first floor and put dirt down. You can now turn it into a small farm! Then, you can build a mine shaft in the basement (where the lockers and toilet is) and work on that at night.   If you plan on staying long, build two towers on each side, connecting to the second floor deck. Surround the pillar with spikes. Now, when the zombies cluster around your base, you can walk out, turn, and pick them off. Obviously when the Feral Cops show up, you retreat back to the deck.   This Cabin Fort works for a good while until you have the materials to build your own base. This concept works great for people on a budget, as it already provides ample space, coverage, and protection. And these usually exist away from POI towns so you have less spawn rates to contend with."
7daystodie,3az02w,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the step by step. I think the concept of building a temporary fort made of wood and spikes while I save up rebarb and cement might be what I need. And maybe I should try starting in the woods or nearby. Right now I'm in the plains near a big 4 block town but there is hardly any wood at all in sight so I'm pondering if I should build regular cement, brick or lots of metal blocks. To make things worse this whole big town does not contain the forge book, but I have an SMG, a nailgun and a flawless pickaxe. Regardless, I'm going to start over and try your plan."
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,2,Wed Jun 24 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"I would definitely go to the Woods. It is easily the best biome for people trying to learn. Wood is so important to getting things going.   But words of wisdom:  Don't use the SMG. Instead, craft a Wooden Bow (Sticks and Grass) and Arrows (Stick, Small Stone, Feather). It is quieter and ammo is almost limitless. On your run to the woods biome, just stop at every birds nest. It takes a short while to get good at the Bow, but once you do, you can take down almost anything during the day that isn't a Dog or Cop.   Just make sure you use the Wood Log Spike and not the other spikes (that look like pencils)."
7daystodie,3az02w,InfectedHeisenberg,3,Wed Jun 24 22:54:11 2015 UTC,Another idea for the draw bridge is trap doors. Make them the bridge floor and open them up when you're inside.
7daystodie,3az02w,Rock1monkey,2,Thu Jun 25 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"So yea, I'm going for a 3rd+ floor equivalent when possible. Sometimes you have to pick something less than optimal for night 1 depending on where you spawn. But I wouldn't set up permanent shop in a town that close to the ground.  I've actually had a lot of success out in the plains where there are just plain less zombies. Some nights go by with nothing but 1 or 2 wanderers. Height is less of an issue there than in a town.  For ledges I'm using wood as nothing is really hitting it. Just spiders from below and it knocks them down onto spikes underneath.   For the first couple tiers on the ground I've been using reinforced concrete with a fair amount of success. Bonus points if you can build on something they can't dig through because if there is a weak spot they'll surely find it. Every once in a while one will get underneath. I am testing sinking one concrete block into the ground but I'm not really sure that's worth it.  Reinforced concrete looks like it'll be expensive to build. But it's not really unreasonable if you can find a couple decent tools scavenging. It's harder if you have to build your own faulty iron pickaxe for sure as it just takes longer to gather stuff. But scrap iron and iron fragments aren't hard to find at all. If you're busting up boulders you get the stone and iron you need for it all in one go. They seem to hold up pretty well. If you're in a boulder-poor biome I can see that being tricky without making a resource run every chance you get.   One other note: for the actual roof access I'm using a ladder with a frame set on top at night. Maybe it'll change, but they just can't really attack upward so even if they get through everything else they just bunch up under the ladder until morning. If you're lucky enough to have found a chainsaw cleanup is fast and easy. I normally have a second exit of some sort just because - one that cannot be accessed from the ground at all so exit only. If you don't have a better way to clean them up you can drop on the outside and they'll trickle out and it's much easier to deal with them.  Edit: oh... and if you do use wood for ledges be wary of standing on them if cops show up. That ranged attack that's aimed at you can bust them up in short order. You can repair them faster than the cops can hit them, but be mindful of it."
7daystodie,3az02w,ExplodingJesus,2,Wed Jun 24 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Reinforced concrete does seem to be a bit much for the first week. It's hard for me consider collecting all that metal and concrete and still have time to get the base all set up by the 7th day. Which leads me to using up a lot of that scrap iron to upgrade the wood blocks, doors and making metal siding. Right now, I'm on day 4 in the plains with hardly any trees so I'm scrambling to think of what to build with. There's a 4 block town nearby so I may just start knocking down store shelves to see if I can get enough metal as I have plenty of stone under my little wooden hut. Maybe I'll move into the edge of that town on a 3rd floor brick building and start making a perimeter of just regular concrete and maybe brick while saving my limited wood for log spikes."
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"It might be too much for day 1-2 and maybe 3. But after that it's totally feasible to build in fair amounts over the course of the next couple days. It's a bit slower if you're playing solo.  So let's say I find a building I like with a nice big roof to call home. The first thing I'm going to do is make it so you can't get up there except by ladder that I can block with a frame. I like the ladder to come up through a hole in the roof from the interior of the building - not from the outside. It seems like spiders don't come much early on, although that may be in part due to a lack of campfires\forges. Still, I like to get that wooden ledge up next so I don't get cornholed in the night. Then I build a little basic storage.  What comes next depends on what tools you scavenge. Being stuck with a stone axe or faulty iron pick slows you down big time... but it's all feasible with the iron pick anyway.  I like to get a forge up pretty early on so I can build a crossbow. I really don't like the wooden bow except for fuel for a fire later ;)  After that you're a little clay away from the requisite molds. Then all you have to do is scavenge.  I work on hardening the first floor entrance next (get those doors and windows). They might get through overnight, but not without cost. In the end the only way you'll be getting into my building is with a jump. Since they can't jump really, use this to your advantage.  Anyway, it sounds ambitious but after doing it a few times it seems to actually save on resources versus upgrading incrementally.  As an aside, once you get your roof secure take dirt up there and place it in rows. they don't really collapse like you'd think they would, but you can plant in them. You can even make a big ""bowl"" out of dirt and bring a bucket of water up for a seemingly endless water supply if there isn't a toilet handy. Having a bit of extra food and water immediately available makes it easier to focus on resources."
7daystodie,3az02w,ExplodingJesus,2,Wed Jun 24 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That's really great info. One more question, do you ever build with regular concrete or anything in between wood and reinforced concrete?"
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,2,Wed Jun 24 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"The most common answer is going to be ""no"".   I use Cobblestone, though, because it looks nice and holds up rather well against Cop Spit compared to Wood.   it isn't terribly hard to make, but mining Stone can be a pain in the ass. But at night, there is usually little to do besides mine."
7daystodie,3az02w,InfectedHeisenberg,2,Wed Jun 24 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"Well that saves me a lot of trouble of making a brick base just to see it possibly crumble. I wish you could though because I like the idea of being forced to improvise. I was given almost no wood, but I have loads of clay and metal so I figured the devs had it in mind for me to build bricks and metal sidings.   Man, why do I have to be at work right now?!"
7daystodie,3az02w,Stargos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"Not really. I will build cobblestone or something stone based if I have way too many rocks and not enough iron. But I'd probably try to use them in secondary positions before having a weak spot in my concrete perimeter.  Even with needing rock for gravel for both the cement and concrete mix it still seems like I accrue that faster. That said, I'll try to even it out by going after scrap iron specifically sometimes either from burned out cars, air ducts or whatever it around."

7daystodie,3b0b2x,InfectedHeisenberg,2,Wed Jun 24 23:07:15 2015 UTC,They can stick on sideways?
7daystodie,3b0b2x,InfectedHeisenberg,3,Thu Jun 25 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"For several spots, yes.   I am not 100% positive on how far, but if you place 3 on one side, then 3 on the other and they connect, you can make a bridge. You can't just place them 6 out, or they fall, you have to do a few on each side to get it to work. You have to then run across once to test the stability, but I, right now, have a frame drawbridge that is 6 spaces long. I use one upside down ramp on my support column to add ""strength"", but I don't even know if it does anything lol."

7daystodie,3b0b2x,Rishijheelan,2,Thu Jun 25 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on what is underneath. If it is simply ground and spikes and whatnot, then yes probably not too great. But, from what I understand, if you were to dig underneath where you wanted to place the bridge, you could, in theory, place some trussing or something underground, and that would hold it up; keep it from collapsing. Does not have to be in contact, just directly beneath the blocks, vertically, somewhere down there. But, probably a lot easier to use wood frames than to do all that."
7daystodie,3b0b2x,Dardoleon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:12:42 2015 UTC,Not in every scenario. Rebar works fine for my bridge between 2 concrete structures.

7daystodie,3azih3,Learuis,5,Wed Jun 24 21:10:35 2015 UTC,"Reinforced concrete does take the most damage to destroy, particularly without using the correct tools. While it is fairly expensive per block (0.66 iron ingots, 1 gravel, 0.25 stone/2 small stone, 2 planks) it's definitely worth the cost. The only drawback that it has compared to wood is that once it's damage down you can't repair it all the way back to full durability. However, it does revert to the iron rebar frame just before being fully broken, so from that point you can add more wood and pour fresh concrete mix into it."
7daystodie,3azih3,Stargos,10,Wed Jun 24 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"If you right click a broken concrete block (repair tool won't work anymore) with a bucket of concrete, it will repair to the next stage."

7daystodie,3azih3,gl1tch,2,Thu Jun 25 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"No need for the hole in the center, the rest looks good. Make sure to surround it with another 2 rings of outer spikes and then ramps on the outer most side to stop the zombies attacking your spikes."
7daystodie,3azih3,willhelumplump,2,Thu Jun 25 08:13:30 2015 UTC,"The hole in the center to shoot down is a great idea. Not only does it allow you to kill zombies (and get the XP boost that comes with it!), but it gives you the chance to break up the gore blocks (shotguns break up gore blocks great).  But look out--don't walk on those iron bars right now. They are bugged and you may fall through. Hopefully that will get fixed in A12!  Also, make a lip around the outside edge. Right now you are vulnerable to spider zombies. Just create an overhang with any material you like to prevent them from coming up. I like metal trussing (if it is a small enough span), OR make rebar frames and upgrade them with wood as if you were going to make reinforced concrete blocks, but don't do the last step. You can see through and shoot through these, and can walk on them without falling through!"

7daystodie,3azih3,SecretAgendaMan,2,Thu Jun 25 19:53:42 2015 UTC,I have read that zombies get a damage bonus against wood. I have not tested the blocks head to head so I cannot say for sure.
7daystodie,3azih3,Blaktoe,4,Wed Jun 24 20:54:06 2015 UTC,I've had a really hard time finding forge books in A11 for some reason. I have started 5 games and 4 of those took over 14 in game days to find it. Since I didn't have a choice to make concrete I used the metal siding on fully upgraded wood and it held up really well. I saw your picture of your base. If you put siding all around two high and upgrade all spikes to metal and you'll be invincible.

7daystodie,3azih3,Blaktoe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:13:40 2015 UTC,What is this siding you are talking about? I'm curious
7daystodie,3azih3,Gorian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:49:06 2015 UTC,"Search ""siding"" in your crafting menu and you'll see it. It cost 4 scrap metal but seems worth it."
7daystodie,3azih3,Blaktoe,4,Thu Jun 25 13:20:07 2015 UTC,I've heard that zombies have a x3 multiplier for DMG to wood.  So your scrap metal block is only good for 5-6 hits after the first layer.  The concrete will be good all the way through.
7daystodie,3azih3,TribalDancer,3,Thu Jun 25 00:14:43 2015 UTC,"I'm new too, but I've done some testing by building mini bases and then turning the spawn up so that spider zombies bring a horde down on me. For my limited experience wood is ripped apart like tissue paper unless you upgrade it fully with iron and metal siding helps too; I've heard some say that zombies get a 3X bonus to wood. Once you have that metal on it then it really slows them down to the point that it looks fairly comparable to regular concrete or decayed brick. Reinforced concrete though is really strong which leads me to believe that everything else is comparable to one another and it all just depends on where you start in the game. If you're in the forest you get tons of wood to make this big double enforced structure, if you're in the plains get some clay and make bricks, wasteland has concrete, and if you start in the desert then I guess you dig a hole. Ultimately I think the goal is to eventually get reinforced concrete once you obtain enough resources.  This is all anecdotal so please correct me where I'm wrong."
7daystodie,3azih3,TribalDancer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"Neither is really optimal for a defense.   Wood is wood, it kinda sucks. It is fine because it is cheap an easy to make, but it won't last long - especially against Cop Spit. When I use wood, though, I make two layers.   I tend to use Cobblestone Frames at first. I find the materials easy to find and it holds up well against most attacks. I eventually work towards Rebar Frames (Working Stiffs usually funds my first 2 or 3 stacks) and then use Concrete Mix to fortify it. If you aren't using the best stuff for your ""forever home"", you are kind of just wasting materials.   Long story short, use wood frames to start then switch to Reinforced Concrete."

We ended up splitting off to our respective areas and building.  Turns out, the town the other side took over was in a little valley.  They were trolling us by building a giant ""LOSERS -->"" sign in the ground (so it was visible from the map).  So, one night, I sneaked my way their little town and on the top of the hill, I built a giant cement penis (with a claim block), so that every morning when the sun rose, the shadow of my cock crept across their little town."

7daystodie,3ayzee,deadline_zombie,2,Wed Jun 24 22:27:14 2015 UTC,Do the 7 day hordes keep spawning while you are in the middle? I had a 7 day horde and was shooting and noticed zombies would just drop in front of me. I moved aside out of the direction they were walking and it seemed they stopped spawning.
7daystodie,3ayzee,Dardoleon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"The game seems to spawn a certain amount, bit by bit, and they approach you from the edge of your sight distance. The console said the AI spawned 100 zombies. Seemed like that number was accurate. Thankfully, by the time the last few dozen were arriving it was morning, and they slowed down enough that I felt comfortable getting off my fort and cleaning them up."

Best to approach stealthily from the South-East corner if you don't want to meet more dogs. Alternatively, travel North on Courtland until you're on the Northern border of the Burnt forest, travel East less than 1Km keeping the burnt forest on your right until you see some tents. Dig down a bit between them, you'll find some useful stuff there."
7daystodie,3ayli4,visualmasterj,5,Wed Jun 24 17:39:01 2015 UTC,From my understanding there are no caves in navezgane.  Just dig down and hope for the best if you want Potassium Nitrate

7daystodie,3ay3qu,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Wed Jun 24 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"They have to actually see you, and call in a horde. Like our old base had a bitchin death pit, so they could come and we could hear them outside, but the pit would kill them and that's the end of it.  If we went outside and let them see us, and screech a horde in, then we had fun times. If you kill them fast enough no horde comes either."
7daystodie,3ay3qu,ExplodingJesus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:56:25 2015 UTC,Ok... that's what I was hoping. I'm always high up at night with a spider-proof ledge. So without direct line of sight the larger group won't come (unless we want them to :D ).
7daystodie,3ay3qu,InfectedHeisenberg,2,Wed Jun 24 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"Its heat based.   I know when I played alone I would rarely see them, but my MP with two friends gets them once or twice a day (all the camp fires and forges draw them over)."
7daystodie,3ay3qu,cecilkorik,2,Wed Jun 24 13:43:42 2015 UTC,"One reason you might not have noticed them as much is that they graphically aren't as obvious now that they've redone the graphics for Unity 5. They are not as creepy-thin/spindly as they once were. They've bulked up a bit and don't look as distinct from other zombies. They still exist though, and if you get close enough you can still see their distinctive skin patterns.  I think people might be right that they don't random-spawn anymore though. They seem to mainly show up as scouts for hordes now."
7daystodie,3ay3qu,visualmasterj,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:53:07 2015 UTC,Yea they are still in the game.  Killed one two days ago

7daystodie,3ay3qu,a_little_obscene,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:38:56 2015 UTC,They definitely exist.  I actually didn't see one until around day 10 when our base is pretty well established so I assume its because we were using forges and campfires to cause a lot of heat.

On top of that, picking berries 75% of the time for the first couple hours got old."

The dinosaurs are cool, and there's end game content and a lot of things 7 Days doesn't have.  But I have 100+ hours in the last 3 weeks on 7 Days, and ~5 on ARK.  :shrugs:  Edit:  I think I know what it is.  7 Days to Die takes the brilliance of Minecraft basics (minus ""electricity"", which I hope we see at some point) and adds a challenging (PvE) opponent plus scavenging for loot.  ARK PvE isn't so engaging.  I'm told the PvP is good, but I haven't any experience with that.  So I guess for me, 7 Days reminds me a lot of Minecraft, which I loved at the time.  ARK is something different, but I just can't find the desire to play it that often."

Alcohol distillation is done quite far south, the path to which starts under the blue-tile house seen from below at 10:32.

7daystodie,3asz0u,JamesTalon,3,Tue Jun 23 08:03:40 2015 UTC,Proximity is location based i think.  Would be cool if it was realistic 3D sound taking into account building acoustics! Imagine having to stay within earshot of other players and saying anything too loudly will attract zombies? Would make for interesting gameplay :D
7daystodie,3asz0u,Aeonskye,2,Tue Jun 23 13:06:30 2015 UTC,It would be amazing if they added that but it would use up a lot of gpu power. I saw a video of a guy using Ray tracing in quake to change the acoustics based on his location and he was using a gtx Titan.
7daystodie,3asz0u,Kimano,-1,Tue Jun 23 23:20:24 2015 UTC,Everyone would just get around it with external voice chat though.

They'll wear you down eventually trying to stay one step ahead of them keeping your base in good repair after waves and waves of them. Mostly solo experience though, may have better luck with a friend.   I quit trying to build zed proof strongholds a long time ago and instead I now opt to make cheap multiple defensible (well, as much as possible) wooden outposts all over the map.

7daystodie,3ateia,Frankeh1,2,Tue Jun 23 14:17:27 2015 UTC,you can make a bucket and carry water to where ever you need it. once you tip the water out you can refill it from that water block making short work of filling a moat. You can also make a 1x1 hole in your base floor and dump a bucket of water in it to use as a sink for filling bottles.

Just build frames up from the bottom, then improve the one that sits at the surface.  Once you've got that surface block built, you can then go back and remove all of the ones underwater.  You can then build off of that surface block.  The only thing I don't like is that ladders and water don't play well together.  I always have to use stairs."

If still having problems with them digging you can fill in the walls of the first 2 levels above the spikes with something stronger like Cobblestone, Concrete or reinforced concrete.  I haven't done a long fall mote yet, but I don't really do motes. I just like a few rows of wood log spikes with barred windows to shot through. I shot a respawning 7-day horde for like 8 game hours with nothing but the concrete walls for defense and the most damage done was 2 levels of breakage on one block that i wasn't paying attention to."

7daystodie,3ateia,ExplodingJesus,2,Fri Jul 3 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"They will. I've been digging a one unit deep trench and sinking the first reinforced concrete block into that, then 2 more vertically on top. then one wood on top of that, with another wood hanging out as a ledge to stop the spiders.  Put the big spikes under that and it'll keep em busy for quite some time.   It uses a LOT of resources. But it's a pretty good outer perimeter.  Edit: I also prefer the plains to raised ground. They don't tunnel and you can pick them off with a crossbow from forever away."
7daystodie,3ateia,Blaktoe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty solid start to a fort. However, with only 2 blocks above ground level, or above the point where zombies will stand, they can beat up your zombie lip. Either sink your spikes to ground level or add another level so they can't reach.  Also, if you're not going to go all the way down to rock there's not a lot of use in digging any kind of foundation."
7daystodie,3ateia,ExplodingJesus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"Well technically it's 4 high, with one set in the ground. So 1 in the ground then 2 more concrete with wood on top. So the ledge is 3 up... you're saying I should go one more? They can't reach above the second above ground block I think.  And I'm saying the spikes go on the ground under the ledge so they've on the spikes if they're hitting the wall.  Thinking it through... with the height boost of the spikes I can see how going one higher would help. I'm not sure they'd attack ""up"" so maybe wood or something would suffice still to save on resources. But I do like to overbuild >:)"
7daystodie,3ateia,Blaktoe,2,Tue Jun 23 14:12:55 2015 UTC,There ya go. Have to consider that they are going to stand on that spike. I generally always overbuild by primary defense wall.
7daystodie,3ateia,Ceorl_Lounge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"Moats SEEM like a great idea and if we were fighting humans they'd be brilliant. But I found myself more likely to fall into a moat while clearing out stragglers, hasn't been worth the bother. My group has lately been using rings of spikes around outer walls and reinforced bunkers as firing positions. You can shoot firearms through iron bars and draw zeds away from your main wall. Spacing them out and spreading out the damage gives all your defense time to work (passive and active). Hard/scary part is cleaning the zombie goo off your spikes after you're done!"
7daystodie,3ateia,ZedLorde,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"I just started playing about two weeks ago and my strategy is to build a wall out of road asphalt and sandstone on the outer perimeter, and directly behind that is a spike pit as deep as the wall is tall. I've been playing by myself and have held up inside a gas station in the desert. So far I've survived a horde as big as 60 zed with not much besides a crossbow."

7daystodie,3ateia,Redlotus99,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"I can second most of the posts listed here.  What I have found works so far are two things.   Trenches/Moats - these work well and from my testing I haven't actually seen them fall in the trench/moat except on the occasion push from another zombie, but they never cross the moat especially if it is 2-3+ across. The last one I created was about 28 blocks deep no spikes and very seldom did I have a zombie fall in. Spikes would be ideal if you don't dig it deep enough for the fall to kill them Underground Bases - I have built a few of these and haven't had an issue with zombies whatsoever as they do not dig down.  Make a small hatch to get in and you're pretty set.   I do not use either of these methods anymore and on the server I play on we have about 6 of us that build together and we all agreed not to use either of these as they felt ""cheaty"" even though both aren't...it just removed some of the fun."

One night, running zombies came across my house, some running across without doing anything some bashing their way in on the third night.  I'd like to know what was going on. Was that a ""Wandering Horde ?"" Is that because of the ""Heat system"" ? I was doing all manners of ""Heat"" raising actions in my house (forging, crafting...)  10/10 shat my pants"
7daystodie,3arn2v,joulesFect,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:48:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a wandering group to me. I get one almost every night. Sometimes just a few, sometimes dozens. They run by only stopping to punch something in their way, otherwise they keep moving.   The Heat response will be a handful of screechy Spider Zombies (the sound they make is chilling, especially knowing they're advance scouts for a zombie army) checking the area out where they detected the activity. I had a group arrive only to begin punching the ground above where my forges are. If they detect you (Hunted), they'll call in a horde which will include dogs (I hate them so much) and fat, toxic-vomit spewing cop-zombies. That toxic vomit will screw up anything wood with ease, and partially deteriorate anything stronger."

7daystodie,3as0ml,MoarPye,3,Tue Jun 23 01:16:28 2015 UTC,Time in crafting isn't fun. It's an mmo convention which is a literal time sink / money maker for them. No reason at all to bring it to a non-sub game.  Your other ideas are good.
7daystodie,3as0ml,CaptSquarepants,5,Tue Jun 23 05:19:00 2015 UTC,"Isn't that kind of the point of a survival crafting game though, to balance time with productivity?... And crafting in 7DTD is already timed, in a set-and-forget kind of way which I'm not exactly fond of but which isn't incompatible with my idea."

A great game is fun and allows for a wide range of expression in the environment without being tedious."
7daystodie,3as0ml,zdss,2,Tue Jun 23 06:50:57 2015 UTC,"How do you have ""beat the clock"" challenge in a multiplayer game without things taking actual time?"
7daystodie,3as0ml,CaptSquarepants,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:00:11 2015 UTC,"The fun way is to have your actions be what is taking time - not an abstraction which locks you down.

7daystodie,3as0ml,ChrisWorstMedicEver,2,Tue Jun 23 21:06:46 2015 UTC,No thanks. This seems like a potential mod which would be nice for servers but for individual players it creates a complexity to it which is unnecessary. The game already requires a decent amount of time looking at the wiki to figure it out and adding this would just be another level of complexity. Would be neat for veteran players though.
7daystodie,3as0ml,SirNanigans,2,Tue Jun 23 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"I like these ideas, and they fall in line with some ideas I shared in a similar post. If I may, I would like to offer some ideas to expand on yours.   I like the idea of broad skills and specialization. I think that what could be better is if each level offered a classic RPG ""skill point"". This skill point is put into metallurgy, carpentry, or masonry at the player's discretion. The benefit of the skill point would be singular: the increased experience gain in skills of this category.   The specialized skills would improve independently from one's level and the use of the skill is what improves it. In this way, a player who has invested in metallurgy but spent his time making gun parts will find making axes to be a quick learning experience, but not without the learning still.  This is a lot like Skyrim skills but with character skill points replacing the stones that offer skill experience buffs.  Time may be better included by decreasing time to make an item with skill level. Your idea to allow players to take more time is alright, but players are impatient and that's the biggest flaw. To achieve the same effect, you can set the baseline slower and allow people to speed up certain crafts. In this way, players still have to choose between inferior quantities of odd things or superior quantities of their specialty.   While this replaces the quality choice with quantity, it should offer the same kind of strategic challenge. Also, when it comes to things that take a very long time at their baseline, a player not specialized for this craft may find it to be a dangerous investment of time and possibly unable to be completed.   I like the rest of your ideas the way they are. I feel like my points on these two might help to make them fit more naturally into a Crafting/RPG setting."

7daystodie,3as0ml,Blaktoe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:21:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair I don't think this is particularly realistic. It's much more like a set of nested rock-paper-scissors... The only element of 'realism' is in the philosophy that each individual player shouldn't be able to do everything equally well. A lone survivor should be encouraged to be more of a jack-of-all-trades, while a group of survivors should be encouraged to develop specialty skills."

This was also back when all zombies on the map made a b-line for you at night so it was pretty intense.

Anyone know if its possible to go back farther?   2Edit: This is helpful when playing online when theres a patch. If your server doesnt update and you get the auto update it locks you out. You can then go back to the previous version with the steam options and keep playing till your server updates. Sometimes with the little patches it wont wipe the progress."

7daystodie,3aqldq,BlaineTog,8,Mon Jun 22 18:33:10 2015 UTC,The server list also shows the options for said server. It will say PvE or PvP or no base raiding etc. Also when you join some of the servers have a message of the day explaining the rules of the server. The point being don't just jump in and start killing or raiding without knowing that server's rules (regardless if they are private or public).
7daystodie,3aqldq,open6l,4,Mon Jun 22 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I have no interest in griefing (or PvP -- dealing with zombies is tough enough, tyvm), I just wasn't sure what the community etiquette was in this situation.  Thanks!"
7daystodie,3aqldq,TribalDancer,3,Mon Jun 22 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"What I would say is this: some people start MP's not thinking to lock them down in any way. I was one of those, who started a local game to invite my husband to play, but a couple times we had random people pop in.  Now, most of the time those people popping in mean no harm, and are like you and just jump in. But some are hackers who are hoping to make a mess of your game. So if you are HOSTING a game, haven't locked it down (or have and no one else is supposed to be there!), and an unfamiliar name pops in, CLOSE YOUR GAME IMMEDIATELY before they have time to port to your location and kill you or plant TNT all over your base. Lock it down with a password and start again.  So OP, if you join a game, it isn't obvious that it was intentionally public, and then suddenly get kicked, this may be why--you logged into an unintentionally public server. When you log in, look for evidence that it is intentionally public before investing any time or resources in the game. Make sense?"
7daystodie,3aqldq,Maulgrump,5,Tue Jun 23 03:02:09 2015 UTC,Well they do have the option of making it private and not showing up on the browser. So... go ahead?

7daystodie,3aq0u6,OnceIthought,3,Mon Jun 22 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"No word on that yet. It's a mechanic they added to the game and may simply be obsolete. Previously dismantling a weapon would only let you take one part from it and the rest would be lost, but with the current system allowing you to recover all parts there's not quite as much of a need.  This could be a case of old mechanics having a use in a new system, though. Locking the ability to forge the parts behind a rare book could add depth to the game down the line. That way, eventually, a character could reliably forge pretty good weapons. Just more possibilities that come from legacy mechanics being left in the code."
7daystodie,3aq0u6,Arik_De_Frasia,2,Mon Jun 22 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute, I took a break through pretty much all of A10, so you're saying you can't make molds of weapon parts anymore? And I'm supposed to be able to take all parts of a dismantled weapon out of the crafting grid?  Because I don't think I've tried with a weapon yet, but when I dismantle a bullet it still only lets me keep one part."
7daystodie,3aq0u6,PwntIndustries,7,Mon Jun 22 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Bullets are still affected by the 1 part limitation. Molds were removed due to the quality system implementation. Since crafting quality is determined by player level, they would have had to rework the weapon molds, as the items they produce are not directly crafted by a player. One work-around would be to add weapon part molds and have them be affected by quality.  The easier fix was to remove the molds and make weapon parts more commonly found. It's actually fairly fun to find a better part for one of your guns, and be able to swap it in on the fly."

7daystodie,3aq0u6,PwntIndustries,5,Tue Jun 23 00:02:32 2015 UTC,"Shotgun Messiah's are good for the odd sniper parts. I tend to find them more in air drops. A friend of mine was extremely lucky and found a full sniper rifle in the munitions cache in a police station.  A few of the overlooked spots are barns. Some of them have secret hatches under the hay bale piles that lead to weapons bunkers that usually have 2 munitions caches, 2 shotgun messiah boxes and a few other random assorted containers (lockers and cabinets, if I remember correctly.) The other is exclusively in the wastelands, (I haven't seen a village variation like this in previous patches, so I'm not sure if this was a behind the scenes tweak with 11.6) the ""ruined villages"" where all thats left are building corners. You're looking for the buildings that have the gun safe sitting on the edge of the 2nd floor. Most people tend to overlook the shotgun messiah crate up on the 3rd floor. Carry a stack of like 10 wood frames, and you can easily get up to both floors."
7daystodie,3aq0u6,TheFlyingDharma,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:31:44 2015 UTC,"Ran to the gun store. Tried to be sneaky. Failed. Turned into a gun fight. However, every other place my wife and I travel, eventually we kill everyone and it goes quiet. This didn't happen there. I went through several hundred rounds of ammunition, killing many zombies, but more always arrived. Why is that?"
7daystodie,3aq0u6,rhaikh,2,Tue Jun 23 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"Using ammo (among other things) generates noise, or ""heat"". When you're in a small area like a gun store, and theres already a fair number of zombies in the area, each shot adds a set percentage (I believe it's 8% per shot, but I could be mistaken) to the heat map.  Now heres where my knowledge of it gets a little murky. Using forges/campfires will generate heat for each unit of fuel they consume, when the percentage reaches 100%, scouts are dispatched to search the area, but no additional zombies were spawned around the base. Where as I've gone into POI villages with a shotgun, and blown away every zombie that dared show their face, and the only thing that happens is more end up spawning, but  to this day, I've never received an ""incoming scouts"" notification when discharging ridiculous amounts of ammunition in a village.  The other factor that comes into play in all this, is server type. If you're on a private server where it's just you and the wife, all this noise will continually spawn additional zombies. The INI file that you can edit for servers has a zombie limit, so if it was set to a max of 80, you could have up to 80 zombies on the map at any given time.  So combining the quick, efficient killing of zombies with your guns actually ends up working against you, as the constant noise is causing more to spawn, and as they die, it opens up more of the max 80 spawns to keep them coming. Switching to more silent modes of killing such as the bow/crossbow/clubs will allow for the heat generated by all the noise to eventually die down.  Where as I play on a multiplayer server that generally has around 23-24 people on it during prime time, and an average of around 15 usually. Due to all those people being on, the server then has to sort of split the spawns among the players, which results in seemingly less zombies spawning in a general vicinity. So I could go into a nearby village, guns blazing, and if someone, somewhere else does the same, the spawning in my area will begin to eventually decrease, rather than creating a near infinite zombie spawn loop, regardless of how many I kill using ammunition."

7daystodie,3ap5pt,TribalDancer,3,Mon Jun 22 14:38:38 2015 UTC,I'll be happy to see the minibike for putzing around. But like pretty much every zombie tv show\movie\game all I really want is a bicycle.
7daystodie,3ap5pt,SkoobyDoo,2,Mon Jun 22 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, give them tradeoffs.   Bicycle: free to power, but only marginally faster than walking, and uses stamina. Minibike: takes gas, attracts zombies like flies to crap. Motorcycle: more gas and oil, super fast, but horde incoming!"
7daystodie,3ap5pt,bobdylan401,2,Mon Jun 22 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"No, I get it. Some people want far more depth than an incremental update might offer. That's fair to say. Not like them playing or not affects US playing or not, so it's all good."
7daystodie,3ap5pt,bobdylan401,2,Mon Jun 22 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"snow capped mountains and weather don't promise to be real game changing even if they do add a lot to the atmosphere (badum-tish) but the motorbike does promise to enable a definitively different playstyle, especially if it has an inventory (not sure if it will)"
7daystodie,3ap5pt,Pointless_arguments,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:13:55 2015 UTC,I think it does have an inventory
7daystodie,3ap5pt,bobdylan401,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:17:28 2015 UTC,you can craft a basket and attach it to the bike so yea it will have inventory.
7daystodie,3ap5pt,InfectedHeisenberg,2,Tue Jun 23 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"that is like exactly what they are doing, and more…Each of the last patches has offered exponentially more prefabs (nice ones too) including little villages of varying sizes in different biomes. This next patch which will include random gen 3 should include more as well. My only problem is the difficulty. I haven't figured it out yet. So far the only way I can start a server is just by skirting around prefabs, sticking to green biomes and looting through trash until I have enough bone shivs to actually start looting a town. But I still usually die at that point anyways. I feel like a complete noob again thats why I haven't really been playing but after this next patch I am going to try again and refuse to give up."

7daystodie,3aomyz,knowsnofear,2,Mon Jun 22 06:11:18 2015 UTC,"You mine for coal, lead, potassium nitrate, and iron from caves you have to find. If you look on the map they are the dark/black dots on the map and tend to be near water or roads.  Brass is from what you find in the cars/houses/zombies, can find lead and iron the same way.   If you see buildings with the metal shelves you can break those for a ton of scrap metal that turns into iron"
7daystodie,3aomyz,trisity,3,Mon Jun 22 06:18:12 2015 UTC,"Just to expand a little:  In caves there's almost always some mineral adjacent to gravel veins, so use a shovel on gravel and follow it. Also, you need gravel for concrete, so it may be worth keeping.  If a house has brass lights at the door, it'll have brass lights inside too."
7daystodie,3aomyz,Thepher,2,Mon Jun 22 07:01:55 2015 UTC,I think breaking metal shelves is the easiest way to get into metal production.   Once I find the forge book I typically have enough metal scrap from cans and such to make a pickaxe.  Once I have that I find a store with tons of shelves and smash as many as I can. That gives me enough scrap iron to build the basics until I can find a mine.

7daystodie,3aomyz,FlatusGiganticus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:44:19 2015 UTC,2nd this. It's a really easy way to get your iron works started up. Can easily get enough to make an axe and a pick and it breaks up fairly easy.
7daystodie,3aomyz,Blaktoe,2,Mon Jun 22 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"Hehe, day 3 you say? Wait for day 6 and 7 then you will know what to do ;)  Remember everything in the game is destructible and/or salvagable.  happy constructing :)"
7daystodie,3aomyz,MCRoadkill,2,Mon Jun 22 10:36:13 2015 UTC,"Before you can go spelunking in caves, you need the basics.   Get a Forge Book first. This requires looting Zombies or Bookshelves in POI's. Garbage piles can also drop them.   Second, break rocks with your Stone Axe (zzzz slow but it works) to get Iron Fragments. It sucks, but it will be enough to melt down into tools. I think light fixtures that aren't brass drops fragments as well.   Once you have a Fire Axe and an Iron Pick Axe, you can start spelunking for actual ore, like Iron, Lead, Potassium, and Coal.   Iron is black and sounds like metal when you hit it. Coal is softer, but also black. It is more rare than Iron, but incredibly useful. Potassium can be found as white ore, or you can break the stalagmites for some. Lead is blue-ish.   But the Forge Book is key. I know you can find a Forge Book in some Cabin POI's, but the odds are much lower of finding that Cabin than you finding the book."
7daystodie,3aomyz,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:28:58 2015 UTC,Go look for ores in those holes. Fall in and die. My experience so far.    You can also get some iron from smashing those large stones on the surface. They drop small stones and ... iron something (not ores)
7daystodie,3aomyz,MrGamu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:44:40 2015 UTC,"Iron fragments, and they're so not worth getting. They don't actually have a lot of iron in them."
7daystodie,3aomyz,FurryFredChunks,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"I would just go scavenging until you find some decent tools and the books you need for guns and the forge. Once you have an axe and a pickaxe, you can go looking for a cave and start mining for future building materials."

Remember that cars often have tools in them, so you may be able to loot an upgrade to your tools before you can even make them."
7daystodie,3aos41,SpaceTimeBadass,2,Mon Jun 22 07:22:08 2015 UTC,"Claim health set to 0 makes all the blocks in the claim area have infinite durability to other non-friended players.  This includes the claim block itself.  Any other number multiplies the durability of blocks by that amount.  Health settings under about 15 make the average base relatively easy to raid if the block can easily be found, however people are relentless at any setting so your best defense is keeping your base well hidden."

7daystodie,3aos41,snowdogJJJ,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"there is no security to claim blocks as far as I can tell.  It just makes them stronger and take longer to break in ( to my and my users disappointment) there are a few add-ons that can give you the protection you are looking for I think the 7d2d reddit server runs it but I cant remember, I have not been playing much since it is end of v11 cycle (I am waiting on v12 now).    I went with a white list due to Asian breaking into everyone houses, it just got old.  I wish dev's would add something for that but as you will hear (to many times here) it is alpha and that is the catch all excuse, and for most arguments about features, its  a good one.  Best if luck to ya"
7daystodie,3aos41,Blaktoe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:18:53 2015 UTC,"Hm, I guess it kind of makes sense in a way, we couldn't very well place a block in real life and expect to be safe, then again we can't really log out of life. At least it makes them harder to break. But now it's probably going to take me even longer to get to the chests I've hidden in the walls xD"

7daystodie,3am1hj,slrrp,13,Sun Jun 21 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"This is a great game, although it may not run so well on a crappy laptop. The issue is that each major patch requires you to restart from scratch, which means that as soon we get wind that a new release is pending (A12 is ordained to arrive sometime in the next couple of weeks) most of us stop playing as any progress we make will be lost."
7daystodie,3am1hj,giltirn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"This is a great game, although it may not run so well on a crappy laptop.   This. The engine got upgraded recently and the performance was dismal even on premium hardware. They probably optimized it somewhat, but I would not expect it to be playable on an average (non-gaming) laptop.  Update: disregard please. Just tested it again and it runs smooth as silk. Whatever optimizations they did had a great effect."

It is an actual Zombie Survival game with an amazing amount of depth. There is always something new to try, experiment with, or alternative ways to play.   Amazing game that keeps getting better."
7daystodie,3am1hj,InfectedHeisenberg,2,Sun Jun 21 18:45:25 2015 UTC,The game knows what it is and what it wants to be.   Zombie apocalypse Minecraft. Hooray!

It's brilliant how the devs have made role playing survival a higher priority then pvp. There have been rumors for ages of np  and maybe quests in the future."
7daystodie,3am1hj,bobdylan401,3,Sun Jun 21 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"This game is alot more fun than I expected. I have had it for about a year now, and have ~200 hours playing it, about 1/2 that as just a single player, not even on a public server.   Like any game most public servers can have a few hackers. You can play on your own server though, just you & you friend if you want.  Even though it is still in alpha, the devs regularly pump out new content/changes/updates. The community is fairly large & active, as seen here and on steam. This is by no means an abandoned game. Things do tend to slow a bit as a major update nears (because that means a server wipe generally).  I'd say get it, you'll definitely get your 9.99 out of it."
7daystodie,3am1hj,JD-73,3,Sun Jun 21 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Very much worth it, yes.   Lots of people play on private servers, there's a big patch in the works with lots of new features coming we're all anticipating, and the only -major- bug right now is that the 7-day feral hordes usually fail to appear.   But there are still plenty of zombies to deal with.  Unless you seal yourself into a super-fortress marvel-of-engineering even other humans would have a hard time getting into, and declare yourself -bored-.   Then you only have yourself to blame."
7daystodie,3am1hj,elt,2,Sun Jun 21 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"Next patch should probably bring back the most life and I'm guessing it won't die off as quick or be majorly updated/wiped as quick. I feel that the devs are really trying to get us this motorbike and as much content as they can as quick as possible. They are pushing for by the end of the month! Where all of the other alphas have failed 7d2d devs have so far overcame the obstacles. The random gen is really getting quite lovely and at good frame rates (in loaded chunks at least.) Also the depth of the gameplay is spot on imo, it is in no way casual hold your hand, but it's also not so cutthroat hardcore, leading to much more creative and fun servers, even/especially pvp ones."
7daystodie,3am1hj,bobdylan401,2,Sun Jun 21 21:59:13 2015 UTC,Yeah this will do
7daystodie,3am1hj,Defttone,2,Mon Jun 22 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"This isn't a game that is 'populated'. It's not an mmo.  There are no centrally run servers.  It's a fun game.  Servers are run by players.  If you want to play, start a server and invite your friend.  Or take your chances that one of the public servers will still be there when you want to play.   Often a player run server disappears when the admin stops playing."
7daystodie,3am1hj,JDogg126,2,Mon Jun 22 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"Things have slowed down at the moment while most people wait for A12.

It's worth it, of course, but as with any early access game the level of activity rises and falls between updates."

I was immediately immersed into the world when I first loaded in. Since then, more and more depth has been added to the game by a very cool dev team that communicates a lot with their players on the forums and posts blogs showcasing upcoming enhancements. But most importantly, they love playing their game, and are passionate about achieving their vision.  Right now I'm waiting for the release of A12 to start playing again."

7daystodie,3am1hj,xblindguardianx,2,Fri Jun 26 09:03:29 2015 UTC,I feel like it has been in alpha forever.  I expected bugs. But not something that completely resets the game Every 2 weeks.

7daystodie,3alzs7,SnawBoard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:05:21 2015 UTC,Some one already said ask for server rules as soon as you log into a server. This is a very important thing to do. also if youre going to build make sure you do so very far from the spawn. i'd say minimum 10 biomes away if not more. Even if the server rules state no looting/griefing. people will still do it and it happens more near spawn.

I found lots of nice people even on PvP and there is occasional trading and shelter given but at the same time there are people who will kill you on sight on steal all your gear and completely raid your base if its not hidden well enough."

7daystodie,3alzs7,Hloden,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"There are really 3 types of servers:  PvE:  Killing each other is discouraged/bannable, really COOP  PvP, no raid:  PvP is allowed (can shoot other players), but generally raiding bases is limited, particularly griefing.  PvP, full:  Anything goes  For any of the PvP modes, it's generally shoot on sight in my experience.  Many weapons are one-shot, one-kill, and there aren't good ways to identify others, so unless you are in a pretty secure position, most people aren't going to risk not shooting first."
7daystodie,3amkb8,partisan98,3,Sun Jun 21 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"Dying in single player isnt bad, you keep ur xp and ur stuff is in a backpack where u died (depending on how u have it set up). Multiplayer depenplayerthe server. Zeds hit whats in the way and sleeping bags, there is a very low chance they attack your base while you are away. (Just dont leave any fires on)"
7daystodie,3amkb8,Defttone,2,Mon Jun 22 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"1 : If you die you will re-spawn one of two ways.      a) At a random location within a pre-defined spawn zone (this zone is rather large)      b) At a sleeping bag or bed you have place in the world.  Once you place it on the ground it becomes your spawn point.  2 : Yes but with a potential no.  Your destroyed base will stay where it is, with all the damage caused by the horde.  So if you build storage containers and keep your items in them, it will all be there for when you come back.  However if the horde destroys the containers, you are out of luck for what was in it."
7daystodie,3amkb8,FelixMortane,3,Sun Jun 21 18:33:02 2015 UTC,So do the hordes attack the chests or only if you try and hide behind them?
7daystodie,3amkb8,SilentNN,4,Sun Jun 21 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"They don't go out of their way to destroy storage, but they will attack things that get in the way of where they're going. So if they sense you and a chest is between you and zombies, they might decide to attack the chest. They're also attracted to certain activities like an ongoing campfire or forge, but will of course prioritize players if they can sense them."

Some people whome have good specs still have problems with the game being heavy. A friend of mine still has a dual core processor and an low end videocard and is able to run the game (with some lag every now and then). Just try to put all the settings on low and make sure you have enough free ram (sometimes the game uses almost all my 9gb ram).

Also note, press R/Take all, when you search a zombie dog. For some reason not doing it also caused the same glitch for me and my friends.

7daystodie,3aizxg,drussinator,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"I had this same problem until I saw someone using the shift+click in a youtube video, was a huuuuuuge improvement to my crafting. Also the ctrl+right-click on the item name allowing you to add a certain number to an item to be crafted, as well as ctrl+right-click on the item in your inventory to half it.  Also being able to search the list, I feel, makes up for the flaws in the current system."
7daystodie,3aizxg,rezanow,2,Fri Jun 26 09:54:24 2015 UTC,"You don't need to hold Ctrl, just right click and it halves in your inventory.  If the name of the item in question is in green (meaning you've crafted it at least once), you can just click on it however many times you need to get however many you want. You can also shift+click it to craft as many as you possibly can, given your current inventory.   You can shift+click to move a stack from a chest to your inventory. You can also shift+click to move it from your inventory to your toolbelt. Shift+Right click will move a single item from your chest to your inventory (and stack with an existing item, if available). Repeat for toolbelt. Shift+click is my favorite thing, but what is really frustrating is that it doesn't work in reverse. I want to be able to shift click to put things back into a chest, as well as take them out.   Although, anything right click related is going to change in A12.   Being able to search is very nice, and I agree, it makes up for flaws in the organization of the crafting UI. However, not knowing if a certain character has read a certain book is frustrating. For example, how do I know if I have read the Pistols book? I broke apart a perfectly working pistol to upgrade a part and found I couldn't put it back together again. =("

About entity damage, from my personal experiences, any melee weapon with the blunt trauma perk is typically the best at taking out zombies (Spiked Club and Sledgehammer are two of the best for this), personally though I find the Spiked Club better because it doesn't use as much stamina as the sledgehammer. Headshots of any kind do more damage than bodyshots albeit from melee or guns. That is really all the info I got from my playtime and experimentation. Hope it helped."

Everyone wants to be less obvious though, so I imagine some good trees to balance out would be good. Weapon/character skills maybe.

There is an endurance skill that i think i would like, you could sprint  for longer/ stamina would be used up at a slower rate... but again the wellness level kind of mimics that, however it decreases every time you die... and any time you think of a skill, it's something permanent."

I would use the old World of Warcraft Skill Tree (Three disciplines, with ascending skill trees, but you can ""dual spec"" in a way but never become a master if you chose this method).   The three trees would be:   Crafting, Combat, and Scavenging.   Crafting would allow you to improve your chances at making better quality items (or even bonus High Quality items with bonuses to damage, defense, etc.), allow more yield from crafted items (instead of a wood plank granting 4 sticks it would grant 5, 6, etc. based on skill), and probably faster crafting times or upgrade times (Stone Axes work like Repair tools, etc). The Crafting Role would allow people who build bases and defenses to be better at it and support the team through this method.   The Combat tree would obviously improve combat skills. Better defenses and damage modifiers, lessen the decay of weapons and items, improvements to ammo crafting, or allow for specialized ammo to be made (like fire arrows or piercing bullets). You could also allow for bonuses to crafting, like letting them attach flash lights or hunting knives to guns for melee attacks.   The final tree would be Scavenging. It would increase wellness, stamina, health, and the hydration/fullness bars, double wellness increases (or via a %), increase run speeds and jump heights, and raise the drop rate of items or loot value. It would also enable side-packs or larger backpacks so they can carry more.   Each tree would give people an identity. From the fighters and defenders to the loot runners to the builders, people can improve what they like. Nobody is locked out of anything (outside of specialized talents like crafting flame arrows or something), but people can be better at certain things.   I think the best thing would be to allow talent trees like this, but let the leveling system increase each talent by a small % or milestone. It would give leveling something else to assist with besides being a crafting gate."

Crafting, to craft more items and potentially skip ingredients.  Hunting, to track animals and obtain more loot from skinning.  Scavenging (includes lock picking) would help you find more supplies from the land.  Architecture, helps you build better houses that dont fall victim to gravity and may potentially offer more upgrades (i.e. steel lined reinforced concrete).

I wouldn't mind being able to mine faster, or reload faster, for example. Either of those could be based on overall level, or on successful use of the item (the more you use the weapon/tool successfully, the better you get at it).

For all these things, why must they be entirely static, identical between every character and never changing throughout a character's life?  Take running speed as an example. Unless you want to turn running into more than just holding W, why should all characters run at the exact same speed, and never get better at it?  Or hit damage with melee weapons. Unless you want swinging a weapon to be more than clicking the mouse, why should all characters swing it with the exact same amount of force and with the same technique, dealing the same damage as every other character?"

I just didn't want to ruin a concise argumentative post by being open to discussion. ;-)  Disclaimer, Mount and Blade Warband is one of my favorite games of all time.  Everything in that game is dictated by simple numbers that you can improve over time and it gives a great feeling of progression that's reflected in the game mechanics.  Your athletic score dictates how fast you can run, your renown score dictates how many soldiers will follow you, your weapon skill how fast you can swing your weapon.  I think their melee and archery combat system is a great model for a survival RPG.  I feel skill talent trees go beyond that though and instead become arbitrary gamey systems that take the player out of the game environment.    DING!    You leveled up and now you have a talent point to spend.  If you're a min/maxing player, now you need to research where best to spend this point.  How does it affect your progression in the immediate future or should you be planning for an end game state?  Are you able to respec your talent points or is this decision even more paramount because it's final?    None of these considerations have anything to do with playing the game.  You're playing a meta game of numbers instead.  I think that's lazy design when they're perfectly able to keep the progression restricted to the game world."

The only point I made is that you can't represent everything you do in the game with mechanics that a player can become skilled at performing.  You say the player should care more about what they're running from than the running itself, but I don't think I said anything implying that I disagree with that. Introducing some dynamics into the static elements of the game doesn't have to make them important to the player. It's a subtle enhancement to the gameplay.

Place blocks in and around your work area all the way up to the surface, then remove the interior blocks. Make sure you leave a ""wall"" around you other wise the water will flood back in.  I know cause I built a few ""middle of the lake"" bases.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=464711861"
7daystodie,3afq7u,dmanwithnoname,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:54:50 2015 UTC,Thanks. One of my friends made a lake base in A9 and I never really got into the details of how he emptied out the basement.
7daystodie,3afq7u,dmanwithnoname,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:02:41 2015 UTC,I built a ton of lake bases when I figured it out. But then it got to be so much work and no one ever came to visit. :(
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"Do wood and rebar frames displace water? I would think they wouldn't, but with the block physics it's hard to say for sure without doing it."
7daystodie,3afq7u,dmanwithnoname,2,Fri Jun 19 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. Any block. Sand, wood, rebar, stone, etc. I am sure you could probably even use the couches or potted plants, but I've never tried.   I think it's just a matter of an item filling up the space instead of the water. When you remove the item the water doesn't remember it was there, hence it stays empty.   Fun trick. You don't even have to completely get rid of the water. If you are fast enough, you can place a couple blocks in front of you, then start digging, and when you need air, remove the blocks and run into the space. You will have a few moments of air supply till the water fills back up.   You get diarrhea though eventually."
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Wait, does that mean you get dysentery just from being in the water too long?  New plan on the mining though: Forget the dirt/sand/clay filler, wood frames take much less effort. Might still do the stone cover/chimney, though. Seems more sturdy and I like the aesthetic."
7daystodie,3afq7u,dmanwithnoname,2,Fri Jun 19 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think you get it from ""drowning"" too often."
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,2,Fri Jun 19 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, that would make sense. You're inhaling water that could make you sick from drinking it."
7daystodie,3afq7u,TheFlyingDharma,2,Fri Jun 19 21:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. Try building a bridge with supports, it looks either terrible or magically hydrophobic."
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:34:04 2015 UTC,"Hopefully someone who's actually done it will chime in, but here's what I'd try, though it would take some time depending on how deep the water is.  Cover most of the visible deposit with two blocks worth of stone, except for an area bout 2x2 blocks. Build a chimney straight up with the stone to just above the surface of the water. The wall of the chimney could be only one block thick, but I'd probably make it two if I could. Make sure it doesn't have any holes. Fill the chimney with dirt, sand or clay until all water is displaced, then it out. This should prevent you from cracking through the stone and flooding your work. Make sure you have wood frames or ladders to get out. Once you've cleared all the filler the deposit should be revealed and you can mine as usual. The two layers of stone should keep the water from collapsing the cavern you make, just make sure you don't mine anything but the ore."
7daystodie,3afq7u,Ne0r15s,3,Fri Jun 19 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"So the gist seems to be... cover the vein completely (to the waters surface) then selectively remove that material until you can mine the vein. Makes sense, beats hauling the water with a bucket."
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,2,Fri Jun 19 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"you could just place a 3 block cube using wooden frames, remove 2 blocks in the center to let yourself in(not the ceiling), then the 2 center blocks, again, not the ceiling).  Replace the 2 blocks from the outside wall to plug the hole(or use a door).  [][][]  -  [][][] [][][]  -  []...[] [][][] -   []...[] You now have a hollow waterproof cube to mine from."
7daystodie,3afq7u,TribalDancer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:03:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I only added the detail because I think it would be the most efficient method, but how you do it is really up to you. You could also mine down beside the water and under the bottom, but keeping track of where you are and how deep you need to mine can be a pain."
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"This, only I would do it with wood frames. They can simply be picked up if you place one by accident, and upgraded if you decide to make a permanent mineshaft. Use those same frames to fill in the middle and you can take them away easily without wearing down your shovel or stamina by digging dirt out.   Bring along some ladders to put down so you can get up and down the shaft, then mine away!"
7daystodie,3afq7u,TribalDancer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure about the wood frames thing until /u/dmanwithnoname said they displace water too. Good advice, and yet another reason to keep a stack of them with you when mining."
7daystodie,3afq7u,OnceIthought,2,Fri Jun 19 22:51:35 2015 UTC,"Hell, I keep a stack of them with me all the time. I use them for tons of stuff, not the least of which a common glitch I experience where if I jump to climb a ladder missing the bottom rung and miss, it will be unclimbable with a jump. I have to put down a wood frame, hop on it, and then climb the ladder sans jump. Weird right?"
7daystodie,3afq7u,Van_Tek,2,Fri Jun 19 23:07:42 2015 UTC,I get a slightly lesser version of this. I can still climb the ladder with a jump but I have to be in juuuuust the right spot. So I usually hop around looking up the ladder sliding back and forth on the wall a few times until it grabs.

7daystodie,3afq7u,TheHiddenYouTuber,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"Take a bunch of wooden frames and build a solid cube of them over the area.  Then pick up the frames in the middle of the cube, leaving you with a hollow box devoid of water.    The wooden frames displace the water (despite not looking very watertight :D) and will destroy any 'block' of water that previously resided there.  You can do this with any solid block, but I prefer frames because you can just pick them back up again."
7daystodie,3afq7u,Maulgrump,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"All I know is to either remove the water or find another vein of ore. I don't think you can mine underwater, please correct me if I am wrong, all the other times I've tried to do so I had no luck."
7daystodie,3afq7u,TheHiddenYouTuber,2,Sat Jun 20 02:09:42 2015 UTC,You can definitely mine underwater. Sometimes getting the correct angle is tricky.

7daystodie,3af792,rezanow,5,Fri Jun 19 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"I can answer a few of these for you, not the most experienced player though so I may be wrong on some of them...   It alters how much damage a zombie can do to you and how much it can take before it dies. Horde time is not affected. The reason the hordes are appearing at random times/not at all is because of a bug in the current version. It should be fixed with the next update I believe. The no-spawn radius is bedrock to sky, so no, they shouldn't spawn below you. I think only solid blocks affect sight, they can still sense you even through walls if you make noise though. Being still doesn't stop you being seen, it may stop you being sensed though... This I don't know, I think it makes you easier to be seen. I usually kill my lights if I am sneaking so I have no experience with this...   5a. Heat map. Everything you do that involves loud noises (Construction, Gun fire, Power tools) or light (Campfires, Forges) adds to the heat map of an area, when the heat map gets high enough, Spider Zombies will come and check out the area. If they find you they will call a horde on you. That is probably what caused your horde on day 16. General rule of thumb, do your smelting away from your base unless you can handle the hordes that will come for you.  5b. Loot every gun, even broken ones. They may have a good part in them...  5c. Clear Gore Blocks from your defenses. Nothing is scarier than a horde walking over their own dead brethren and into your base. You can shoot them if you can't leave your base at the moment.  I hope this helps..."
7daystodie,3af792,dangerous_b,3,Fri Jun 19 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Regarding the gun thing: You can disassemble them, or even just check their parts by putting them in the output slot in your craft menu. The ammo in them will be dropped into your inventory if you have free space, or on the ground if you don't (make space before disassembling). A junk gun might have a purple part worth keeping.  Took me a little while to realize you could put certain items there for dismantling."
7daystodie,3af792,OnceIthought,3,Fri Jun 19 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, should have clarified. Thanks for pointing that out..."
7daystodie,3af792,dangerous_b,4,Fri Jun 19 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"Most people probably figure it out faster than I did, but for us special short-bus types it's handy info."
7daystodie,3af792,OnceIthought,3,Fri Jun 19 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"If I may tack on as well, DO NOT disassemble a gun you can use until you have the book to reassemble it. I have heard many a lament of people who forgot they didn't know how to make, say, a shotgun, but went and put a shotgun in the output slot to get out parts and bullets and went ""D'oh!"" because they couldn't put one together again!"
7daystodie,3af792,TribalDancer,3,Fri Jun 19 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"Very good advice. You can even still put it in the output slot to see what the parts quality is, but as soon as you move one of those parts you've disassembled it and can't reassemble it if you haven't found the right book."
7daystodie,3af792,OnceIthought,2,Fri Jun 19 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I wasn't paying attention on a new game. Assumed I had read the book (after looting the book store). Looked at the parts of a pistol, swapped out a better part, and then clicked Craft... and watched as it all turned into scrap."

7daystodie,3af792,dangerous_b,5,Fri Jun 19 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"More than one of yours won't count, somebody else's will..."
7daystodie,3af792,OnceIthought,3,Fri Jun 19 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"Adding to what /u/dangerous_b said. Only the last sleeping bag you place will count as your spawn point, including the exclusion zone it provides. If you are playing with multiple people having everyone place theirs in a different area of the base can give it a good buffer zone, and ensure you don't get spawns in a larger base."

7daystodie,3af792,UnremarkablyWeird,4,Fri Jun 19 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"I've never seen them grow back, so I don't think they do.   Harvest the whole thing (top first, so they don't fall) and replant."

7daystodie,3af2hj,saerileth,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"Are you on a server with other players, or a private server with just you guys? If the former, /u/WeezulDK is correct.  In any case, horde spawns have been a bit buggy in the most recent release. It may be as simple as that, and when 12 comes out you may see that improve."
7daystodie,3af2hj,TribalDancer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"There is a known issue with hordes based on zombie population. If there is a ton of zombies already on the map somewhere, the horde can't spawn more.   This can be from multiple issues, including other players on MP servers, riling up zombies in the area prior to their spawn time, and other such events.   Or, your file is corrupted somewhere. We had the issue a few patches ago and had to get it fixed by our admin."

7daystodie,3acxts,Thepher,6,Fri Jun 19 02:33:57 2015 UTC,Is it going to generate completely new biomes? or just more intricate and detailed ones?
7daystodie,3acxts,TribalDancer,8,Fri Jun 19 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"The biomes are getting tweaked so they aren't always divided by rivers. They will blend into one another more seamlessly. Also, they are introducing weather effects, like rain and snow, and now different biomes will exist at different altitudes! So snow biomes will be actually up in the mountains. Also, there will be rock formations and a general smoothing of terrain. I can't wait!"

But one key thing you need to understand is that the server has to be accomodate a ton of people at once. My server costs about 10.40 a month and it's relatively nice for 6 people playing.  One thing I've thought about doing is calling for faction leaders/town ""kings"" to be required to pitch in for the server. In my mind, that seems like the only logical scenario in order for something like this to happen. That way, not only do they actively play on the server but they also have a personal stake in the health of the server.

The anti-gay flavor only adds to how much it hurts the document's credibility. It's easy to be humorous and light hearted without being overtly negative (and in this case potentially offensive).   I don't care what words you use to demean people, and I use ""gay"" to describe how something is unfavorable myself (although I always found ""faggot"" to be more suitable for rednecks and rage quitting gamer tykes). I won't tell you what to do, or even ask, because I don't care about the language personally, but TribalDancer has a point: the phrase is needless, childish, and offensive."
7daystodie,3acqwx,TribalDancer,0,Sat Jun 20 19:30:32 2015 UTC,Also note: TFP has gone on record saying this game is not optimized for larger servers. I think the sweet spot they said was 12 players max.

Opposing factions have options, setup a trade for those resources, threaten and force them out of the territory, or kill them all.   Unfortunately it would end up turning into an issue with one group just killing everyone instead of trying to RP realistically.    It would take a good solid reasonable group of people to really make it work and unfortunately, I don't see this happening with a bunch of random internet strangers."

I mean /r/thewalkingreddits is hosted by the 7 days to die developers and it's PvE only with a ban for just walking into someone's house uninvited and it works because you have a reddit background scan on how active you are and based on posts.
7daystodie,3acqwx,a_little_obscene,4,Fri Jun 19 02:32:24 2015 UTC,I mean /r/thewalkingreddits is hosted by the 7 days to die developers  gotta correct you here. the devs have nothing to do with the walking reddit server. this is hosted and run by other people then the devs.
7daystodie,3acqwx,Palin_Sees_Russia,-3,Fri Jun 19 07:10:20 2015 UTC,"The server might not have many of the devs on but it's in the dev's subreddit as a button to ger information on their server, It's affiliated."
7daystodie,3acqwx,a_little_obscene,3,Fri Jun 19 13:11:11 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. The 7 Days subreddit was around well before the devs decided to have a presence on it.

7daystodie,3acqwx,a_little_obscene,3,Fri Jun 19 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Right but the problem here is fostering a PvP environment, not a PvE environment. The rules have to get pretty complex as to what is considered griefing and what is considered fair game in a PvP situation, where on PvE it's way simpler. In a PvP situation, it attracts a certain element... eventually people come in and blow up half of one team's base by hacking--they get banned, but then what happens to that faction's base?  I love the idea, but agree it seems a tricky thing to try and make happen and that is why it doesn't exist currently. I hope you are able to make it work somehow!"

Is that possible?"
7daystodie,3acqwx,Rock1monkey,2,Mon Jun 22 20:11:41 2015 UTC,Chunks yeah. Not the whole server. I have made friends with all the admins when I play and they have done this for me before on a couple different servers. Hackers will happen and I build big and right in the open so I am affected a lot.

7daystodie,3aejxt,Izviral,3,Fri Jun 19 14:32:45 2015 UTC,"AFAIK there are no caves in Navezgane. Ore definitely does spawn randomly. I started a game a few nights ago for nostalgia reasons, playing on 11.6, and made a tunnel down from inside the little metal shed across from the farmhouse. Always, 100% of the time, I have found all types of ore down there. That's the reason I stopped playing on Navezgane - ore is so easy to come by, it never seems to run out down there.  The ""ore only spawns in caves"" rule only applies to random gen."

I can't tell you any exact co-ordinates because i mostly play random gen. But Ores now ONLY spawn in premade mines.   DON'T, i repeat DON'T waste your time trying to find ores by just digging down, because since 11.4 (ish) they stopped ores spawning at random and confined them to premade mines.   If you try to just dig down, you're only going to find stone.  For the most part (at least in random gen), Mines spawn either Near roads or river beds. Hope this helps."
7daystodie,3aejxt,Annihilinth,2,Fri Jun 19 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"just let me add that this is not for the SP Navezgane map, he is talking about the random PVP maps.  In Navezgane, you just dig down and you will run into random stuff."

Then you'll be safe. from digging zombies for quite a while. If you can spend the resources then even when that deep just sugarcoat the base with 5 layers of reinforced concrete. Key to these cave systems is making them the right size. Too big and they spawn down there, Make it a little bigger than your spawn protecting radius from zeds spawning."
7daystodie,3acmms,dobby420,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:19:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure how deep it is right now. My goal was to hit bedrock and then dig out a base, with a shit ton of doors on the way down. Never even considered them digging down to me, thought the stone would keep them at bay long enough that I would never need to worry about it."
7daystodie,3acmms,dobby420,3,Fri Jun 19 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"On horde's especially remember that they don't have to see you to know where you are. The deeper you go the longer it'll take them. A well placed defence of traps can avoid trouble if they dig down enough. Having your base's most secured room/area at the deepest level whilst so stragatically placed so that zombies would fall into a pit of upgraded log spikes. When zombies fall in a pit it's a bit of an exploit but when they crawl up to get out if you just put a ladder going sideways on the top of the inside, so it's not usable. The zeds will try to climb it but because it's facing the wrong way they will not attack and get mind fucked because they can't climb the ladder infront of them. This gives you the ability to exterminate zombies in the pit without worry of them climbing over.

But a brand new YouTuber, playing a game for the first time, doing a give away...? Normally you do a giveaway for reaching a milestone, or inviting your viewers to play with you, but you're advertising your channel more then the game, on a subreddit where 99% of us own said game. And you don't really seem that into it, and slam the ""poor fps and glithcy gameplay""  Come on man. Have more respect for gamers and the 7 Days to Die fanbase. We're not here to make you into YouTuber. You want those subs, then make good content with a game you love. Not just an alpha game to cash in on. You should be inspired just because you love the game you play. Don't pick a game to feature or do a give-away on that you think will land you the most viewers. Thats insulting both to us, and yourself."
7daystodie,3ahdya,Jayick,3,Sat Jun 20 05:56:13 2015 UTC,"your right! I really appreciate the comment you gave me, maybe i can redo this video and make a better one. I really do appreciate the comment though, even though it was negative."
7daystodie,3ahdya,Jayick,2,Sat Jun 20 06:55:00 2015 UTC,"Wasn't really trying to be negative towards you. Just 7 Days to Die is about the only alpha survival game that isn't spammed on the subreddits by wanna-be YouTubers. I wouldn't ""redo"" the video, I would just go ahead and play it without recording, until you get familiar with the game and what needs to be done to make good content.  But honestly, it sounds like you aren't that into the game, so I suggest finding a game you love, and making content based off that. Spreading yourself thin on multiple games and always playing the ""latest and greatest"" game isn't the way to go starting out with streaming and youtube. Content and viewers come when you are really good at a game. You show off how well you can play, and give players interesting tips and ideas to expand their game experience. Why would anyone want to watch someone learn how to play a game? We sit back, watch that video and go ""Why?! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! Oh my god, you just missed this item that's important. WHY GOD?! Jesus man, pay attention, you're bleeding out!"" (your first death btw).  7 Days to Die is a great game, but these survival games get boring as hell watching. Try editing the video to show major highlights in your gameplay. Maybe cut out the endless looting/scavenging, speed up the video when you build, and show normal gameplay during zombie hordes or struggling to clear out a town. Do a voice over commentary afterwards, and you'll notice yourself not struggling to come up with stuff to talk about while playing either. This will also prevent you from unintentionally insulting a game and the fanbase you're trying to attract."

7daystodie,3aakwr,dafuqz,7,Thu Jun 18 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there's a plan to add additional skins to the weapons based on their quality. It would be kind of neat to see a faulty weapon look a bit busted and a flawless weapon look very sleek and solid. Some different descriptors might be neat too. Start with a primitive stone axe, then crude, solid, and polished (need one more). Firearms could be cheap, faulty, bargain, loose, antique, tuned, military, spec-ops, etc. (not that particular order, just thinking of possible descriptors). Metal tools could be dull, rusty, old, rattling, oiled, honed, durable, sharpened, razor sharp, and such.  If they get really ambitious or have the time they could have multiple types in each quality range with modifiers for some of the descriptors, like an axe with durable has 10-20% more durability than one of the same quality without that modifier. Perhaps something could be added to the item in crafting to add one of the positive modifiers, like adding nails to the fireaxe (keeps the head on the handle better?), or a stone for the sharpened modifier. Being able to use Red Wood Planks to craft some of the items to give them a different look would be nifty, too.  Then there's the really far out there idea of firearms being rendered based on their parts. The slide of a pistol is sleek and solid (purple pistol parts), but the grip is pitted and the receiver is rusted. The parts could have modifiers themselves. A bonus to accuracy because the barrel is milled, but the reload time is increased because the receiver is rusty.  Okay, got excited and carried away. Even if none of this ends up in the game, it's still additively fun and I love what they're doing."

From the screenshots, that is what it looks like. This definitely makes the game harder. I really like the direction this game is going if this is case! :D"
7daystodie,3aakwr,rabidwolf5,6,Thu Jun 18 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"I like it too, but kind of also strengthens my sentiment that we need something in between stone axe and fire axe. A scrap axe or so. The book should be found early (before you can find a forge book) and it should only be efficient on trees. I think wood is not that big of a deal to take ages to harvest it. The stone axe does take a while. It should be just a little bit more efficient than the stone one and definately worse than the fire axe. I think the fire axe needs like 2-3 hits with full stamina, so let's say 4-6 hits for the scrap axe."

7daystodie,3aakwr,rabidwolf5,2,Thu Jun 18 17:26:34 2015 UTC,I like it. Scrap hatchet resonates with me a bit more. 3-5 scrap iron and a board.  If they don't want to add a book they could lock it behind the tanning book and require a leather strip to wrap the handle.
7daystodie,3aakwr,OnceIthought,2,Thu Jun 18 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"That would actually be also a good idea. When you start, getting scrap takes some effort. So I don't think it would be too easy to maintain. The leather adds to difficulty/drop luck and you don't need luck with the axe itself."

I was just limping around with nothing else around to hurt me (no falling stuff from above either) and suddenly I'm dead, and again no backpack. It seems like the backpack not appearing is somehow tied to the death being random like that, because if I die to a zombie or player, the backpack always drops."

Run it, then your computer should act as normal, or if you're running your OS of a SSD, just do a quick reboot instead. But if you don't want any of these options, the issue clears itself up as your OS recovers the RAM manually. Most noticeable when hosting MP / running your own server.  Side note, the issue isn't usually that bad, just lately since 11.5 it seems to be worse. With the new Random Gen 3.0 coming out on A12, hopefully it'll be slightly more optimized."

7daystodie,3a8x19,OnceIthought,3,Thu Jun 18 18:11:12 2015 UTC,Is that true for Navezgane too? I don't think it has caves.
7daystodie,3a8x19,Stargos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:12:26 2015 UTC,Got it. Thank you! I feel like I wasted so much time.
7daystodie,3a8x19,Ceorl_Lounge,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:26:40 2015 UTC,Just got back into the game after sitting out most of A11. I REALLY wish I'd seen this comment a few days ago!
7daystodie,3a8x19,MrApexy,0,Thu Jun 18 21:44:49 2015 UTC,oh my god man thank you so much!
7daystodie,3a4rvq,JoelHuenink,18,Wed Jun 17 05:43:20 2015 UTC,"That is incredible news. I asked if there were any updates to random gen and you said no, /u/JoelHuenink, you bastard!  I'd love to see you guys stream a test session, answer questions from the viewers. I'd love to see more random gen 3.0."
7daystodie,3a4rvq,Lucullus76,30,Wed Jun 17 08:22:38 2015 UTC,That's because I have a habit of working on things in secret then telling Madmole and everyone else about it once it's about 60% there. ;)
7daystodie,3a4rvq,Kinyajuu,7,Wed Jun 17 13:50:20 2015 UTC,"You're doing a great job, the random gen really makes the game so much better.  Are there any changes to the layout of urban areas? It often feels a bit repetitive with the same prefab over and over.  EDIT: I now see that /u/liiliiliiliiliilii basically asked the same question."
7daystodie,3a4rvq,Lucullus76,2,Wed Jun 17 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"Would love to see more random urban areas which slightly change over time(the falling snow, also plants grow and overcrowd area's).   Building houses/poi is something I would love to do and I think many people feel this way. This way there is more time to introducing new items and less times will be lost making POI's."
7daystodie,3a4rvq,liiliiliiliiliilii,4,Wed Jun 17 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"From those screenshots, you did a bang up job. Bravo!"

Naughty."
7daystodie,3a4rvq,snowdogJJJ,2,Wed Jun 17 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"yes , please"
7daystodie,3a4rvq,superkuh,8,Wed Jun 17 11:56:24 2015 UTC,The whole discrete biome thing was kind of weird. I can't wait to try out the new random gen for the surface. It looks great.  Any news on fixing random gen for below the surface? I know perlin/random resources outside of caves are still available now if you tweak the config but almost no popular servers run it due to computer processor/resources issues.
7daystodie,3a4rvq,Kinyajuu,8,Wed Jun 17 06:44:40 2015 UTC,"Having resources set to ""all"" doesn't slow the game down. It was having cave layouts that were entirely too complex, requiring more in/out checking the more branches that one had. Turning ore on for the whole world is actually perfectly fine and should not slow things down at all if they don't mind players just being able to dig anywhere for resources."
7daystodie,3a4rvq,liiliiliiliiliilii,6,Wed Jun 17 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome guy, just when I started to get burned out of the ""random map"" you guy make the next step to better random worlds. Hopefully more random city's next. ( and let the community build the houses, to make them load easily)."
7daystodie,3a4rvq,Kinyajuu,13,Wed Jun 17 10:44:08 2015 UTC,I've been reading posts by prefabbers and modders for the past 8 months (at least) and I'm cooking up something that should please everyone. You'll be able to do so much more with the rwgmixer xml for sure. More details on that later once it's fully finished. :)
7daystodie,3a4rvq,Angry_unicornn,3,Wed Jun 17 13:56:47 2015 UTC,Any plans to include more prefabs? Some of the stuff the community has been creating are amazing would love to see some of them included in the default world.

7daystodie,3a4rvq,giltirn,2,Wed Jun 17 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"Very poor optimization; it runs like crap even on very high end machines. PvP servers are riddled with griefers. The time and resources required to do anything meaningful are too long.  That said the game has a lot of promise, and the devs are very active. Once it gets over its teething troubles it's going to be a very good game."

7daystodie,3a4rvq,Stonewall_Gary,8,Wed Jun 17 12:55:51 2015 UTC,"Random Gen 3.0 is here! This is one of the big surprises for Alpha 12 we have been waiting to show. No longer do rivers separate biomes or are biomes a big defined area, but they are based on altitude, temperature and humidity. This produces a lot more natural landscape and we have taller mountains and much more believable terrain. You can see plains blending in next to desert, and if a pine forest is high enough it becomes a snow biome.   Roads now have gravel shoulders on them and all wildneness POIs will be found via a dirt path that leads from a main road. So if you find a dirt road and you are lost, it will either lead you to a POI or the main road depending which way you take. Roads curve and look better now too, and always go somewhere.  The desert has small ponds in it now. They are rare but exist, making for a handy place to fill your jars with that murky good stuff."

7daystodie,3a4rvq,Thelonous,4,Wed Jun 17 10:08:32 2015 UTC,"any map changes will require a reset to take affect.  Character data is best reset with it due to being tied to bases, chests."

7daystodie,3a4rvq,IckyOutlaw,4,Wed Jun 17 05:44:40 2015 UTC,There are already working lights (and fridges...) in the current version. So I guess that's just it. I hope I'm wrong though and a working generator and lighting would be included in A12.

7daystodie,3a7tez,f22o,6,Wed Jun 17 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No  Long Answer: No, even if you log off, he picks up your sleeping bag, you log back in. It will still spawn you where your new sleeping bag ""was"". The game still thinks its there, even if its not, and until you place a new sleeping bag it will continue to think you have an ""invisible"" bag.  Edit: Best way to test this is usually to destroy your sleeping bag by killing the blocks below it or something then killing yourself, you will still see the option to spawn on your sleeping bag or near it. Even though you just destroyed it."
7daystodie,3a7tez,Lostmortal,2,Wed Jun 17 23:06:18 2015 UTC,"Another explanation:  You ""respawn"" point is set when you place bed/sleeping bag/mattress.. Removing that block does nothing."

As far as I know there's no way to pick up someone else's sleeping bag. If you pick it up, then your sleeping bag at your own base will remain inactive and if you die you will just spawn randomly on the map.  I think.

7daystodie,3a5oi5,ekkonox_07,4,Wed Jun 17 12:47:49 2015 UTC,All depends on quality of  your tool and level of your stamina. With 50ish stamina and purple pickaxe (flawless) destroying a large stone is 3 swings. wooden door? purple axe takes 1-2 hits to take it down. To get better tools you need to level up and then craft it. There is a formula on the wiki that will explain how quality is determined in crafted tools.  Good advice: Try to locate Tool Store.. It has crates with items in it.. you may get lucky and find axe/pickaxe of greater quality there before you are able to craft it yourself.
7daystodie,3a5oi5,korben76,3,Wed Jun 17 13:06:58 2015 UTC,If you're impatient it could be you're just clicking until you're done when really you should be resting inbetween.   No stamina = no damage > no damage = more swings > more swings = more repairs.  So it's a viscous cycle if you don't rest. You can get more use out of a tool if you use it at your full strength. I suggest resting at 50% stamina until full before continuing.   And depending on quality of your tools you may want to consider crafting a new one vs repairing low quality. Crafting a new one grants you a chance at improving the quality rather than pouring resources into a low tier item.
7daystodie,3a5oi5,Imakedo,2,Wed Jun 17 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"as you progress in the game you will be able to craft more effective/higher quality tools. The beginning is slow though, not much you can do about it but keep playing. Also, don't cut down the big trees, the small ones still give decent amount of wood and take less time to cut down."
7daystodie,3a5oi5,Elduriel,2,Wed Jun 17 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"Instead of taking the route that minecraft usually takes--wood tools to stone tools and onward to godlike status. Take some time running around searching everything for books, tools, and supplies. Once night time is coming around you should definitely build yourself a shelter."
7daystodie,3a5oi5,ChrisWorstMedicEver,2,Wed Jun 17 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"He might still need basic crappy tools to get first materials. Stone axe to smash few doors get clay.. its cheap. I agree,, you should go for scavenging more than trying to be self sufficient in the woods kind of a type. As for the shelter.. I successfully build bases from scratch on surface and underground, now I am in phase when I would rather fortify existing building and stay there for night and that is what I would recommend. Keep in mind that in case you get caught around 18is afternoon in the middle of nowhere its better to just sit quietly and wait till morning than trying to run and find shelter. (zeds run at night - usually)"
7daystodie,3a5oi5,korben76,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:33:10 2015 UTC,Yeah he definitely needs to land a flawless stone axe. That's probably still the most useful tool in this game.
7daystodie,3a5oi5,ChrisWorstMedicEver,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly I personally set the block durability to half because I have more fun than way. But yeah, like everyone else has said, you need to level up to make better quality tools."
7daystodie,3a60e2,CraftyZeds,3,Wed Jun 17 14:32:29 2015 UTC,".. maybe adding 5 to the top-end quality, but 25 is WAY too much.  May as well remove the quality system altogether."
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,2,Wed Jun 17 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe, but it should be a meaningful number. It's not like it isn't still random and doesn't require you spending extra time and resources making 5-10+ of the same item (or item group) just to get the chance at higher quality.  And while it my not be high enough, there is certainly a cost, and when you can just go scavanging and find a flawless/great quality item that then completely devaules any further crafting you try to do as nothing you make will be better than that for the foreseeable future."
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to do that for a stone axe, but if/when you start doing that for the iron (and soon, steel) gear that nearly obliterates everything in it's path, that's a whole 'nother story."
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,2,Wed Jun 17 17:29:20 2015 UTC,Is that vastly different than finding a Great/Flawless item and then using that to obliterate everything in your path and never make said tool again?
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"Completely.  I can craft (literally) hundreds of tools.  I'm on a PvP server so it's easy for me to lose my gear.  If I FIND one, the chances that I'll find another are slim to none."
7daystodie,3a60e2,gl1tch,2,Wed Jun 17 17:47:06 2015 UTC,I am so out of the loop on PvP... I do imagine that would skew things. Does killing other players reward XP? Is it generally considered fair and balanced for the people who find flawless/great gear first to outmatch anything that anyone can make for a very long time?  Genuinely curious as I have little (no) PvP experience and was looking into making a server with friends.
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"There's generally a gentleman's agreement that you don't kill naked players (unless they ask for it), because really, there's no challenge...  No XP is gained, and on death, no wellness is lost (I think, it's been a while since I've been killed).  Bases are raided on a regular basis looking for claim-blocks, and more/better gear.    For me, it's one more way you get slammed back to foraging... because, really, the game is no fun once you have infinite ammo/food."
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,2,Wed Jun 17 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"I think adding to the bottom-end would be better than adding to the top-end. A small number like 2 would work well, that would mean 25 crafts of a given item to eliminate the -50, making the range 0 to 50 at level 1 instead of -50 to 50 ( or 100-150 at level 10 instead of 50-150)"
7daystodie,3a60e2,ravenze,2,Wed Jun 17 16:59:53 2015 UTC,adding a +1-2 to the bottom DOES make a lot more sense.
7daystodie,3a60e2,Blaktoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am the odd one out on this then... but is it common to craft so many of the same tool and item?   Is there a need to make the number so small? Is it common to make so many duplicates of items? I set the number to 25 initially due to the fact that I feel the need to make tools so rarely, maybe 2-3 times if I happen to have the time and a large supply of said materials... or it hits on the -50 end."
7daystodie,3a6fj4,StylishStuff,9,Wed Jun 17 16:24:37 2015 UTC,Punch grass (plant fiber) Punch bushes (sticks) Pick up small rocks Craft a stone axe Chop cotton Make cotton armor Chop trees Repair axe Make bow Loot bird nests on floor Make arrows Make a small log cabin Make a sleeping bag Explore the map and loot everything Aim for the head
7daystodie,3a6fj4,gl1tch,3,Wed Jun 17 16:38:47 2015 UTC,That 30 minutes could save you 30 minutes of in game time.
7daystodie,3a6fj4,Stargos,3,Wed Jun 17 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"Join pvp server:   Find 20 sticks(attack the small bush), 5 grass and 10 stones: make 2 stones axes and a bow.  Find some feathers in birds nest and make arrows. Loot some cars to find tools. Found a pickaxe and an axe? Dig down about 10 blocks and make a 6x6x4 room with ladders up. Place some chests and start looting city's. Place an item on top of the ladder.(in PvP don't use a hatch it is a big give away, so they now there will be a base down there). Hide rare items somewhere outside your base in a chest about 3 blocks deep. Place the dirt's back and remember where you hid the chest. Now you probably found some gun parts to make your first gun( don't use it except on other players)."
7daystodie,3a6fj4,liiliiliiliiliilii,3,Wed Jun 17 16:38:59 2015 UTC,TL;DR don't die.

7daystodie,3a6fj4,ravenze,2,Wed Jun 17 17:42:02 2015 UTC,Do stone axes still chop down trees? I tried playing for the first time in around a year a couple nights ago and I couldn't cut down a tree or break a boulder.
7daystodie,3a6fj4,Detenator,2,Wed Jun 17 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it just takes a very long time using a crappy faulty stone axe with grey quality bar (which is what you're basically guaranteed to get when crafting until at least level 5 or so). It also usually takes almost a full durability bar, and sometimes more than one stone axe.  Technically I think you can punch trees into lumber if you're patient enough.  Try and find a better axe (stone or fireaxe) through looting cars or stores if you can. It'll be much better than anything you can craft for quite awhile."
7daystodie,3a6fj4,cecilkorik,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:54:39 2015 UTC,Ah I see. I gave up after one stone axe broke because I broke two on a boulder prior. Thanks for the info. (ᵔᴥᵔ)

7daystodie,3a6fj4,ravenze,2,Thu Jun 18 03:36:28 2015 UTC,"My preferred game style is Nomad Style and I found most of those essential lists posted here correct, Ill add few tips from my experience.  Besides surviving my goal is to level up and rise wellness (gain stamina/health). Killing zeds in the morning, lunch, looting at the afternoon, waiting/crafting at night should be a routine also:   If you have found antibiotics keep 1 it in case you get infected.. any spare you have you should use right away -> be ""on them"" as much as possible. Antibiotics buff is quite long and will rise your wellness over time. Eating cooked foods (dat vension stew) works best for gaining wellness. If you not in a hurry - always kill zeds.   Always be upgrading!   Found a second gun, disassemble you guns and switch parts to create best quality gun possible then scrap/trash other parts. Established shelter in town? Fortified it with scrap metal, add better door, fill window holes with something, dig a moat around put log spikes there. Found multiple metal items, nails, cans, crappy pickaxe? scrap everything scrap stacks in piles of 64, same for cloth/bronze,lead.. ect   Don't be reckless .. be careful.   Carry some wooden frames on you. You can use them to get to higher places and then you can pick up them, also will save you if you fall into a ditch. Don't use firearms if you don't want to fight hordes.. because that's how you get hordes, crossbow is the ultimate weapon in this game, also spiked club with high quality is a one hit in a head weapon (on difficulty 3), However in case of extreme danger go ahead and start blasting. Beer, Grain alcohol and Coffee boosts your stamina regen.. If you cannot drink because you are not thirsty.. pop a painkiller. Bandage should be on your toolbar all the time, use it when you start bleeding, carry few splints on you too. After battle, destroy gore blocks especially around your shelters.. those will attract more zeds over time. If you get caught away from shelter consider waiting in darkness over night running with zeds.   My Nomad style specific:   Establish network of shelters in town prefabs or POIs. Move from one to another every few days and relay on loot, make shelters only in towns that have good loot and you consider returning there. Place bed in shelter right when you arrive, in case you get rekt you respawn right there. Always be upgrading -> fortify shelters a little every time you visit. Place storage crates in good loot places to keep stuff there so you don't have to carry everything on you. Example: I have storage boxes in gun store when I loot I will upgrade my rifle and if I find some decent parts I will leave them there."

Rebar is a good example of this.  Also reinforced concrete (7) is built from rebar (14? Lost count) so that demonstrates why weight plays a role"

As host, the console will open quite often as well, which has gotten me killed a few times. A bit of an annoyance for sure, but we're having too much fun to give up."
7daystodie,3a3xkj,FurryFredChunks,2,Wed Jun 17 01:33:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I actually know how I might be able to help!  My buddies and I were having the same problem when one of them was hosting a server on his PC. We would try to run out of the town we were in and would essentially have a failed map render much like you described. So after relentless searching I was able to figure out a way to bypass this.  This is a temporary fix and we have to do it about every 7 or so in game days.   First off, back up your saved world located in documents>7 days to die>saves>random gen or navezgane>server name  Next delete all the "".map"" files located in the ""player"" folder listed in the file path you're in.   Now this will delete all locations you had in your current map so you will have to find them all again, but at least you won't get the map rendering issues you were having.   Let me know if this worked for you! And of course, happy hunting!"

7daystodie,3a3d4h,Darkstar_Lojek,3,Tue Jun 16 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"I believe it was around Alpha 10 or 10.2 that they changed it so time stopped when no one is logged on to a server.

Going into one of the large factory pre-fabs in Navezgane and seeing a few of them sprint at you on all fours from the other end of the huge, cavernous room was just terrifying.  Most recently, I had a dozen forges and campfires running throughout the day and night, and was picking them off with my sniper rifle from the safety of my roof about 70 blocks away when they'd charge in at night.  Of course, nothing causes more dread than having them sprinting at you, then climbing up the wall to appear right beside you and swiping at your head while popping down to all fours between attacks."

This happens every release: I get excited and once released play for hours non-stop until I have a secure base and food supply (usually around day 14). Then I always end up stopping because I know that anything I do is going to get lost in the next update. I read progress logs of the next update and wait patiently (mostly) for the next update. Then the cycle begins again.  What I would really like is if the devs developed a system that allows us to carry our base and most of our equipment between updates. I know that we would end up with nasty chunk borders like during Minecraft beta, but I'm fine with that."

I really like this part, as it gives a very real sense of accomplishment to survey my fortress that I have spent so long working on. This is why I also enjoy Minecraft and Space Engineers.   For me, 7DTD is a replacement for Minecraft in which my forts also serve a purpose and the enemies are to be feared for more than just the first 10 mins of gaming.   I do understand that those who play for the survival aspect will get bored as soon as they are established, but that is the same in pretty much all survival games. I don't really know how to get around this, other than just ramping up the difficulty as time goes on (which I personally do not like) or by forcing players to leave their forts for some rare resource."

Graphics won't look as good obviously but it should help your framerate. Aside from this there isn't much more you can do. The game is just a resource hog and could use some optimizations.

It wasn't until the last update that I could actually play the game (due to lag) but I still have to run everything absolute minimum. My only suggestion would be to drop everything down and wait for the next alpha build to optimize if that doesn't work.
7daystodie,3a2aun,Terza_Rima,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"Do you have a SDD installed?  They generally load faster than your standard laptop HDD's.  Of course that means you'll have to reload everything if you have a standard HDD, but for me it made a large enough difference to do so.  Can you play at a lesser resolution?  Try 1280x800 (or whatever it is you have around that)."
7daystodie,3a2aun,TheRogaDanar,2,Tue Jun 16 22:37:26 2015 UTC,I have a DV6 with the AMD A8 processor and  Radeon HD 6620G integrated graphics. It plays just fine with relatively low settings. I would expect a bit better performance out of your computer. You may want to start by updating drivers. Next I would try a smaller resolution and maybe reinstalling the game in case it's not running right.   The game is not yet optimized for performance. So if all else fails try again after a couple of updates.
7daystodie,3a2aun,GerbilKor,2,Tue Jun 16 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"I'm running it with an i5 4460 and an R9 290. Even I have trouble running the game most of the time, and I don't have everything set to max either. I'm running most of everything on Normal/Medium. I can get 70fps in the plains, but the moment I hit small prefabs, immediate 17-26fps. I have a feeling it isn't optimised on account of it being in Alpha."
7daystodie,3a2aun,FurryFredChunks,2,Wed Jun 17 01:52:41 2015 UTC,Curious how it runs on the default display at the default resolution. It's not really the fault of the game that it doesn't run well at a resolution that your hardware was not designed to support.
7daystodie,3a2aun,Blaktoe,2,Wed Jun 17 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my laptop's an older girl and I've started putting serious thought into retiring her.  In the meantime, the game runs ok at lower, non-full-screen resolution, but sadly still lags a little bit (below what I would consider playable in an FPS, for example) and looks terrible since the textures are all at the lowest res possible.  I haven't turned zombie spawning back on; we'll see how that goes later."
7daystodie,3a2aun,Blaktoe,2,Wed Jun 17 20:16:31 2015 UTC,You could try overclock the video card. Might get you a few frames...
7daystodie,3a2aun,Blaktoe,2,Wed Jun 17 20:33:12 2015 UTC,My GPU would literally melt.  Trying to play 7 Days without a cooling pad and external fan already forced a shutdown after like 20 minutes of playtime.  At this point I have to either just suck it up or stick to playing Fallout: New Vegas for my post-apoc fix until I get a new computer.
7daystodie,3a3vft,Ender94,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:51:05 2015 UTC,I believe you might have to use the 11.2 spawning.xls file? As it got messed up in later version *note I haven't played the current 11.x version to tell.  Also sometimes there is/was error with other spawns sticking around and causing the big spawns not to show up.  Best way to solve this is log off 45 minutes gametime before 00:00 to ensure the way is clear for the 7 day spawn.  Hopefully all this will be fixed/solved for version 12 that is coming out in a couple weeks? (fingers crossed).
7daystodie,39zaol,bobobo19,18,Tue Jun 16 00:21:52 2015 UTC,"YES. For the love of God yes.  The one thing that continues to set this apart from the success of Minecraft is the distinct lack of things you can actually do. Minecraft has this little thing you might heard of. Redstone. It's what set the game apart from anything else like it, and for 7 Days to usurp its throne it seriously needs a similar feature. Electricity.  Generators. Wires and cables. MACHINES, with a purpose. For instance, make meat go bad over time, but increase the time it's good by putting it in a fridge hooked up to power. Give us an electric cooking machine, an oven or something. Give us the ability to generate power from windmills, gas generators, and solar panels. Let us charge up the lead car batteries to remotely power things.  Minecraft and it's mods still hold the throne on survival gameplay. The possibilities are damned near endless, especially in the larger modpacks. 7 Days has to have similar features.  EDIT: How FUCKING cool would it be to just be able to make a drawbridge for your bases? Lights that came on when movement was detected outside the walls? Lights that automatically came on when it became night time? Or even simpler things, like maybe your flashlights would have a charge that would deplete? Maybe a mobile battery charger, ala Metro 2033, to charge your portable items. An electric sword?! There's just SO much that such a system could add to the game."
7daystodie,39zaol,SuiXi3D,5,Tue Jun 16 02:19:59 2015 UTC,"I really really hope they create something akin to redstone, because that was what kept me playing Minecraft for EVAH. Discovering all the amazing things I could create and affect with it was endlessly entertaining."
7daystodie,39zaol,TribalDancer,8,Tue Jun 16 02:34:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly, with Redstone in Minecraft it became possible to build actual machines that did things.  We need similar in 7 Days or it will just become another zombie survival game."
7daystodie,39zaol,Worstdriver,5,Tue Jun 16 03:12:05 2015 UTC,We'd be able to set up lights for our underground fortresses!
7daystodie,39zaol,Palin_Sees_Russia,2,Tue Jun 16 04:07:55 2015 UTC,"For instance, make meat go bad over time   Thats one of the things that makes don't starve so difficult and that would be great here. Also, drying racks for meat and leather would be a nice addition."
7daystodie,39zaol,Ninjacaje,2,Tue Jun 16 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"For instance, make meat go bad over time, but increase the time it's good by putting it in a fridge hooked up to power   I like this idea as long as there are 'early game' alternatives, such as gathering snow from a snow biome and putting it into an ice chest."
7daystodie,39zaol,gl1tch,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that'd be awesome! Or, even better, just pick up one of the existing coolers and use that. Maybe it'd have another small item slot on the left where you'd put snow or ice, and it'd deplete slowly over time like fuel in a campfire. Otherwise it'd simply be storage like normal."
7daystodie,39zaol,SuiXi3D,2,Wed Jun 17 11:44:49 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of 7days, and I was blown away by some of the items that ARK: Survival evolved had for crafting. The game is nowhere as fun to play as 7days for me, but the crafting options were glorious. You could craft electrical generators but you needed to craft and run wires, the craft and run outlets, then craft the refrigerator or the Auto Turrent.   It was so awesome. They also had pipes for water you can build and fountains for drinking. 7days isn't as dependent on water as ARK but it was still really cool.   It was too much of a grindfest though just to ""learn"" the recipes for those items. I think 7days could do it a lot better."
7daystodie,39zaol,dmanwithnoname,6,Tue Jun 16 21:26:41 2015 UTC,Would be an interesting idea. Maybe if they decide to make food perishable if you store it in a fridge it lasts longer? That would be an incentive to get your power going.
7daystodie,39zaol,moremysterious,4,Tue Jun 16 00:32:49 2015 UTC,Or maybe certain blocks have an insulation trait and ice or snow could be gathered from the snow biomes. The insulation trait could also help with the coming climate challenges (if they are confirmed? Not sure).
7daystodie,39zaol,Balake0813,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I like this! I was thinking that storing food in a cooler would keep it fresh for X days, and fridge would keep it fresh a lot longer. Dried foods wouldn't need cooling at all and would last the longest, but would have lower effect on fullness and wellness.   Tied into this, I like your idea of using ice/snow. Perhaps the cooler would be able to keep food as fresh as long as a fridge so long as you keep filling it with ice/snow. The benefit of fridges being you don't have to tend to them, but you need electricity to run them.  The primary issue here being that you can't stack food with different ""ages"". I am not sure how they could get around that. Maybe if you stack new food with old food, the new food gets as old as the oldest food it is stacked with. Just like if you stored fresh food with rotten food, it would spoil the fresh food. So you have a stack of venison that is 2 days old, you drop fresh venison on it and now that stack is 2 days old as well?  Just spit-balling how it might work..."
7daystodie,39zaol,TribalDancer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"Imagine the PvP griefing possibility of stealing food, but then stacking the rest of the food with rotten food and leaving it behind--spoiling their entire food ration.

7daystodie,39zaol,TribalDancer,3,Tue Jun 16 17:59:47 2015 UTC,Yeah i like that idea
7daystodie,39zaol,tembrant,4,Tue Jun 16 01:52:21 2015 UTC,"I would love an electrical system in this game, I really hate using torches for lighting."
7daystodie,39zaol,procrastinatorgrrl,3,Tue Jun 16 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe have towns/areas which have wind turbines nearby to supply power, with the flip side of that being that the noise generates/attracts more zombies. Or some of the turbines might need repairing with very rare parts/tools. Or allow us to siphon gas from pumps and use it to fuel simple generators. 7D2D is so, so close to being the perfect survival game. So close.  (Also gas is a super underused feature. Why can't I pour it on the ground then shoot it alight? WHY?)"
7daystodie,39zaol,korben76,3,Tue Jun 16 04:52:54 2015 UTC,"There are 2 very easy things they can add right now:   power tools and a way to charge them (add outlets in prefabs that you can hook up a charger and have to left it there for few hours to charge) add electrical road signs powered by solar panels that can be scavenged and used to build solar charging station (utilizing car battery for example)   Example of power tool that is already in game... nail gun, flashlight, mining helmet, but you can add a lot more:   resource (electric/electronic parts) batteries (for flashlight/helmet) battery chargers electric small appliances generated in prefabs that can be used or scavenged for parts (tvs are already there dropping scrap metal when broken) cooking appliances like electric toaster, microwave oven to cook with less ""heat"". house lamps (scavenged and hooked up in your base/prefab) taser! Has no effect on zeds but disables players forcing them to drop on the ground and lose items via ""blue backpack"" that you can loot and run away. radio/music player - for some music in base (can attract zeds so can be used as decoy) battery powered stand alone lights (like construction site lights) electric engine/battery for electric version of chainsaw, nail gun and augur. electric bike! solar powered electric bike!   As for minecraft style redstone I would not go that way.. that is not how things work in real world, I mean redstone is similar to how electronics work but you don't build contraptions like that in reality because you can do that on smaller scale.  If we however go into cables/wires we can create electrical systems with the use of lightbulbs/lamps/chargers/panels/switches - think basic electrician stuff. We can utilize TVs and get cameras (scavenged from prefabs) to create better security too. Also... if we are able to build wireless send-receive devices we may have a remote cameras/lights at least in a small range but those still would require to be powered. Electricity can be used to detonate explosives! Electricity can open/close doors.. like prison style doors or garage doors.  Now imagine... Your new bunker base have outside cameras to watch for incoming zeds.. You control lights outside so you can target zeds better by turning lights on. When in trouble you can remotely turn on loud radio in a spot outside of your base in an attempt to lure zeds there. Lastly when all fails you flip the switch and detonate charges under your base sacrificing yourself but taking hordes with you.  Now. That may be a long shot but... If pimps are reading this.. I wanted you to know that I was considering going into game design and would love to do it. I have many more ideas what can be added to 7dtd in terms of content, feel free to contact me in priv."
7daystodie,39zaol,TribalDancer,3,Tue Jun 16 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"FYI: when we talk about redstone, most of us are talking about real-world electrical system stuff in the vein of redstone. Not actual redstone or a made-up magical stone or component. We are addressing the desire for power and electrical and mechanical devices we can build."
7daystodie,39zaol,Spank_hamma,2,Tue Jun 16 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"Imagine the possibility of having an underground base, lit by light bulbs connected to a main generator...  Only to have a horde detroy your generator, leaving you in the dark, where you may or may not have a flashlight. That would be fucking terrifying. What a story to tell."
7daystodie,39zaol,Withoutadoubt43,2,Tue Jun 16 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"It would be nice if they added an additional tier of technology, nothing too advanced but maybe something on par with the kind of useful contraptions that the Myth Busters could make. I'm sure those guys could make a crude generator if they really wanted to."
7daystodie,39zaol,MCRoadkill,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"Electricity, oh HELL YES!! Nice idea! The power of society!  We have Fuel, we have engines, combine it with some metal pipes and you can make yourself a generator to power your underground or above ground base. wich comes at a cost ofcourse, increasing the heat-map while it runs.  Have generators power your fridge to prevent your meat from spoiling etc. actually keeping you drinks cool (for a reason, little buff or something)  the possibilities are endless :D  Make lightbulbs salvagable/lootable items. Powerup batteries to power your off-location traps to kill zombies or trap animals. Beeing able to run electricity without generating heat to the map instead of generating heat with the generator.  But before you can make it, you should find a book first, ""Electrical Engineering Part X"" or schematics to be able to build a generator.  Then the lights that come on at night either have to stay out, since there is supposed to be no power or...be able to tap from a lightpost or buildings breakerbox to power your building/stuff. or put windturbines next to farms, you can tap from or just take over the farm."
7daystodie,39zaol,TribalDancer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:43:07 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, we clearly HAVE power in the game. Lights on and in most homes still work. Fridges still work.

7daystodie,3a1ocx,TribalDancer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"It is public, but my 2 friends couldn't find it in the server list, they had to enter my address manually to join, so I doubt people are randomly stumbling upon it.  Wasn't an attack, there was structure to the base missing that the 2 of us added, storage boxes just 2 of us created, our sleeping bags (which were on the original structure), and a farm out in the land.  All the trees that were cut down by the 2 were still gone and items they collected and put in the original storage boxes were there as well as all the items on their person. Very odd.  It hasn't happened again, I added a TON of stuff to the base yesterday and logged out and back in a few times and also checked it this morning.  I restarted the server service and everything is still intact, although it does reset the day back to 1, but all zombies, items, structures, etc.. remain the same."
7daystodie,3a1ocx,dobby420,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:06:32 2015 UTC,Make sure one of your pals hasn't been stealing. If that's not the case then perhaps zeds have broken them. That's what they usually do when they invade a base. But you would have thought you'd know about that and there would be some stuff left at least. Another thing is you all didn't quit before host. I think that will have something to do with it.

Their delivery isn't as smooth and polished as the more experienced YouTubers, but they put forth a lot of effort, they're engaging, and they have good chemistry. This isn't a tale of god-kings conquering vast armies and reshaping a shattered and dying landscape in their own image, theirs is the simple story of humanity struggling to endure another night in a brutal and ravenous jungle. This is what survival is really like.  They leave you wondering how they possibly could have lasted at all in such a ruthless world, but after a while you start to see the strength of spirit that gets them through each day. Having fought so hard each small step forward is a huge accomplishment, and thus more deeply rewarding. They make you want to cheer over a can of clean water, or a small chunk of boiled pork.

7daystodie,39xavu,dobby420,2,Mon Jun 15 21:22:03 2015 UTC,If you install the 32 bit glibc library then only 32-bit applications that need it will use it. It will exist side-by-side with the 64-bit version. It won't harm anything else that uses the 64-bit version.  yum install glibc.i686   It isn't any effort at all and won't cause any complications or issues.

7daystodie,39yb58,Dardoleon,2,Wed Jun 17 11:28:27 2015 UTC,I also have an i5 2500k at 4 ghz with 8gb RAM but only a 560ti. I also get the microstutters and I don't know why. I get great frames but the stuttering stays no matter what. I think it's a game/coding issue rather than settings.
7daystodie,39yb58,UhhNegative,3,Mon Jun 15 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it is lack of optimization as well, I toggled a few settings today and got it mostly taken care of.

7daystodie,39yb58,UhhNegative,3,Tue Jun 16 02:02:45 2015 UTC,Remember it is still in alpha though. I think when they start focusing on graphics optimization it will be a really good looking game.

7daystodie,39yb58,FurryFredChunks,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"I was just going to suggest turning down draw distance as well. I was messing with it last night and by going from 9 to 11 it cost around 11FPS. I mistakenly thought it would have no effect if you're inside and there's no actual distance to see, but it still drags performance down.  OP, the usual suspects are the ones to look at: shadow quality, additional effects, reflections, water quality. You really need to experiment with them and see what works best for you. I usually see 60 FPS, but forest townships drag my system down, and to some degree, wastelands as well, and that's with a beefier graphics card and only running at 1080p."

7daystodie,39wfu0,dobby420,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"There is one general spawning area most of the time on servers so you normally spawn near player areas and/or your friends (so it's pretty easy to find friends, especially with the friend tracking system). It's kind of hard to find servers with a decent population though (at least for me), so I usually play with a friend or two which makes the whole experience twice as enjoyable. The graphics are a improved (though there are still other games with better) and there have been several changes with crafting and what not to make starting out a bit more difficult. Zombies are hard to deal with, I believe they have random wandering hordes still implemented unless they were taken out in a previous patch, there are the 7th Day zombies, and the ambiance from them is freaking creepy (plus a couple new zombies like spider zombies & burning zombies)! The zombies are all in all great, but it also depends on which server you join as everyone makes them harder/easier or more/less numerous. I would suggest giving it a try at least :)"

7daystodie,39wp5d,dobby420,2,Mon Jun 15 13:57:42 2015 UTC,Does rebooting the server seem to help or does it actually require starting a new map?
7daystodie,39wp5d,OnceIthought,3,Mon Jun 15 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"Rebooting the server seems to be a temporary fix, a full wipe will fix your problem completely but... you have to do a full wipe.  The last server I was on, I was having this problem and the admins found that the corruption problem was centered around the biome my base was in. They wiped only the area of the map where the corruption was (don't ask me how), and they fixed it that way"
7daystodie,39wp5d,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Mon Jun 15 16:58:30 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. If they weren't changing the way biomes are generated so soon it would be good to submit incident reports on these to figure out the problem.  Information I would think was necessary would be type of biome, approximate coordinates of the area, and surrounding biomes. If it still happens in A12 that may be important."
7daystodie,39wp5d,OnceIthought,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:07:28 2015 UTC,"It is actually fairly easy to remove the corrupt parts.  The map is split up into regions.  Either you have a server manager that lets you know what region is what, or you use the web map to figure out the problematic regions, then you shut down server and go into map save area for server and delete them.  This will reset those regions to unexplored for that map, removing any bases or anything modified by a player on them (but not actually do anything to any players who happen to be in region)."
7daystodie,39wp5d,Thelonous,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ah that makes sense. So I take it region data is only generated once a player accesses a new region, causing data to populate?   And once it's deleted it just repopulates fresh data? That would make sense. Much better than doing a full wipe"
7daystodie,39wp5d,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:14:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It has saved my server quite a few times.

7daystodie,39wp5d,Dardoleon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:39:07 2015 UTC,"Right, this would make sense. It seems the longer a game goes on and the more data that has to be stored and the higher chance for corruption to happen. Especially if there's a lot of people in one area, like a lot of people building in one biome.   But when you make a new game.. there's no data and therefore almost no chance of corruption."
7daystodie,39wp5d,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:12:54 2015 UTC,My friends and I had this issue. We were stuck in a small area and the map wouldn't render.

7daystodie,39uuwg,CasperHarkin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:56:34 2015 UTC,You playing with us?  I have still not seen an air drop but I stopped looking so maybe I missed it :)
7daystodie,39uuwg,snowdogJJJ,0,Mon Jun 15 12:03:54 2015 UTC,"I've been following the game for a while now, bought it with Steam summer sale. 4 of my friends did as well. I ran out a building when I heard it and was like ""IT'S THERE. IT'S FUCKING THERE!"""
7daystodie,39uuwg,dobby420,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:38:34 2015 UTC,Yesterday I see the plane but it doesn't drop anything and I chase it for around 20 minutes to realize that it must have dropped it behind me when it flew over.
7daystodie,39uuwg,dobby420,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:39:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, don't follow the plane. Look around for the smoke."
7daystodie,39uuwg,visualmasterj,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:41:03 2015 UTC,facepalm When I realized. I think I've only had about 3 or 4 drops since I started playing this game in apha 9.
7daystodie,39uuwg,Deathmckilly,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:53:07 2015 UTC,Is air drops something that was missing or messed up?  I just bought this game this weekend so everything is new to me.  I saw a crate falling off in the distance with orange smoke trailing behind it.  Followed it and after searching for a few minutes found a crate with some gun parts and a few gun schematics
7daystodie,39uuwg,thehandsomebaron,2,Mon Jun 15 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"They would drop, but the plane was invisible and there was no smoke trail so you couldn't locate it. People were seeing it as a rare occurrence that you would just run into it."
7daystodie,39uuwg,the2ndjay,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:40:07 2015 UTC,Pretty much what was happening was that the plane and crates were only visible within your standard view distance. You could see the plane for a split second on the rare times that it would fly directly above you.
7daystodie,39uuwg,TribalDancer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:12:29 2015 UTC,Really I felt like leg breaking became hyper sensitive and air drops just never happen probably have to reset my server
7daystodie,39tfkg,dafuqz,14,Sun Jun 14 16:37:23 2015 UTC,Of course we appreciate when a problem is acknowledged and fixed.
7daystodie,39tfkg,Smegzor,9,Sun Jun 14 18:12:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the quick fix.  I had hoped this would quickly be resolved.
7daystodie,39tfkg,Thelonous,7,Sun Jun 14 18:02:34 2015 UTC,Awesome job Fun Pimps! You guys never let the community down :)
7daystodie,39tfkg,DaThompi,6,Sun Jun 14 21:27:47 2015 UTC,I can't speak for everyone but thank you so much for fixing this it means alot to us.
7daystodie,39tfkg,Chancehighfill1,25,Sun Jun 14 23:22:16 2015 UTC,Wonder if the rage-o-holics are gonna be gracious enough to apologize and thank the devs for working on the weekend?  Probably not.
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,21,Sun Jun 14 16:46:21 2015 UTC,You really expect the kids to swallow their pride and accept that the devs are actually working on the game?  Oh my dear friend.....
7daystodie,39tfkg,NuttyIrishMan93,4,Sun Jun 14 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"Of course, how silly of me xD"
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"If they didn't release them on Friday nights, maybe they wouldn't have to work the weekends"
7daystodie,39tfkg,Soylent_gray,6,Sun Jun 14 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"They DON'T have to work weekends. They did it as a courtesy to their player base. They don't owe you a timely fix, they did it because they like their fans and want them to have a good experience."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,5,Sun Jun 14 19:22:22 2015 UTC,I think you missed the point
7daystodie,39tfkg,Soylent_gray,3,Sun Jun 14 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"No, I get it, the point is you want everything delivered to you on a silver platter RIGHT NOW. That was a fairly clearly made point based on your attitude, as evidenced by almost every single comment you've made in this sub since they released A11.6.  Just because you paid for an alpha product, don't think The Fun Pimps work for you. They do not. They owe you nothing beyond what you paid for, which is a product that is unfinished. This was made perfectly clear to you while you were purchasing it.  I'm willing to bet that you've already got more than 100 hours of entertainment out of that unfinished product, too. I know I have.  If they stopped right now and said ""This is the final release,"" I would still have gotten far and above the amount of money I paid them worth of sheer entertainment value. So would you.  I understand that it's frustrating when a game doesn't work the way it was intended to, but the great thing about having an unfinished product is that it usually doesn't take long for your issue to be dealt with, unless you have an unreasonable request or the issue is part of something that will only break down again when they add more features.  Sometimes, the bug that's causing you grief doesn't have a simple solution, so it takes longer than you would expect or hope for. This is where you exhibit a behavior called ""patience"". Turn off the game, play something else for a while, and relax. The world doesn't revolve around your demands, despite the old adage that ""The customer is always right.""  Sometimes, the customer can sit his/her ass down and shut the hell up."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,7,Sun Jun 14 21:41:55 2015 UTC,"I've put in almost 1500 hours into my server, so I have a lot of time invested into it.   And I didn't demand anything. My point is they put themselves into this situation by releasing on Friday night."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Soylent_gray,3,Mon Jun 15 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"Why is there a sweeping movement of just calling other players entitled? It always makes the person calling others entitled look like a child. And stop using the word deserve period. The devs want players, yes? Then they need to do what will keep the players, the customers who PAID for this game happy. Whatever silver platter nonsense you're talking about is as if we got the game for free and are whining about something small. This is different. Walking on flat surface and breaking both legs for weeks and weeks is also nonsense. So deserve is a weird word for this. The game was not fun and the devs finally got around to it, with limited communication. They don't NEED to communicate, but if they want loyal fans, they should."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Anderrn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"When the word fits the situation, people use it. It's this thing called speaking English. Words were invented a long time ago and given specific meanings and we use those words in their appropriate situations. When someone's first reaction to something that other people worked hard to deliver to them is ""You guys are retarded,"" then the word entitled fits that situation perfectly.  If you choose to act like you're in your terrible twos, even though you're clearly old enough to know better, people will call you on your bullshit.  I volunteer!"
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Not for nothing, but the only one in this thread who is throwing a tantrum is you.   The guy was stating that it was a matter of timing. If they released it on a Thursday, then they could choose to fix it during a business day (not that this exists in the indie development world). Even when you started calling him entitled (which is getting a bit old btw) he stayed calm and you moved on to another person. You should reduce the caffeine intake and take a breath."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,0,Sun Jun 14 23:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, calmly stating my case is definitely a tantrum, I can see where you got that idea, I'm clearly an escaped mental patient. Thank you for pointing that out."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Thelonous,-3,Mon Jun 15 01:56:09 2015 UTC,"Thanking I will do.  But it took people getting up in arms about something that has been around since beginning of 11 to get it fixed finally.  Our server noticed a major drop in population since 11 hit due to it.  People were complaining about broken legs constantly, and it became frustrating trying to find ways to make people's playing expereince better despite it."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Van_Tek,5,Sun Jun 14 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was the uproar that caused the fix. They've known about it since it started, so it seems more reasonable to assume that someone has been combing through the lines of code and experimenting with various solutions than to just assuming they've been sitting on the knowledge and intentionally ignoring the bug.  What limited knowledge of physics equations I possess tells me that trying to program realistic leg breaks due to falling from certain heights at certain speeds isn't easy to do."
7daystodie,39tfkg,Thelonous,4,Sun Jun 14 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"Fair enough- my issue was mainly they were not really communicating this.  The lack of communication has been an issue for awhile, and it caused people to be frustrated.  Also, the issue that happened with 11.6 was not there before hand, so it was something they introduced and was not properly tested.  From what I can tell, this was something happened on dedicated servers only, and in the past they have stated they don't test on them."
7daystodie,39tfkg,moremysterious,3,Sun Jun 14 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"Great news! I never really had leg break problems before 11.6, nice to hear it got fixed so quickly."

7daystodie,39tfkg,honeybadger21,3,Sun Jun 14 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I was the butt end of my buddies jokes the other night when I kept breaking my leg every 30 seconds! What a pain, but at the same time it was really hilarious."

7daystodie,39tfkg,Thelonous,5,Sun Jun 14 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"Not that I have been able to tell.  It looks like the fix solved the problem.  Been testing on my server and other players also have.  So far, no damage at all :)"
7daystodie,39tfkg,TribalDancer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"Sad day. I had no leg break problems before. Today mine broke 4 times in less than a game day. Once was just walking down some stairs. Once was falling from a 2-block height. I have been skeptical this was even a ""big deal"" given that I had never run into it. Now that it's ""fixed"", I am the latest victim! LOL"

7daystodie,39xe5h,MYCcreations,2,Mon Jun 15 16:05:34 2015 UTC,Funny story...  I was playing on my favorite PvE server with my son(13) when the server admin comes by to take a look at what we are building.  My son had a shotgun and the admin's avatar stepped out from behind a corner right in front of him.  And scaring the crap out of him.  BOOM Headshot.    One fragged admin.

7daystodie,39ucd3,Brandalf_the_grey,9,Sun Jun 14 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad start, but again, you need LOG SPIKES. Upgrade them as much as you can. Also, if there are enough of them, once zombies reach your door, they'll likely rip through it relatively quickly. One of the best things about starting out is getting to experiment with base ideas. Oh, and try to have two entrance/exits in case you do get ovverun. And some sort of look-out tower type thing will serve you well if you have the materials.  Also don't hesitate to ask as many noob questions as you need - we were all noobs once, it took me about a week and a half of playing before I made it past day 3. That was a joyous day indeed."
7daystodie,39ucd3,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:13:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, lol. Yeah, I'm working on some stuff. Added a layer of log spikes outside the moat, going to add a layer of log spikes around the top in the morning. Actually got my fiance to buy the game last night, this is our co-op progress so far. Got a long way to go, but it's going to be fun getting there."
7daystodie,39ucd3,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"Playing with a friend is always infinitely more fun. At least then if something goes wrong you can share the blame. Or you can run away as your partner in crime gets mauled, your call."
7daystodie,39ucd3,TribalDancer,2,Mon Jun 15 01:39:32 2015 UTC,Those spikes will not last long. The spikes you want are LOG SPIKES. The spikes you put down will be overrun and destroyed by any significant horde. Good luck!  For heat map info: http://7daystodie.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-20116.html  And to your last question: no. If they come up over that ridge they will drop in on you and eat you for lunch. You need a roof.
7daystodie,39ucd3,Van_Tek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"It's fun experimenting with base ideas, but when you first start up a new game, I've found the best thing to do is find a tall apartment building, go up to the roof, build some crates to stash gear, build a wood hatch to secure the hole at the top of the ladder, and then run around looting like crazy until you've got your survival and combat needs met. Then you can pretty much do whatever you want!  If you play with zombies who run at night, you'll want to line the edges of the roof with an outer lip of some sort, so that spider zombies won't be able to just climb right up the side of the building and eat your face off.  If you're paranoid about the wood hatch not being enough of a defense, you can build a small hut around the ladder's exit, leaving the sides open so you can shoot into the hut and kill zombies as they get to the top of the ladder."
7daystodie,39ucd3,snowdogJJJ,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:27:01 2015 UTC,This is great advice and is usually what I do in a new game.  Getting high up or far under ground is your best friend at night.
7daystodie,39ucd3,dobby420,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:07:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly the best policy is trial and error. There are a few designs that everyons sticks with because it's fool proof like the water moat and spikes or the tower over a bedrock pit. But mixing it up how you like it is much more fun.  This is what I did yesterday, I started out in a police station until I had found enough materials to start. Then after visiting caves to get iron ingots I moved into our manmade cave with my brother to make as much concrete mix and rebar frames as I could. http://i.imgur.com/jCR3vv2.jpg  Then once we had enough (just in time for day 7) we created this fort. The idea was that the supports were made of 4 x concrete and 4 x reinforced concrete. The housing made out of concrete so that zeds climbing gore blocks wouldn't penetrate instantly. The top mostly wood/concrete and access to the roof to kill the zeds.  http://i.imgur.com/YtTrpCl.jpg http://i.imgur.com/O43pbSZ.jpg"
7daystodie,39ucd3,Blaktoe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"That looks ok, but be warned they will tunnel into your base. Want to be safe? Dig a hole. Down to bedrock. Then clear out a room and make that your main crafting area. Then you can play around with building a neato base on top without risking everything.  There are some awesome bases and base building ideas in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFTUArvAyHc  Good luck!"

7daystodie,39ukev,WindAeris,2,Sun Jun 14 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"Edit:  doing a quick google, I have a better guess as to what the problem is.  Your friend's permission levels in his admin config file are probably set wrong.  You will want his permisison level to be lower or equal to each power granted.      <admins>         <admin steamID=""76561198021925107"" permission_level=""0"" />     </admins>    Above is the admin section from the serveradmin.xml file.   It is best for the head server admin to be set to 0, so that every permission with a level will be granted to them.  Typically a regular user is set at default of permission level 1000, lowest level.  So anything in between those is good for different permissions.   Hopefully I was able to explain that correctly.  If your friend is having probelms, get him to contact me on Reddit or Steam."

7daystodie,39tmhy,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"Great video btw to help beginners. Hell, I've been playing for a month and watched it just to see if there were any good tips for me.  I've started from scratch so many times now though. I just immediately make a stone axe, cut down a few trees, run near the 0,0 city. Looting all the goldenrod, small stones and cotton on the way. The trees I cut down give me plenty of wood to make arrows AND some secure wooden chests.   Find a mine, throw my shit in the chests. Make some frames for a door if I want, and boom. Instant base with resources behind you, lets you go out and loot the world and build up your supplies until you're ready to make a base."
7daystodie,39tmhy,Ahrk,0,Tue Jun 16 22:05:39 2015 UTC,Thanks pal! The only reason I wanted to show people how to make a base outside of a cave was that I wanted to cover all bases (excuse the pun) in that I wanted to do a tutorial that could be used for SP and MP alike - I know from experience on most MP servers due to the fact you so rightly state that most caves are already occupado!

7daystodie,39u8sa,cprogger70,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"It's VERY active. Just depends on what server you choose to play on. And every major alpha update requires the map to be wiped, so often times people take a break from the game until the update is released, so that they aren't wasting time building or scavenging."
7daystodie,39u8sa,Arik_De_Frasia,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yes the player base is very active, however... only for the first week or two of an update because server wipes are necessary and frequent. Also the ""end game"" is lacking currently so no real reason to continue after day 49 (the big hords stop then)"
7daystodie,39u8sa,Jeradox,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"I thought they were just more random after day 49, I know 49 is the number in the game file for the large horde spawn...but I thought I heard that they were just less predictable after day 49. Is there anything official on this?"

The first time I played it I was still a bit KoS-fraid from games like DayZ and H1Z1 and was afraid to meet people and get shot instantly or stabbed in the back.  In 7DTD game people actually help each other, you have a common goal wich lacks with the other games mentioned before. (maybe it depends on the server)  You pay for 7DTD and get the full game. H1Z1 is going to be ""Free to play"", don't pay for it in Early Acces."
7daystodie,39u8sa,MCRoadkill,-5,Tue Jun 16 13:05:09 2015 UTC,Well H1Z1 is a more finished game than 7D2D is right now so I guess buy that instead. This game still has a ton of things that need to be fixed/added.
7daystodie,39u8sa,Syncyy,11,Sun Jun 14 21:38:36 2015 UTC,I prefer voxel building to just putting down a prefab.
7daystodie,39u8sa,KungFuHamster,3,Sun Jun 14 22:00:55 2015 UTC,I have no clue how anyone who has played both can say that.   H1Z1 is just a Sandbox Shooter pretending to be a Zombie Survival game. It has no content for people outside of placing some prefab garbage base pieces and shooting one another.

7daystodie,39spa7,TheHiddenYouTuber,4,Sun Jun 14 11:37:27 2015 UTC,"All survival games have an inherent problem, in that they are a series of challenges which eventually  stop being problems. You are starving until you build a farm, then you're never hungry again. You're freezing until you make clothes, and then you are always warm. You are scared until you make machine guns, then nothing can touch you. This is an inherent power creep which results in an inverse difficulty curve, it starts hard and gets easy. This is the exact opposite of how game difficulty is meant to work, resulting in new players being intimidated and old players being bored. This can never be solved by simply scaling the base difficulty, the systems themselves need to become more challenging and unexpected over time. To this end, I would like to see late game content which becomes ever more difficult and unpredictable."
7daystodie,39spa7,PossAbilities,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"They've been taking strides to doing this happily. With the addition of new top end items, and also the need to level, fighting hordes and going scavenging in the Gravestown type destroyed wasteland cities is more rewarding. Also added in are the 7th night feral hordes which scale up in difficulty on the 14th night, 21st night, etc. Then there's also the Feral zombie who has a tremendous health pool and is actually very dangerous, but also possessing a much greater loot table than all other zombies.  Of course, I've been playing the game since Alpha 1, and of course I get bored when I reach the end game during a patch cycle just like all other experienced players. It's just nice to see that The Fun Pimps are taking steps in extending and improving upon the late game. :)"
7daystodie,39spa7,Deathmckilly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:12:10 2015 UTC,Well said.
7daystodie,39spa7,Palin_Sees_Russia,5,Tue Jun 16 05:46:14 2015 UTC,"I would add spawns of living survivors that are hostile to the players, armed with melee weapons/bows, and have caches of goods stockpiled that they guard. They could also send out small groups of ""scavengers"" that are hostile to zombies and players alike that may attack a player's stronghold in an attempt to steal supplies.  Alternatively/additionally I would add roaming patrols of armed military sent in to ""sterilize"" the area.  Both groups would be more active during the day and stationary at night, possibly gravitating to structures in an attempt to wait out the darkness. After nightfall they would produce light sources potentially making them easier to spot. As the zombies get deadlier, the humans get more avoidable and vice versa. This would add a potential hazard to the daylight hours late game to balance with the increased danger at night."
7daystodie,39spa7,Insanity-pepper,2,Wed Jun 17 15:38:06 2015 UTC,Sound amazing! :D
7daystodie,39spa7,MaverickMcBeef,2,Thu Jun 18 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, how sweet would it be to add factions into the game? Maybe for the most part NPC's keep to themselves, but later in the game factions naturally branch out and start conflicting with one another's areas and you see wars waging off in the distance and can even get caught in the middle of a war yourself.  Maybe you are warned that a faction will be heading your way soon by the 7th day and you can either prepare to fend them off or gather as much of your supplies as you can and hit the road before they arrive."
7daystodie,39spa7,Insanity-pepper,2,Mon Jun 22 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"I like that. A lot. It would take things in a sort of Walking Dead direction where the zombies are a framing device, more like a force of nature than the story itself, that the human element exists and has its own drama around.  I'm almost getting a Stalker vibe from the idea with less mutants."

It leads to an underground bunker that is overrun with zombies. The loot is extremely rewarding but the tight spaces and lack of light makes it a deadly place. It would be huge, perhaps the size of a city, but with a maze like layout with about 3 different levels. Would be pretty cool as it forces you to stay outside during a horde, which is unthinkable. But you may get to day 21 and need a challenge."

Unfortunately,  you are forced to kill her.

There are alot of good streamers out there which really explain how to get started. My favourite is Kage848, he explains quite well and tries to show you everything along the way.   Once you have some basics down, try em out on you own on single player with difficulty dropped a bit. Then Id say join into multiplayer. There aren`t too many people that have the time or patience to show you everything. I myself am just trying enough time to platy at all! Anyway good luck"

It's something a tad special for an old cynic like me, the crafting, style, fear of certain zombies and approach to how you want to survive in your own custom world is unique to me.    I've gotten far with just my cousin playing this, we've had 3 maps so far during multiple alpha builds and at this point we're waiting for Alpha 12 to continue playing, don't let that put you off, it's a sign that we trust the devs to give something to this product that makes us not want to get burnt out before the new content arrives.    Get some mates, have some patience, SURVIVE and THEN build. Hope you enjoy it and enjoy the developers passion for this little game."
7daystodie,39q8s5,ShabbyOrange,2,Sat Jun 13 22:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, the bad thing about randomly generated worlds (that is, ones that go on forever and aren't the map...Navezone or whatever) is that even in a decently populated server, it's sometimes hard to find a lot of players. However playing with other players is, for the most part, a completely different experience compared to DayZ/H1Z1 or any other survival game. More often than not, players are MUCH more likely to help other players than to shoot on sight."

7daystodie,39q8s5,Mascapone,3,Sat Jun 13 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"7 Days is definitely better. I have both those games and they are nice but pale in comparison. Building in this game is more robust, for one--think more Minecraft, but with actual physics (blocks won't float in air, spans cannot be infinite, etc). The threat of zombies is very real and heart-stopping. Lots of dials to tweak to make it easier or harder as you are less experienced/more experienced in the game. Map can be infinite and is randomly generated so every game has its own personality, if you will. And this is just in Alpha!"
7daystodie,39q8s5,TribalDancer,2,Sat Jun 13 22:29:25 2015 UTC,"Played savage lands. 7 days is much more put together. It's a lot of fun, especially with a friend(s). It's good solo also. It started with two of us, and we now have ten family and friends on our server. Updates are great. You get the feeling devs are constantly making it better. For an alpha, its very solid."

I would say the PVP isn't that great but it was also not what I was really looking for. If you are looking for a good survival & zombie game then this is probably one of the best options. The game DID NOT start off very well, but there have been a lot of great overhauls since its release (graphics, crafting, UI, zombies, and other things). It's also worth it to note that there are 2 types of maps, one which is called something like ""Navezone"" which is a map with boundaries and locations/biomes set in place, and others that are randomly generated maps...most servers have randomly generated maps so you get a unique experience every time you join a different server."

Don't know if there's a vertical clearance requirement more than just the height of the plant, though. Both he and I had three blocks between the ceiling and dirt. Corn grows 2 blocks high. Haven't tested trees, though I've seen it mentioned that if there is something above them, no matter how high, they won't grow. I'd like to test that some day."

The single player experience is awesome for experiencing the horror side of 7 Days. The game feels exponentially less spooky when you're playing with a cooperative group, or even just one other player. Soon as people log off and voice chat goes silent though... The tension."
7daystodie,39rgso,Rixiot,7,Sun Jun 14 01:26:10 2015 UTC,Works perfectly fine in sp if you like sp survival.  It will be a challenge until you learn the game but then it becomes very playable.  Co op is where its at imo so find a buddy or two once you have the mechanics sorted.
7daystodie,39rgso,Togfox,3,Sun Jun 14 01:23:34 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Co-op is truly the most enjoyable way to play Imo too.
7daystodie,39rgso,djcollyder,5,Sun Jun 14 03:12:51 2015 UTC,If anything you should start in sp until you learn the in's and outs of survival and crafting. That will make you better experienced for mp survival.

7daystodie,39rgso,Blaktoe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:35:15 2015 UTC,You will get very bored playing solo. Hosting a co-op game is amazing. If you can rent a server that'll make it even better. That way either of you can play when the other is not and still still build and survive in the same world. My buddu rents his own private server. It's awesome. J

I bought this game when is was A9 on the summer sale, and have played over 400 hours. It's a great game. Got my husband hooked on it as well.  Survival is the key. There are constantly hordes wandering around--you can clear most areas with a little work for a period of time, but there is still a chance of wandering hordes coming through, and there are feral hordes every 7 days. They get worse with every multiple of 7 so you need to improve your tools, weapons, and defenses as you advance as a player.  You can play locally on your own computer, host a multi-player on your computer (people can log in only when you are online), or host a game on an external server (people can log in anytime). Very flexible in this regard.  Do NOT buy if you don't want to be part of an Alpha experience. That means they are still in active development, tweaking the dials here and there, smashing bugs as they can. You will sometimes run into video glitches, gameplay affecting bugs, etc. Our job is to help test this thing, so you need to be willing to work around these things sometimes. That said, I have run into close to zero showstopper bugs since A10 (there was a menu problem on some Mac OS early in the Alpha 10 release where I couldn't get into the game at all. It was fixed eventually, no trouble like that since).  The closest thing to a roadmap is their Kickstarter campaign, which outlined their general idea of how the game would grow. Don't look at it as a bible, though. The promised goals are already coming to fruition, but the linked video may or may not have elements which will make it into the game. Again, it's all part of the Alpha experience. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/7daystodie/7-days-to-die-zombie-survival-game  Please feel free to ping us with more questions! But truly, friend: BUY THIS GAME. You will get your money's worth."

7daystodie,39q9xg,GerbilKor,2,Sat Jun 13 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"There is no end, the days continue indefinitely and you get a big hoard on each 7th day. No building material is 100% zombie-proof, and it's unlikely one will ever be added. You can play single player without a server.

You guys appear to have re-introduced the bug where the game remembers your fall speed and kills you the instant you gently touch the ground except now it is doing this with no fall speed.  Please lower the fall damage again.  That should make the game playable again.  Right now broken legs are much worse than before.
7daystodie,39ms72,Devils_-_Advocate,7,Fri Jun 12 23:34:57 2015 UTC,I feel like the game's base features shouldn't be engineered to work with a specific mod.
7daystodie,39ms72,Defenerate,4,Sat Jun 13 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"A mod created by a dev of the game? A mod that one day will simply be part of the game package, but right now is simply out as a mod? A mod that 95% of servers use?  Yeah, the game shouldn't be engineered to work with a mod the the game's developers engineered and everyone uses"
7daystodie,39ms72,hatch_bbe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:07:16 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, didn't know that it was an official mod, that changes things."
7daystodie,39ms72,Smegzor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:39:21 2015 UTC,It's more complicated than that because it's not actually official. It's just that they hired the guy that creates it so it's assumed that the mod will be integrated into the main game at some point.
7daystodie,39ms72,Defenerate,2,Sun Jun 14 14:41:59 2015 UTC,Actually Alloc was hired by TFP. They have partially rolled his mod into the server and we have the awkward situation where a patch is released ahead of his mod being updated.  The delay isn't long but it would be nice if they included all of his mod instead of just cherry picking some of its features.  It would mean that our job as admins isn't compromised every time we update. At the very least they should include his LCBs and his tele command.
7daystodie,39ms72,Defttone,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:49:02 2015 UTC,"Okay yeah that's a different story. I do still feel like the game in Alpha is to be expected to break even an official mod, though."

7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,3,Sat Jun 13 01:18:57 2015 UTC,Sits back in the wheel chair after leg breaks again Fuuuuuuck
7daystodie,39ms72,Van_Tek,10,Sat Jun 13 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"You guys are retarded. Now everyone is breaking legs constantly, even dying from slight falls. Teleporting kills people.   And once again you released a patch Friday night, so you won't hotfix till Monday. Sometimes I think TFP is just trolling players.  Edit: Oh, we didn't read the patch notes correctly:   Fixed fall damage was set too low   Meaning, ""Fixed: Fall damage was set too low"", in other words they made it higher. Indeed, TFP is trolling us all."
7daystodie,39ms72,Smegzor,3,Fri Jun 12 23:29:09 2015 UTC,Who said we don't work weekends? As a matter of fact we have been working on this issue today.
7daystodie,39ms72,OnceIthought,3,Sun Jun 14 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"The whole ""Alpha"" and ""Beta"" concept confuses a lot of people these days.  People who understand that it's a work in progress involving a lot of experimental math equations that can end up with surprising results also understand that you guys are kicking ass all over the place.  For this, we thank you heartily. Keep making this kickass game, you talented maniacs!"
7daystodie,39ms72,Thelonous,8,Sun Jun 14 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the point was making fall damage higher.  If they had not done that, legs might not be breaking more often than they were.  Why was it necessary to offset one fix with something worse?"
7daystodie,39ms72,slrrp,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"While leg breaking was overly common, fall damage did seem pretty low in my experience, though somewhat inconsistent. I fell off of my 17 block high base several times while experimenting with the architecture and only took 1/3rd health bar damage at most (around 110-120 wellness). Of course there were a couple obvious glitch moments, like when I fell two blocks and it killed me from full health."
7daystodie,39ms72,keef984,9,Sun Jun 14 06:37:11 2015 UTC,"as much as i typically disagree with comments like this, i have to agree.  This is bloody annoying.  Please just get more people back on patching alpha 11 so it works instead of putting in new features.  If you just devote the time required to it, i am sure this whole thing can be fixed once and for all."
7daystodie,39ms72,Thelonous,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:34:11 2015 UTC,I've abandoned this game until some competent devs can fix an issue as trivial as legs breaking.
7daystodie,39ms72,KungFuHamster,-4,Sat Jun 13 05:19:59 2015 UTC,The increased fall DAMAGE- which was nominal; they also fixed the glitch that you're griping about. Please go out and buy a brain next time you flame
7daystodie,39ms72,Behltane,14,Fri Jun 12 23:35:34 2015 UTC,I am not just randomly blowing hot air.  I just updated my server and have been getting constant complaints about deaths and broken legs from teleporting.  Please refrain from insulting others before you actually look into the issue being mentioned.
7daystodie,39ms72,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Fri Jun 12 23:38:19 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it's the developer's fault that a third-party mod is causing problems, regardless of how popular it is.  To me, arbitrary teleporting takes away 99% of the difficulty of the game."
7daystodie,39ms72,Thelonous,6,Sat Jun 13 12:58:57 2015 UTC,Maybe if tedium is your idea of difficulty.  A teleport back to base once an hour does not ezmode make.
7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,2,Sat Jun 13 13:42:09 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it's the developer's fault that a third-party mod is causing problems   The mod isn't causing problems. Breaking a leg when falling a distance of 2 blocks is what is causing problems. It wasn't that way before the patch, it's gotten worse and they supposedly fixed it.   Falling two blocks is like jumping from 5-6 feet onto the ground. Do people break their legs in this scenario in real life? Maybe 1% of the time? It's not realistic"
7daystodie,39ms72,Smegzor,2,Sat Jun 13 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"You are correct that the issue with teleporting isn't the dev's fault.  But the problem doesn't stem from there. The issue is with the fall damage being broken.  One easily breaks legs in numerous other situations such as coming off an end of ladder or randomly falling off a one-high block.  The teleporting is just the most obvious and quickest one.  The flaw is in how it the damage is calculated.  As a note, though, the mod is extremely useful in other ways besides teleporting and is created and maintained by one of their staff.  It needs to be to just integrated into the game since it makes it much less difficult to admin a server with it."
7daystodie,39ms72,keef984,9,Sat Jun 13 13:54:56 2015 UTC,Have you played 11.6 yet?
7daystodie,39ms72,keef984,5,Fri Jun 12 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"Now play the new patch.  If you can last a day without dying from random fall damage, I will be impressed.  Difficulty:  You can't just stand on the spot for 1 day."
7daystodie,39ms72,Smegzor,0,Fri Jun 12 23:42:55 2015 UTC,done and done- issue hasnt come up
7daystodie,39ms72,keef984,-15,Sat Jun 13 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"PS the game is in alpha, so don't invent pretend problems because you're embarrassed about being wrong."
7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,14,Sat Jun 13 01:20:42 2015 UTC,These aren't pretend problems.  Stop trolling.
7daystodie,39ms72,slrrp,-5,Sat Jun 13 01:29:07 2015 UTC,The comment you posted below says otherwise :[
7daystodie,39ms72,TribalDancer,5,Sat Jun 13 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"Using the excuse ""the game is in alpha"" only works the first few dozen botched patches. Alpha or not, they have no quality control or proper testing prior to releasing an update.   Also, it's a Kickstarter funded game, and they have little to no communication with the player base about upcoming fixes or current bugs. Even the release notes have very little information on what exactly has been changed. They are treating this like their own little project and we just get in their way."
7daystodie,39ms72,SpectreFire,5,Sat Jun 13 05:14:35 2015 UTC,"Using the excuse ""the game is in alpha""   I hate this more than anything I've encountered on this sub. Sorry but it's been weeks (months?) since A11 and this shit should be an easy fix. It's not necessarily that the bug is the issue (it's certainly an annoyance) but the inability of the dev team to fix this raises concerns that they are not competent enough to put out a polished product."
7daystodie,39ms72,Behltane,2,Sat Jun 13 05:24:44 2015 UTC,"and this shit should be an easy fix.   Obviously it's not. Comments like this always confuse me. Do you really think TFP is sitting around drinking beers and going, ""I guess we should get to that super simple leg-breaking bug. Nah! Let's do some lines of coke instead!""  If it were so easy IT WOULD BE DONE. That fact it is not done points to the fact that IT IS NOT EASY.  These guys are inventing whole systems for physics, random generation of terrain, and physical toughness/wellness, ALL AT ONCE. These systems may often interact in ways that are unpredictable, and it takes time to pinpoint the issue and tackle it while maintaining the gains you made in other areas of the system. This is complex. Give them a break."
7daystodie,39ms72,OnceIthought,0,Sat Jun 13 20:14:08 2015 UTC,The game is selling for money. There should be proper and competent big fixing.
7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,4,Sun Jun 14 01:12:00 2015 UTC,Please do some research before parroting what we all just saw and flaunting your ignorance.
7daystodie,39ms72,OnceIthought,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe time to take a break from the game. A portion of the patch was botched. Okay, but being insulting? Report the problem, even say it's frustrating or irritating if you feel you must, and move on. Unless it's hindering your livelihood or somehow causing physical harm it's not worth getting that upset. Take some time to check out something in your library that you haven't played yet, or go do something else entirely.  As far as pushing it out on Friday, people have been complaining about the problem and demanding that it be fixed right now for a while. So TFP probably pushed it as soon as they thought it was ready. Even if they weren't working the weekend, which /u/dafuqz has made clear that they are, it was an attempt to make it better for people. Had it worked, which it appears it did in some cases as myself and others do seem to have a lower frequency of breaks, it would have made for a great weekend surprise for players. We've all been there when stuff goes sour on a Friday. We determine whether it's important enough to lose the weekend, or if it can wait until Monday. Hopefully if that ever happens to you those affected don't tell you you're retarded and lazy before giving you a chance to fix it. That'd be pretty demeaning.  Even major developers have put out bad patches for games in full release. It happens."
7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,0,Sun Jun 14 07:21:02 2015 UTC,"I've been running a server since Alpha 8, with a community of hundreds of players. This happens every single patch. They have stated numerous times they don't support multiplayer or dedicated servers. Had they tested this patch on MP for a few minutes, it would have been an obvious issue.   But MP is not in their vision of the game. All the mods that you see on the servers (like the ability to teleport) are hacks created by players. Even the land claim block was created by a player. Yet TFP still treats MP like second class."
7daystodie,39ms72,OnceIthought,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"Had they tested this patch on MP for a few minutes   Unfortunately I can't find an employee count of TFP, but I get the impression they don't have hundreds or even dozens of in-house testers. With that limited number they have there's a reasonable possibility that with their test they wouldn't have seen the issue since, as I and others have experienced, the problem is not universal. We are the big test team that does that. That's what signing up for an alpha is. There are plenty of stories from professional testers about sending the same bugs back to the devs dozens of times, in some cases being told to ignore the problem until the next release. It can be frustrating for both the devs and testers, but it's how games are made.   This happens every single patch.   By every account I have read and heard the game is working better and better. Just because every problem isn't fixed by a patch doesn't negate that. Three things fixed, one thing broken? Still progress.    MP is not in their vision of the game… TFP still treats MP like second class.   I can’t find anything where they’ve said this, but I’m not going to spend more than the few minutes I already have searching for it.  On the opposite end there was Doc’s statement (albeit poorly written) that they are rolling everything into the multiplayer model. You mention at least one feature that became a standard in the game, the claim blocks. Nothing was said about intentionally breaking teleporting, and now that they know about the problem if it isn’t fixed when they figure out why leg-breaking got worse for some people they can work on resolving that as well. If they don’t give it their complete focus that’s because it’s not game-breaking, but someone will probably be tasked with working on it as it was a feature specifically commissioned for the game. All that said if you truly have that negative of a view of their competence and outlook then what I said still stands: Take a break. You do this for leisure. If it's not fun and instead causing you that much stress that a mistake instantly makes you as angry as you seem it doesn't matter if your server hosts hundreds of players. You don't have to pull the plug immediately. Let them know a few days in advance that you're taking a break.  You are responsible for your own happiness. I'm not demeaning your frustration. You're invested in this game, but there is such a thing as caring too much. I've been in the same position. The words in your OP immediately reminded me of my own mindset at the time. I realized that a combination of factors from various aspects of my life were resulting in frustration in a game that I realized I was overly invested in. The only obvious factor I had the power to change was the time I spent playing something that was no longer making me happier than it was frustrating me. I took a step back and did other things I had been wanting to find time for. Some of the other problems passed, and others became more manageable. While that was going on the issues I had with the game had been largely resolved. I came back to it and the friends who played and it was much more enjoyable.  The game will still be here, and it might be fun to play again for you."
7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,0,Sun Jun 14 18:08:33 2015 UTC,LT pretty much sums it up with this and this post
7daystodie,39ms72,Van_Tek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate, but I think Madmole is pretty spot on. Even Doc, who we've seen can be rather crass (and why he's not really participating in the forums anymore as of recently), has valid points. The game was not proposed as an MMO. It looks like the performance issues started occurring when they went live with Unity 5. Newer engine with more capability in terms of voxel based gameplay, but that probably comes with some higher demands. From a project management standpoint it makes much more sense to continue progress on game-building instead of stopping, re-gearing, and focusing on netcode that could very well be resolved as Unity 5 itself is updated into the future. Who knows, maybe when they do get to optimization the capabilities of the game will again surprisingly surpass expectations."
7daystodie,39ms72,hatch_bbe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:29:49 2015 UTC,Who said we don't support multiplayer? The entire game is MP. SP is just a private multiplayer local server...
7daystodie,39ms72,Soylent_gray,2,Sun Jun 14 16:44:21 2015 UTC,I should have been more specific: dedicated servers with more than 12 players.
7daystodie,39ms72,Cragvis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"Since you don't seem to understand what's going on:  Alpha is for feature implementation, Beta is for bug fixing. Once upon a time, companies did their alpha testing in-house and rarely even let outsiders play their beta testing phases.  Now, this early access stuff is a thing and it's got ups and downs. The upside, you can be a part of crafting and testing a game before it's finished. You can say that you were part of something awesome and helped with suggestions to make it even more awesome.  The downside, of course, is that a lot of people seem to think they're paying for a finished product, despite being told up-front when purchasing the unfinished game that it is in fact a game in progress. I repeat. The game is NOT finished. It's not even into the Beta phase, where the bugs are fixed.  This means that people are lucky that the developers DO listen to them and attempt to fix the worst bugs in order to try and give us a pleasant experience testing their game.  One might argue that this is simply good business strategy, but the truth of the matter is that until they roll out the full version of the game, they don't owe you a damn thing.  You agreed to play an unfinished game and that's what you're doing. This means you agreed that you would put up with bugs during this phase, because they were open and honest in informing you that there would in fact be many bugs along the way.  I don't know much about making games, but what little programming experience I have tells me that it's an incredibly complex process involving an insane amount of experimentation using math formulae that would make an advanced statistics student cry. Combine this with the fact that every person on the team has their own unique coding style and that sometimes those coding styles don't mesh well and you've got yourself a big ol' mess of code to sort through any time something goes sideways.  If you're unhappy with the current phase of the game's development, you're not being forced to continue playing and I encourage you to uninstall it for a while and focus on other games. By the time you're ready to give it another shot, your issue will likely be fixed and the world will be a merry place once more. That's what I'm currently doing with DayZ and The Forest.  The beauty of an ever-evolving early access game is that things change rapidly under the direction of strong developers, which The Fun Pimps most definitely are. Maybe they don't know everything about how to implement their design choices before they attempt them, but at least they DO attempt things and if those things don't work, they go to town trying to fix them."
7daystodie,39ms72,comandobee,0,Sun Jun 14 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest they've been pretty amateur from the start when in their Kickstarter they declared they were not really an indie dev due to the fact some of their staff worked on triple A titles in the past. Fact is they're an independent developer because they don't have a publishing company.    Then it's just been bad planning, terrible setting of expectations and scope creep ever since. The only thing they have going for them is their work ethic and the fact they keep banging this stuff out; maybe they will eventually get there. But I've lost all faith they actually know what they are doing or even know what they are trying to do."
7daystodie,39ms72,Cragvis,2,Sun Jun 14 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"If you look a little closer at their AAA credentials, it was only two of them, and they did stuff like testing, logo design, and some lighting work.

7daystodie,39nmwa,TheCurlz,7,Sat Jun 13 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, zombies can still destroy blocks. That's kind of the point of the game - building yourself a box out of wood just won't cut it in the long term. You have to loot, mine and craft better materials to upgrade your base and prepare traps. You can get creative and build over water, go underground, or even just say fuck it and live out your days as a nomad.  There are plenty of multiplayer servers, both PvP and PvE depending on your tastes. The amount of players a server can hold varies - some might only hold 12, others might hold up to 64. You just have to look around and find one that suits your play style.  And as I said, there are both PvE and PvP serves. Some people might still KoS but on most of the servers I've played on, I've found that people tend to help each other out and work together. Meanwhile I prefer to be left alone, and I've never had a problem with that either. The 7DtD community is so varied that I can guarantee you'll find a server that suits you, and if not, the game is still plenty enjoyable in single player/with a couple of friends.  Basically, get it while it's on sale. It will be well worth the money."
7daystodie,39nmwa,procrastinatorgrrl,3,Sat Jun 13 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. So they can also destroy strong blocks, other than wood? E.g. metals, rocks, etc?  Good to know there is a variety of servers, thanks!"
7daystodie,39nmwa,procrastinatorgrrl,5,Sat Jun 13 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they can destroy anything in the game, aside from bedrock. Metal, stone, even reinforced concrete. Obviously the stronger the block, the longer it takes them to destroy.   Also I haven't seen the Roosterteeth lets play but I'm going to assume it's at least a few alpha's old. The game has moved on a LOT since then."
7daystodie,39nmwa,Deathmckilly,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was back in Alpha 7 if I recall correctly, and they just used very weak log cabin wood for their walls so zombies broke through it rather quickly. They also tried to make a trench around their base with dirt and found out that zombies will tunnel through that even faster than the wood. The ending to the last of those lets plays they did was rather spectacular and good for a laugh.  As for the current game, you can make wooden frames and upgrade them with extra wood and also scrap metal to make them very strong. You can then make cobblestone walls which are stronger yet, but require stone and gravel instead of just wood. The best walls are reinforced concrete, which take a fair bit of metal to make in addition to even more stone and gravel, and once the Alpha 12 patch hits we'll be able to upgrade them even further with steel plating (Alpha 12 also adds the ability to make steel). Even without the steel plating, reinforced concrete can withstand a tremendous amount of damage from the zombies."
7daystodie,39nmwa,Arik_De_Frasia,4,Sat Jun 13 08:01:42 2015 UTC,"Zombies can destroy literally everything. But the stronger the material, the longer it takes for them to do it.

This is a game that can easily be played single player as well, or really good with one or two friends. With some of the A12 updates around the corner, we're going to be getting vehicles and a tonne of new stuff, so this is defiantly the time to on-board."

You can find servers with really friendly people, and then there are many private ones to keep  out the assholes.  And i don't understand why you would be upset that zombies break through blocks.  Thats the whole purpose of the game..  to get better blocks that are stronger and can hold off more zombies.

I still regret Rust, there's little to no PvE content so you're constantly forced to play with others.   I haven't played DayZ, I'm not sure DayZ has a crafting system and lacks the creative construction options 7 Days has.   Community is just like any other game. It can be good or bad. If you're playing public servers expect to be killed on sight.   Personally I prefer to play on small private PvE servers.  As for settling down it's pretty simple once you get your log spikes planted and supply lines secured. Just keep in mind everything you do generates map heat and that will attract zombies on your location. It's commonly suggested to build your camp fires and forges away from your living space."

7daystodie,39nmwa,ProfRigglesniff,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"On sale today for $9.99, $15.99 for a 2 pack.  I reccomend getting it if you want a more realistic Minecraft game, the devs really care about the player base and have been working hard for over a year and a half to make the game what it is today.  That said, it's a long way from release, because the dev team is small and they work diligently before releasing content."
7daystodie,39nmwa,Zajaka,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"Remember it is an alpha, so you are buying into the developer as well as the game. If you visit the web site, you can see the changes that are planned for alpha 12. They are rather ambitious.  For what it sells for today, ~$10 on sale, it will definitely live up to the purchase price. I've put over a hundred hours in with friends myself"
7daystodie,39nmwa,Akiruu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Has this changed? Or do they still have the ability to destroy everything in the game?   Yes they can still tear through even the highest strength walls, but not in a few hits. This makes you need to have traps or a defense system around your base if you want to stay in one place. The ""hordes"" of zombies don't come until Day 7's night, so you have plenty of time to prepare.   Also are there and multiplayer servers, if so what is the maximum amount of players that the servers can hold?   Yes, some claim 100 but the most I've had on one server with a steady connection was around 20-30 players.   Also what is the community like? Is it kill on sight or do people try to cooperate and leave each other alone?   Both, it's really a toss up. Some servers are PvE only and PvPing will get you banned. Other servers you'll be killed even if you have nothing of value.   Is it worth getting this game now or should I wait a little while longer?   It was worth it a year ago as I've put over 1200 hours into it (Before that I was into Minecraft and logged around 500 hours). Right now it's on sale for $9.99 and I can't think of a better zombies/voxel building game for less than $10 period. I would argue the game is well worth $25 (cheaper than minecraft)."

The survival bar is higher than minecraft, but not nearly so high that it can cover for how limited the crafting and building is at the moment.  It shouldn't take modders to flesh out the XML files; one of the devs seriously needs to sit down with a block and item catalogue and make sure that every single one of them is hooked back into the crafting system... Make those recipes drive the player's exploration in search of parts and materials.  There's so much wasted scope with existing content, just for the lack of one cohesive XML. It's immensely frustrating."

7daystodie,39kq8w,Suzuki_Makoto,10,Fri Jun 12 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"Possibly, the answer to that is that the game is not intended to be PVP. It is generally meant to be cooperative survival against a horde of monsters. The developers are feeding that form of the game rather than the DayZ model, rightfully so given DayZ's player base has been drying up of late."
7daystodie,39kq8w,Azmodan_Kijur,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"But the cause for the drying up is that all those games are incredibly dull, especially Dayz that seems to utilize a model of ""take the money and run"" development.   I feel it is a terrible waste and I am not alone with this opinion because I have many friends among 7DTD server owners/runners and I had a server of my own, that it is a TERRIBLE WASTE of potential for 7DTD.  How about they actually rewrite the whole netcode from scratch for the A12 release? They just keep adding more and more content which is really cool, and I know they need to keep improving the visuals because that is the primary way how to get money from selling games these days BUT I believe that if they rewrote the netcode to a proper one they would find a lot of returning players aswell as new ones."
7daystodie,39kq8w,Azmodan_Kijur,6,Fri Jun 12 13:36:15 2015 UTC,"On DayZ, that is certainly partly to blame, but the core mechanic of that game became the PVP. The zombie apocalypse was an afterthought and the zombies themselves were little more than a nuisance. It has become a mad dash for the few known loot spawns. Once the player has that, it becomes a game about taking pot-shots at newbies just joining the game. It results in, as you said, a very dull game. I am not playing any game to become an NPC for someone else. Fuck that - I'll stick to other SP games in that case.  I can't see that the game, in its current state, is a terrible waste of potential. Unlike DayZ and many others, the threat of the apocalypse functions in 7 Days. Going about and being a PVPer should always be a very dangerous activity in such a game. Roaming the countryside and preying on the living while the dead seek your flesh never made much sense to me. That said, you can be a PVPer in the game as-is, but as the direction of the game is not to be competitive like that, it is not the focus."
7daystodie,39kq8w,giltirn,8,Fri Jun 12 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"This. The reason I avoid PvP ""survival"" games like the plague; they just become infested with griefers/bullies reliving their glory days on the school playground."
7daystodie,39kq8w,Azmodan_Kijur,4,Fri Jun 12 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Generally, you will find that the griefers and bullies of these situations tend to be younger overall and rife with immaturity. Not to say that all PVPers are like that - a ""proper"" PVPer is, in my opinion, someone that seeks the challenge of fighting other players in a fair manner. Attacking a fortified base with a plan and some fellow guns to take down that player. I can see that being potentially entertaining.   Unfortunately, many PVPers are not looking for a challenge - they are looking for prey. The weaker the position of that player, the better. Take the DayZ example again - people that rush the loot spawns and then spend hours gunning down new players just joining are not SUPAR HARDCORE UBER-EXPERT GAMING GODS!!!!1111!!!one!!! They are assholes with nothing better to do than ruin the playtime of someone else for their own joy. Power to them if that's what they want, but I flatly refuse to be the bullet cushion for their pent up aggressive and childish behavior.  Again, not all PVPers are like this, but way, way too many are. There is a reason that we have the term griefer. And there is a reason why many servers for games out there have switched to white listing, instead of black listing. Take the people you trust - not the asshats that think that gunning people down is the only fun to be had in a non-deathmatch type game.  As an aside, I don't play much online for this reason. That and my gaming time is a precious commodity. I'm 35 - I have a full time job, a home to take care of and a loving wife. I have limited time for gaming - which I have no complaints about. But in that limitation, I must use that time to have as much fun as I am able. Getting killed repeatedly by a jackass with nothing but time on his or her hands is not in the fun card deck."
7daystodie,39kq8w,Gorian,4,Fri Jun 12 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"This is my take on gaming too. I have friends I'd play Battlefield with, and we'd get in a map and spawn and die for 2 or 3 rounds. I'd leave and go find a different server and get ""but we can make it, just do something different"" etc. Sorry, I work fulltime. If I game, I want it to be fun. If I spawn and die from a player in any game, I'm leaving. I'm not rage quitting. I'm not a poor sport. I am just prioritizing my time to FUN things, and being a target with no way to fight back against something camping the server spawn area with a shotgun isn't fun.  On top of that, so often, in perpetual environment games like this, it IS a matter of time. I have a couple hours a day, for maybe a few days a week to play. But my base is sitting there 24/7, and some kid with 8 hours a day in a different timezone while I'm sleeping can just sit there and beat on my reinforced iron door with his fist for hours while I sleep. At that point, no matter of skill or architecture ability can make a difference if they have more time than I do."
7daystodie,39kq8w,Azmodan_Kijur,3,Fri Jun 12 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I have limited time - the price of growing up I suppose. So as I've mature, so has my gaming. No longer am I able to devote endless hours to a game not have the time to give my skills to stay competitive. I have things that I need to do such that gaming to 'beat' someone is not even on the radar. I want to have fun with my hobby."
7daystodie,39kq8w,giltirn,5,Fri Jun 12 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"I am of the stronger opinion that PvP has no place at all in this game.   The problem is that as soon as you start a PvP game, the game becomes completely about the other players, and the zombies are just a distraction. You don't collect weapons and build your base to defend against zombies; you do it to defend against other players. The environment no longer matters.   It doesn't matter whether you are a mature PvPer or an immature one. The game instantly becomes identical to H1Z1/Rust/DayZ/Ark/every other ""survival"" game on the market up to minor mechanical differences.   Worse, the devs end up spending all their time addressing PvP ""balance"" issues while the actual point of the game, the zombies, go fallow. Eventually PvE players get bored and leave, and the PvP community takes over. Heck, the devs might just end up removing the zombies entirely, like they did in Rust (and I think DayZ).   For the love of God, please keep PvP away from this game!"

I want to play 7DTD. Rust actually had an infected threat when the game started, and then they ditched them altogether because why bother? PvP became the focus because anything else was incidental.  I am not interested in 7DTD becoming anything like that. If PvP were somehow more realistic, I would love to play wondering if the person I am coming up on is friend or foe; but honestly in today's gaming world 99% are just 12-19 year olds (if not physically than mentally) griefing other gamers to make themselves feel more powerful, plain and simple.

Nothing worst than bleeding to death because a dog bit you and you didn't have a bandage on the bar to stop the flow in time.  With that in mind, no matter the size and content of the horde, always kill the dogs first. They're quick and deadly.  Spike pits are your friends. Always upgrade them to the top (metal reinforced).  When looting zombies, you'll take anything at first. After a while, you'll want to get picky with what you get. Anything brass is good as is lead if you can't find any lead ore. Moldy bread is a must for antibiotics. Ignore wood planks as you can make these by the dozens. When looting, prioritize the Nurses. They are often the only source of beakers outside of drug stores (which are super rare).  It is advisable to have a high quality gun when making a trip into the 0,0 city. Sneaking is a good idea, but when shit hits the fan, you want something hardcore to go loud with."

Decayed Brick structures like these are some of the hardest prefabs in the game. Decent protection early in the game, though you'll want something stronger later. They often have concrete blocks on the roof that can be reused for added protection. Make sure the building is actually Decayed Brick and not stone. Break a block and see what you get if you're unsure.  Break the stairs in any prefab you're hiding in. Use wood frames to get to the upper level and pull them up behind you so Zs can't follow.  If looting near your home realize you can come back for it. Prioritize important stuff and trade things in your full inventory if you have to.  If you have a crossbow don't bother holding feathers in reserve if you don't have to. Make all the bolts you can. No sense in running low on bolts during a surprise horde. Yes, this is probably really obvious, but I didn't even realize I was doing it until a friend pointed it out. I keep planks and other items in reserve to make repairs and items as needed and did so with feathers without thinking about it.  Couch middles and corners make great fuel for campfires and forges.  If you're going to make a base, build up or build down. Building entirely at ground level may be doable, but makes things difficult.  Extensively tunneling under a large surface base can reduce structural integrity.  Speaking of tunnels, you can put rock back. If you're shaping a tunnel or room and make a mistake, equip the stone and put it back in the hole you made.  Surround yourself with spikes. One block of water on top of the spikes helps clear gore blocks. Build a berm around the outside of the spike pit to hold the water in.  Make direct access to your base impossible. A ramp a few blocks high that is 2 blocks separate from your base is a good example. Jump, run or put a wood frames down to cross. You can jump two blocks when running if you have to, barring leg problems (though I managed to make it when splinted once). Zs can fall right off the end to spikes below.   edit: I said 2 originally due to multiple glitches I've experienced, but 1 block should be sufficient as /u/TribalDancer pointed out.  Always watch your back. Don't focus so much on the horde in front of you that you miss the Zs coming from the sides and behind. Take a moment after each kill, or even every swing or shot, and look around."

Zs can fall right off the end to spikes below.""  You only need one block--currently zombies cannot get across any gaps as they don't jump. Bonus: with a one-wide gap you can just run across the span and don't need to jump (note: RUN, don't walk. Try to walk across that gap and you will fall)."
7daystodie,39kq6q,TribalDancer,3,Fri Jun 12 18:48:57 2015 UTC,"Ideally, but as a result of lag, glitches, or whatever the cause I have seen running Zs and dogs cross a one block gap a few times, so I leave the two blocks. I've had to get across in a hurry fewer times than I've seen them make it across. More than two is definitely overkill and wastes time, though."
7daystodie,39kq6q,OnceIthought,4,Fri Jun 12 18:54:35 2015 UTC,Must be a glitch! We have used 1 wide gaps for months with nothing crossing. ALPHA! lawls.
7daystodie,39kq6q,TribalDancer,3,Fri Jun 12 19:24:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's my machine. The first time I saw it was playing on a server hosted by a friend who's been playing much longer. He set up the ramp with a 1 wide gap and a horde spawned. I let them know dogs were incoming:  ""No problem, they can't get across the SHITIT'SHERESHOOTITDON'TSHOOTME!""  Got my first pvp kill unintentionally that day with a crossbow. They said I should be proud. I was not :("
7daystodie,39kq6q,OnceIthought,4,Fri Jun 12 19:33:13 2015 UTC,"Whenever looting at roof or attic, knock out the bottom-most rung of the ladder. You can jump and get on the ladder no problem, but zeds can't. That way if they surround you while you're up there, they can't get to you and you can simply shoot them from the top of the ladder and get away.  Spider zombies can climb any sheer face in a straight vertical line. To avoid them getting into your upper windows, on your roof, etc, build a lip around the edge of your structure. Bonus: make the ledge out of metal trussing or rebar and you can shoot through them with any weapon which uses bullets (cannot shoot through with arrows or bolts). The most sturdy + efficient material for this lip is rebar ramps, which you can rotate with the left mouse button until they are upside-down."
7daystodie,39kq6q,TribalDancer,3,Fri Jun 12 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Regarding ramps, it is eight clicks from the initial position to the upside down position."
7daystodie,39kq6q,Eepopfunny,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"Actually I couldn't say. Because it starts in a different position depending on which way you're facing--it contextually tries to connect itself with the face of the object you're attach it to. From there, you flip it upside-down, but then you want to rotate it to the proper position. So the number of clicks will be different depending on if it is north, south, east, or west!"
7daystodie,39kq6q,TribalDancer,3,Sat Jun 13 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"Build a moat if you plan on staying in one place, fill it with water using a bucket but only after you put 2-3 rows of fully upgraded spikes. Make sure to outline the base with metal trussing as you can shoot through it. Dont bother making a base until you have cement mix and rebar frames with enough wood all to make an insane base."
7daystodie,39kq6q,Defttone,3,Sat Jun 13 06:24:52 2015 UTC,"With a little work, you can build mazes in towns. Connecting second floors and roofs can be an absolute lifesaver if you get cornered - simply walk the catwalk to the next building and commence escaping.  Try to plan far into the future. In single player I leave survival caches with some food, tea, beer and repair materials in nearby towns just in case I'm cut off.  Putting up small 3 block high walls with ladders to the top(omitting the first block for the ladder) at random intervals throughout the map can give you some breathing room. It won't help with spider zombies, wasps or policemen, but for most everything else will have to path around.  Get good at playing with no running zombies before you move up. There's a lot you can learn about the behaviors and AI that carry up to the normal game.  Keep redundancies. You will get into a panic situation where you use up all the durability of your shotgun, so plan accordingly. More so since the components are not presently craftable.  Of course, prefer crossbow over guns. Less noise, less zombie mosh pits.  The bow is absolutely worthless, in my opinion. Use it if you have to, but you will waste a ridiculous amount of ammo.  You can easily bury survival caches under a mound of dirt, and put a loot spawner such as a locker on top. Most people will not dig below, and you have a easy to recognize marker.  Build your defenses like a castle. You WILL get breached, it's just a matter of time, so again, plan accordingly. Fortifications, curtain walls and secure the inside of your base as well as outside.  Edit: Keep a inventory of things you constantly need and craft while you scavenge. This saves a tonne of inventory space in the long run."

7daystodie,39bkoy,NuttyIrishMan93,3,Wed Jun 10 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"So my first real attempt at survival involved building a base into a shed like this. Had walls built around it, with spikes and a moat, and then thought I'd upgrade the floor.   After I dug up the last block under the building walls it collapsed on my head. That's how I learned about 7DTD physics being a bit more realistic than Minecraft.   Good times."

7daystodie,39a5ek,Eepop_gaming,2,Wed Jun 10 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"Hopefully someday they will be able to leverage the character creation engine for zombies as well. I can see how that would grind the current game to a screeching halt, but after a few years of optimizations and the constant rise of the minimum expected hardware it might be possible.   Imagine zombies with as much variability as you can get in character creation."

Not sure either, but when it comes to coding, planned features and all of that there may be things we don't know or don't foresee. Such as not implementing any kind of pause because of unifying game modes. Then again, they might just say it doesn't fit with their vision for the game.  I do hope they add them, I just don't have an expectation of them to. Even if they don't, though, I'd predict someone would mod them into the game."

Depending on what the servers settings are, it'll still 1 shot zombies without generating heat.   It reloads slow as molasses, takes weapon repair kits to fix instead of sticks, takes 762 rounds to shoot which I'd rather use on a sniper. Everything it does the xbow does but better, or if I need firepower I'd switch to a weapon that holds more than 1 round and doesn't reload slower than dirt"

For example, corn can be arranged like this:   XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX   Tight rows, no gaps. Blueberries, potatoes, coffee, and Goldenrod must each be arranged with gaps in between the next row. This tends to be in keeping with the way ""properly"" tilled land looks. For example:   XXXXXXXX 000000000 XXXXXXXX 000000000 XXXXXXXX   In this case, the X's are on tilled ground. The 0's are strips that have been skipped. Do that and all should grow fine."

7daystodie,395eju,Thad0ct0r,2,Tue Jun 9 12:52:51 2015 UTC,Are you tilling the dirt before planting the blueberries?  Corn will grow anywhere but you have to use a tool on the dirt before planting other food seeds.

7daystodie,392owc,Jeradox,2,Mon Jun 8 20:39:29 2015 UTC,I would see if the issue also happens with Navezgain (spelling?) instead of Random Gen. I'd look at permissions writing to the folder the maps are contained in. Keeping in mind where the game map is generated is not the same folder as the 7d2d game files. I would test if LAN connectivity functions differently then WAN. I would try a different port and or verify port forwarding and firewall settings.

Some have hard dates set (PS2), others have features tided to a specific release (TDL) and others have neither.  A roadmap does not mean dates are required, just like the original kickstarter goals had nothing but generalized times (before/after release).  Hope this enriches your understanding."
7daystodie,38tzho,TribalDancer,3,Sun Jun 7 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"(sorry this is coming out jannky. I have some packet loss issues today )  Have to agree that the term roadmap is being used very loosely in these cases, and are much more ""features lists"".  Also it doesn't strengthen your point use the example of a game which is dead in the water right now, with dozens of angry reviewers talking about how promises were made and never kept and the game is in permanent limbo since last November.    Basically this is part of the fear that some people have on 7DTD, which has them asking for a roadmap (a timeline, if you will) in the first place--they want to have a better understanding of how this game is being actively developed and make sure they don't get their hearts broken over promised features that never get delivered. I think that's a reasonable concern for any early access gamer, and has little to nothing to do with trust in the developer or not.  That said, roadmaps CAN be date free. Some prefer date-free, as TFP seems to prefer. Here's some more info on roadmaps and what they are important for in a development cycle:  ""Think of your roadmap as a strategic communication document.  Its purpose is to show your team and other stakeholders what your product vision is and what the high-level initiatives will be to get there.  It’s not a device for showing off every last nook and cranny of your development plan, and doesn’t need to include your list of specific bugs or minor features you want to get out the door.  .....  Leave out the dates. You don’t know what the expected delivery dates are for anything that goes beyond a couple weeks – ie the length of a sprint, or however long ahead your team specifically plans out as a distinct project or deliverable – and so you shouldn’t fake it! Putting a date on a roadmap, even if it’s vague like ‘Q3 2013′, will more often than not end up setting expectations you don’t deliver on and cause undue stress and finger-pointing among various stakeholders.  While ideally, as the awesome product manager that you are, you’d like to think that you can put a rough estimate on something and stick to it, your estimates suck (from a great book called Rework I recommend everyone reads!).  You don’t know what bugs are going to creep up and change your plans, and even if you did, by the time you get to ‘Q3 2013′, your product strategy might need to adapt and change based on what’s going on in the market, your users, your competition, etc.""  From another resource, by contrast:  ""    Roadmapping is just good planning, for all the areas that contribute to a successful product line. The roadmapping process leads a cross-functional planning team to fully examine potential competitive strategies and ways to implement those strategies. Technology decisions are made as an integral part of the plan, not just an afterthought. Roadmaps incorporate an explicit element of time. Roadmapping helps the team make sure that they will have the technologies and capabilities at the time they will be needed to carry out their strategy. Roadmaps link business strategy and market data with product and technology decisions.  Roadmapping prompts a team to be specific with respect to planned features or performance in terms of value for customers. Roadmaps reveal gaps in product and technology plans. Areas where plans are needed to achieve objectives become immediately apparent, and can be filled before they become problems. trimmed More at http://www.albrightstrategy.com/ten_reasons.html """

One I have recently been assigned to do is to setup virtual desktops for a client. It instills more confidence in the client if you have a projection on how long each thing should take. While they're different concepts, the base idea is the same. You don't have to include time frames, but you get more confidence from the customer/client if you do. My bosses strictly enforce research on the topic and giving an estimation on how much each portion of the task should take. There will always be hitches in the plan, and you need to account for those. Scotty in star trek always estimated twice as long to fix a problem. I don't think this was to make himself seem as a miracle worker, but more so to allow for things to go wrong and fix them.  Tl;Dr you don't need to put estimated dates, but customers feel more confident in the project. I personally feel a lot of devs would benefit from a project management course, and if I ran a gamestudio, that'd be my first course of action for new hires."
7daystodie,38tzho,Jezzdit,2,Sun Jun 7 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, this is an incorrect term of the word roadmap, at least IMHO. and with how TDL development is going they have learned to stop using dates."

I simply provided that roadmap to show that not all roadmaps have a time factor, which was your original assertion.    You decided to attack the basis for example, instead of arguing the point with counter proof and then dare to assume your opinion stands as fact. The nature of that game makes my example no less valid and to think so is the mark of an individual not worthy of debate."

7daystodie,38tzho,Zalpha,6,Sat Jun 6 20:58:36 2015 UTC,All of these features will be in the game before full release.
7daystodie,38tzho,carpediembr,4,Sun Jun 7 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"They stated they can not do seasons but I agree most if not all will be in the game and if not, well to be honest I don't care. The great as it is but I do feel they would be letting down a lot of people if they don't do what they promised. Also it is unrealistic to expect all those features to be in the game already. The time they have taken on the game because of it it is better off for it, many of the new patches address old features that they improved on so we are the better for it, also the scope is huge. They have done an amazing job as it is right now."

7daystodie,38tzho,cprogger70,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:30:37 2015 UTC,I think the general reason they aren't doing seasons is because they don't actually play longer term games so they don't see how servers are up and have 700+ days depending on how many hours since last patch.  Seasons would be great if they switched to being calendar based in the game instead of days since server start.  It would make it interesting and everyone wants to say winter is coming.  They don't want to add something they don't think many people will see (a full year of days). But I think it should be a server option.
7daystodie,38tzho,JDogg126,0,Tue Jun 9 01:44:49 2015 UTC,Keep in mind the promise of all of these features being in place before release was also coupled with an expected release date of May 2014.
7daystodie,38tzho,Zanedildofaggin,2,Mon Jun 8 17:30:05 2015 UTC,That date was tossed long ago but the devs have said the kickstarter is still the best list of what they are planning.

7daystodie,38tzho,carpediembr,4,Sun Jun 7 07:22:47 2015 UTC,"I am very curious to see how they manage NPCs.   I don't see towns/communities working very well as the game stands right now. Zombies tear into everything, and things need constant maintaining. I just don't know if they would be able to pull off sophisticated enough AI to give NPCs the ability to rebuild and defend themselves at a consistent rate. NPCs would die pretty much inevitably. Not long after you find them.   Enemy AI though (bandits, raiders) would work okay enough I suppose.  Maybe, once they cross the NPC bridge, the game will be different enough to suit them. Like I said, very curious to see how it works out."
7daystodie,38tzho,Van_Tek,4,Sun Jun 7 09:54:16 2015 UTC,I think they will be in fortified bases/buildings. Either the design of a player made base or for example a petrol station converted into an NPC safe house. They just chill in side and wait for you to vist them/attack them (probably script to avoided by zombies raids unless your in the building making a noise).

More guns, more melee weapons, more armor, more zombie skins, more types of blocks, more prefabs.   The game doesn't need another complicated system that will probably be deeply flawed. What it needs is to actually give players a reason to explore the procedural maps."
7daystodie,38tzho,TribalDancer,2,Mon Jun 8 19:14:15 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the opposite. Part of why I came into this was the Kickstarter promises of NPCs and storylines. Having yet another gun and yet more armor changes nothing about gameplay and keeps things very static and eventually BORING.  ""What it needs is to actually give players a reason to explore the procedural maps. ""  Right. Like storylines. And quests/goals. So we agree!"
7daystodie,38tzho,geengaween,0,Tue Jun 9 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think more variety of items etc gives players more than enough reason to explore - although I agree that missions and goals would be pretty awesome too. I think instead of NPC's handing out these missions and goals, it should be other players. Instead of getting a quest to kill 10 zombies from an NPC, why not have player generated noticeboards asking to trade items, clear out areas, exploration partners, etc?   I'm actually surprised at the amount of people who are happy with the tiny amount of items available in the game currently. You explore for 2 hours and you've literally seen everything the game has to offer. Don't you think it would be better to have a wide variety of items, locations, buildings, enemies, etc so every corner you turn is new and interesting? Wouldn't it be cool to have the only WWII M1911 on the server, or the only skull mask?   Bear in mind the NPC's aren't going to be amazing AAA quality like the Witcher or Mass Effect. Most likely we'll see a person standing motionless or in a walking animation, approach them, get a dialogue text box with options and an objective to pick. That's nothing particularly exciting in my opinion. Instead of introducing artificial people with a limited potential for interaction, why not encourage players to fill those roles instead? Trader roles, bandits, scavengers, etc."
7daystodie,38tzho,Jbird206,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:09:55 2015 UTC,"Actually no. My bag gets full SUPER FAST as it is. I don't need even more clutter. And in two hours I most certainly haven't seen everything--can't get all the books in 2 hours, all the weapon parts in 2 hours, can't make everything in the game in two hours, can't get all the tools in two hours let alone now purple level parts, tools, weapons, etc. The leveled loot system that is coming will make it take even longer to get everything you might want to survive.  I can't imagine if there were even 10 more things to loot regularly in the game what would happen to inventory management. It's already difficult to keep it all square!  As to your first comment, there will surely be  BOTH NPC's and player-made quests, trades, etc. In fact, that is just how I imagine it being--more cooperative opportunities in game to trade, raid, explore together with other players. But when I play SP, obviously I still want some story, quests, trade opportunities, etc. Or if just me and a buddy are playing, similarly. This isn't an MMO, it is SMO - Small Multiplayer Online. Currently it is best for 10 and less players on a server, and I am not sure if it will ever really be more than that. So to expand on content and player interaction, NPC's seem the most logical way."

Having a group of 10 NPC raiders come rolling up to your base in a pickup with a 50cal mounted on the back shooting up your bases and taking it from you then setting up shop in it and forcing you have to try and retake it.

Sure it might be cool the first time you see them, but the 10th time you meet the canned NPC's with their canned dialogue and canned behavior you'll be sick of them.

If only a restart would fix it :( My gf is hosting a normal (not dedicated) multiplayer game and we are the only two people playing on it. After some days it becomes impossible for me to open the map at all because it will lead to said groundless sections.

Then you can do your stuff and observe how they are affecting the heat.

That being said, heat is caused by all sorts of things, but no matter how much heat you have generated it will always only spawn spider zombies to scout the area and if they aren't killed before they spot something they will spawn a zombie horde. And within that zombie horde is usually more spider zombies, can really create a never ending loop, or until the zombie limit is reached (The limit where if you dont kill any zombies and they keep spawning eventually they will stop spawning once lets say 80 zombies is in one area).  But with the more heat you have the more spider zombies will come, up until the spider zombie horde limit (its in the .xml files somewhere). Or spider zombie horde after spider zombie horde will keep coming if you kill them fast enough but don't reduce your heat."

In regards to heat anyway, what I've noticed is using campfires/forges that use more individual items for fuel time create more heat vs the long burn time items. Eg; 1 log burning, lasts longer and creates less Zombie heat than 30 planks burning.    -Random addition-    Recently made about 19 tnt and used 8 oil barrels to draw as many streamers/climber zombies as we could when we blew it up. The pile was small and blown up at 18:00, only 3 came and called a horde. I've seen videos where someone blew up a huge (wide and tall) boat with hundreds of tnt and barrels, they got an incredible amount of screamer/climber zombies.     My conclusion from my small test was that there is a area/chunk limit that determines how many screamers you get...

7daystodie,38vamw,Ensley03,7,Sun Jun 7 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Lead by example.  Start your own server and be the admin 7 Days to Die deserves. Someone says someone is cheating and you have fair suspicion that they are, ban them. Don't try to reason with them or argue, just drop the ban hammer and carry on.  Used to play DayZ Epoch with some nice admins that handled things like that. Was a great server."
7daystodie,38vamw,Obviously_Dracula,-4,Sun Jun 7 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"TBH thats shitty attitude, banning people with no proof or anything, just suspicious. Your server will be empty after 2 months."
7daystodie,38vamw,carpediembr,2,Tue Jun 9 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"If you hold on for proof, cheaters will ruin your server and your server will be empty after 2 months. I've seen it.  In my experience, when most people say someone is hacking, they're telling the truth and those people blowing the whistle on hackers are likely to leave when they see an admin is taking his/her sweet time to ban the offenders."
7daystodie,38vamw,Obviously_Dracula,-2,Wed Jun 10 07:01:18 2015 UTC,"Make a guild with 20 players... All accuse everyone else of being hackers, they get banned, profit?"
7daystodie,38vamw,carpediembr,5,Wed Jun 10 14:07:27 2015 UTC,They aren't focused on delivering a pvp experience so for now you're probably wise to play other things while they finish the core game which is PvE centric.  It's just not going to make much sense to worry about pvp until the game is further along.  It's just a development distraction.  And there are other games focused on pvp first like rust and h1z1 and dayz.
7daystodie,38vamw,JDogg126,2,Tue Jun 9 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I also utterly lost intrest in 7days when a lot of time was wasted on a pub. server because some cheap hacker floated though the wall, shot my face off with a rocketlaucher and spammed about 300 claim blocks on everything so the base is unuseable.   I did screenshot the entire thing and report him, but the only thing that came from it is that he now has a comment on his steampage (from me) with a link to the screenshots.   Playing on the reddit server now, but its pretty dead, never saw more then 2 people on."
7daystodie,38vamw,Thtb,3,Sun Jun 7 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to stop playing with cheaters is to stop playing multiplayer. Until you do that, there will always be cheaters in your game."
7daystodie,38vamw,triniumalloy,3,Sun Jun 7 04:10:41 2015 UTC,"Actually the fun pimps have said they recommend password protected survival mp mode servers.  Speaking from experience, that really is the best way to go."
7daystodie,38vamw,JDogg126,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is hope. But there is no need to waste resources on cheat detection while new features are still being added. It's a lot easier and cheaper to implement such features in the later part of the development. If you don't like the current state, then you could just find a private server. I see threads about that all the time, it can't be too hard?"
7daystodie,38vamw,SKEW_YOU,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:43:11 2015 UTC,"I would love nothing more than to play on a private PW server that had pvp/raiding and a population but I doubt if that really even exists, and if it does, it's just a matter of time before some idiot shares the info and lets cheaters in, or just starts cheating himself. Unless you personally know 50 people to play together and maintain a solid population, I don't really see a way. Sure, you can play on a private server with a few friends, but that's just a waste of time."
7daystodie,38vamw,inyou329,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:46:31 2015 UTC,I'm glad admins don't just ban people because others complain they're cheating. Most people hop to cheating whenever they're beaten in a fight because everyone thinks they're the shit. Obviously if I lose it is because they cheated...
7daystodie,38vamw,Solaratov,-4,Tue Jun 9 20:15:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like this is someone's first multiplayer FPS.
7daystodie,38r1yi,TheHiddenYouTuber,3,Sat Jun 6 02:15:41 2015 UTC,Have had this on mp and that was when my ping was a bit high. not sure if I've seen it on single. bug would seem accurate.

7daystodie,38r1yi,Lostmortal,2,Sat Jun 6 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"Zombies that stand still are either because of 1 of 2 things.  1st: Someone else killed the zombie in an area you have explored personally but never looted the corpse, but the packet somehow never reached your system from the server so its just a zombie that is actually dead and doing anything to it will insta kill it making its corpse lootable for you.  2nd: The zombie spawned with some objective to go to ""X"" place or kill ""X"" thing, and when it reached its goal, it basically didn't know what to do so it just stood there until you either: A) attack it and it locks onto you as its new objective. B) get to close and it does the same thing anyways.  Other wise you can just leave it alone and it will despawn after awhile."
7daystodie,38r1yi,UnremarkablyWeird,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:32:55 2015 UTC,1st doesn't apply to me due to being in single player. However I sore that zombie move around outside my base while I was up on the roof. When I went down to kill him that's when he wasn't moving.
7daystodie,38q8mo,OngoingProject,3,Fri Jun 5 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are a rare find. Did you think about destroying them?  Guess what they drop, usable honey combs!!  And last time I checked when you dropped them in your base, they instantly produced honey.  After which you destroy and replace for endless honey."
7daystodie,38q8mo,dredawg,5,Fri Jun 5 23:23:22 2015 UTC,That's definitely an exploit...
7daystodie,38q8mo,ThatOneGuy1294,2,Sat Jun 6 02:07:21 2015 UTC,afaik every kind of place-able container do this the instant you put them down. Want unlimited food? break and replace a cooler. Repeat as needed.
7daystodie,38q8mo,Twad_feu,3,Sat Jun 6 03:40:47 2015 UTC,This has never worked for me. I break them and replace them and they never spawn again.

7daystodie,38q8mo,Twad_feu,-1,Sun Jun 7 02:28:57 2015 UTC,^ that
7daystodie,38q8mo,Feycat,-1,Sat Jun 6 19:23:33 2015 UTC,"how is it an exploit? its a feature if you ask me.  Honestly I wish the combs would spawn the honey over time and that I had to deal with the odd hornet, but in meantime, Im the honeyman."
7daystodie,38q8mo,dredawg,3,Sat Jun 6 11:49:43 2015 UTC,"It's a bug in the game, not a feature."

7daystodie,38rzb5,influox,4,Sat Jun 6 08:25:08 2015 UTC,"I think when you pick up a bed with E - any bed, not just yours - it removes your current spawn point. Did you loot a bed or mattress or something in a building?"
7daystodie,38rzb5,Ihmhi,2,Sat Jun 6 12:39:56 2015 UTC,i did have a mattress blocking some stairs and I sometimes picked it up if I had trouble jumping it. Wonder if that was it. Didn't realise this counted as a home. Can you use a mattress instead of sleeping bag then?
7daystodie,38rzb5,Ihmhi,2,Sun Jun 7 10:15:27 2015 UTC,"I believe so. The last ""bed"" you placed is your spawn point. Sleeping Bag and Old Bed definitely count. I haven't tested the Mattress but I would wager it does, too.  Pick up the mattress next time, check your map, and see if your home icon is gone. If that happens, then there's your problem."
7daystodie,38rzb5,WeezulDK,2,Sun Jun 7 13:13:51 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll check that out next time I find a mattress.

7daystodie,38qyi1,Azmodan_Kijur,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:30:13 2015 UTC,Maybe I should set a timer for exiting the game. I hate that there's no in-game save feature. Exiting and reentering takes a little time. I just wish there was a save and pause feature.
7daystodie,38qyi1,Azmodan_Kijur,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:44:19 2015 UTC,"Same here. I try to exit to the main menu intermittently so that the state of my inventory saves. Then I just reenter the game.  If it crashes to the desktop, I haven't lost too much then.  The crash is odd. World changes are constantly saved - alterations to the landscape, looting of boxes, planting various things, building things - but the world time and the inventory does not save. I've had flawless weapons get consumed in a crash as well as stacks of potatoes I've just harvested. It sucks and apparently completely unfixable."

7daystodie,38qyi1,lobo5000,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:22:04 2015 UTC,I can sympathize with you completely. Try making the run and exiting to the menu every couple of minutes.

7daystodie,38qxlw,ninjustice,2,Tue Jun 9 04:18:44 2015 UTC,Well that really sucks. That fps drop is nothing too bad but it's very annoying and breaks the immersion imo.
7daystodie,38mtb4,JoelHuenink,5,Fri Jun 5 05:56:51 2015 UTC,Excitebike mini game confirmed.
7daystodie,38mtb4,Angry_unicornn,4,Fri Jun 5 11:44:15 2015 UTC,Hopefully it's not a total gas guzzler like the auger.
7daystodie,38mtb4,HP_Strangelove,4,Fri Jun 5 14:14:39 2015 UTC,Hopefully!  I would think that a gallon of gas should be able to get you at least 30 MPG on it.  Quick googling suggests that the average moped gets 50-70 MPG.
7daystodie,38mtb4,demonlag,2,Fri Jun 5 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting. With quality being added to the handlebars and motor, I wonder how it will affect the auger.  Obviously the blade will affect block damage but turning isnt a thing needed for the auger.  Could this be the start of parts having multiple attributes and it varys on which one is applied based on what its put into?"
7daystodie,38mtb4,IMSIL-Cypherdiaz,2,Fri Jun 5 07:43:16 2015 UTC,Well a poor quality engine won't spin the auger blade as fast or maybe stall so it would slow down the digging process. If you have low quality handlebars perhaps you will lose stamina running the auger because it would require more energy to keep the auger under control.
7daystodie,38mtb4,kenhk117,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:57:05 2015 UTC,I think the first thing im going to do is just scavenge for the best parts. Faulty stuff seems pointless.
7daystodie,38mtb4,Defttone,5,Fri Jun 5 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"Sometimes a faulty item is better than no item, and with the dismantling feature allowing individual parts to be upgraded as you find better it doesn't hurt to build a lower quality gun or machine, even if just to save space until you get better parts. I have a spare of several weapons with lower quality parts that I trade out as I find better. The one I use gets priority, the secondary gets the hand-me downs and anything better than what they currently have but worse than what's in the primary, and most everything else gets scrapped, melted or tossed, which keeps me from having five weapons boxes dedicated to just parts.  Edit: Spelling and added details of my own parts policy."
7daystodie,38mtb4,OnceIthought,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe a low quality engine will use more fuel per damage but take the same amount of time  Maybe low quality handle bars will be less precise, maybe hit blocks around it every 5th time or something  Maybe low quality blade will do less damage to the block."

7daystodie,38mtb4,MacheteSanta,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"So I changed my motor out to the best one I could get and tried again, and I got quite a bit of air!    Seems like that will depend on the motor ""quality""."
7daystodie,38mtb4,Zajaka,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"Looking forward to seeing it in action!   Will the minibike be worth building? Absolutely! It is a serious game changing experience. Driving through snow storms was just absolutely jaw dropping. Imagine the envy of other people on the server when they see someone has crafted one and they drive by on it and get the air drop first :) Or you die and lose your stuff and need a ride to get your gear back, the guy on the minibike can be the hero. Lots of interesting game play for sure!   Of course in most ""survival"" games, the guy on the vehicle is the most important target to kill because .. just because he has a vehicle and you don't.  Zombies, food, water, making it another day.. all secondary to killing the guy on the vehicle."
7daystodie,38mtb4,JDogg126,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:03:22 2015 UTC,It'd be nice if the minibike had saddlebags on it so you could carry some extra stuff with you.
7daystodie,38mtb4,Ihmhi,2,Sat Jun 6 12:41:50 2015 UTC,It will have a container you can add to it to hold stuff. This was discussed and shown in the video they posted a couple weeks ago. http://joelhuenink.tumblr.com/post/119494628008/here-is-a-preview-of-some-of-the-things-were

7daystodie,38ok5x,Djpalko18,3,Fri Jun 5 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"The enforcer magazine is very rare, indeed. Look for bookstores, the big ones that looks like libraries that has 2 floors with bookcases on them. That should yield the best chance of finding them. Then loot all the bookcases, and return in 3 days (or whenever the server settings respawns loot) Also look in file cabinets, and garbage piles, although the drop chance is veeery low in these."
7daystodie,38ok5x,randomusername6,2,Fri Jun 5 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick tip on looting bookstores. Go ahead and grab everything, including common books. It saves a huge amount of time when looting through a store and clean shelves will allow new books to spawn for the next player (think of it as replanting). In the end you will end up with around 8 stacks of common books, but you can just stash them in a drawer up front on the way out. Alternately you could keep them for a source of paper or to burn them as fuel."
7daystodie,38ok5x,wastelander,3,Mon Jun 8 15:58:24 2015 UTC,Only time I've found one was in a supply crate. They are pretty rare.

7daystodie,38li1s,dangerous_b,5,Fri Jun 5 00:21:03 2015 UTC,Why am I worried about this snow having. .weight..and affecting SI. I hope it doesnt. I hope this game doesnt change into 7DaysOfClearingSnow. just a thought..
7daystodie,38li1s,IMSIL-Cypherdiaz,3,Fri Jun 5 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"I on the other hand think that would be fantastic.  Zombie movies aren't about the characters figuring out a solution and then everything going swell because now they're safe forever.  Little things to bust your base would breath some life into the game once you're pretty well set up.  Plus, roofs built by actual professionals collapse under snow and all in all our scrappy survivors probably aren't building to code."
7daystodie,38li1s,zdss,5,Fri Jun 5 05:52:35 2015 UTC,"Id agree to that if SI was further developed. Buildings rarely fail suddenly. Cracks in concrete and wood, the wood audibly creaking, etc all give signs of stressors beyond design. If we want to go real worls here, fine, but go all the way. Give us queues as to a failure before it happens so we might do something about it first."

Leave your base in the snow biome, come back and you need to get shoveling to find your base again.  speaking of wich...that means we now need ""SNOWshovels"" ;)  new ideas, new issues to work on. can we build fires to melt the snow and keep our basewalls clear? does the snow accumulate and make it possible for the zombies to just walk over the walls when the snow gets high enough?"
7daystodie,38li1s,MCRoadkill,2,Fri Jun 5 10:49:05 2015 UTC,Or water freezing.  That spike moat uust froze and turned into a bridge to dinner for the zombies.  I fear how this system will develop and how well thought out it has been.

7daystodie,38li1s,TribalDancer,2,Fri Jun 5 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"So this might be a dumb question, however I only started playing this game about 3 weeks ago.  I know it's in alpha, and has been for quite some time now. Is there a road map for when it turns into Beta, and perhaps a final release? The game seems so polished for being in alpha, I mean there's some obvious bugs that are on the back-burner sure, I just wonder where the line between Alpha and Beta is, and how far is the game from it now?"
7daystodie,38li1s,Devils_-_Advocate,5,Fri Jun 5 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"Not even close to release, or possibly even beta.  Beta mostly implies that it is near release with loads of features and it's time to bust up the bugs as best they can and tweak balances/issues/add last minute content updates.  Alpha is jam packed with bugs and the time where they try to cram it with content and experiment.  And in EA on Steam, they want a smuch time to hear community desires/feedback as possible.  So to answer you in short;  no one knows."

7daystodie,38li1s,elduderino197,10,Fri Jun 5 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to an Alpha game.  But on a more serious note they are not going to talk about those even if they fixed them in the blog.  The blog is there to let us know of all the cool new things they are working on.    I do not know for sure if they have, but if you trawl through the dev post track you may get some info of whether it has been fixed or not in an upcoming patch."
7daystodie,38li1s,insanetwo,-7,Fri Jun 5 03:27:25 2015 UTC,"no sorry it's to easy to play the ""alpha-game"" card. Things that worked before don't work anymore. Like a lot of people are complaining about core things are not fixed and new stuff is added. Fix the things at hand first then move on.  They know those issues live in the community, if they would fix them they would mention them in the update list."
7daystodie,38li1s,MCRoadkill,10,Fri Jun 5 10:45:22 2015 UTC,"In general though, that is not the design goal of an alpha.  You fix bugs as you can, but you do not go all out in fixing them.  It would be a complete waste of time if you spend 100 hours fixing some bug (it may be major) only for it to break again when you add the next new thing to the system.  The entire point of an alpha is to add content.  The goal of a beta is to debug a feature complete game.    Look, I am not saying it is not an annoying but.  It is.  It is one of the reasons I am taking a break from 7dtd, but with an indy dev team they need to focus their resources.  Fixing this bug may be as simple as changing a variable or it may be as complicated as rewriting the entire physics system.  And while I know the ""but it is in Alpha"" argument is overused, the fact that it is in alpha cannot be overlooked.  If you want to be actually useful and hopefully get the breaking leg bug fixed, then go due some testing.  Find out exactly what actions cause a leg to break with completely repeatable actions.  Record these and submit a bug report to the Pimps.  They know it is messed up, complaining doesn't do much good over and over again and it is annoying to listen to."

7daystodie,38li1s,MCRoadkill,3,Fri Jun 5 12:52:50 2015 UTC,I would recommend playing the game in phases. Play a ton when the new patch hits and then through the quick fixes. Enjoy the new content while it's fresh. Then put it down for a while. That's what I do. The game isn't done so we shouldn't treat it like it is.

7daystodie,38msez,IMSIL-Cypherdiaz,15,Fri Jun 5 05:48:17 2015 UTC,We have had a defined set of Kickstarter goals and others that came from us or the community along the way. Locking us down to what were doing and when were doing it is not a fun way to develop games. We have added many things that are good for the game that we're never promised. I would assume our track record would give us some credibility and trust by now.   We do have an internal roadmap but its always changing and if we posted it a lot of the community might take it as set in stone and want to bring out a lynch mob if we change our minds which we will likely do based on what's best for the game and our business.
7daystodie,38msez,The_Fun_Pimp,-6,Fri Jun 5 19:29:40 2015 UTC,Please see my response above to dafuqz as it counts as a response to you too.
7daystodie,38msez,Spider013,10,Fri Jun 5 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"I’ve been playing the game a long time and I have trust in them to get it right (only them most other Dev teams suck). And if you’re looking for a Road Map they have the Kickstarter List that has all the planed items that are going in the game what else do you want? A Time line? Ha! Thank god that they stopped doing that. You must not of been here long they used to give us dates and tell us what was coming next and you know what, It was horrible. They never made a date and there was blood in the streets at every missed date and bad press everywhere. It is precisely because the fan base begged them for months to please stop giving dates for updates and features and finally after the constant chaos they stopped giving that type of information and all has been peaceful for nearly a year. They are not building a house where you can know the time it takes to frame a wall and raise it, they are making a creative unique product and parts will be implemented and finished when they are done. Please TFP don’t go back to those days you have been so good at not inciting internet riots by releasing incorrect dates. Keep up the good work, and to the fans grow 2 ounces of patience not everything in life is instant gratification."
7daystodie,38msez,dafuqz,-3,Fri Jun 5 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Oh I remember those days. Hence why I very clearly stated in my original post that my suggestion only included the soft date of ""heres what we hope to see in the next 3 months"". I also stated in a post here that I understand the challenges of time and how they dont know for sure how long stuff will take."
7daystodie,38msez,TryRestartingIt,13,Fri Jun 5 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"as Spider hit the exact golden nail on the head I can comment. First you guys want dates and timelines. Then you grab the torches and pitchforks when the timelines are missed. Then you demand to stop getting dates as they are missed and lead to you scheduling days off of work to play the new releases and it not coming out. So we stopped with the dates and gave rough estimates. Now you want dates and roadmaps again.  This is a no win situation for us. You have to understand all the kickstarter goals will be met so consider that your roadmap. We don't stick to a roadmap so that we can push updates to you guys with quality content. Remember back when vehicles (minibikes) were said to be in a previous release yet they weren't? That was because we experienced issues and instead of delaying the release we decided to push without it. Giving timelines like this doesn't work for us. For bigger game companies that have their own custom game engine and have control of what it can and cannot do, timelines and roadmaps are good. For us, when we depend on a 3rd party engine, are not good.  Switching to Unity 5 caused major issues. While it will be better for the long run, the short time was chaotic. Joel has been great about posting updates to his blog on what is going on. We then reference those posts across all our media sites for everyone to see."

7daystodie,38msez,theflyponix,-6,Fri Jun 12 22:13:09 2015 UTC,"Dafuqz..I understand. My posts here should show that if read. I stated that I understood why a roadmap was bad. I stated that I understood why concrete dates are a problem, due to you working in an engine that is not your own, and thus determining how long something will take can be tricky.  You seem to miss my intent. I did not start this thread to attack the dev team but to offer them an option that might have been missed. A way to say what youd LIKE to accomplish in the next three months baring any issues. Such a thing would make the community a little calmer with an idea of the path set before this game.   Joel's posts are a great addition. But they come as features come. It is not hard to talk of your wishes for what youd like to see for the next 3 months. Maybe forme this is because I can understand the difference between having a goal youd LIKE to reach versus a promise to reach.  Let me restate in short order. 1) I don't want a defined roadmap with set dates 2)I want to get a better idea of what you all would LIKE to accomplish in the next 3 months without a promise of those actually being done in that time frame.  Case example. Let's say that you say ridable horses are something youd want to see in the next 3 months. Cool. 3 months down the line, at the next state of the game, you say that it turned out you had to completely rework animal AI first, and thus the horses are not done yet.  My reaction: A little disappointed sure, but understanding of the challenges you face and glad to know the status of the feature even though its not ready yet.  Also, roadmaps dont need dates. I direct you at the roadmap for The Dead Linger. It provides the community with an idea of the direction of the game without any hardset dates on when they might appear. I hope you all have more planned than simply the kickstarter goals. Thats what I want..an idea of where you see the game heading."
7daystodie,38msez,TribalDancer,5,Fri Jun 5 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"You, I and probably a fair number of people around here may understand when things get delayed, but there are plenty of other people out there (especially on their forums) who will tunnel-vision ""3 months"" and pitch a goddamn fit."

Your point stands well agreed though. To me ""here is what we hope to accomplish in the next 3 months"" means exactly that hope. Delays happen. Unanticipated issues arise,  etc. My original idea stated two parts. The first being a ""what has happened in the last 3 months"" where issues of that ilk could be discussed.  Alas I do feel your point made that some, if not too many, would crucify the devs for missing what they perceive as a promise. I would not see this so. I simply aim to get a better glimpse of the minds and directions of the devs over the currently available means."

You will find hundreds of posts about what he is doing, what he is working on, and answering many questions people ask about.  Many times he has talked about kick starter goals coming towards the end of development because they don't want to add certain stuff that would have to be reprogrammed after every major update.  Heck, madmoles even tells us what he is shooting to put in the next 3 or 4 alphas, if you'd just read his posts.    IMO,  the Fun Pimps keep people apprised of what's going on better than any other game developer I am aware of.  They blog about upcoming content, post in their forums constantly, and are now posting on reddit.  A three month road map seems like a waste of time."
7daystodie,38msez,TryRestartingIt,5,Fri Jun 5 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"IMO, the Fun Pimps keep people apprised of what's going on better than any other game developer I am aware of.    I was with you up until this assertion. There are many many other developers who are worlds better at communicating frequently and clearly (Shroud of the Avatar, Savage Lands off the top of my head).   I really feel for The Fun Pimps that we have some incredibly shitty attitudes in our fanbase, and the developers are fairly protecting themselves from the lynch mobs by staying more mum than they might want. But I think we're in a chicken and egg situation. They aren't always great communicators and aren't good at dealing with public opinion gracefully, on the other side of the coin is a large population of whiny-baby-gamer-boiz who just complain with every update (and this is not one of those situations, OP, so please don't take that as anything directed at you), and the two feed off one another over and over in this endless spiral of negativity and bad communication.  I would love it if TFP had the funds and time to get their PR branch in order. If they had someone in on their development side, but was more effective at parsing and disseminating this information in a way that is more consumable by the larger audience, I think it would do a world of good.  Also, as a businessperson and a creative, anyone who tells me they don't do well with road maps and plans sends up big Red Flags for me. Failing to plan is planning to fail, as they say. If they told me they had one but just didn't choose to share it publicly that's one thing, but to say it ""isn't their style"" is a bit concerning.   That said, I am getting my money's worth and I offer these thoughts as an academic exercise, not as a complaint or demand that things change. I am content where I am in my 7DTD experience for now and am grateful to be part of the alpha process of an exciting game like this."

Not every reply that is disagreeing with you is some kind of attack on your honor that needs to be so vigorously defended. Some of your responses in this thread are unnecessarily mean spirited.  Certainly doesn't help your case.  As an occasional open source dev I can tell you that nothing makes me want to fulfill a request less than when the person making that request is acting like you are.   You buying their early access game (probably on sale, lets be honest) didn't make you a shareholder of the company.  You asked for something and they even took time out of their day to respond to it, and then you go on to cop an attitude with anyone who disagrees with you and talk about how the devs are making a mistake.  You bought into their VISION.  That's not just for the game, but how they intend to make it.   If you think the way they're making their game is a mistake, you're certainly entitled to your opinion, but don't act like yours is the only valid one and that anyone who disagrees with you is somehow inferior, like implying they don't know how to read.    I disagree with you.  I think they're making plenty of efforts to keep everyone updated on what they're doing behind the scenes.  The information is out there if you put forth the effort to find it.  I'd rather they apply themselves to actually working on the game instead of organizing their thoughts into some kind of roadmap that they'll just get harassed over.  And yes, I understood your numerous lengthy comments explaining your feelings on the matter.  I still disagree.  Doesn't make me an asshole, or illiterate, or stupid.

I legitimately think that's a bullshit answer and terrible development process.   This is really my whole gripe with the early access system. If you want people to pay full retail price for a game that's still in alpha development, you have to give them some sort of confidence. Your name and reputation means nothing because you have none. Unless you're a Double Fine or another known developer with a good history to back them up, you're essentially a nobody. Thats what The Fun Pimps are, nobodies. Yes, it sounds harsh, but when you're asking consumers to blindly trust you with their money, we have to be harsh about it.  You can't just tell us that look, we have an idea, we're not sure where it's going, or how it's going to end up, but trust us that you'll like what you get in the end and that we'll complete it. No, I shouldn't have to trust you, trust is earned, you need to show me what your plans are, where you think you're going and what to expect along a reasonable roadmap, and yes, I expect you to have an end goal in mind, and I expect that you should have to share this goal with me if you want my money.  My issue with 7 Days to Die is that I have no idea what this game is supposed to be, and I fear the developers don't even know either. It's falling into the trap of every other survival crafting game out there where it's mechanics, interesting mechanics, but barely a game where there's incentives to continue once you make it to the late game. Their blog updates are nice, but my issues with them have largely that they seem just so... trivial. Like... oh? You've added a need skybox? Bears? Minibikes? That's great, but those are just pieces of a game... they don't necessarily make a game. They don't feel like they add to some big end goal here. It feels like their development process is basically thinking of all the random cool shit and mechanics they can add without thinking of the big picture, which is why should anyone play this after a few months?   Hell, I've played this game for 2 months now, and I already kind of feel a little burned out by it. There's only so much you can do playing singeplayer or PVE. It makes it more disappointing that they said they don't plan on developing the game with big servers in mind, which I think is a terrible idea on their part, because that's  where this game should be, if you're not going to give players end content to continue their worlds, then let the players do it themselves in large servers where there's incentives to explore, find other players and venture out.   In short, I don't like where this game is going, and I don't necessarily think it's going anywhere. If they want to be vague about their plans, that's their choice, but they shouldn't expect people to be willing to hand out $25 for a vague promise and a completely unknown development roadmap. They can't and shouldn't expect everyone to be able to continue hyping up and caring about this game a year down the line if they still haven't made any progress on really finishing this game. Players burn out, and they're in a VERY crowded genre.   All I'm saying is, when Minecraft was in it's alpha phase and Notch opened admittedly that he had no idea where the game was going to go as he developed, he was entire fair about the pricing and had scaled rates based on how far along development he was. Notch never charged full retail price until the game was officially completely and could be shipped as a full retail game. To be honest, The Fun Pimps should be a bit ashamed of themselves for charging full price for an in-progress game that has zero promise of actually completing. I only brought this when it was on sale for a significantly deal and I paid around $15. This is not a $25 game, it is not a full retail price game. Minecraft is a full retail $25 game because it's complete, and the developers actually make an effort to properly fix bugs and make the game playable above all else. If you want people to playtest your game, you shouldn't charge full price for it."
7daystodie,38msez,MCRoadkill,7,Fri Jun 5 09:44:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that having more defined goals would be beneficial and would give some people a confidence boost. However, The Fun Pimps have been very consistent for almost two years now. I don't think they've gone more than a couple months without adding something significant that improved the game, not bad at all for a small dev team. Based on their performance thus far, I'm willing to give these guys the benefit of the doubt."
7daystodie,38msez,NolaNewsGuy,3,Fri Jun 5 12:18:46 2015 UTC,"So you paid $15 for the game right? You have been playing for 2 months right? I'm guessing you haven't paid full price for a game and beat it in 20 hours only for it to sit and collect dust. Was that game great for those 20 hours? Sure! You have been playing for 2 months on a game you paid $15 for...and the game isn't even complete! You even knew it wasn't complete when you made the purchase.   If you don't like where this game is going go back to Minecraft or whatever game you feel is headed in the right direction. Just because you don't agree with the Roadmap, or lack thereof, doesn't mean what they are doing is wrong. Have you looked at the H1Z1 roadmap? Every week they fail to meet their dates with shit they say they will have in their Roadmap and every week people are pissed about it and riots ensue.   Scroll down to the bottom where /u/spider013 makes a very good point when TFP did have a roadmap."
7daystodie,38msez,inyou329,6,Fri Jun 5 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"If you don't like where this game is going go back to Minecraft or whatever game you feel is headed in the right direction.   This is a really poor attitude for any business, if every person did this there would be no feedback. Somebody taking time to complain (especially constructively like this) is also a second chance for you to impress them, many people do just leave and never come back. It shouldn't be used as an opportunity to show them the door."
7daystodie,38msez,TryRestartingIt,6,Fri Jun 5 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between constructively criticizing and flat out whining and complaining about how they aren't running the business they way he wants them to.   I understand all of his frustrations, but instead of just complaining about everything and talking about how other games are so much better, why not offer a suggestion.   The way his entire post is constructed is ""The game isn't going in the direction I want it to go. The Dev's aren't communicating the way I want them to. I paid money for this game therefore I should get X, Y and Z.""   So with all of his ""constructive complaints"" he offers nothing. He doesn't say ""I don't like this because of this, and this is what I would do to change that.""  Instead, its ""In short, I don't like where this game is going, and I don't necessarily think it's going anywhere."" Quoted directly from his ""constructive complaint"" post.  So please, by all means, if you aren't happy with the way the game is, go play something else that makes you happy. In this instance, all he does is refer at how good Minecraft is."
7daystodie,38msez,Quinnna,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"And then there is me who has put 1000+ hours into this game and can't get enough. Seems more than worth it for my $25. If they say they are doing well with their current development path I say let them be.   How many hours did you put into the game over the last two months? Triple A titles often came with single player campaigns lasting less than 20 hours.   Let them finish the game and then judge it. If you don't want to help develop the game you shouldn't have bought it. The dev road map has been here all along.   If you only started in the last 2 months you have experienced very little. The Fun Pimps haven't updated much with content because of the change in engine. Before that, updates were popping all the time with massive changes. You should be patient."
7daystodie,38msez,gloop524,-3,Mon Jun 8 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"Sadly im seeing more and more customers start to turn against the devs. I understand their reasons, which are as varied as leaves on the wind. I think the cause of many,  the root of it, is that the devs have been feverishly tight lipped in their goals.   The minibike, while I agree a horrible place to start vehicles, is likely a part of something greater. But we dont know that because they dont communicate effectively.  There are some around innthe dev field calling into question their practices. I have limited knowledge there. My BA is in Organizational Communication. So on that bit I seek to offer them alternate means to communicate since they seem so against roadmaps being made public.  At this point I sit atop the fence, hoping in the purity of their vision and their desire and ability to communicate it as they should. Yet I realize that all you have said does hold truths and needa to be addressed.  I give TFP 6 months. In that time they will either start communicating as they once did (during kickstarter) and making us get all excited again (and deliver..) or I fear 7DTD will fall bt the wayside as another failed Minecraft clone.  As a note, thats not me speaking out of my ass. I own and run a cyber cafe. Ibhave heard those exact words from more than a few customers of mine that used to play it. Granted my register of 400 clients, only of which 20 play it, is minor segment of the games population. Yet in my experience, thats how it starts."
7daystodie,38msez,JaxTeller718,6,Fri Jun 5 11:00:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. Im not by any means a nolife 7dtd player, but i had maybe 5 decent playthroughs with friends, and everytime it was a different, exciting experience. Even between a10 and a11, with quality and the new visuals, it feels like a new game.  even regarding the roadmap, i know there was nothing conrete. But afaik, they said the game is going in the direction of adding NPCs, quest, and more AI enemies. Also adding electricity and all the cool stuff that comes with it.  maybe im not familiar with currently available games, but 7dtd is the only zombie survival game i know that has decent pve, decent multiplayer,  non-blocky graphics and a fully destructible world. Just because of this is is constantly on the top of my fav games. Im not even being a fanboy here, but im very optimistic about the future of this game."
7daystodie,38msez,influox,0,Fri Jun 5 12:39:01 2015 UTC,"yup, a lot of complaining is starting. If they want to turn that around then now is the time to act.  There are a few companies that can recover from that, for instance EA has the same with Battlefield franchise, they release way to early, but make it up later."
7daystodie,38msez,TribalDancer,-6,Fri Jun 5 11:24:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. At this point in the game's life I have zero confidence in the dev team. They're just adding random things instead of fixing crippling issues. Not to mention the whole deleting critical posts on their forums.

Line the sides of the roads with them so you're only being attacked in two directions instead of all.  Hard to describe but I do a 4 corners spike formation as well just to give me somewhere to retreat back to.   X-X-o-X-X  X-o-O-o-X  o-O-O-O-o  X-o-O-o-X  X-X-o-X-X  X's being spikes and the rest empty space on the ground.

Flawless pick-axes are nice, but using stamina will slow you down when compared to an auger (if you're mining)."
7daystodie,38j455,dointhestankyleg,2,Thu Jun 4 16:41:57 2015 UTC,using stamina will slow you down   It's coffee time!
7daystodie,38j455,OnceIthought,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:57:49 2015 UTC,"Also, it seems like only the value of full item durability is taken. If your pickaxe is damaged, and it shows only e.g. 2 block damage instead of 5, I think you still have 5 block damage.   (At least the amount of hits required for a block are always the same)"
7daystodie,38j455,FowlyTheOne,3,Fri Jun 5 07:16:43 2015 UTC,"All tools and weapons have, in the xml, a damage range. This range is then divided by potential quality.  Best to explain with an example. So lets take Tool X. It has a damage range of 0-60 in the files with a quality range of 0-600. Simple math says for every 100 quality, it gains 10 damage. So at quality 100 it does 10 damage. At quality 200 it does 20. And so on. This also works to say if Tool X has a quality of say 350 then it has a damage of 35.  Second you have modifiers. Certain tools gain a modifer to certain things. An example is that all tools get a 25x multipler vs glass.  What shows in the tooltip is the RAW damage, not including multipliers.  Axes get modifiers to wood materials, shovel to dirt/clay, etc.  So thats how it works. Best way to find the current numbers is to open items.xml in a txt editor and search for the item.  Btw..all weapons get a 6x modifer to headshots.  Hope this helps."

7daystodie,38j455,dointhestankyleg,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"So I took a look through the items.xml and this is interesting:  Auger is a DamageBlock = 2, no bonus to anything except the usual (4x head, 25x glass)  Pickaxe on the other hand, DamageBlock = 2 and damage bonus to stone = x2 and metal = x4.  Additionally there is this:  <property class=""Attributes""> <property name=""EntityDamage"" value=""5,15"" /> <property name=""BlockDamage"" value=""2,12"" /> <property name=""DegradationMax"" value=""100,600"" />   Which would lead me to believe that at 600 durability, the block damage goes up to 12.  This would mean that a flawless pickaxe would be hitting for 48 against an iron door vs the 2 an auger would hit.  Wow is that OP.  Thanks to /u/IMSIL-Cypherdiaz for pointing out the XML file."
7daystodie,38j455,endertargaryen,2,Thu Jun 4 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the auger is many hits in a short time, not just one tap like a pick.  To properly compare them, you'd have to determine how many auger hits you can fit into one swing of the axe.  I know in my experience, flawless pickaxe with good stamina mined iron really fast, 1 or 2 hits per ore, but the auger still felt faster."
7daystodie,38j455,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"Per OP's findings, every hit with a flawless pickaxe is x12 of an auger against stone, assuming close to full durability. I'd guess they would be pretty evenly matched, except auger costs a lot more resource wise"
7daystodie,38j455,IMSIL-Cypherdiaz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:31:26 2015 UTC,"I used an auger to demolish a lot of concrete I put up once. A trick/bug I found is.... use the auger till it's at 1-10 gas left, then hold down E and collect everything you've been pounding out. I should note not to pick anything up before this.   For some reason, the gas goes back up to full. So you essentially get double the use out of it before having to reload it. Which makes the auger very useful in mining situations"

I'd also still love to see higher end tools degrading with each repair, the lower your actual level is. So someone who is level 1 and happens to find a flawless axe will see it slowly degrade over time. Again, more of an incentive to make tools and means tools aren't immortal."

So the pistol (or axe or whatever) may be fantastic, but if you're still an amateur with the kits you're probably going to make things a little worse each time.  And if you're a high level god, when you take that crappy axe you built at level 15 and repair it you'll actually make improvements."

7daystodie,38lrx9,MCRoadkill,2,Fri Jun 5 01:55:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's based on the current loot distributions which are not in any way set in stone and is heavily influenced by your game settings and luck.  I play on 25% loot without respawn and tough zombies, so it took a long time to find a high quality pick.  More importantly in this scheme, your tools might deviate from your level briefly, but high or low they'll eventually settle back near what you could make naturally.  You dont need to make new tools every few levels and when you find nice tools they'll degrade over time, so finding a purple pick won't mean that you've beaten the pick minigame."

By pre-generating the map, the world will no longer need to generate it upon demand, with hopes of passively increasing overall server FPS."
7daystodie,38ktsj,pyrofool,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:34:11 2015 UTC,I had thought about implementing the same idea in my server manager. In the end I decided against it due to potential death risk when teleporting players and the fact that it's such a manual way of revealing the map. Does the constant chunk loading spike the cpu? I never tested it but have you tried changing the z coor to something much higher? I'm not sure how high you can be while still generating that part of the map.
7daystodie,38ktsj,Learuis,2,Fri Jun 5 12:56:24 2015 UTC,"The height was tested in A11.2 to generate efficiently.   The speed was tested on both high performing, and bogged down servers (3.00FPS)  The performance loss by doing this, is the equivalent of a player exploring a new area - Which is something they are going to do anyways, upon a map wipe.   So, rather than waiting for prime-time and having 20 players going off into the unknown, you can pro-actively generate the map, and perform the processing in advanced. Or at least, that was it's purpose."

7daystodie,38iwk0,TribalDancer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:28:50 2015 UTC,Could one put down multiple sleeping bags to make the no spawn zone larger?  Say one about every 15 blocks?

Only the last sleeping bag/bed placed by any single player will count as a spawn point and will create a safe zone.

Sure, no problem.  Splint and use one of the stack of first aid kits I have with me.  But when the break outright kills me  That pisses me off.  As for the digging.  No cave ins, just digging a 2 block wide shaft.  When I rage quit the shaft was 6 deep with a ladder leading back up and I died by walking over the horizontal floor of the shaft.  As for why an escape tunnel.  It's an emergency route in case it all goes to hell and I have to flee my base.  You dig a shaft down into the rock, then go horizontally for awhile and come back up and surface in a quiet spot.   Most people who do this camouflage the exit and put a hatch or door over the tunnel entrance.    I've only ever had to use it once, before I knew how to make better bases.  I still make them because paranoia is a survival trait."

I'm known as a cave dweller by my friends. Before I started carrying wooden frames with me, I would tunnel to the ceiling of caves to get ore, it was a sight to behold. I've broken my leg in some weird ways, but I have never died while mining outside of a cave-in. Your situation sounds like an anomaly man, I would recommend ditching the escape tunnel plan.  Your base should have layers of defense. A strong 1st layer is a kill pit that goes all the way around your base. Spikes in that thing, it should have a lip on the inside so spider zombies can't get out. After that your base walls should be thick, coated in barbed wire. The ONE entrance to your base should lead up to a second level. The stairs that lead up should be wooden, so you can blow them apart with a shotgun. If the zombies get this far, you blow the stairs out and below them is another death pit. You should have some way to see into this deathpit to shoot the zombies. Around your base should be lookout balcony's that allow you to shoot the zombies when they are in the outer deathpit and if they get to your front door.  If they zombies get past all that, then dude.. all is lost. Screw an escape tunnel, I'm going down with my ship"

More leg breaks but rarely ever resulting in death. I question things when they patch in more serious bugs in an attempt to remove minor ones.

7daystodie,38e0cd,elt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Because serious bugs are much harder and take a lot more time to fix. Especially if the issues are tied to fundamental and unique game mechanics (random gen + physics). They aren't just sitting on their thumbs, you know. They are surely trying to work it out and it's just gonna take more work than the smaller issues.   I see this complaint a lot and I think ""How can that person be COOKING DINNER when they have a WHOLE HOUSE TO PAINT?!"" Because cooking dinner is a little daily thing that needs to be done and is easier to do. Painting a house takes money, time, and preparation and you won't see someone doing it quickly or easily."

That tells me that they were aware, looked into it, couldnt validate the claims, and nothing is being done. Even though virtually every single LP video out there is showing just how its happening.  The programmers are hard at work. No question there and I never meant to insinuate that they werent. But testing has been rather poor. Yes its alpha and beta is the time for bug fixing but when a bug is driving people away and making it unplayable for many...that needa to get fixed.

Given how ridiculously low your health initially is anyways, just taking damage is plenty of punishment enough for jumping off a high place. I shouldn't have to be punished even further by having my already slow movement speed stunted even further, especially if you're trying to get away from zombies. I get it, it's ""realistic"", but that doesn't make it fun, and in a game where you can carry an entire forest of trees in your backpack with no problem whatsoever, realism really isn't any issue.  This game should be fun and challenging, but mechanics like this aren't fun or challenging.

7daystodie,38e0cd,CarpetFibers,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'm of two minds on this. One, as you said, it's ""realistic"" which, as a survival game, is part of the point. It's a mechanic meant to keep players acting somewhat realistic where movement is concerned (never mind jumping into water/onto hay bales).   Two, it doesn't add all that much to the game. I don't think it detracts, but the penalty is quite small for a break once you splint it. So long as you make a habit of carrying cloth, it's a matter of seconds to halve the penalty. And if you carry beer or coffee, you can still outrun mobs, thus negating the penalty entirely.   As an aside, I've been playing ARK the last few days and it has more ""realistic"" elements including weight and encumbrance. It also has a broken bone icon, yet that debuff goes away in a matter of seconds after you've healed back up. Interesting to see how different devs handle things in the same genre."

7daystodie,38e0cd,MCRoadkill,2,Thu Jun 4 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"But it's not a cheap take price. 7 Days to Die costs the same as Minecraft and that's a full release and complete game, which is generally the standard pricing for survival crafting games. When Minecraft was in alpha, it charged alpha pricing that scaled up as development progressed, so people paid fair value for content they were getting the moment they purchased it. 7 Days to Die is charging full price for a clearly incomplete game that seems to be progressing backwards instead of forwards. That's not fair and isn't entirely reasonable."

Closed a door today..it decided my leg needed to break. Presto. Walked down some stairs (walked..not sprinting or jumping) and it rebreaks. I walk down a hallway by a candle which sorta catches me..break.   I rarely can get my leg to break intentionally. And when its broken...itll rebreak if someone merely asks if my leg is healed. Kidding but its like that sometimes.  One player of mine went threw 30 splints between game day 108 and 118.  Its the randomness and for no reason that drives us mad.
7daystodie,38e0cd,Arm-the-homeless,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:16:27 2015 UTC,"Some weird shit happens when you dig a tunnel that is only 2 blocks high because of the way the blocks are arranged. 2 blocks high is only just barely enough to fit a character in, if you made your character particularly tall you might be a bit too big for the tunnel as the edges curve up.  To give an example, 2 blocks high is tall enough for me to stand up in ( made my character as small as possible), but if I put a sleeping bag down I need to crouch to stand on it, but if I stand up while crouched on the sleeping bag I will either break a leg or die because im clipping through the roof.  So maybe your character model is just too big to easily fit so if you stray to an edge it clips your character model and the game sees that as you being crushed?"

Currently end game (or even mid game for that matter) has caused our entire server group to stop playing out of boredom.   There is little incentive to continue after beating back intermittent waves of zombies with sniper rifles, shotguns and other weapons. There is absolutely no challenge or interest in this great, atmospheric game once you get to a certain point. Bases like this only make the matter worse."
7daystodie,38c4j7,AstarJoe,10,Wed Jun 3 14:00:34 2015 UTC,"To be clear we don't want our base to be like it's made of paper. We don't want the zeds to be able to smash down our walls.   What we want is something to do after our secure base is up. Some kind of challenge or event we can seek out that will keep us coming back for more.   There needs to be more WORTH exploring, or, a more complex building mechanic to create more customized things. Or something that limits our ability to craft every single thing on the fly.    can only make wood planks from machine at a saw mill, or collected from hardware store, or tearing down a house can only make bullets from a machine at shotgun messiah or a ""redneck"" garage that happens to have the right equipment.  schools are abundant in paper, books, has an engineering area that could be used to make advanced tools like solar panels?   forcing people to leave their safe haven to venture out to be ready for the next wave of walkers."

7daystodie,38c4j7,AstarJoe,2,Wed Jun 3 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"I just need a good reason to be far from my base when a truly horrifying horde comes and chases me back to safety.

7daystodie,38c4j7,rtothewin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:39:35 2015 UTC,Making materials more biome-specific is a good start. Scarcity is healthy and forces players to get out there and harvest.   Once the base gets to that all-encompasing point I usually lose interest in the game.
7daystodie,38c4j7,fade17,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:35:55 2015 UTC,"I'd rather engage with the world, though   Then I suspect the minibike, weapon attachments and alternative ammo will give you at least a little entertainment for a while.  I agree that once you hit the endgame there's not much to do, and that hitting the endgame is more a matter of player experience than character experience, but please remember that this is still the alpha. Making sure the mechanics of everything they want to add works as well as possible can be the hard part. Once that's taken care of arranging all of it into a more compelling experience is much simpler.  If they decided they were done with programming the mechanics right now and wanted to start working on story or more lasting level progression they could lock crafting behind other requirements fairly easily (As an example: You read the book but are you high enough level to craft the item?), time or geo-lock item spawning (sniper schematics only spawn in this area that is always pre-spawned with x number of zombies with x% of them specials), and possibly time or geo-trigger events.  That last one is really important. If there's not something already in the code to do this I wonder if it would be tough to add. It appears it would currently be limited to creature and object spawning, which is rather limited since there's no mechanical feature in the game that doesn't rely on direct input from the character with the exception of structural collapse. In the future if they add any kind of lever or motor mechanic the creative possibilities increase drastically.  If there is a way to make an event geo-trigger there are some interesting scenarios we might already be able to mod in. I imagine a character approaching a city. As soon as they get near a particular prefab designed with specific structural weaknesses a spawn event is triggered on one of the upper floors and the building collapses. Simultaneously some event is triggered that attracts the attention of zombies (whether that's heat map, horde, some modification of smell I'm not sure) and from the rubble a group of zombies start crawling out toward the player... I think I just developed an interest in modding.  Anyway, the point is that with this type of game the mechanics are everything. Whether they create a story in the end or leave it a sandbox for people to create their own story via modding the potential is pretty incredible."

Under no circumstances ever would things made of flesh be able to bust through a 3 foot thick concrete wall.  Wrapping it in metal is a bit redundant.

I doubt they ever scale zombie hordes into the thousands like I want so they really need 'bunker buster' zombie units.

7daystodie,38c4j7,Lucullus76,2,Wed Jun 3 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"yup and with looking it up, coal is somewhere between 60 and 90% carbon. maybe it would make more sense to craft carbon powder from coal and use that with iron ingots."
7daystodie,38c4j7,bluke123,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Steel is about 1% carbon, but that carbon has to be removed from the basic pig-iron.  Pig-iron has too much carbon which makes it brittle (like your cast-iron skillet) because dislocations (defects in the iron's crystal structure) cannot move easily.    Steel is made by removing more carbon and other impurities, then sometimes adding other stuff to get the right type of steel.  Then you have to temper it for the desired size of impurities and correct crystal structure (I devoted an entire master's level class to this).  More good info here  I hope TFP keep steel manufacturing simple."

7daystodie,38d21q,TheHiddenYouTuber,10,Wed Jun 3 12:53:21 2015 UTC,"Characters in this game run at about 1.7km per hour if you are high on coffee (we've tested it on our server).  This is much slower than a human actually would do in real life... but in real life I wouldn't be carrying, 4 guns, 3 tools, food, water, some logs, and a pile of bricks around.  So the run/walk speeds are pretty close to what most people could do while back country hiking/camp with a heavy pack (though still not as heavy as we carry in game).  I'm hoping the mini-bike will be 100% faster while on road, and 20% faster while off road."
7daystodie,38d21q,kyarmentari,3,Wed Jun 3 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"only 100% faster on the road? so ~4km/h? It should be able to do at least 30-40 I hope (10x speed?).

Maybe an option to ""boost"" at the expense of doubling your fuel consumption. I would think that any faster than that would make the map very small for the ones not playing on random gen.   Maybe its just me, but I still enjoy the threat of potentially being caught after dark away from your base. With the bike, you can just hop on at any time and ride your ass back to your base safely.   Don't get me wrong, I think its a great addition to the game and I am very much appreciative of TFP for adding this."
7daystodie,38d21q,joefont6,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"Well if the bike travels 150-175% of run speed, there is no use for a boost option."
7daystodie,38d21q,joefont6,2,Thu Jun 4 01:42:55 2015 UTC,I was just throwing out numbers. Lets say you are running at 100% run speed and you come across a zombie dog. You can't out run the zombie dog so lets say hes running at 120%. I would think that a motorized vehicle would be logically faster than the dog at 120%.   So I just randomly threw out there that 150% would be OK with me. The boost kind of seems far fetched now that I think of it. Especially since its going to be some random parts you scrapped together to make a bike.

For now they can just be roaming and much like zombies except they attack zombies and players and drop loot based on your level. (if you are a higher level more would have guns/iron/steel armor.

7daystodie,38avce,Hatbeemo,7,Wed Jun 3 00:46:15 2015 UTC,"Statement #5 - Who knows because I've had the 7th day hordes spawn on the 5th day, the 8th day, 7th day at night, not at all, or only on the 7th day and never again.  You'd have better luck trying to transmute lead into gold than figuring out how the fucking horde spawning works in this game.  It's an alpha so thats to be expected though.  I personally don't care when the hordes spawn as long as they do.  In fact I kinda like the challenge of not knowing.  I just hate it when I go and do all the work to defend myself and end up having to exploit the heatmap to actually get some action."
7daystodie,38avce,Arm-the-homeless,3,Wed Jun 3 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"I kinda like the challenge of not knowing.   Agreed. Reliability is great when learning, but once you've gained a little experience (playing more than character-wise) spontaneous hordes are exciting.  Kind of wish there was an option for zombies to damage each other. Dodged some cop spit that some zombie took to the face and it didn't even flinch."
7daystodie,38avce,OnceIthought,4,Wed Jun 3 02:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope they add an option for spontaneous feral hordes instead of just 7th day ones.  The frequency doesn't really need to be increased, if they were just random after the 7th day that would make things a lot more fun.  I think they would need to give a little bit more warning though.  Can you imagine the tension of being in the wasteland/hub city, hearing the regular hornets buzzing around, knowing a horde could go feral at any moment and you would have no warning?   And I agree regarding zombies damaging each other.  If a cop exploding can damage a building and instakill me, it should take out nearby zombies and be exploitable as a means to clear a crowd."
7daystodie,38avce,Arm-the-homeless,2,Wed Jun 3 03:06:14 2015 UTC,what DOES feral mean?
7daystodie,38avce,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"It means the zombie horde is hunting you whether you're hidden or not.  Also feral hordes usually have dogs, cops, and sometimes the new Feral zombie which is hard to kill and super fast at night."
7daystodie,38avce,Arm-the-homeless,2,Thu Jun 4 00:37:16 2015 UTC,Man that'd suck.  I haven't played enough to deal with much but so far I just kinda don't like the feral-ness.  If you don't have a gun it's damn near impossible to handle more than 1 fast zombie.  The fact they just have to be within 20 feet to swing and register a hit...which usually will stun you so you will be forced to take more hits...  Now add in the fact you HAVE to fight them because they know about you...just because?
7daystodie,38avce,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,2,Thu Jun 4 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"Ah if you had played ""back in the day"", all zombies were feral at night. They were heat seeking missiles and found you and tried to fight their way to you wherever you were. Dig underground beneath a building, you'd come up in the day and find they completely tore your building apart, even if you hadn't made a single sound. It was terrifying."
7daystodie,38avce,TribalDancer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I did play back then.  me and friends enjoyed ourselves to a point but got sick of the lack of content, and the fact we basically were forced to log off for the duration of night on servers because any and all work was undone in 60 seconds.  Been a year since I played before this month"
7daystodie,38avce,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah feral hordes are tough if you're underequipped.  Not much you can do but run and try to gather feathers for arrows, or try to kite the zombies and melee them one at a time.  Thats why they only spawn on the 7th day and afterwards, to give you some time to prepare.    Once you get enough hours in you'll have a good idea of what you need to do to survive and get kitted out pretty quickly.  Then the game almost becomes too easy unless you crank the difficulty and do things to make things harder on yourself, like not using the map or playing hardcore where if you die you respawn.  But really the zombies aren't much of a threat once you get the hang of things, unless you turn spawning up super high and/or make them always run."

7daystodie,38avce,roscocoltrane,5,Thu Jun 4 08:34:02 2015 UTC,"If you want to understand horde spawning, the first thing you'll want to do is look at the games config files.  Assuming the default install location:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\Data\Config\spawning.xml  Here's a copy for convenience: http://pastebin.com/q4fzW3br  #1 - Mostly true.   Look for an entry towards the bottom of the config called ""NightHorde"". You'll see the type of hordes that spawn on day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. The top entry has * for day, which is a wild card character. Any day aside from a 7th day uses that entry, which has a 0 for # per wave. So, no (automatic) horde on any day but the 7ths.  You said ""morning times"", which is semi correct. ""NightHorde"" is triggered at 12:00am each day. You can see this by running a dedicated server and watching the telnet console or reading the log file. You'll see a message each day ""Spawning Night Horde for day (#)"", followed by ""Spawning this wave: #"". Again, on any day but the 7th, the number spawning is 0.  #2 - Sometimes true.  In addition to the daily night horde, there is a chance for a wandering horde to spawn. These can be found in the config under ""RoamingHordeSpawn"". There are both day and night variants.  #3 - Usually false.  From my experience, both the daily hordes and wandering hordes spawn and immediately seek a player's location, regardless of stealth or buildings. For evidence of this, again examine logs. When hordes spawn you'll see either ""was spawned and is moving towards pitstop"", or ""was spawned and is moving towards point of interest"". I strongly suspect both messages are different ways of saying that the hordes are headed for the player.  The only zombies you seem to be able to evade through stealth are the random wilderness spawned ones, or ones spawned around prefabs (towns/buildings). The actual hordes spawn for the express purpose of killing you and your friends.  #4 - Mostly true. (See #3)  #4.5 - Probably false. (See #3)  You didn't specifically ask about it, but just for completeness, there is one more category of horde. ""HordeMeterDynamicSpawn"", either day or night. They can be triggered when you are located by scouts (spider zombies).   Scouts themselves are spawned by buildup of the horde meter, which increases through actions that attract attention. The biggest of those are probably gunfire and felling trees."
7daystodie,38avce,octagami,3,Wed Jun 3 05:20:55 2015 UTC,"I should also mention that, as of alpha 11.4, the wandering hordes are either bugged or deliberately nerfed. So you may see them rarely or not at all.  Here's a good thread on the subject, and how to fix it if desired: https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?26974-So-about-the-nerf-of-zombie-hordes-in-11-3/"
7daystodie,38avce,octagami,3,Wed Jun 3 05:25:02 2015 UTC,"I've never had a wandering horde detect me.  They do spawn in and move towards a POI or person, but they just keep wandering if its not feral in my experience."
7daystodie,38avce,cprogger70,2,Wed Jun 3 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"There is or was also the thing were the ""heat-horde"" would overrule/block the ""feral-horde"" from spawning. While the heat horde is on the map the feral horde won't spawn.  So you could cheat your way out of the 7th day horde by crafting your ass off.  Don't know if that still works."
7daystodie,38avce,MCRoadkill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:59:00 2015 UTC,I've never had a 7th day horde auto-sense me without me doing something to get their attention. I find that the 7th day horde usually actually spawns after 1am on day 8.

If the tunnel goes far away then I won't even be sensed and I won't have to deal with it. Only once did I have to fight zombies indoor and It's because I messed up. I can spend 50 days without being attacked by zombies and working on my base. So the feral who chases you wherever you are....well I have doubts.

7daystodie,388vg3,Jeradox,3,Tue Jun 2 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting ideas. Not sure about zombie mutated animals. I expect more variations in the human versions first. In fact, it makes sense that the human ones would be systematically annihilating all life as they spread - killing and eating them. Then again, bite one and it flees ... boom, zombie animal unless the infection does not work on all animals equally.  I do like the community contest idea for prefabs. More variation is welcome. More houses, more auxiliary buildings, more store shapes, etc. Couldn't hurt. Similar to the infinite exploration submissions in Space Engineers.  Not sure on the bullets thing. Once you can melt down lead and brass, it becomes natural to mold it afterwards. I think part of what you are looking at in that case would be the realism of the game - something that must always be balanced with the fun of actually playing it. The heatmap component was added to the game to ensure that the player was always pressured as you indicate. Whether that is effective is a bit up in the air. If we were to err on the side of realism, the problem becomes that, realistically speaking, bullets are not made in gun stores either. They are made in factories and shipped to gun stores. Reading over the manufacturing process, the actual construct of the bullet is not terribly high-tech. Making millions of rounds is, but making single rounds is not. Take a look around - once you have something that can melt the metal down, the casting is relatively primitive itself."
7daystodie,388vg3,Azmodan_Kijur,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:31:50 2015 UTC,"As far as ammo goes, I actually quite like the idea of needing reloading equipment, but I don't agree that it shouldn't be movable. People reload privately all the time. It would make sense if it couldn't stack in your inventory, but that's as much of a limitation as I'd give it.  Now, if there were a prefab in the game that was some kind of factory, which you can take advantage of if you can get running again, that would be pretty neat. That's going further than just equipment though. If they ever manage to get some kind of machinery into the game that doesn't require the player to wield it for it to run I think we would see a massive expansion of possibilities. As soon as they implement levers, axles and something like Redstone we'll see an explosion of creativity."
7daystodie,388vg3,OnceIthought,2,Tue Jun 2 22:54:02 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see more 'phases' to the game, in the form of a sort of storyline.   Like, who's dropping the airdrops every three days?   Maybe you build a radio, and make contact with them.   This activates the next phase of the game, where zeds get stronger and faster and home in on you because now you've got a radio broadcast tower built or something.   In return for the added difficulty, you get to actually request specific airdrops, and they start sending you parts for some kind of endgame thingy. something that, when completely assembled, lets you 'win' the game.  But each piece you add drives the zeds (and zed spawns) crazy.   So you still get to advance at your own pace, but everything's getting crazier as you do.  Maybe it's an airport or helipad with beacons that you're building, so you can get rescued.   Don't know.   But something along those lines would be interesting."
7daystodie,388vg3,elt,2,Tue Jun 2 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"I like the radio idea.  Getting a radio to call in an air strike that falls within a certain radius of your location (in exchange for massive heat gain in the area) would be nice.  This could lead to lots of potential prefabs:   A military roadblock outside a town or a military base that could have super tough armored out zombies that are immune to non bullet weapons.  When you kill them, or as loot around the block you could recover a broken or functional radio.  An electronics store could have parts necessary to repair a radio (or a radio if you're lucky) along with a radio repair manual for the recipe.  A radio tower you can somehow connect to send a signal, or act as a repeater for your signal.  You also have a (very) small chance to find radios/manuals in homes or vehicles.  It would be cool if you could recover a map item or a GPS receiver that you have to have to give the air drop coordinates.  Without either of these items, the air drop should be completely unpredictable, with the map it should be within a 3-4 hour run from your location, and with the GPS receiver, it could be within 1-2.  In multiplayer, the radio could also be used for voice comms when not in the same area, just share the frequency with whoever you're trying to talk to, but be wary of other people listening in.  I could see something like this becoming very exploitable, especially in multiplayer.  Say you have six players staying at a single base, they shouldn't be able to call in six individual air drops per day.  The easiest way to limit it would be some combination of: limiting air drops in an area, limiting air drops by a player, and limiting total number of air drops per day.  Maybe the air drop calling radio would have to be a fixed terrain feature, so you would always have to be nearby it to summon.  Whatever happens, I see tons of potential for that aspect of the idea.  As for the rest of it, I don't really see 7 days to die as a game you ""win"", especially given the multiplayer aspect to it.  I do like the idea of gathering parts through air drops that can be used to build something, giving some sort of long term goal, but I'm not sure what that would be."
7daystodie,388vg3,dointhestankyleg,2,Tue Jun 2 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"As an avid explorer I really want to see more variety in world gen. It's kinda become town hopping, with near zero point in going off roads. I want to see a lot of different stuff, with a lot of very rare spawns to keep things interesting. It's like 4/5 cells have a frikkin town... gets old. And I want a reason to really explore. Caves need to be less common and be able to spawn anywhere in the cell.    I'm extremely excited for community prefab packs and world gen mods in the future, when the game is done and people put a lot of time into good finished mods."
7daystodie,388vg3,Thepher,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:44:58 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, exploring has become bland as all the towns are basically the same. Rectangle layout, 3 to 4 buildings per block. The houses are basically all the same furniture, all the same drapes, mostly the same wallpaper.   I wish town were made in such a way where there is a chance for at least 2 or 3 ""special"" prefabs. For example, one town would have a hardware store, pop'n'pills, and a shamway foods, over in another town it would have a shotgun messiah, and a lumber mill.   If we had significantly more prefabs, each town would seem different enough to be worth while exploring, without having to literally travel 6 or 7 bioms away to see 1 new or unique building."
7daystodie,388vg3,TribalDancer,2,Tue Jun 2 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"In another thread I suggested the idea of a workbench which kind of addresses your #5. You can make one (book gated) or loot one and put it in your base. You need to use the workbench to craft certain things, and there are different modules you can plug into the workbench to add functionality, similar to how molds work in forges and cooking vessels do in campfires.   So for instance:   you have to find/make bullet molds and a reloading press to be able to make most bullets (low-end weapons like the blunderbuss could use bullets which don't require these so not all range weapons are gated in this manner). you have to make/find tanning tools and slot them into the work bench to make leather and leather goods. Potentially the workbench could additionally (or instead) be a way to make higher quality items, boosting lower level player's crafting ability over just making it in your regular pack. So right now quality may be only (Level * 10) +50/-50, but if you use a workbench to do the crafting you get a higher multiplier or bonus, like changing the modifier to +50 to +100, no possibility of -50.   I am sure there are other logical and useful ways in which this could be done. But it prevents you from being able to run around killing zombies while magically sewing a pair of leather boots in your bag. LOL It would also make nights feel more useful and productive since you have to do those things at a base and that is the logical time to do them. Of course, all actions there have varying degrees of impact on the heat map...  And also, 100% agree on the pre-fabs. We have installed the mega pre-fab pack on our server and as avid hunters/collectors/explorers this has increased our enjoyment of the game immensely. It makes the towns and cities more textured and interesting, rather than the same house 5 times.  As for storylines, I like the idea of creating our own. They say in-game story elements and NPC's are coming someday, though right now in Alpha as they are building the base mechanics, there has been no motion on those deeper story elements. I look forward to that day, though."
7daystodie,388vg3,Arm-the-homeless,2,Tue Jun 2 20:07:01 2015 UTC,"I really like your ideas for the workbench and hope the devs take notice.  I think some things should be craftable on the fly, but most things obviously shouldn't, and there really does need to be more to do at night.  If crafting and maintaining higher tier tools and weapons required a workstation it would definitely add something to the game.  While making tools only maintainable at a workstation would be sacrificing some fun for the sake of realism, the game could be changed so that you can still repair on the go, but use resources more efficiently at a workstation.  They could make it take 2x/3x as many metal strips (or more depending on the quality of the item).  Maybe add a toolbox that would allow you to sacrifice an inventory slot for cheaper maintenance on the go?  There's plenty of ways to add more to the experience while keeping it balanced and fun.  It doesn't even have to be all that difficult to make, and it could be something that you could break down to take with you (maybe fill half your inventory to encourage using the minibike storage) for those who want to play as nomads.    Right now the only way to increase the challenge is to make the zombies spawn more frequently at immersion shattering distances, turn their damage up, and/or make them always run. All of these options are horribly imbalanced. Its either too easy or stupid hard, there's no real threat until you either make the zombies run or make the game spawn zombies 3 steps away that stun you with one hit and kill you with a second.  That's it.   The game could use with a bit more realism and challenge, and a prime candidate for reform is the magic workshop bag."
7daystodie,388vg3,TribalDancer,2,Wed Jun 3 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And I agree, even an increase in efficiency (time, materials, etc) but requiring you to set up a bench would be interesting and balancing."
7daystodie,388vg3,JDogg126,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:37:09 2015 UTC,Great ideas +1
7daystodie,388vg3,Arm-the-homeless,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:18:13 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that since alpha 1 most of this game is a collection of placeholders.  It's just not fully there and still largely a work in progress.  The wildlife is expanding to include a bear.  The reason there isn't more is because that isn't a priority and the placeholder wildlife got the job done for now.  I think at some point the game will allow server owners to tweak the type of content on their servers as much as they could possibly want.  The game will support mods so don't worry about getting prefabs into the game so much.  And frankly the developers are better suited designing prefabs that fit their vision and gameplay goals.  They shouldn't waste time running contests with so much unfinished work.  To be quite honest the zombies in the game are not a big enough threat.  If they aren't going to be able to make 1000+ zombie hordes then they need more special zombies that a player needs to plan for.
7daystodie,388vg3,JDogg126,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"1000+ zombie hordes aren't that fun.  Turn spawning up to high and go hang out in the hub city and try to build a shelter.  I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm sure someone out there could do it, but I sure couldn't.  It's like a persistent 7th day horde with dogs, cops, hornets, etc.   I've tried to clear the horde under these conditions and they just keep spawning.  It's less than 1000 zombies in a day but its still too much.  They're definitely a threat when they don't stop spawning but when you spend the whole day from dawn to dusk just trying to survive an endless horde it stops being fun and ventures into annoying land.  I think the challenge could be ramped up in other ways.  Zombies should be a danger and you're right that they're not enough of one right now, but a lot of mechanics in the game could be tweaked to make things more challenging.  Especially in terms of leveling up, gating off access to higher tiers of weapons/tools, and making crafting/maintenance more difficult.    I know it's alpha but right now the leveling system is a joke.  I can start a new game and 8 out of 10 times I'll have great or flawless tools by the third day, and an auger/chainsaw by the start of the second week.  By the 14th day I can be in a reinforced concrete bunker and by that point the only real threat to my life is my own stupidity or carelessness.    It's a game with zombies, so realism is kind of a dumb argument to make, but I don't think a player should be able to make an inpenetrable reinforced concrete bunker by themselves in two weeks.   With nothing but hand tools it would be unrealistic if it took a month in a world where you didn't have to scavenge or avoid the constant threat of the undead."
7daystodie,388vg3,TribalDancer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to say that the cities, as currently implemented, are a broken idea.  These cities should not be places anyone should be building because they should be overrun with zombies.  Thousands of zombies.  The idea of big hordes is that you don't clear them they should represent the apocalypse and players should have to avoid that.  Building a base where hordes roam should be suicide.  Right now there is no threat that a player cannot defeat and that, ultimately, hurts the game.  There needs to be bigger challenges to survival to drive the emergent game play that Joel has spoken about in the past."
7daystodie,388vg3,JDogg126,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:29:15 2015 UTC,"I think the flaw in the wasteland cities is that if you make them too hard, you lose the solo player and if you make them too easy it's no challenge to team play. The ability to tweak dials, which they have already given us and will be giving us more of in the future, will surely help in this regard.  Also, the leveling system is not complete. Even what you are able to find/loot will soon be in part based on your level. the idea being that the better you get at survival, the better you are at spotting the good stuff among the detritus."
7daystodie,388vg3,Not-in-jail,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:54:39 2015 UTC,Survival SP mode doesn't have to be the same as survival MP Mode.  It would be fine to allow the single player game to have completely different behaviors of zombies in city hub areas.  I do not care what they do with single player mode. However the multiplayer mode needs more of a challenge.  Edit: I do not really like where the leveling system is going in this game. I wish that loot in the game had more to do with the difficulty in getting to that loot than your level.  But this too is tied to whether the game can actually present a challenge that is legitimately hard to overcome.

I would almost kind of like a random map option that wasn't infinite.  On our random gen server, we've explored a huge chunk of map and never found snow, and only two little towns.  It would be kind of nice to have an option like Terraria, where the map is a fixed size and there's always at least one of each thing.    In Terraria, there's always a jungle, always a dungeon, a crimson or corruption zone, a desert, and an icy area.  In 7 days, the generator could make a fixed size map with at least one major city, hospital, military base, desert, snow, etc.  All the other regions could be random and maybe you'd have two deserts, etc.    It would still be random in that when you start out you wouldn't know where anything was, but you'd have a guarantee of being able to find a lot of the cooler things that you may not otherwise see if you get an unlucky random seed."
7daystodie,388vg3,demonlag,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:49:07 2015 UTC,May I suggest just starting a new build. We have run into lame gens before and we just start again and usually improve greatly.

It isn't worth starting over for, we just make do with what we have.  I just meant as a general suggestion it would be nice if such an option existed.  We've been doing random gen since it was an option to make things a bit harder to get established since we don't know where we'll find something now, but as a result there's a ton of prefabs we've never even seen in person because we just don't get lucky enough to find them."
7daystodie,389ot2,Arm-the-homeless,3,Tue Jun 2 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"The flash light doesn't bounce around like the helmet, is there a way to just make the helmet use that code instead?"
7daystodie,389ot2,Jeradox,2,Tue Jun 2 22:42:17 2015 UTC,If I can't find something premade I may try my hand at editing some stuff to see if this is possible.  Thanks for the suggestion!
7daystodie,389ot2,TribalDancer,3,Wed Jun 3 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"I would love to know this as well. But the issue is, in my experience, primarily how it is trying to handle the change in your head/arms position when holding a weapon while wearing the helmet. For me at least, if I unequip and have empty hands, the bouncing stops."
7daystodie,389ot2,TribalDancer,4,Wed Jun 3 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"The main problem I have is that the while mining and using the auger it tends to shift downwards and sway all over the place making it all but useless since I have to place candles/torches everywhere no matter if I have the helmet or not.  I understand they were going for some sort of realism but its just a nuisance I'd rather not deal with.  I mean, it's called a mining helmet but when I go mining its more like a drunk guy holding a flashlight over my shoulder, it's just a little ridiculous."
7daystodie,389ot2,MCRoadkill,2,Wed Jun 3 01:07:59 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree it's a pain and I hope it gets improved for sure. Just noticing the situations in which I observed the behavior (and why the flashlight would be different). It sucks, dude, fer sure."
7daystodie,389ot2,snowdogJJJ,2,Wed Jun 3 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"yeah, I got a mod for the flashlight... http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/593/176/416/416176593_281.JPG  Sorry could not resist, but yes the swaying light is really annoying, I like it the way it was."

My advise is to drop the ""lets play"" bullshit and  focus on helpfull tips that not everybody knows about. After you get a following you can switch to some lets plays but thanks to pewdiepie making those damn things so common and setting off a chain of popular copy cats the market is saturated. You will find helpful videos are more appriciated, granted they will take more work, but if you want to succeed you need to put in the work."
7daystodie,388n71,Defttone,3,Tue Jun 2 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"i have just never posted in here as reddit seems to always be 70% negative. but ive been having great luck with the Playrust reddit and my lets plays, so i figured id drop by here and see ow the community is. also i have been doing lets plays on this game since before it was on steam and just recently came back to it on my new/reworked channel, so im not joining the ""craze"" so to speak. also nothing pewdiepie does can be called a lets play. I used to do instructional or update videos on this game but their production is to slow to get anything regular out of the game other than lets plays. unlike rust which updates weekly. thx for the input i look forward to hearing from others"
7daystodie,388n71,S1ipperyJim,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"lol pewdiepie hardly invented lets plays, if anything he was copying those that came long before him. Discouraging people from posting or making lets plays is not going to help the game grow, people don't watch a tutorial and magically think 'hey I want to play this game', let's plays are what make people want to play it. For instance, if pewdiepie stuck to tutorial videos for Amnesia would it have sold as many copies as it eventually sold due to his lets plays? no way in hell. So if you want this game to be more popular and have more players you want to encourage every form of videos from players not just tutorials, after all if you want to learn to craft an axe go to the wiki or the hundreds of other tutorial videos already out there. Each and every lets play is unique and different. Don't be a hater."

I imagine it may be in alpha 12 or shortly thereafter though since they removed gun part moulds with alpha 11 and added the new quality system, though said that they were just removed until the skill trees are in. Skill trees will accomplish what you're looking for rather well I think. :)"

7daystodie,38113h,TribalDancer,3,Mon Jun 1 02:58:36 2015 UTC,Carrying a toilet or two doesn't seem as unrealistic as carrying multiple stacks of stone haha. You could always balance it by having those types of items being unstackable.

7daystodie,38113h,Pointless_arguments,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:09:25 2015 UTC,Yeah it would need to be balanced to not be a more efficient way to grief. That's why my idea of a timer based on item strength would be used - this would make it no faster to pickup the block than it would be to destroy it.
7daystodie,38113h,Twad_feu,2,Mon Jun 1 13:24:32 2015 UTC,this could easily be solved by just making the crowbar able to pick up specific items like toilets instead of any block

7daystodie,38113h,SkoobyDoo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. A crowbar seems like a wierd tool for the job, but it makes more sense than bashing the shit out of something with a sledgehammer."
7daystodie,38113h,TheAngryBrian,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:18:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think a crowbar is great at pulling things off a wall IRL. I also chose crowbar as it distinct enough from existing tools to justify its addition, and also due to Half-Life influence."
7daystodie,38113h,SkoobyDoo,2,Mon Jun 1 16:38:40 2015 UTC,"Crowbars are good for prying, but in the process they tend to destroy whatever they're prying up. If something is nailed or bolted down, then prying it up will destroy those and possibly whatever they've been put into.  Maybe a wrench would be a better option? A crowbar to me seems like a good scavenging tool. Rather than loudly smashing your axe or pick against a door, a crowbar could have a timer on it that changes depending on the door type and quality. It could unlock doors, rather than smashing them open, making it good for keeping whatever place you entered sealed up so you can scavenge it without fear of zombies sneaking up on you."
7daystodie,38113h,TribalDancer,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"as someone who has both pryed up a toilet and opened a door with a crowbar, the former survived while the latter splintered, FWIW."
7daystodie,38113h,SkoobyDoo,2,Tue Jun 2 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"I know no door would likely actually survive a crowbar, it just seemed like a better idea to me than lockpicks since a lockpick doesnt have any use beyond unlocking things. A high quality crowbar in 7DtD could make a good enough improvised weapon that, perhaps, you would prefer to carry it around rather than your standard melee weapon. So you would then have multiple tools and a weapon replaced by a single scavenging multi-tool. You could make it more of an end-game item, too. Have it be something you learn how to make in the second home maintenance book."
7daystodie,38113h,TribalDancer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"Meh. I only play insane, so the only melee weapon is a crossbow. Even a sledgehammer takes multiple swings to do anything to normal zombies.  As far as utility goes, yeah it would be great to have a way to open doors without having to smash them down; let's keep the discussion about feature viability grounded well outside the realm of realism, zombie slaying survivor who can convert iron bars into perfect pipes using only their fists."
7daystodie,37zxnc,godzillanenny,2,Sun May 31 20:40:12 2015 UTC,When the server updated to 11.5 I was at my base and everything was fine. But later I log in and my base is basically deleted.  Stone parts of my house became dirt and a part of land close by turned from dirt to stone. my spikes and all my blocks that made up my base are gone except for a certain section. It barely missed my freind's house.  Later I noticed on my map it shows the exact spots that have reseted and after that they turn completely black and reset again to a different type of terrain.  I CAN'T damage it but I can place a frame but it goes below where it should go and I can basically dig by placing a block then picking it up again because the dirt there disappears.  I contacted the mod but haven't received  a reply about it yet.
