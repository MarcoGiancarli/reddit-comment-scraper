UnderTheDome,3e3r9h,Jayke1981,8,Tue Jul 21 18:56:44 2015 UTC,The TV series went off the book sometime around the beginning of the first season.

UnderTheDome,3duqvm,TheGlobalConspiracy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there's an answer  Do you mean when they were in the matrix ? I think they all saw her in the s2 finale when she said ""let's all go home"" and then they were all separated into the total white (like we see with Junior and Barbie I didn't see it coming , but I knew she was going to probably go dark side when she was the one down in the crater who ""guided them home"" If I recall , shortly after Christine saved Julia was when Julia ran away from everybody, and Christine wouldn't draw undo attention to herself ."
UnderTheDome,3duqvm,TheBondsOfFandoms,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant when they were in the matrix. Also on that point I think she also showed up at the military base. There's a scene where a few soldiers are escorting a woman wearing a head covering."
UnderTheDome,3duqvm,possessednayru,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"I think Barbie and Ben saw her because they weren't as ""into"" the matrix as everyone else. If that makes sense. I don't think they ever explained why they did. Barbie lost someone and was unhappy from it, Ben wondered why he didn't have asthma anymore, and he noticed the delivery guys were all the same dude. Also because if Ben wasn't the one to see Melanie in the matrix, his character wouldn't have done anything the entire time he was in the series. And it gave them a reason to kill him off."

UnderTheDome,3dsnkv,mauxfaux,9,Sun Jul 19 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'll do my best. (A lot of this is from the first two episodes because that's where most of the story happens.   Season starts out, we see the residents of Chester's Mill make it out through Melanie's portal/hole thing. Once they're out the Dome comes down.   Fast forward a year, we see how the residents have adjusted to their Dome-less existence. Barbie is back in the military, and is joined by Hunter (computer guy from season 2). He has a new girlfriend that he is sexually active with, but only in showers, apparently. (What happened to Julia, you ask? She died when the Dome came down, along with Big Jim and Junior.) Turns out, whoops! - Barbie didn't use protection because his new girlfriend is pregnant.   Joe and Norrie have broken up and Norrie has gone off to college. Joe seems to be having a problem with ""moving on"" - he refuses to leave Chester's Mill, even when given ample opportunity to do so. (the title of the first episode is 'Move On'. Get it? Because all the moving on?) She won't even return his texts anymore. Straight savage.   So remember how all those people died under the Dome? Well the townspeople do, because they've built a memorial to them in the center of town. This brings those who made it out of the Dome back to Chester's Mill for a ceremony, where we meet Christine Price, who is said to work for FEMA to help communities recover from catastrophic events, like earthquakes or giant domes. Remember her: she'll be important later.   This is where things get interesting. Ben, aka Skater Dude, is convinced that things are not what they seem in Chester's Mill because he notices the same person doing three different jobs in town. He tells Barbie this, and Barbie recognizes the guy as an enemy he encountered back in the military.   Here we find out the truth: the residents of Chester's Mill never made it out of the Dome. Melanie is an alien. Melanie's portal thing was a trap that led to all the townspeople being trapped in cocoons in the underground cave system and placed into an alternate reality. Its basically like a combination of The Truman Show and The Matrix.   Anyway, Melanie sees that Skater Dude is going to reveal the truth about the alternate reality and so she takes Skater Dude out of his cocoon and kills him, which also kills him in the alternate reality. RIP Skater Dude.   Here comes another plot twist: Big Jim, Julia, and Junior are all still alive and still under the Dome. Junior eventually gets taken to Melanie's CocoonLand and placed into the alternate reality. Barbie's dad shows up with the egg (through the portal behind his house) and then Melanie takes the egg and kills him. She takes the egg to CocoonLand and starts using it for some sort of magic cocoon-based alien ritual, but then Big Jim and Julia show up and are all like lol nope and they smash the egg, which allows everyone to awaken from their cocoons. Big Jim ends up killing Melanie, but don't worry, she'll probably be back at some point.   Now everyone's out of the cocoons, and also still under the Chester's Mill Dimmadome. Julia and Barbie get back together, but its awkward because he still remembers shower sex with his girlfriend (her name is Eva, by the way. Forgot to mention.) Eva is now under the dome too, and she also remembers shower sex with Barbie.  Boom, love triangle.   Norrie starts a relationship with Hunter, which makes Joe all sad and jealous. It doesn't last long though, because she ends up going back to Joe, who happens to have a lot of condoms because he's a playa.   Junior burns down the Rennie house after Christine Price convinces him to. Yeah, remember her? She's calling herself a therapist now, and we also find out that she's basically an alien commander/mother/leader. Most of the town of Chester's Mill is under her mind control (the ones who aren't are Barbie, Julia, Big Jim, Joe, and Norrie.) The townspeople are endlessly loyal to her, doing anything she says without question and voraciously defending her honor.  Julia does some snooping around and finds out that Christine actually works for Acteon (sp?), aka Barbie's dad's company. Acteon is inside the dome as well, and they want two things: the egg, and Christine. Julia gives them Christine, but whoops, Big Jim smashed the egg. He gets imprisoned - along with his canine BFF - and Acteon plans to use him for experimentation as a control against the townspeople, who have what is considered a ""virus"" - the thing inside them that makes them loyal to Christine.   That's the gist of it. The rest of the season promises total apocalypse, lots of intensity, and more Dome."

UnderTheDome,3dsnkv,ununiquespecies,4,Mon Jul 20 03:22:04 2015 UTC,"I really don't know where they are going.  Season 1 was reasonable - poorly acted and some of the plot lines went nowhere, but followable.  Season 2 was just weird.  Season 3 is on the same path.  I think what makes it even harder than Season 2 is that at least Season 2 was building on character development and plots from the reasonable season, but Season 3 is just winging it because nothing was really logically set up for it in the previous season.  Does that make sense?  I watch the show for the trainwreck properties, but I've given up on following plots or hoping questions get logically answered."
UnderTheDome,3dsnkv,bjt23,7,Sun Jul 19 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"I like season 3 better than season 2.  Season 2 was stale because it was just pretty much the same as season 1.  Season 3 is something else entirely, the plot advances episode to episode, and no it isn't the same but it keeps things interesting.  I think a good comparison would be Danger 5, where Season 1 was the battle of the week while Season 2 (correlating to Under The Dome season 3) is more connected plot-wise."

UnderTheDome,3dnefj,kona_worldwaker,12,Fri Jul 17 18:06:27 2015 UTC,I was honestly surprised they gave as much information away as they did in that preview. It seemed like it had major spoilers for the rest of the season.
UnderTheDome,3dnefj,surferjakeheron,3,Sat Jul 18 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. Unless a lot happens in this next episode, I have a feeling they just spoiled the whole season's plot."
UnderTheDome,3dnefj,surferjakeheron,4,Sat Jul 18 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"I assume it was a desperate attempt to attract more viewers for the remainder of the season, but that seems counterintuitive since now I know what's going to happen and am less interested in watching future episodes."
UnderTheDome,3dnefj,Dinger2013,7,Sat Jul 18 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"My personal theory, from seeing the preview, is that Mike Sorrentino will join the cast as Barbie's smarter younger brother and will become his newest love interest. Joe and 5head will have a baby. Julia will start her period. Big Jim will decide to kill the dog after all. Junior will start his period. Duckface's plan to create a plot will fail. A bunch of meteorites. That's all. Hope you have a sense of humor."
UnderTheDome,3dnefj,HSaddict101,5,Sat Jul 18 03:24:32 2015 UTC,"Joe and 5Head break loose from Junior and his army of zombies, run for their lives, but somehow meet up with Julia who explains how Big Jim got locked up and they need to break him out. They get in Julia's car but the zombie crowd catches up and follows the car to the house where Big Jim is locked up at. Bunch of armed guys come out of the house when they see a car pull up and aim their guns at Julia, Joe, and 5Head. All of a sudden, the armed men get shot and killed by their own guy, the doctor, who is in charge of the operation. The doctor hastily brings Julia, Joe, and 5Head in the house, locks the door, and then explains how crazy lady Christine transformed into an alien, took Big Jim and Indy hostage, and went back to the world outside the dome, then, all of a sudden, the zombies, who found the house, starts clawing on the outside walls and starts breaking into the windows. Julia, Joe, 5Head, and the doctor quickly go out the back door (escaping the dome) where they see the whole world being invaded by aliens, people dying, houses on fire, and jets falling out of the sky. The T.V. show runs credits. The end."

UnderTheDome,3dl0up,flossy_mcwobblestein,2,Fri Jul 17 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, Aliens.  Unfortunately the show has become waaayyy more muddled than the book since the network decided to milk it for everything it could and completely turn the show into a weak mess. Now it seems like a mix between Under the Dome and The Tommyknockers (even Marg Helgenberger!).   I wish that they would have wrapped up the original story after 1-2 seasons, then kept going if they think they could have added to the story in a real way and had the viewers. Now it's nothing like the book, with a ridiculous storyline. I'll keep watching the show for now just because I've already invested time in it, but I really hope they get an early enough cancellation notice that they can wrap it up in a good way that doesn't resemble their previous season finales."

UnderTheDome,3dl17l,KaladinStormborn,3,Fri Jul 17 13:37:36 2015 UTC,"It's fucking weird and the writers deviated from the book without a concrete or cohesive story line. Like you said, everything seems extremely haphazard, everyone is manipulating everyone so it's incredibly hard to sympathise or support various people and on top of that, the 'townspeople' are a convenient sheep whenever the writers need them and when not, they don't exist.   It's a shit show people, there is nothing left to defend. And to those saying 'oh you just must not like sci-fi' or some other shit, I love sci-fi - this is a poorly written drama with some bad sci-fi/alien elements."
UnderTheDome,3dl17l,onafarawaybeach,5,Fri Jul 17 05:27:17 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you why I love the show. It is the only show that I have ever watched where characters switch characterization. An example is Big Jim. As a paternal figure he has a duality - he is protective/respectable but also aggressive/absurd. The genius in this show lies in this switching between dualities. Within a season you will hate and love Big Jim in the most extreme way. The trick is that this switching duality switches within a season but also within an episode, a scene and even within a gesture. I have switched from hating to loving Big Jim in this way and every character, with the exception of Julia the hero, has this duality. What you previously hated, you now love.  Other characters display this switching duality within the narrative and each character has a nice duality. In the Matrix world the therapist was an empathetic healer, in the real world a sexed up, controlling psyopath. Joe: supportive/wimpy. Sam: drunk loser/heroic actions. Norrie: bratty/passionate.  You will switch between the dualities within a season, episode, scene and even gesture. At the end of last season I loathed Big Jim and now he has redeemed himself and this happens over and over.   What is this show teaching us that other shows with more one-sided characters where you never switch your allegiance, which is ubiquitous in drama? It's barely scifi, that is true, but I have realized that scifi is actually barely scifi. The scifi is just a setup for the drama and mostly unimportant.  There are other aspects I've written about concerning the symbols and metaphors that also make this show very entertaining. It's poorly written but that doesn't detract from the story. The current arc seems to be related to a communal vs individualistic society, communistic ideas that are being implemented by a female leader who persuades rather than forces, almost a non-technological brave new world with Big Jim as the individualistic counter who will team up with Julie and defeat it.  Julia is the daughter/hero figure (with the curiously name Barbie as her sidekick that she has to keep reigning in b/c he's constantly confused about who is good and bad), Big Jim is the father figure that Julia mostly hates (when she slapped him his barely concealed respect and enjoyment was hilarious) and the mother is the dome itself with its orifice/vagina/cave and round enclosure. Ultimately this could be read as a metaphor for the conflict between individual and group."

UnderTheDome,3dem1e,JakeArvizu,21,Fri Jul 17 02:27:38 2015 UTC,"Help me understand your attitude towards this show, as to me there doesn't seem to be a reason to watch a show when you fucking hate it.   Calm down. I don't think anyone has said that they hate Under the Dome. I recognize that the show is absolute horse shit, but that doesn't mean I hate it. I watch it because of how horrible it is, and because I'm curious to see where it goes.   All a series has to do for me is to keep me interested in the episodes.   Yep, me too. The show is interesting. It's just not particularly well paced, cast, acted, written, or directed. And I recognize that. Still want to see where it goes though.   Seriously. Everyone on here seems like they're just circlejerking the fuck out of this show, OH MY GOD ITS SO TERRIBLE. Just don't watch it.   Don't tell me what to do. To me, this just sounds like ""stop enjoying things differently than how I enjoy them.""   The characters are dumb as shit, most of the time, and the director can't fucking direct the show, but I do want to know what the fuck is happening w/ the dome and all that, and the actions that happen in between are all by-play.   I think this is how most of us feel, so why shouldn't we post about it? Should we only post positive things while ignoring the fact that the show is put together so terribly? The show wouldn't be nearly as fun without being able to laugh at it. (And honestly, if we only posted about the positive aspects of the show, there would be very little to talk about.)"
UnderTheDome,3dem1e,JTorch1,3,Thu Jul 16 01:18:29 2015 UTC,I agree. I really liked the show an got into it. Then as it started to have rediculous moments I ignored that. I think with this season it's gotten insanely rediculous and now I can't ignore it. I still watch but only because I'm hoping the writers have people who pay attention to fans online an may see the error of their ways. Hopefully they turn it around. The show had a lot of potential an still does have some even with the frustrating turns and outlandish plot changes.

I checked in like, spring, for the date of the S3 premiere and wrote it on my calendar so I wouldn't forget. I really enjoy watching it. But I also love commenting on the live thread and joking about what's going on.  I think that a lot of people on here feel that objectively, the show is just bad. (which is different than hating it!) The writing is confusing and inconsistent while also being incredibly repetitive - nothing really goes anywhere. The show comes off as low budget with it's cheap effects and makeup. And the characters are so, so obnoxious and hard to root for because they are constantly making the same stupid mistakes. But that's part of what make's the show so awesome and entertaining. It's like a campy horror movie that becomes a cult classic. While it may not be a good movie, it hits the right notes that makes the audience love it almost because of it's flaws.  Compare this to a similar summer show, The Whispers, where I usually just dick around on my phone for half of it and am still able to understand most of the plot. That show has higher production, better actors, and a more coherent story, but I find it incredibly boring and am only still watching to see where it goes. I watch Under the Dome because it's fun, both to watch and to joke with others in the audience about how dumb everyone is being."

If you visit the GoT discussions there is bashing here and there (of course that show is far less flawed), but mostly discussion. I had expected at least a bit of discussion here. Instead, it's pretty much just complaining about Fivehead's acting and sponsors. I mean, it's terrible, but I think we established that 3 seasons ago."

UnderTheDome,3d3hqo,SIDESTEAL,3,Mon Jul 13 05:46:02 2015 UTC,"Big Jim isn't realistic (duh, right?). What he represents is the ultimate powerful male. He is devoid of fear. An extreme follower of rules and very moralistic but at the same time always transgressing those same rules and being obscene. He represents the ultimate masculinity which is why  he always redeems himself, he is never too far gone.  King is highly symbolic and most of the characters are not meant to be fully characterized/fleshed out. Ultimately (and this reoccurs with King and David Lynch), he is a caricature of a father as seen from a child's perspective with all of its exaggerated contradictions. Daddy is the enforcer/creator of external law at the same time smirking and allowing you to transgress the law. He has no guilt for he is the Law and not subject to it. He protects and attacks.  What people miss about this great show is that there are many aspects of it that are not realistic but rather than seeing this as a flaw it is actually the strength of the show. The unrealistic aspects are the point b/c they are symbolic or metaphors for different concepts. In its way it is more real than reality, the same as how a fictional story can express truth easier than an anecdote though the latter is more true."

UnderTheDome,3d232g,Fuarian,4,Sun Jul 12 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the book -and the aliens were such a minor minor part - was that the dome was SPOILER ALERT like that alien children toying with Chester's Mill like a child burning ants with a magnifying glass. I might have glossed over something because during the tiny part of the book that dealt with the aliens, shit was getting really real in town. Every other plotline was coming to a head and the aliens were honestly the least interesting part. The lord of the flies style conflict  was way more engaging.  That doesn't really fit with the egg hatching into the child. That's a good thought though, I hadn't made that connection. That being said, the show is different enough that the egg could be anything at this point."

UnderTheDome,3d232g,miicah,2,Tue Jul 14 11:49:06 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame that the show seems to take the opposite approach. I'm sad that things like the radio station and the craziness with the police never really made it into the show. I mean.. There was some of both, but it was just shadows of shadows.  It's ironic because The Mist -which I see as a precursor to UtD in a lot of ways - has a pretty great film adaptation that's more or less true to the source."
UnderTheDome,3d232g,greatfriscofreakout,2,Wed Jul 15 00:05:04 2015 UTC,"Since this is a conjecture thread I'll give you some ideas that spring to mind (I've not read the book).  The Dome show itself is highly feminine. The dome is egg-like itself and inside this egg is a zone, a forbidden zone. Now, it's pretty much a vagina. It looks like one, the perverse psychiatrist grabbed some its ""jelly"" to spread on Junior's mouth (pretty obvious) and she appeared as the head cocoon, place towards the spot where the clit would be (wish I had an image).  Here's my theory. The dome itself represent subjectivity. You are encased in a transparent membrane (your body) but you can see others (eyes) yet you are not them. You are ultimately encased alone in your own microcosm and the barrier/zone between what is outside and inside is the crux of the matter. This is where all of the ambiguous horror and fascination reside.  When you leave the zone through it's subterranean orifice (vagina) http://previously.tv/m/2014-08-12-under-the-dome26.jpg you arrive in a playground (like birth/children). To get into the dome however you oddly (not really though) have to go through a tunnel in the basement (anal metaphor but also a metaphor about how there is a passageway from the outside world through an underground of unconscious/subconscious route). You arrive via a lake (another birth metaphor). In a way, you are ""born"" which ever direction you go.  The egg, which was placed deep in the uterus, is just that, an egg. It's placed it its proper spot to hatch. The problem is that all of this is ambiguous as to whether it's friendly or malevolent. The show relates to our distrust of things b/c of their dual nature. A mouth can kiss, a mouth can bite. A egg, can hatch new things, but they can also be bad (and literally you can birth to a malformed baby). The ending will provide the moral of the story - is all of this bad or good?  Having written all of this I can sum up in a nutshell that ultimately Under the Dome is about human subjectivity and how is related to the mystery of sex."
UnderTheDome,3d232g,onafarawaybeach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:52 2015 UTC,So Big Jim destroying the egg could represent in this case? Contraceptives?
UnderTheDome,3d232g,onafarawaybeach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"Possibly. The Father traditionally does enforce sexual prohibitions. Like our reality/dreams, things that are symbolic can mix and mingle. Sometimes a cigar isn't a penis but most of the time it is. I doubt every thing means something but there should be an overarching theme.  In the ""real"" world Jim simply doesn't want contamination of ""his"" town, that he perceives as similar to himself. He is the town so he doesn't want the constitution of it messed with, like his own constitution. Symbolically what Jim represents is paternal authority which is scary and ridiculous at the same time. Jim destroying the egg represents his refusal of the ""birth"" of anything new and potentially scary (in reality and in an individual's consciousness). He's there to keep contradictory order - the implicit and explicit rules."
UnderTheDome,3d232g,AmIonFire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"My theory is the the egg contained the alien life-force; in the video of the ""anthropologist"", when she touched the egg, her arm went all alien-looking...then she went on the mission to ""download"" the life force into the Chesters Mill folks, like the egg was a flash-drive of sorts. I dont think it was meant to hatch itself, but to spread some kind of alien DNA.     Wasnt the egg destroyed when Big Jim bashed it a few weeks ago?"

Here's my comment in the episode thread (check the second bullet point, but feel free to read/comment on the other ones if you wish too!):  OK OK, so I know this show doesn't make any damn sense, but I am struggling with a few things in this episode! Any thoughts?   Do they really have a big enough ecosystem of pigs etc to just go around hunting them? Shouldn't they be raising them first to make sure they have enough before killing whatever few they have left?? So why did Fivehead get all excited when she saw computer guy brought her chocolate? Either she remembers a year of eating anything she wanted (chocolate included) inside the matrix rip-off or she forgets that but had chocolate no less than three weeks ago when there was no dome. Logically they didn't run out of chocolate right away, so it has maybe been about a week since she hasn't had chocolate. So why the super orgasmic joy? So Big Jim magic punches his way to the door of his captor's science house, and dashes out the door and you can hear an over dubbed ""let him go, he can't get far"" and then in the next scene they are chasing him. So... did they ignore that or what huh? Also, these guys have body armor on and the squib exploded on the guy's shoulder so why did he ""die"" when Redhead shot him? And she is now a cold blooded killer? Whaa?   Just wonderin'"
UnderTheDome,3ct673,j4p4n,5,Fri Jul 10 18:54:27 2015 UTC,Did he die? Seems like he fell when he was shot in the shoulder. Unlike Big Jim and his son that can take a bullet without missing a beat.

Now, the show has absolutely no resemblance to the book what so ever.  The show was closest to the book (and also at its best) in the series pilot.

But I suppose I could see how people doped up on oxytocin could have more empathy for each other and therefore work together in a group more easily, but also become more pliable and easier to boss around. People content with their interpersonal relationships are probably less likely to rebel and stir up protests and conflicts that could result in 'political unrest' with current leadership."

Walt winds up dying in the last episode and Jesse gets away.  After all this, some weird alternate reality appears and Hank is stuck under a dome, going by the name of James ""Big Jim"" Rennie. He is the only character left from the show. He frames a good guy named Barbie for murder and tries to have him hanged. He is all set to be hanged but some weird thing happens with the egg and he is saved. After that, weird things happen and Hank is constantly the bad guy that everyone goes from hating to loving back to hating. And more weird things happen that some science teacher (who seems like she has a PhD in every science field) is able to answer. Literally everything from magnetic fields to fire to complete darkness. All of this seems to make perfect sense to the characters while the viewers remain completely confused and just watch it for the inconsistencies in Hank's alternate reality"

Hank Schrader's character is still a main character, he's inconsistent saving the town one day and murdering people the next.  They are still in the dome.  There was a portal to another town outside of the dome, Barbie and another few people escaped there.  They all found a portal back into the town so they went back to tell people how to get out.  Big Jim made a deal with this shady corporation Aktion that he would give them the magic egg in exchange that they would let him and his son out of the dome.  He throws the egg out of the dome and the portal out closes up.  Barbie thinks he found another way out so he takes the town but they all just wind up in the matrix.  Big Jim convinces Aktion to send the egg back, which gets stolen by the chick who runs the matrix.  Big Jim goes to where the townspeople are in the physical world, the egg is there and starts to release energy so he smashes it.  Everyone gets out of the matrix.  Everyone's personality is different and some aktion employee poses as a psychologist to take over the town.  That's pretty much it so far."

The whole life force thing is ridiculous. Hell, everything is ridiculous, but that stood out. Junior's bullet wound was healed by the cocoon and it looks like it cleaned the blood from his shirt too! But not the dirt. Junior burns down his house. Wasn't there a season 1 episode where they were worried about anything being set on fire in case it spread and burned down the entire town? Joe looks like 3 years older than when the show started. The one year time gap could've explained some of that ageing but now we're back to ""three weeks ago"" again so he just looks ridiculous. Fivehead is back. She looked pretty in the alternate reality with the different hair, but now she's Fivehead again. She did look hot with that bow though. Even though that too was ridiculous. They all worship the moon now? What the fuck? This show... I can't even.   See you next week, Dome lovers!"

The ending is kind of whatever, but that's often the case with Stephen King. The journey though was great though. The drama came from the people and not the mystical crap and mysteries and as a result, it felt a lot more real.  I was thinking about reading it again, and this thread might just push me to it."
UnderTheDome,3by5zq,greatfriscofreakout,2,Fri Jul 3 20:32:08 2015 UTC,I read the book after Season 1 I think. I really missed the drug storyline from the show (at the first few eps it had some emphasis but not much).

I remember that I planned to skip some chapters to save time and start with ""season 2"". But because I missed the first tv-episode I started at the beginning. And I kept waiting for the plot to reach the point of ""episode 2"" so I could start skipping. I think after about 3 hours I finally realized that the show was very very different from the book."

UnderTheDome,3bvy03,Mayooonaise,7,Thu Jul 2 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"A big dome came down, trapping people inside. There were disagreements and fights about how to handle limited resources. (Think Jericho, or any post-apocalyptic show.) Chaos broke out, people died. A guy named Big Jim thought he was hot shit and decided to make all of the rules, including killing some people. One guy, nicknamed Barbie, didn't like this. Some teens found a small glowy egg-like thing. It ended up outside the dome, in the hands of some well-contected guy who also happened to be Barbie's dad. A girl named Melanie, who died several years prior, came back from the dead. Barbie found a cave that led to a way out of the dome and miraculously into the next town. He went back into the dome though, I don't remember how he got back in. Everyone gathered in the cave and Melanie said to the town folks, ""follow me and we will get out."" That sums up the first two seasons, which takes place over 3 weeks total."

In Game of Thrones (which of course has a much better writing) the main characters are all so evil or unlikeable that people, including me, seriously wanted the Night's King (the linked image is a spoiler!) to ""win the game"".  At about the end of season 2 I wanted Big Jim to really kill every freaking single inhabitant of the dome because they act so damn stupid and foolish, or because they are annoying, untrustful bitches, or because they are too religious, or because it's so god damn hard to feel just a tiny bit of empathy for anyone of those trash people.  Seeing him rescueing them all even if he isn't liked by them just saddens me. He should just leave them to their fates.  But seeing here that alot of people actually watch the show because it is so god-awful bad makes me smile. Thanks guys!"

Average IQ of a Chester's Mill inhabitant seems to be <50, I mean, they're all a bunch of animals following a pathological liar and murderer who keeps on getting away with crimes against humanity, I mean COME ON.   I'm currently binge-watching it (S02E11) and sometimes I have to take a break because I'm too irritated by those people taking the worst possible actions ALWAYS and have a hard time figuring simple things out or see patterns.  I'll keep watching it because I want to know what the heck is that dome and ""energy source"", but that's about it. It's really hard to alternate between Hannibal(3), True Detective (2) and THIS but hey, people rated ""Mad Max : Fury Road"" 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, everything is possible."
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,curioustrout,2,Tue Jun 30 16:31:15 2015 UTC,Haven't watched Mad Max. Is it bad?
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,cenkozan,3,Tue Jun 30 18:53:56 2015 UTC,Mad Max is fucking brilliant. It's one of the best action films ever made and was brilliantly directed.
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,KaladinStormborn,0,Sun Jul 5 07:28:45 2015 UTC,Just watched it as it just dropped to the pirate bay. I LOVED it. I didn't want it to end. But I agree with the other commenter on that it needed more character development. Maybe in the sequels.
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,cenkozan,2,Sun Jul 5 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"I watched it in the cinemas, and still downloaded a Blu Ray rip later on. It's one of the few films, if the only one, where I have actually gotten a lot of value out of a re-watch. Every time is still amazing.   I disagree with regards to character development, Mad Max is meant to be a mysterious figure of unknown origins and motivations thrown into situations where he needs to make big decisions and fight for survival; and he did exactly that in this film. Have you seen the previous films, because I think they explain his character pretty well, in that there isn't much to explain; a capable loner trekking the apocalyptic world.    The other characters had great development, Furiosa (who is arguably the main character next to Max) had enormous development with her background, motivations and emotional dilemmas explored greatly."
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,KaladinStormborn,-1,Sun Jul 5 11:34:22 2015 UTC,"But how had she lost her arm? Also, I really wanted to know more about the villains, how they turned the way they look, how the valhalla guys got picked, or what is the frekking half-life of a person. Maybe you are right. I am so much invested in TV shows, that are all about the character development, I forgot that they only have mere two hours to film a movie."
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,cenkozan,3,Sun Jul 5 11:45:31 2015 UTC,"Haha you're obviously a person which needs to know every back story, origin and explanation! Nothing wrong with that, but I like a bit of mystery. And I feel like often films, and tv shows, really condescend the audience by explaining every single facet of the film/tv show's universe. I think that a lot of the authenticity/ believability/engagement of Fury Road arose out of an already developed society with its own lore, religion and hierarchy. The existence/relationships of Gas Town and Bullet farm added this air of realism whereby the audience was thrown into a world to witness one story, rather than a crazy sequence of events created for the films purposes.   Although it would be sick to see how she lost her arm. And while it would be cool to investigate more of that in sequels, as Hardy is signed on for a few more, the way Mad Max films have run, I feel as though that is probably not likely and that future films will take place in new environments with new characters and stories to be told.   Also if you've seen the first film you know Max's hatred of the immoral and origins as a 'cop'."
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,KaladinStormborn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:54:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. I can't forget the original Max movie. It is a cult one. And also in that movie, there was no indication that it was an apocalyptic world right? It adds a lot to the mystery you are talking about."

I dropped out half way through the second season, but I've just caught up to the season 2 finale (as I type) - crying with laughter when Big Jim just warned the dome he'd give it 3 seconds until he murdered everyone. Best US comedy drama I've ever watched. It can only get better/worse - never ceases to surprise hehe - Looking forward to season 3! it's absolute rubbish, but it does make me laugh out loud = quality entertainment /season 2 just finished... I legitimately like it even more ;)"
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,timbermill,5,Wed Jul 1 20:11:50 2015 UTC,I'd like the show better if it stuck more to the book. The show is way different and I feel like the show has become so outlandish because it doesn't follow the book.
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,TheeFlipper,3,Tue Jun 30 17:07:36 2015 UTC,Season 1 was the closest to the book anything after that is just based on an idea that came from the book
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,anonymous028,3,Tue Jun 30 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"But season 1 was also so far away from the book. Phil Bushy wasn't a radio dj. Rachel was middle aged, Angie was killed way sooner, there were no 4 hands, Big Jim wasn't just a crooked car salesman/selectman he was a drug manufacturer and distributor, and many more huge differences that completely change the story.  It's a shit-show compared to the book and I feel like following the book would have made for better television."
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,TheeFlipper,2,Tue Jun 30 20:21:58 2015 UTC,I know some things had to change so it could be on tv. Junior comes to mind. But the Phil Bushy storyline changes just irritated me. Especially because I can't for the life of me remember why Big Jim is hoarding propane on the show...
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,greatfriscofreakout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think they bothered explaining, just let the whole propane/meth storyline fall off and hoped the viewers would forget"
UnderTheDome,3bn2p2,AmIonFire,3,Thu Jul 2 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Once I finally let go of my desire that it match the book, I started liking it better. I just think of them (book and series) as two totally unrelated things now, that just happen to have a similar plot.

Or her ostentatiously placed amethyst geode. That's our first clue that Shrink Lady isn't a casual observer. She says ""damn"" when something doesn't happen between Joe and Norrie at the pier. Real therapists don't connive things to happen, they help you find your own path. So she's part of whatever scheme Melanie was driving."

UnderTheDome,3bgs2e,romulusnr,7,Wed Jul 8 05:10:28 2015 UTC,That's a big assumption to say the show will actually explain something.
UnderTheDome,3bgs2e,kingvicc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:35:07 2015 UTC,Melanie being an alien in disguise definitely answered a question I continuously had on my mind. Where were Melanie's parents and why wasn't anyone / or Melanie looking for them? I mean I know they would be the first people I'd look for.

They all start out slow, build up and seem great, then the writers seem to run out of ideas and usually will lose it's way and seem rediculous. The show jumped the shark for me last season but was savable with good writing. This recent episode told me there's no new writer coming to save it this season."

Both Melanie and Christine (and probably Eva) are all trying to get certain things to happen to the characters in the fake world. When Big Jim destroys the egg, a bunch of life-changing moments were about to occur -- Norrie sleeping with Hunter, Joe forgiving Steve, Junior torching his house.  In the Matrix they didn't give a damn about the lives people led, as long as they led them (and didn't disrupt the system).  So the comparison between the premiere and the Matrix stops at the cocoons and the fake world.   Besides, the Matrix ripped off The Invisibles, so there."

I had to pause it right there and vent for a few minutes. I have to keep watching for closure. What gets me is how this is still running when much better shows have been ended halfway through the first season. I wonder how much money SK is sinking in this. Maybe it is just an extended ad for M$ and Toyota.
UnderTheDome,3b6mg9,Dinger2013,6,Fri Jun 26 17:25:06 2015 UTC,I might stop watching this season out of pity because it's sad that everyone involved on the show thinks that they're doing a good job still.  Do you think that they'll ever find out about why people watch or that this subreddit exists? Do you think that she knows she is known as fivehead?
UnderTheDome,3b6mg9,Maninhartsford,2,Sun Jul 5 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"One of the higher ups gave an interview recently and they asked him about it. He said something along the lines of ""it's really easy to criticize and hard to develop a tv show."" So we should all stop complaining and appreciate what they're doing because, like, it's really hard"
UnderTheDome,3b6mg9,Dinger2013,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's hard for them to accept all the money they receive too. I don't feel sorry for them. They should do better and make an enjoyable show for people who actually work for a living to enjoy. There are plenty of other shows like game of thrones and the walking dead that stay consistent and make sense, so why can't Under the Dome?"
UnderTheDome,3b6mg9,Maninhartsford,3,Mon Jun 29 01:59:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know, I agree. I was being sarcastic. They act like they're doing the best they can. I'm sorry, no. Everything about the show is painfully lazy and confusing. (so much so that I'll never miss an episode)"

UnderTheDome,3b7x4c,Join_You_In_The_Sun,5,Fri Jun 26 18:37:37 2015 UTC,I like it. It gives this subreddit the same 'high quality but looking critically shows a dumpster fire'-style the show has.
UnderTheDome,3b7x4c,venn177,8,Sat Jun 27 08:54:01 2015 UTC,I think updating the cast section by removing the characters who have died would be a way of spoiling the show for newcomers who visit the subreddit before being fully caught up.

UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,Dudenheim19,8,Fri Jun 26 20:47:23 2015 UTC,Unsensible inconsistencies on this show? They wouldn't dare.
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,maybelying,4,Fri Jun 26 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"I hope the writers weren't that desperate to have a unsensible inconsistency give away a lot of the show's plot.   Seriously?  The writer's gave away the plot when they had Barbie refer to the possibility of an alternate world right in the beginning of the show.  That came out of nowhere, and hadn't even been implied at the end of S2.   I'm confident that the guy will reappear later in the series. Remember how Barbie was going to kill him before he got the call about his girlfriend. That must mean something, right?   The call was just to underscore the fact that Melanie was pulling the strings and trying to direct the players.  I mentioned in another comment that the actor playing this guy isn't appearing on any of the upcoming episode cast lists, so I don't think there's any more story to tell with him."
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,lyotox,6,Sat Jun 27 06:02:10 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm a little lost here. Were they ALL the time inside the cocoons?  What I understood is that after they crossed that cave they went in the cocoons. Anyway this show sucks but I still watch it. About the face, I guess It was just something the writers needed to give Dale and the skate dude a reason to believe everything was fake."
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,JakeArvizu,3,Fri Jun 26 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"All of them origanal people that were trapped in the Dome were all in the Matrix except for Big Jim, Julia, and of course the orchestrator Melanie. The purpose of that fake world was obviously to get them to ""move on"" but what for? I don't know why these shows have to distance themselves so far from reality. It makes it not fun to watch... i.e. Once Upon A Time, Falling Skies, Lost etc."
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,lyotox,2,Fri Jun 26 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"You take that back, Lost was amazing. These shows aren't even in the same realm of quality."
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,newmanowns,0,Tue Jun 30 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but as I understand this matrix-like thing with effects that remember the 80's happened after they crossed the cave at the end of season 2, right?  Seriously, what a shitty show. However I keep watching it lol"
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,maybelying,3,Sun Jun 28 07:17:01 2015 UTC,They entered the matrix when they entered that white sticky place in the cave.  It's consistent to the scene when Junior went into the matrix from the real world.
UnderTheDome,3b7zgz,Maninhartsford,3,Sun Jun 28 07:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to read too much into it yet, because from my experience the writers frequently throw away plot elements from episode to episode.  Barbie killed the guy in Yemen, and yet he was constantly re-appearing, which would suggest that he was not real but generated by the system.  It could be that maybe the aliens can only create images of people they have encountered, it could be that there were only a handful of different characters to play the various NPC's in the lives of the Chester's Mill residents, and none of them aside from Ben ever noticed.    It was interesting to note that the next time Barbie saw him, he had a mustache, so maybe the system was trying to further disguise him.  At any rate, I don't think we'll be seeing him again.  The writers aren't that subtle, they usually belt you over the head repeatedly with a plot point when they can be bothered having one.  We saw the CSI girl and Barbie's new girlfriend appear among the residents of Chester's Mill, but then we already knew they were going to appear as part of the cast.  We would have seen some reference to the dude, as well, if he was real.  More to the point, the actor isn't listed in the published cast lists for upcoming episodes."

But they listened to what was said online and started answering questions. When I saw the red door I immediately though of the hatch in Lost. We don't rally know for sure if the dome is even of alien origin. We just assume. It's been a couple seasons and all we know is Jim probably is bad as he is most of the time. But honestly would a town allow someone like that to go this long without at least locking him up permanently? He's pretty much in his same role as season one just with a tarnished reputation and he's almost killed everyone a few times. If they wanted a bad guy how about the idea the town couldn't be perfect and there's got to of been plenty of criminals caught under the dome to worry about. And why would anyone keep the way out a secret for so long, it makes little sense. Even their reason makes no sense.they shouldn't of provided a way out, but if they do it should of closed shortly after. Technically the entire town could of at one point left and figured hit what the done is from the other side. It's taking a stretch of the imagination to buy into a lot of what's going on knowing human behavior would be greatly different. And would the Government really allow private contractors to guard and have so much influence on such a thing? Please."

UnderTheDome,3aukd3,Culinarytracker,2,Thu Jun 25 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"Setting aside the fact that King approved the rewrite, is the book better, and if they followed the book more would that of helped the series more in your opinion? I mean I'm not even seeing a story arch, the story line plateaued a while ago IMHO. And I suspect it's because they don't want to have too much resolved too soon because they aren't sure how much longer the show will last for various reasons (ratings, main character/actors contract negotiations) so they're waiting and seeing if it's another one season or two of life left. But if true it's a bad idea because that sort of thing tends to frustrate viewers and makes them drop off."
UnderTheDome,3aukd3,sxarr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think strict adherence to the book would have made the show better exactly... The fact that it's a new story is a good thing. Also the premise is flexible enough to go lots of different directions. I'm glad it's not the same.  However, the book had an end. If this show goes on not clearing up its main mysteries, and ends up canceled, then we are all getting screwed. I've had this happen before. (Invasion - 2006)"

UnderTheDome,37cm1h,Vaatune,8,Tue May 26 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"My theories:   Big Jim was watching home videos of Junior (and maybe Pauline?), even though CBS cleverly retconned it to ""summer repeats"". I think that the town believes that they got outside the dome but are still actually trapped in it. Maybe it just got bigger? Or maybe the ""light"" leads to another domed town. This other town seems to be a place where they have embraced the dome and are all under one ultimate belief, which will most likely be contrary to the citizen's of Chester's Mill. Like Linda was quick to be killed off in the Season 2 premiere, I think Sam will be killed off in the Season 3 premiere. I don't really see what purpose his character can really have in the story now besides having him bond with Junior more, which can easily be done with Big Jim instead."

I watch because I've become (surprisingly) attached to Andrew(?) Koch's portrayal of Junior. Rachael Lefeverre gave a better performance in Twilight (imho), and that's saying something.

UnderTheDome,2xersw,Peetrius,17,Sat Feb 28 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think missing an episode really changes much, because I'm pretty sure they bring in new writers for each episode and don't let them watch any of the previous ones.  Continuity isn't exactly a strong point for the series, and they're really just making it up as they go along.  If you made it through the first half, why not just finish it off?    Honestly, I find the show to be so bad that it is good on a whole different level.  They have some pretty decent actors on the show who are doing the best with what they have to work with, and if I lower my expectations for what I would expect of a quasi-sci-fi series and just enjoy it for the completely unintentional campiness, it's really not that bad.  It's a show I love to hate-watch."
UnderTheDome,2xersw,BranWafr,3,Sat Feb 28 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The show is bad, if you are talking about the plot and writing.  But, it's fun to watch just to see what the hell they are going to do next and just how badly they are going to do it.  I don't think they bring in new writers each week, I think they assign each episode to a different writer and they all write their episodes all at once without talking to each other.  Any ""continuity"" only happens if one of the writers accidentally talks to another writer during that time period and accidentally lets something slip out.  Then, when all the scripts are done they have someone who puts them in the least confusing order and adds in a line or two of dialog to each script to make it seem like they are connected, somehow.  At least that's how I see it in my brain."

UnderTheDome,2pvuvl,Canoneer,0,Mon Jan 26 17:50:25 2015 UTC,I think basing this show after an experienced reality (that you're comfortable with) and not the actual setting of the show is a mistake. I liked the first season but didn't really care for the second as I also thought it jumped the shark. So the bad science and unrealistic actions do not seem to be legitimate gripes. Especially the bad science. We're talking about a device that defies reality and can do whatever it wants. Who knows how a person would react to this concept; as no one has ever experienced it before?  /just my subjective thoughts.
UnderTheDome,2pvuvl,HomerTron,2,Sat Dec 20 14:05:11 2014 UTC,I'm not even talking about the science of the device / dome. Just the actual science stuff.
UnderTheDome,2pvuvl,HomerTron,-1,Sat Dec 20 14:45:40 2014 UTC,But the Dome technically controls all that science stuff. So there is no reason for it to follow any normal theory of convention.
UnderTheDome,2pvuvl,HomerTron,4,Sat Dec 20 19:21:32 2014 UTC,"Well actually you're wrong.   This is why they pull in the science teacher character. She uses science to solve problems that they are facing in the dome brought on by the effects of the dome which has created a microsystem. She's not using ""dome science"".   Then there's the case of the communications, this too isn't ""dome science"", the military are using regular old science to forward communications through the dome. Likewise the tablets in use are using regular ass wifi to receive emails.   If you want to know what makes a good sci-fi great. It isn't lazy plot writers saying ""Oh well the dome controls the science"" at every plot hole. It is writers putting in effort to make a real effort to marry actual science with conceptual science ,eg: Interstellar (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c_CW3Iv6j4).   Watch that documentary."
UnderTheDome,2pvuvl,HomerTron,-3,Sat Dec 20 23:38:09 2014 UTC,She is using science the dome allows her to use. And how is that bad science?

UnderTheDome,2pbesf,Shoninjv,3,Mon Dec 15 02:59:01 2014 UTC,"The main similarity that I see between the two is unfulfilled potential. Both begin with (in my opinion) an incredibly interesting premise. Then the premise becomes a backdrop for uninteresting dramatic interactions between the poorly written, underdeveloped characters. After watching an entire season of either, it becomes clear that this show was not written with a master plan for the plot (such as Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones), but rather that the writers are (poorly) winging it. Subplots appear and disappear, often without resolution or explanation. You find yourself watching more out of habit than genuine interest.  A major difference between the two is that from the very start Jericho's central plot could be stretched out indefinitely. Under the Dome's... not so much. I really think UtD could have been a great miniseries adaptation of the source material. I'm really not sure where they're going with the plot and I have a sneaking suspicion that the writers don't either.  Another source of disappointment for both shows is that poor writing and directing stifles the abilities of otherwise good actors. Dean Norris in UtD and Lennie James in Jericho come to mind. If you just judged their acting based on those shows alone, you might not be that impressed. In UtD Dean really seems like a mediocre actor. However, if you watch Breaking Bad you quickly realize that with a decent crew behind him he's a great actor.  Two shows that I'll end up having watched to the end in the vain hope that their potential will be realized. UtD isn't the worst show ever but it falls way short of its potential, due in large part to poor writing."

UnderTheDome,2jizo0,Anorak_,8,Fri Oct 17 21:24:44 2014 UTC,"Junior Rennie. In the book he is a horrific character, one that I did not care much for.. In the TV series, however, i really have come to feel for him. (I think he is one of the better actors out of the lot, but that is besides the point I guess)   Barbie is a soldier and I think he regularly, predictably responds like a soldier.. Junior is just a kid recently-turned man, and I think that lends an aspect of vulnerability to the character."
UnderTheDome,2jizo0,Desparia,2,Sat Oct 18 05:49:12 2014 UTC,"I agree, definitely the most human of the characters too. Flipped out and eventually became more normal again, I'm just hoping the show hasn't forgot that he has that messed up side."
UnderTheDome,2jizo0,bringmethestone,3,Tue Dec 9 10:35:00 2014 UTC,"Angi perhaps. She was the most realistic character. I think it's not too unrealistic to imagine a girl with no prospects in a small town wanting to leave.   We were just starting to get to know her, and then they decided to kill her off. Absolutely every single other character in the show is just too unrealistic to get into.   And then there are these really insulting moments. Just a day before ""Big Jim"" wanted to poison the water supply, and yet only a day later he's back to being the town hero once again. It's a constant roller coaster ride with these characters jumping from either extremes.   They also tend to feature these mini characters that last a show or two, then without fail end up being killed off.   The main characters can be categorised as a) Teenage misfits b) Wicked control freaks c) Mr and Mrs Perfect / moral compass d) Insane clowns.   Even their stories are unrealistic. Take the science teacher. What small time science teacher do you know who is so clued up on physics and chemistry? Now we're supposed to believe this and she's an ecologist too?   The show as I'm learning is a bit of a joke."

UnderTheDome,2hqdk6,clearsighted,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:11:55 2014 UTC,"book is WAY BETTER THEN THE TV SHOW. it ends like this      The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial ""leatherheads"" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a cruel form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens to them.  On an organized ""Visitors Day""—when people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within—Big Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former meth operation from Phil ""Chef"" Bushey, who is stopping Rennie from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four hundred tanks of propane stored there (Chef wants it all, explaining, ""I need it to cook""). Big Jim underestimates Chef's capacity for self-defense and meth-induced paranoia; he, as well as the now-ostracized head selectman Andy Sanders (whom Chef has introduced to meth use) defend themselves and the meth lab with assault rifles. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm large enough to incinerate most of the town.  More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive just over 300 individuals who gradually die out as the toxic air ensues to restrict their breathing. Among the survivors are the twenty-eight refugees at the abandoned farm, an orphaned farm boy hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other over the limited oxygen supply (and Big Jim's worry that Thibodeau may act as a witness against him if they survive); Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the now-toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome.  Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia is able to make contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not caught up in their peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real ""little lives"", and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome rises slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing what is left of the town of Chester's Mill."

I heard that they were granted 30 million dollars for season 2 from NC Film Incentives, but that was hardly enough money for the season. And since NC Film Incentives have taken such a hit they would  only get up to 10 million dollars for a third season. Which would mean they would have to relocate their set or something to shoot somewhere else where there are better film incentives, which would mean major delays in production. Or they could somehow try and make due on a much smaller budget, but I can't see that happening. The stars of the show have attended quite a few protest events about this.

It's like seeing a train derailing - you don't wanna watch, but you can't look away either. I'm just gonna edit this post as I go through the episode.    So Pauline got stabbed... and the best thing you can think of is getting her on her side and put pressure on the wound from outside. Fair enough without supplies... but why the hell do you guys carry a stretcher in that Prius? (And would it even fit in there?) Oh nevermind, now you suddenly know she's bleeding internally, and in the same sentence you state you would need an MRI to know what's hurt. Good god. Oh, and the first thing you thought about with Melanie? Blood transfusion. Stabwound, losing tons of blood? Nah, let's not waste any time getting fluids into her.  ""Let's get a tablet!"" - Yeah, sure.... a crater just appeared, the dome is contracting (while still not killing them with the insane air pressure it would create), someone got stabbed. First thing to do right now is getting a tablet, because obiously WiFi signals come from underground.  That lightning striking the farmer. Really, the whole thing throwing sparks around for like 5 seconds? Have the writers even completed elementary school? That's not how electricity/lightning works...  ""Pauline needs fluids"" - Come on, really? Last time you create a makeshift test to identify blood types, this time you rather send someone to find saline solution instead of just getting a blood transfusion going? Please kill me.  So Melanie disappeared into a hole... that is deep enough so you can't see its bottom, yet you can climb down there with a rucksack's worth of rope and still see daylight? What the actual fuck. Consistency like in a short story of a middleschool kid. Also, no body?  Really, you have a fleet of school buses - but didn't think of draining their tanks when you were facing a fuel and supply shortage earlier on? How did you people even stay alive that long...  Wow, Norrie punched a girl for making fun of her... hair!? How can you overlook that forehead?  Linda... I mean I knew you were stupid, but that stupid? To put her out of her misery, and then carry around the morphine and syringe until someone shows up? That's just... I don't have words anymore.  The town now consists of... 30 people? Well, makes sense, considering how many farmers randomly found their death already in almost hilarious ways.  Yeah Norrie, scream at the dead end - maybe that will help.

UnderTheDome,2h5dy9,SpaceRook,7,Mon Sep 22 19:39:22 2014 UTC,"Some actors can take bad material and elevate it to camp.  ""Under the Dome"" doesn't really have those kind of actors.  Dean Norris is fine with a good script, but the writers for UTD have just treated him terribly.  His character arc looks like a pile of spaghetti.  Even Jack Nicholson couldn't make heads-or-tails of the Big Jim character.  Mike Vogel (Barbie) seems to be genuinely skilled at this type of work.  I am actually impressed at how well he sells some of the lines, although I could see his patience running out as the season progressed.  The kids are, well, kids.  They don't know how to handle terrible writing and direction on a dumb show.  You can't really blame them.  I think people are too hard on 'em."

UnderTheDome,2h5dy9,Yage2006,1 point,Sun Sep 28 15:59:10 2014 UTC,This show has so many problems it's difficult to know where main problem is. A great director can get good performances out of even mediocre actors. This show has some pretty descent actors. Dean Norris was the most well-known before the show started and Breaking Bad was a hit show (in part because of his acting). Mike Vogel was okay in his previous bad guy role in Bates Motel.   I think they changed the story too much for the show. They tried to drag it out too long for sake of getting the season renewed. It would have been better as a mini-series. More time spent on quality rather than quantity would've helped a great deal.
UnderTheDome,2h5dy9,MikeVp,1 point,Tue Sep 23 14:46:22 2014 UTC,"Dean Norris is a great actor when well directed, This show is not well directed and badly written.

But then the portrait of Melanie she did in her journal was a completely different style from the rest of the work we see done by her.  While, no she's not a world-class artist on it either, it's clearly recognizable.  It shows a capability for producing a level of realism that's totally absent in pretty much all of the other paintings and sketches.  You could look at that one and know instantly that it was Melanie.  If you look at the rest of them, you just sort of have to guess who it might be based on context and hair color."
UnderTheDome,2gxq6a,redstarr01,8,Sat Sep 20 16:35:39 2014 UTC,The art is so crap because it is painted by executive producer and/or director Jack Bender.

UnderTheDome,2gp6pk,Gullsti,9,Thu Sep 18 03:17:09 2014 UTC,Why would anyone do that? It's a piece of gauze wrapped in bandages. How does that help anything outside of her clothing?  The actress just wanted to stay in skin tight jeans and the wardrobe department made no effort at realism. More lazy production techniques from Under the Dome.

UnderTheDome,2giec8,Yage2006,7,Tue Sep 16 01:25:58 2014 UTC,They can/should wrap it up this season. As much as I love the trainwreck it needs to end at some point and if they stretch it another season it will just be the same formulaic episode over and over where they have some problem pop up at the start of the episode then by the end it's solved and everything is back to normal. This show would start looking like the modern day Gilligan's Island. The egg and jumping outside the dome are what sent the show from a straight joke to semi serious. They need to address this and end the show.  edit: I just realized they only have one episode left this season. It will likely end without closure.
UnderTheDome,2giec8,ForteShadesOfJay,2,Tue Sep 16 03:12:58 2014 UTC,"Ye but they never cancel shows because they are bad. Networks cancel shows because they drop below that 1.0 margin. At least above that they can move it around and since the show still brings in millions of viewers is still worth money. If the show creators get tired of it and decide to end it well that's another thing but if they are still on board you can expect new seasons to follow.   ""modern day Gilligan's Island"" Good one :)  Gilligan's Island with psychopaths. That show lasted 90 episodes BTW, Probably what they are gunning for, You hit that many and you can do into syndication so its a goal lots of networks shows want to reach."

UnderTheDome,2giec8,Scapone22,9,Tue Sep 16 13:11:23 2014 UTC,"Julia's husband is part of her old life? The guy she loved and who died to protect her just 2-3 weeks ago?  The dome contracts, so it should push all of the ground together...and upwards. If it's a full sphere, it should have contracted from the bottom too and the town should have risen by about 3 meters. If it's not a full sphere, then based on the mass of earth moved (which you see e.g. when Julia visits the dome) the dome would just go about 1 yard into the ground and they should be able to just dig a tunnle.   They can't test Melanie's blood type? I did that in biology in high school, you just mix the blood and some antibodies. You could even just do it with blood from someone else.   Melanie being revived contradicts physics how? Conservation of momentum? Conservation of Energy? Conservation of life force? Oh wait, the last one isn't physics.   Rebecca has to do calculations on how long it's gonna take for the dome to close in? You just divide the radius of the dome by the speed of the dome, you don't need some fancy program showing you a sphere on your tablet.   And the Schrödinger's cat thing? So apparently Melanie hasn't been observed yet."
UnderTheDome,2giec8,Viktour,16,Tue Sep 16 23:59:28 2014 UTC,"Are they even trying anymore?    Blood Type: Oh sure, it's probably faster and easier to do some homebrew blood type test, instead of just finding someone with Type O in that town, right?  The transfusion: I just wanted to hit my against the wall. Hard. The blood bag was hanging higher than the needle in Rebecca's arm, obviously meaning it is impossible for her to actually give any blood. Also, is it just me thinking it would be smart to have a way of measuring the amount transfused/given?  Biggest one for me - the  contractions. Now I see three things that would have to happen with these contractions happening, but none of them seems to be case in the series. a) The dome is a complete sphere, so when it contracts, the ground inside would have to rise compared to the outside, since the dome would be contracting under the ground as well, while having to fit the same amount of soil into a lower volume. b) The dome is not a full sphere, which would (maybe) explain the ground levels still matching... but then you could just dig outside underneath it. c) The dome only contracts by getting narrower - the top and bottom parts don't contract, forming it into sort of an oval. But then, it is highly unlike that the weight distribution inside the dome is equal... so it would most likely tip over in some direction. Also, the ground levels would have to rise inside the dome.    Edit: Ad a) /u/Butterflykey pointed out the ground levels would have to rise, not sink compared to the outside world. Anyway, they wouldn't stay equal, no matter the direction."
UnderTheDome,2giec8,iKnitYogurt,5,Tue Sep 16 08:02:35 2014 UTC,"Also, the dome cuts right trough a lake. If the dome was contracting the water would get pushed up flooding the town."
UnderTheDome,2giec8,Eddie_Lacy,2,Tue Sep 16 08:44:05 2014 UTC,"for A) the ground in the dome would actually go further up wouldent it? because there would be the same amount of dirt in the dome, but it is a smaller area, basically pushing the town slightly up"

And then he fucking kisses her in front of her old boyfriend and best friends and no one even bats an eye that he's in love with a half dead girl as old as his mother.

Ferns the size of small houses make up a lush forest beyond the dome walls, swaying in the breeze.  Big Jim raises himself from the ground where he passed out, placing one hand on his painfully throbbing head. Sweat glistens off his bald scalp as he squints up at a tropical afternoon sun.  A carnotaurus emerges from the forest, stops, cocks its head to one side quizzically, and studies the large man who just woke up on the outskirts of town.  The carnotaurus slowly starts towards Big Jim, approaching the crevice marking the edge of the dome. To Jim's horror, its massive, clawed foot steps over the line where the dome had once stood, and its powerful tail effortlessly smashes a bicycle as it passes.  Big Jim stumbles backward and then trips, falling to the ground as the carnotaurus starts running towards him at full speed. A reptilian roar bursts out from its drooling mouth, and the camera cuts to black. The end."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,SlothQuest,11,Tue Sep 9 06:49:29 2014 UTC,"The twists and turns are genuinely surprising   Because they make absolutely no sense. Also, acting is just... bad."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,iKnitYogurt,11,Tue Sep 9 11:10:06 2014 UTC,"Don't forget the writers who don't research shit before putting ""science stuff"" in there.  I mean, didn't Rebecca claim that the leaves were changing color because it was getting cold?  Because photosynthesis is too complicated a concept for the small town science teacher/doctor/rocket scientist/terrible actress who can engineer a mega virus."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,MethMouthMagoo,4,Tue Sep 9 23:23:50 2014 UTC,"That annoyed me so much in the latest episode. I get that strong, intelligent people can often put that effort into other areas, but come on, we never hear from her and then suddenly she is an expert in about 10 different disciplines.. and vital to the town.   Although, that is my biggest issue with this show; the huge amount of people. It would have been a much better show from my point of view if there had been a town of say, 200 people and as people die, we see the crowds get smaller, see the logistics change, become aware of the key individuals in the town (such as farmers), not just the decision makers.   Maybe I just want a different show?"
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Vrashnar,0,Sun Sep 14 21:37:38 2014 UTC,What? I mean at least OP can just be easy to surprise but honestly all the twists not only make sense (within the realm of the show) but they were so obvious that myself and most people on here predict them weeks in advance.  The twists make sense and can be seen coming from a mile away.
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Scapone22,5,Tue Sep 9 14:57:52 2014 UTC,I LOVE THIS SHOW!
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,VaultDweller82,8,Tue Sep 9 17:13:58 2014 UTC,worst show i currently watch
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,dendrD,6,Wed Sep 10 00:43:23 2014 UTC,For sure. I only still watch it to laugh at it.
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Corvese,0,Wed Sep 10 07:21:22 2014 UTC,"Yep.  This and The Strain are just laughably terrible.  Still, fun to watch."

Almost the entire subreddit for The Strain bashes it as well.  I find both to be entertaining, but in a hokey cornball sort of way."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Alpha_Bitch,1 point,Tue Sep 16 12:40:59 2014 UTC,"The Strain's definitely bad, but holy shit man, Under The Dome is AWFUL.  Awful in the best way, but I really don't think they're in the same realm of terribleness."

UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Alpha_Bitch,-6,Fri Sep 12 04:33:28 2014 UTC,Plot? What plot? I assume you're talking about /r/watchitfortheplot.
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Jesus__Pieces,1 point,Fri Sep 12 05:05:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's not even close. I feel like I'm doing some sort of penance by continuing to watch.   At this point I just want to know what the fuck the done is and why it's there. I couldn't care less about the characters. The writing, the acting, every god damn thing in this show is horrible. I don't see how it isn't a career killer for nearly everyone involved, but especially the writers."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Guano_Loco,2,Fri Sep 12 05:08:02 2014 UTC,"I probably want to take the show in a direction that it wasn't intended, but I would love it if the dome came down, we cut out all the mystical dome foreshadowing and magical nature of the whole thing.   We focus on the fact that there are 200 people now trapped in an isolated environment, possibly for a long time, how do they cope? Still plenty of options for drama; power struggles, food shortages, interesting characters. But we cut out all the children who are the only ones who can touch an egg, random red acid rains that are miraculously solved and a weird military presence."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Vrashnar,3,Wed Sep 10 09:34:49 2014 UTC,"This show is by far the worst show I've ever watched, but also one of the most entertaining. I would not be happy if it was cancelled."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,broncosfighton,6,Sun Sep 14 21:41:44 2014 UTC,"The remake of V was god awful. Crisis was pretty bad. I think this show nestled comfortably between them, like the stuffing in a suck Oreo."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Guano_Loco,4,Wed Sep 10 04:48:07 2014 UTC,"While I don't agree with your glowing sentiments of praise, I am in the crowd that loves to watch--- but I love to watch it for it's stupidity. Something charming about that, in a B movie sort of way."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,j4p4n,4,Wed Sep 10 09:36:02 2014 UTC,"honestly i love the show, i know it isnt top notch acting or writing, but i dont really watch a show to pick apart all of its bad qualities, i like to watch it because i find it enjoyable :D  its got a lost-esque feel to it that i really enjoy"
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Butterflykey,5,Wed Sep 10 15:17:52 2014 UTC,"Please let this show be cancelled. Then this atrocity can end on a semi high note, and have an actual conclusion without being drawn out for more ridiculous nonsense. That's the only hope that's keeping me watching.  Also, do yourself a favor and read the book anyways. It is much better, with an actual plot and well-defined characters. It also has no resemblance to the show."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,dogaholic,-2,Tue Sep 9 11:47:32 2014 UTC,"C'mon, don't be an asshole. This show actually has a pretty good plot, despite the bad acting. The story is really compelling, and the cliffhangers are great. If you don't like it, stop watching it. And if you really want it to be cancelled, why are you watching it in the first place?"
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,AyPay,11,Tue Sep 9 05:02:39 2014 UTC,"Plot? What plot? It adds and drops plotlines with no regard for continuity. They'll build up something for an episode or two so it seems like it's going somewhere, and then drop it to never be spoken of again. The 'crises of the week' don't add to the overall story at all, and are conveniently resolved and promptly forgotten about with nothing changing.   It feels like the writers just sat in a room brainstorming ideas, then each wrote their own episode independently, then just tried to mash them together after.   And I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole about this show. I really wanted it to be good and successful and rooted for it. I stuck with it because it had such potential and I kept hoping it would get better. If it was at least consistent within itself and built on a solid story it would be ok. There's just so many issues with it. After this season I'm done one way or another - if it is cancelled and gets an actual conclusion then great, if they try to drag it out more I won't watch it get any worse."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,dogaholic,5,Tue Sep 9 22:49:51 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  Dragging this out for another entire season would just be painful.  Its still fun to watch, if only for a laugh and the ""oh hell, what happened NOW, guys?"" every week.  But another season...oh please don't."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Alpha_Bitch,1 point,Wed Sep 10 01:01:50 2014 UTC,"Well the ratings were up this week to a 1.4 in the 18-49 demo, it has been steady at a 1.5 pretty much the whole season except on Labor Day where it got a 1.2."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,The_Adamator,1 point,Wed Sep 10 15:46:08 2014 UTC,"Personally, I want it ended with SOME kind of conclusion before it gets cancelled mid stream and i realize i'll never get an answer."
UnderTheDome,2fvnd9,Ranchpig,2,Tue Sep 9 19:51:26 2014 UTC,"The show ending is going to be different than the ending in the book. The writers said so before season 1 even began. With season 2, they wanted to drop basically every reference to the book and do their own thing.  Still, everyone who hasn't already should read the book, it's better anyway."

The fact the the dome and mini dome respond to the four young adults hands and no older adults leads me to believe that the fire Lyle predicts is some kind of alien cleansing of the earth and the dome is to protect the children who will repopulate the earth afterwards.

UnderTheDome,2fux0v,venn177,3,Tue Sep 9 02:34:51 2014 UTC,"I mean, I really want to know how that happened. The only thing I can think of is they shot the first scene with him tearing the paper off or something, then they realized they needed it for the next scene, so they rewrote it right there without checking the film to see how it looked."
UnderTheDome,2fux0v,TheSuperAstronaut,3,Wed Sep 10 00:28:16 2014 UTC,"it is possible that they shot the scene with the black guard on the same day as the shooting of the scene with Big Jim (so as to only pay the actor on that one day), and then forgot to check the film to see what the prop looked like.

UnderTheDome,2fux0v,venn177,3,Tue Sep 9 22:46:25 2014 UTC,"Exactly. Like, it's small but SUCH AN OBVIOUS continuity error. I mean, those scenes couldn't have been filmed more than half an hour apart, given they already had the whole crew out there where they were shooting.  This show never ceases to amaze me with the levels of utter shit it can delve down to."
UnderTheDome,2fux0v,GreyWalker,3,Wed Sep 10 00:44:18 2014 UTC,"You think those two scenes were filmed half an hour apart?  I live in Wilmington and I have been an extra for Under the Dome, One Tree Hill, and EastBound and Down.  For instance, on OTH, I was there for ten hours.  They would film for a few minutes, take an hour to reset, and then film again.  When the show aired, guess how much footage was used?  Thirty seconds.    For Eastbound and Down, I was there for twelve hours.  It was supposed to be six, but they went way over.  They actually had to bring us dinner (anything over eight hours requires a meal).  Those twelve hours ended up to be two minutes of the show.  More than likely those two scenes were filmed HOURS apart, possibly even a day or two.  Heck, they could have filmed one scene (like the guy talking to the soldier) on Day 1, and then filmed Norrie confronting him on Day 5.    All in all, there is PLENTY of time to lose that piece of paper.  Does that make it acceptable?  Absolutely not.  However, I can guarantee that those two scenes were not filmed 30 minutes apart.    Edit:  For another scene on OTH, I was in the season finale.  I don't watch the show (except for episodes I am in!), but the main soldier guy had to surprise the girl and kiss her.  That took about an hour and a half.  One or the other kept messing up.  Both of them actually got it right one time, except the soldier guy kept his hat on when he was supposed to take it off.  I literally wanted to scream at him to take it off.    After each shoot, the director watches the scene on his monitor and then they reshoot it until the director is happy.  For each take, they have to redo the lights, move equipment, get cameras back in place, get extras back in place, etc.  This scene pissed me off because it was cold.  We were filming in an airplane hangar at the airport.  Each time the director yelled cut, the actress girl went back to her trailer to keep warm.  A few minutes later, when we were ready to go again, we had to wait for the girl to come back...and if it was a short wait?  Then she had her assistants carrying around heaters...like literally people were carrying around heaters infront of her so she wouldn't be cold.  For EBD, Kenny Powers (not sure if that is his real name or character name on the show) played baseball.  It was a warm muggy evening, so he had his assistants carrying fans around him.    Edit x2: Here is the scene I was talking about at the hangar, tune to 19:50, scene ends at 21:09. http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/player/videoweed.php?id=a042d3aed003d  You can see my head stick out for less than one second.

It has not been the type full of itty bitty details for fans to obsess over.  It's been pretty much surface level stuff.  I'm thinking maybe it was more a case of the set decoration notes calling for posters, so the crew just grabbed whatever posters they had handy."

Julia was also shot and she seems to have made a full recovery a few episodes in. They ran into water shortage/pollution problems about a week in and somehow have managed since.

UnderTheDome,2fageh,RichWPX,1 point,Fri Sep 5 14:17:39 2014 UTC,"I actually disagree. The end of the book was drawn out so tortuously slow, and the characters were much more black and white (Big Jim was always bad, Junior was always crazy with his brain tumor, and Dale spoke to the Colonel through the other side.)  The reasoning for the dome that is revealed in the end is just so dumb, I mean the egg in the movie at least has an active role in the plot rather than it being missing from 99% of the book.  I don't think it will end like the book, in fact it won't, because of the circumstances regarding Phil and the radio tower in the television compared to the book. It's difficult to discuss this without potentially spoiling it for someone else, but the Dome is much more ""alive"" in the show than the book. It changes, reacts to stimuli, and uses telepathic communication at times.  Also, the scene where Big Jim was speaking to ""Angie"" or hallucinating in the fallout shelter already happened, and instead of the book, he escaped."

I think with UTD they were experimenting with the temporal aspect of it and just got a bit too bugged out in the minor but significant details of the show which ruins the whole thing."

UnderTheDome,2fageh,mrleetyler,2,Thu Sep 4 15:17:37 2014 UTC,agreed they should have portrayed the timeline a bit longer rather than a few weeks would give character development a better chance to be beleiveable.

Oh, and not to mention how they were able to culture a flu virus for an ""ultimate solution"", as well as to have a virus gestate and kill a small population of livestock in an undetermined amount of time. But, they did attempt to explain that one, with some BS about how the dome caused that to happen."
UnderTheDome,2fageh,wamceachern,3,Fri Sep 12 09:17:21 2014 UTC,I have a theory. What if time under the dome is actually accelerating. Not just the season but all together and the character can only remember certain events and details. but their emotions are still the same for the time. So the dome time is actually been like 2 months to 3 months and the real world outside the dome is like 3 weeks.
UnderTheDome,2fageh,RichWPX,3,Wed Sep 3 21:45:56 2014 UTC,But that doesn't work because of times they can see others through the dome they would be accelerated or slowed down.
UnderTheDome,2fageh,wamceachern,0,Thu Sep 4 15:10:16 2014 UTC,not if the dome is filtering the light passing through the dome by slowing the light down or speeding it up. then the image on the other side would appear to be normal? the only reason they can see them is the light reflecting off the people and then passing through the dome.i have to think about this to think if the light is speed up or slowed down. i'll get back to you.
UnderTheDome,2fageh,Korben_Reynolds,4,Thu Sep 4 18:36:12 2014 UTC,I think the whole email exchange between Barbie and Julia rules this out.  Neither side waited days or weeks to get a reply and there was no confusion or delay when they set up a time and place to meet while they were on opposite sides of the dome.
UnderTheDome,2fageh,wamceachern,3,Fri Sep 5 16:29:00 2014 UTC,Good theory!   Did they say in few last episodes how long Barbie and others were outside of the dome?
UnderTheDome,2fageh,somewherein72,1 point,Thu Sep 4 08:02:23 2014 UTC,not that i recall. i only think this because barbie really didn't have an understanding of how long he has been in the dome until he got out of the dome. And the opening narrating of it by him we have no idea where he is doing it. Meaning current or it is his future self retelling the store and that is why he knows its been a couple of weeks. thats my Theory for now at least.

Those are paying for the production of the show, and as long as they are, advertising revenue is pure profit.  When the production is covered, even mediocre ratings driving low ad revenue can be more profitable than high ratings with high ad revenue that also has to cover the cost of production.  Not saying it won't be cancelled, you just can't go by the ratings alone.  It's still generating decent viewership for a summer show, it's just declining from where it was."

It matters more to them how many people are streaming, and if it is helping drive subscriptions and bringing in Netflix viewers.  For Microsoft, it's a global market that they are flashing their brand in.  They'll care more about overall viewership including online and DVD.  Can't tell that from weekly ratings.

If the egg is some sort of alien/intelligent technology/being, then Melony may have been kept in some sort of suspended animation or stasis state, like sleep/hibernation technologies used in SF movies for long distance space travel. No aging there."
UnderTheDome,2f9gsc,maybelying,4,Tue Sep 2 19:44:59 2014 UTC,"My theory is that she didn't really die, the group just thought she did.

As for his Dad not recognizing her, I got the impression that was the one time he had met her, so it could be understandable.  Melanie herself didn't realize who he was, and her mother and never told her about her father."

UnderTheDome,2f7vw0,adiultrapro,32,Tue Sep 2 16:55:05 2014 UTC,"So let me get this straight. Let's break down some Jim-logic here, because this episode he went full-retard a degree further than he's ever went before.  The facts:   Jim cares about the town and it's people, just not as much as his family. After he throws the egg down the hole, he tells Fivehead and Joe as much. Jim was aware of the plan, which would have him going first to negotiate to make sure the entire town would escape. He in fact supported this plan, as per his insistence to go first and be the negotiator. Jim is not completely brain-dead. Jim knew the egg was leverage to make sure the entire town could come out safely.   With those facts, we can extrapolate the following: Jim believed the plan would work and had no reason to go against the plan.  Let's say for posterity that he didn't trust Barbie and wanted to make sure his family could get out. We throw out him caring about the town, the plan, all of that-- he knows how to get out, and wants his family out ASAP. So in that situation, would it not make sense for him to still go first - as a negotiator - and only after securing safe passage have his family bring the egg?  The egg is 100% known to him to be what the men in black are after, so he knows it's his best bet at getting people out safely (collateral, essentially).  So from all of this, I pose to you a singular question that sums up Under The Dome's manufactured idiotic drama where characters aren't characters, but just set pieces to do certain things in each episode in order to make it to the next pseudo-bottled episode:  WHY THE FUCK WOULD JIM THROW THE EGG DOWN FIRST?"
UnderTheDome,2f7vw0,TheSuperAstronaut,22,Tue Sep 2 13:13:02 2014 UTC,"From what I gathered, Jim throwing the egg off the cliff was all just a massive overreaction to his recently returned wife's freak out.   I guess pulling a gun on the kids that just calmed the egg down made more sense than unlocking the door and seeing if she was ok now."
UnderTheDome,2f7vw0,gyang333,2,Tue Sep 2 14:11:56 2014 UTC,"Hey, let's not try and let logic enter the equation, here!"
UnderTheDome,2f7vw0,The_Adamator,1 point,Fri Sep 5 10:00:21 2014 UTC,Also what plays a big role is actually destiny. Jim had to do this because the last vision predicted it (probably).
UnderTheDome,2f7vw0,razztafarai,4,Fri Sep 5 10:44:27 2014 UTC,RIGHT! I thought he was supposed to jump out with the egg and Junior in tow (as he so cleverly negotiated last week)

UnderTheDome,2edhf5,mrleetyler,3,Sun Aug 24 03:42:03 2014 UTC,"The ratings are pretty much irrelevant.  The production cost is covered by their licensing deal with Amazon and overseas distribution, which means the show is basically free for CBS and all ad revenue is pure profit.

What really got me was two seconds before, the black ops officer said you can't come any further without an escort, then gets on the truck.

It will establish a rule in-universe, only to break it an episode later. The character motivations and personalities change in order to fit the plot of any given episode-- something showcased no more than with Big Jim.  On top of that, Junior was completely fucking ruined from the book and his character did whatever the hell could be more of a stark change than a 180. In the beginning he locked a woman in a fucking bomb shelter and almost raped her. Less than two weeks later he's become one of the 'good guys' of the show. There was no character development in between, just magic dome shit.  This show has no rules, no logic, no continuity that really makes sense-- you can tell with how much wheel-spinning there is that the writers never had any fucking idea how long the show was going to go on for.   At first, I hated this show because of how much I loved the book and how fucking awful it is in every way in comparison, but now I love it because of how bad it is.

UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,venn177,5,Wed Aug 20 06:56:20 2014 UTC,"We DO talk about it. I mean, there's just not that much to talk about when there's no real over-arching plotline until two episodes ago. It's been wheel-spinning from the beginning, and without any kind of overall story to discuss - or any repercussions an episode can have on any given conflict - there's not really any discussion to be had.  Look at a show like It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. It's a good show, but there's no 'real' discussion because it's serialized and every episode has little or no bearing on any other episode. The end result is the extent of the subreddit is just quoting everything from it. The other end of the spectrum would be a police procedural, where there's not a ton to discuss from week-to-week besides the 'bad guy'. Well here, we get neither of those things, with the same characters showing up, but nothing to discuss because NOTHING IS HAPPENING.  When you mix all of that together and add in the Sharknado-like properties that the show has taken on with the entire crew outside of maybe Mike Vogel completely giving up, jokes are the way that the majority of us derive our entertainment out of the show. What makes any given discussion less valid than yours? If it's that big of a deal, there's a reason there's no limit on how many subreddits can be made.  Edit: On top of that, the top two comments this right now on the discussion thread are both valid points, where one is written in a humorous way. Literally, the top comment is pointing out that Julia is freaking out about Barbie being dead while standing next to a girl who is supposed to be dead. That's not a joke, or a troll. And the second one is about how Julia is losing her mind over a man she's known for ~20 days when the extent of finding out her husband was killed was making Barbie sleep on the couch for a night.  So when any given viewer can use basic logic to oust the show's female lead's logic, there's something wrong."
UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,venn177,-9,Fri Aug 22 02:55:00 2014 UTC,NOTHING IS HAPPENING herp derp.  Have you been asleep for the past fucking two seasons buddy? Go to wikipedia and read plot summaries if you think nothings happening.
UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,thedevilsmilkman,7,Fri Aug 22 03:00:14 2014 UTC,"The problem is so much of every episode is self-contained and has no real bearing on the rest of the series. The caterpillar infestation? Solved that episode, turns into non-issue. Acid rain? Solved that episode (with a windmill that they built with their giant metalworking tools from nowhere, I guess?) and never a real issue. The fight club? That was one episode, too.  And in-universe, this has all happened in the course of, like, 16 days. People started a fight club, quit it, they thought the world was ending, all kinds of shit went down, and people just forget about it. Things are happening, but they have no bearing on the overarching storyline. At best it's a plothole-ridden scifi mess, and at worst it's a scifi police procedural with a slightly overarching plotline, like season 1 of Fringe.  Edit: Except Fringe was building up to something."

UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,Scapone22,13,Wed Aug 20 18:55:32 2014 UTC,"This show deserves a lot of the ridicule and criticism it gets though. It started off with such promise, a great premise, great source material to pull from, and a strong pilot. Since then it's gone steadily downhill - nonsensical plots, atrocious acting and scripts, 'disaster of the week' storylines that make no sense, are laughably wrapped up by the end of the week, and then forgotten about, poorly written characters.   At this point, there is very little I still like about the show. I am hoping it does not get renewed, and they have a decent finale to close the whole thing off. If they continue past this year, I won't be back."
UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,venn177,2,Wed Aug 20 19:01:51 2014 UTC,"Where I think you're wrong is that it was never all that good.  Sure if was slightly better, but as someone with virtually no knowledge of the source material the premise has always been a bit batshit.  The acting has been bad since day 1, the writing sloppy etc.... I enjoy watching it.  I think the story is interesting and the the other negatives I mentioned are all funny/entertaining, but I don't feel like it became this way, to me it just always was this way."
UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,Scapone22,1 point,Tue Aug 19 21:21:24 2014 UTC,"The big issue is that the only reason the story is interesting is because it's adapted from a book. If you like the story, go read the book. It's better in every. Single. Way."
UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,Jesus__Pieces,1 point,Wed Aug 20 14:04:52 2014 UTC,"Oh I definitely don't doubt that for a second. Unfortunately books don't work for me for a number of reasons.  I'm not a strong reader. I understand that the only way to get better is to keep trying but it's difficult for me.  On top of that I've always relied a lot on audio cues.  Soundtracks (both licensed and original scores) and sound editing are huge for me.  The same scene without quality sound is totally different.  I'm also pretty visual.  I have all the symptoms of ADHD though am not diagnosed, I wouldn't take the medicine anyway so it's pointless.    All that adds up to preferring shows and movies to books for me."

UTD has a great premise and the shows keep me wanting more.   Are there ridiculous scenes and weird displays of acting? Yeah, but not enough to make me turn it off in favor of something else.   I don't understand the hate for this show. If you don't like it, just don't watch it, and if you don't like it, why are you spending time in an online forum talking about it?

UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,chase001,3,Mon Aug 25 02:53:34 2014 UTC,"I think you're completely missing the point of what people are doing in this subreddit. For some, including me, they've read the book and were watching the show to see how it developed. Not only did the show deviate, but the writing is generally very shoddy. So now we can either abandon ship, or take refuge in the subreddit where we commiserate what could have been a great show. I think we've chosen the latter. We're waiting for something to validate our time spent so far. Just about every episode has been a let down and this is our only place to vent our frustration."

I like the story and still have high hopes for it, but I hate the ridiculous fluff that takes up 90% of the episode.  The last two episodes have been the best of the series because they actually somewhat advance the storyline, but they are still hilariously bad that you laugh out loud at it at times.  I guess I'm not allowed to watch a show unless I blindly love every aspect of it, according to you.  LOL"
UnderTheDome,2e0l1w,JEHUCS,1 point,Mon Aug 25 03:33:58 2014 UTC,"Its still one of the best shows on tv. You guys really should try watching shows without over analyzing everything. You can basically go to every damn forum or subredit of every show ever made to have people point out various plot holes. Its like those people that constantly try to think through how a movie is going to end while watching it. Just watch it, you might even find it more enjoyable because you might get surprised at the ending. I just keep wondering why no one has killed jim yet."

I am floored that so many people are enjoying it. I actually rather enjoyed the first season. Though rough around the edges it was pretty good.

The Akaion energy company that Barbie's dad works for wants the egg so they can use its radiation or do something bad to it. As the holographic Alice said in last season's finale, the egg must be protected at all costs. If it gets into the wrong hands, who knows what will happen. Plus, the egg is some sort of generator for the dome, which I think I'd protecting Barbie/someone/the egg from the outside world. My mind is running wild with all sorts of theories. Really good episode. When I heard the plots for this episode and the next few, I thought they would be boring due to everyone thinking Barbie dead. Luckily, these episodes seem to be pulling off really well. I hope Julia is able to understand that Barbie doesn't want her to jump."

I mean both lyle and sam had issues after the went into darkness"

Joe, Norrie, Junior and Angie are the four hands when the dome comes down, then since Angie dies, they bring in Melanie who was probably brought back to life cause she died protecting the egg and the dome brought her back.

UnderTheDome,2dqysm,transmigrant,1 point,Tue Aug 19 02:23:35 2014 UTC,"For the most part the criticism is about the pacing ( they've only been under the dome less than 3 weeks ), the constant trouble that goes on that everyone all the sudden forgets about, and some of the acting."

Lost had a ton of various mysteries but kept you guessing because it was so character focused due to flashbacks.   This- I don't really care about any of the characters because in one episode they're normal people and the next they're building a windmill out of nothing within a few hours. It's like 'anything can happen, so why guess' especially with how they ( the writers ) have barely touched upon the egg and we're already a chunk through season two."

On the contrary, she was only contracted for 10 episodes in S1 and was supposed to leave, but they carried her forward.   So Britt Robertson, who plays Angie McAlister, was pleasantly surprised to learn that her character would survive for at least the season 2 premiere. “I only signed for 10 episodes last season so I always assumed I would die in episode 10,” Robertson tells EW. “It was so great that I got to stay a little longer. It’s a great way to go out, especially after Stephen King wrote the episode.”   Source"
UnderTheDome,2dgd99,maybelying,4,Thu Aug 14 00:57:51 2014 UTC,Britt left because she's getting a real career and there was no way the producers were going to pay her how much she would cost in the future.

The first season it's what got me into the book, but even though the show has a lot of flaws, it's still entertaining and gets me waiting for the next episode every week. I know the consensus is that the show is terrible around this subreddit, but since I enjoy it every week, I don't think it's that bad."

UnderTheDome,2dadjf,SuperbusAtheos,3,Tue Aug 12 17:10:29 2014 UTC,She is an arts teacher. She was clearly teaching the patients how to paint before she got interrupted by Sam.

UnderTheDome,2dadjf,Idkjake,18,Tue Aug 12 21:45:54 2014 UTC,"Actually, there's a bit more I think. Leaving the Dome via the ""bottomless pit"" (I so called that it was gonna be some sort of wormhole) seems to cause them to get ill in some way (probs due to the magnetism!). I read a review of this episode a few minutes ago, and it made me go mindblown. That strange thing that we see in the last scene on the forest floor (that Barbie and his pa don't notice at all) seems to be a red door (with four handprints, I think). Pauline painted a picture of an open red door. The speculation is that the door leads back into under the Dome somehow. What I believe is that Barbie is gonna be like Sheppard from Lost - he's gonna return to the Dome eventually (probs after failing to approach the Dome, talking to Pauline and getting info on the red door, then looking for it = 3 or 4 episodes, probably in the season 2 finale). However, I'm guessing that the tunnel system will disappear and they'll be trapped in the Dome again. My bets: Big Jim regains power and (secretly) blows up the tunnels so no one can leave the town (since he's a power-hungry man). But really,I think this episode was the turning point of getting the show back on a great note. Loved this episode, can't wait for more."

This show is finally picking up speed, I just hope it's not too late and will hurt it's chances for a proper ending. (If it gets renewed for Season 3 I think it should be the last)  Also, great performance by Rachelle Lefevre. I was never really a fan of Julia but last night she was very likable.   PS. That Coldplay song at the end was great. Wonder what the red door is..."
UnderTheDome,2dadjf,thehighplainsdrifter,7,Wed Aug 13 03:51:46 2014 UTC,I agree. It was actually an okay episode. I think it's because it's trying to move forward instead of being sitcom-ish where you can jump in any episode.

Having a handsome man, or a pretty lady, that shares common interest in you, is probably right next to ""food and water"" on the survivability list.

UnderTheDome,2dadjf,__ADAM__,1 point,Tue Aug 12 14:03:08 2014 UTC,"From the way the conversation went, he didn't seem to know to what extent they were out to get him, and presumably he rushed home in the hopes that he could get armed and get the fuck out before anything happened.  I mean, considering where he was and the military's knowledge of him being in there (or was that only in the book? shit, I forget), he kind of needed money in order to do whatever he was planning to do originally."

Just like how Barbie and Sam ended up in the same turn after having taken separate ones, I think that Barbie will fall into a wormhole that'll somehow get him out of the Dome. Of course, there's probably some catch: Either a) It's a one-way, one-time wormhole, meaning Barbie gets stuck outside of the Dome and no one else can use that wormhole, b) The Dome only allows certain chosen people to enter and exit via the wormholes, just like how it chose the Four Hands and the Monarch, or c) The tunnels below the locker will disappear in ""Lost""-like time travel intervals."

Maybe it's like OP and /u/rhymeswithgumbox said, the dome telepathically prevents people from seeing outside.  Or more likely the military moved away because they were going to nuke it and after they saw that didn't work they just stayed away from the border.  Remember though, its only been two weeks since the dome fell so in reality, they haven't had a lack of communication with the outside for more then a week.  Big Jim and that crazy science teacher is kind of keeping them busy week after week."
UnderTheDome,2ctum1,Zombi_Sagan,1 point,Thu Aug 7 02:01:15 2014 UTC,"At this point, I think it's closer to 3 weeks or more. The opening that mentions two weeks is assumed at the beginning of the season. There have been at least a few days go by in this shit, haven't there?"

A little sloppy no? Just like the writers you are so quick to jump all over?"
UnderTheDome,2crdiq,AverageMutantTurtle,4,Wed Aug 6 15:22:07 2014 UTC,"I think the ""Melanie is from Zenith"", ""Barbie is from Zenith"", ""Pauline is in Zenith"", ""Barbie recognizes Melanie"", and ""Barbie lost a loved one before"" is poor foreshadowing.

UnderTheDome,2crdiq,JamarcusRussel,1 point,Thu Aug 7 11:05:50 2014 UTC,"Again, in season 1, the military was all over the dome, they evacuated the surrounding town (towns?) and tried to blow it up.  Then they gave up and left.  The people inside the dome went underground to try to see how far the dome went down.  It went too far down for them to go.  There hasn't been a military presence since season one."

Always include the spoiler tag in the heading.  Anyways, a couple of the best chestnuts:   But to me it sounded like Barbie and Sam were talking about watching Under the Dome, with Sam playing the part of a dude who has given up on the show and can't understand the plotting, and Barbie portraying a stubborn fan who refuses to quit tuning in and is suffering from total denial.   and   Rebecca the Science Teacher's practical use of her natural-world wisdom errs on the side of extremism. So far she'd tried to fix a caterpillar infestation by torching fields inside an enclosed Dome, she's tried to remedy a food shortage by indiscriminately committing mass murder with manmade swine flu, and she's tried to rescue two people from a tunnel that collapsed in an explosion by setting off another explosion inside the tunnel. And because everyone under the Dome has the memory of a goldfish and the intelligence of a stupid goldfish, Julia agreed to the ""let's try another explosion"" plan."

UnderTheDome,2cmwv0,ShitEatingTaco,13,Tue Aug 5 19:59:44 2014 UTC,Right?   Outside of Jr no one cares anymore. And it's been maybe 2 days in dome time since she was buried.   But people tend to not care about the dead. Has Linda been mentioned once since she showed up in big Jims flash back?   What about the fat chick that the dj hung out with? No one cares she's gone?

UnderTheDome,2cmwv0,kit25,38,Thu Aug 7 03:21:09 2014 UTC,I just have to point this out there is no fucking way they would run out of air. The dome is just too big and there is plenty of flora in the dome to keep producing oxygen...
UnderTheDome,2cmwv0,Fireworrks,27,Tue Aug 5 14:50:08 2014 UTC,"Even without any flora, the dome is huge. It makes literally no sense to be worried about air, their food problems will kill them long before they run out of air (ignoring the fact that it seems they have no supermarkets in the town).  I actually did the maths on the air issue, thinking maybe the writers noticed something I didn't about the towns oxygen requirements, then halfway through realised I could have just done a Fermi estimate:   The dome has a diameter of about 10 miles. We'll assume it's a prefect half sphere to make the volume calc easier and because a different shape wouldn't change the volume by that much anyway. We'll also ignore volume taken up by physical objects above ground level for the same reason.    V=⁴⁄₃ x π x r3, so the dome has a volume of 261 miles3 or 1012 m3.   The amount of oxygen a human needs to survive depends mainly on how active they are; these guys seem active so we'll be conservative and use a high estimate of 150 m3 of air per day. There's 2000 people in the town (we'll ignore all the deaths too), so 300,000 m3 is more than enough to see the town through a day. We'll ignore flora and the fact that you only need 2-4 trees to offset a person's oxygen usage. So, the dome contains 1012 m3 of atmosphere. The town needs, at most, 3*105 per day. That's 7 orders of magnitude difference between the town's daily needs and the total supply of air in the dome. Or to put it another way, lack of air in the dome will start being a problem in a little over 9000 years.   All of that is using massively conservative values, ignoring floras regenerative qualities, assuming everyone is constantly exercising hard and ignoring the alarming death rate the town seems to have developed. It's like the writers aren't even trying anymore."

Not Sorkin by any means, but at least entertaining television. So unfortunate that it went down hill to the point where it's so cringeworthy it's hard to watch.   Only character still worth watching is Big Jim, and that's more due to Norris campy performance than the material."

His personality changes based on the plot of the episode and who they want the antagonist to be (dome/junior/jim/dwight yoakam/guy from CSI: NY), so sometimes he helps Barbie with no problems (MAGIC PLANE FUEL) and sometimes he wants him dead.  Maybe the dome's magnetic field just altered his acting patterns."

UnderTheDome,2cd99g,ProxyReaper,1 point,Wed Aug 6 06:41:29 2014 UTC,"I'm sure the initial treatment was a solid one-season miniseries ala Kingdom Hospital and other post-2000 SK powerhouses, but at one point after CBS got a hold of it, I'm thinking their writers took over. They left the same characters in, but completely turned everything around.  Early on, they tagged a lot of the 'required' points from the book, but as the show continued on it shed that and made every character have redeemable qualities (Junior being the biggest one for this-- he's a fucking NIGHTMARE and easily the scariest character in the book) to make it more watchable to weekly audiences."

UnderTheDome,2c80g7,fosius_luminis,9,Thu Jul 31 08:00:01 2014 UTC,"Their characters aren't the same, that's not where people are drawing comparisons.  It's more about the frustrating suspension of disbelief you need with both characters.  Linda was so often oblivious to the events around her and so blind in her loyalty to Jim that it became frustrating when events arose due to her actions or inaction.  Rebecca was parachuted in out of nowhere and is presented as a leading authority on pretty much all things scientific and is used as a crutch to prop up or wrap up ridiculous premises.  The issue is that neither character is relatable.  You can't look at either character and believe that someone could be that oblivious, or someone could be that knowledgeable, and so it's insulting when the writers expect us to.  That frustration manifests itself in frustration towards the characters themselves, and not the shitty writing that created them."
UnderTheDome,2c80g7,maybelying,6,Thu Jul 31 15:53:59 2014 UTC,"I don't get the hate for Linda. Even her mistakes can be placed at relative inexperience, and the very strange phenomena of the dome itself.  But Rebecca? God damn I want the dome to split her in half."

UnderTheDome,2c80g7,venn177,7,Tue Aug 5 09:13:50 2014 UTC,"I don't see a resemblence, except perhaps a faint physical one (similar eyes & hair).   Personally, the one question that nags at me is why people call Norrie fivehead? Is it cause her forehead's large enough for five, or am I missing something?   Srsly though; I think that if they were both potrayed by men they would still get as much hate. I don't think its the people themselves but the writers. And if I were an amateur writer working on UTD and my char got crushed and i was forced to write another character, im pretty sure there would be a little semblance.   Like Jane Espenson. It doesn't matter what she's writing for - I can always tell which bit she's written. She has a distinctive flair that shows through any character.   TL;DR: If there is a resemblence, I think the writers are to blame."
UnderTheDome,2c80g7,Desparia,8,Thu Jul 31 08:20:31 2014 UTC,"I think the Norrie thing is a play on the word ""forehead""---> ""four-head"" so ""five-head"" is a step up from four... I think?. I don't like it either to be honest. I'm all for insulting her godawful acting but the rest isn't cool."
UnderTheDome,2c80g7,normannb,3,Thu Jul 31 12:27:44 2014 UTC,"I think it's because they look similar, and also, Rebecca showed up directly after Linda died, so the timing really made her seem like a replacement"

She had also told him that four hands were needed to hold the Dome, or however she phrased it, so it's plausible that if he thought Angie was one of those four hands because of the picture of her, then he may have thought it would bring the Dome down.  He even said as much to Junior before he almost smothered him.  I think he's acting plausibly within the boundaries of a ridiculously implausible premise.  Wow.  I'm defending the show.  I guess Stockholm Syndrome is kicking in.  I don't think he's a particularly bad character yet, but he's too new to tell.  There's still plenty of opportunity for them to ruin him in ridiculous ways.  Rebecca, on the other hand, I find it hard to believe someone like that could have kept her mouth shut and not been front and center from the beginning, just because she was sciencing.

UnderTheDome,2c22i8,TheAsios,14,Tue Jul 29 16:57:42 2014 UTC,"The disaster of the week (or day, in Dome time) is getting cliched and at this point, the threats and challenges the Domesters are facing are completely losing any sense of dramatic impact because we've already seen it all and we know that everything will be wrapped up tidily with a bow at the end of the show, to be completely forgotten or ignored soon after.  The character writing is just awful.  The only character that seemed to be written with any sense of realism was Angie, she's the only character (at least, I think) that you could watch and relate to the way she acting or feeling, for the most part.    And it's not that the actors are necessarily bad, but there is only so much that they can do with poor material.  So much of the dialogue is forced, and some of it so unnecessarily tense or dramatic that you have to wonder how many takes some of the scenes take, because it's hard to believe that they can keep a straight face through the first few tries.  Weak characterization aside, the thing that is most annoying to me is the absolute lack of any continuity or coherence between episodes.  Like the way the fight club seemed to be completely forgotten about by the next episode, or the way the town can constantly seem to divide itself to the point where they're fighting or shooting at each other, but a simple speech from Jim or Barbie makes everything ok and forgotten about by the next episode.  Or Phil.  What the hell happened?  Suddenly, just for the sake of creating a protagonist, they turn him into a sociopath that can shoot a man in cold blood, blow up a building and risk all of the food, and then threaten a woman's life?  How did we go from a dim witted DJ to the angry drunk swilling from the bottle down the jail corridor?  Where did that come from?  The answer:  the writers' asses.  That's where a lot of it comes from.  They take a lot of liberties when it is convenient for the plot, rather than applying some clever writing.  It's a bit frustrating.  It's the kind of show that should be epic in terms of plot development over time, there should be lots of foreshadowing and plot building, but each episode seems to be a canned story with a start, a middle and a quickly whipped together ending.  You can miss an episode or two, and really not be lost, because what happened in those episodes most likely has no bearing on future episodes.    A character that acts one way in this week's episode shouldn't surprise you if they are written completely differently next week.    Something that is deemed a crisis in one episode may not even be an issue in the next.    You can start watching the series from the middle and not be any more or less confused than someone that has watched from the beginning.  That takes a special kind of magic.  I think when this season is done, I'm going to rewatch the episodes in a random order and see if it actually makes a difference.  Just because.  All that said, I still watch the show.  I love to hate this show.  You kind of want it to get better, but you also kind of want to see just how bad it can still get.  The characters are cliched and the situations are forced and entirely unbelievable, but in a way I think that also gives it kind of a campy quality that I can appreciate.  Really, it's budget is the only thing keeping it from being a campy B-movie style sci fi series.  That's not such a bad thing, if you just suspend disbelief and don't take it too seriously."

There is not even an attempt at continuity or character development, things are conveniently just written for whatever needs to happen this week.  Last week (in Dome terms) Phil was somewhat buds with Julia, having told her what she needed to know about her husband and working with her on sending Dome news through the station.  The next week, he's a cold blooded killer accusing Julia of being on a power grab, blows up the fire hall, and hides all the food in an attempt to set her up to fail and send everybody back into Big Jim's loving arms.  What the hell?  And on a side note, why the hell didn't anyone (Barbie, I'm looking at you) ask Phil how he knew the generator wires were frayed?  Big explosion happens and Phil just happens to know the cause?    And on a side side note, how the hell do frayed wires cause an explosion of that magnitude?

Also, no one cared about the attempted murder of surviving-lesbian-mom or the guys that had been hiding food etc... no one thought to mention that to cement alliances in the town?  What happened to DJ-911 - did he die from that totally survivable chest wound?  Is he going to jail?  From DJ to Police Officer to BigJim-Worshipper to Inmate?

UnderTheDome,2bzvcz,soingee,3,Wed Jul 30 01:20:18 2014 UTC,Oh OK I guess that makes sense. So the journal said that Angie was a hand but didn't mention junior or the other 2? And also this makes me think that on some subconscious level junior can predict what's going to happen just like his mom and that's why he locked up Angie in the bomb shelter at the beginning of the series. He did say he was trying to protect her. Maybe subconsciously he knew someone was gonna kill her

The writing and the storyline choices that the writer made are just so god awful. It's wasted potential.  I was hoping for more assholes, more conflict, better villain/heels (what we got were asshole farmers who didn't want to share water and Barbie's weird lady friend), more alien stuff, more stories from the outside, more government/military involvement, more science fiction.  To be honest I was hoping for something resembling a more serious/dramatic Eureka."

UnderTheDome,2bnic7,antiph3d,5,Fri Jul 25 01:39:21 2014 UTC,"I think this is the case.  She expected the flu to spread across the entire town either way, she just needed a large concentration of people for the initial infection.  I think the fact that it was the church is just a lazy way for the writers to keep stirring the pot on the whole religion vs science undertone they seem to be going with now."
UnderTheDome,2bnic7,maybelying,6,Fri Jul 25 06:55:16 2014 UTC,"I took it as she thought religious people were the weakest and would contribute the least.   Like, instead of helping make the dome sustainable, they would be in church praying God would help.   I'd have to say, she would be correct in this."
UnderTheDome,2bnic7,Wizmaxman,-3,Fri Jul 25 15:26:01 2014 UTC,I guess Newton and Faraday were pretty useless because of their religiosity..and all these guys too. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_thinkers_in_science  Personally I'd eliminate all the atheist first.

I think because the Dome started it's magnet weirdness from E01 of this season, that the whole electronics blowing up close to it is now ceased. I mean, that's what I assumed.  The Dome changes it's state, I don't think it's bad writing. But I guess others can see it as such. I'm sure more will be explained about the Dome doing these types of shifts soon enough."

It's possible that the plane was older and simply didn't have that much electronic gear, may have been mostly electrical and electro-mechanical.  But honestly, they really don't pay attention to continuity in this show so it's best not to question too deeply."
UnderTheDome,2bfg8p,idontbelieveyourpost,3,Tue Jul 22 21:11:11 2014 UTC,"No, they exploded because they crashed into it. in The pilot for example, that plane blew up because it crashed right into the dome. The plane Barbie was flying just scraped it."
UnderTheDome,2bfg8p,MasterFGH,7,Tue Jul 22 21:02:18 2014 UTC,"He's referring to how electronics eh 'splode when they come in contact with the dome.  Like the guy that Hank killed by pushing his hearing aide to the dome, as well as that one dude I don't remember and don't care about that also died by touching the dome with his electronics.  Yes, it's a horrible show, and yes we keep watching to see how bad it can get.  There's no rhyme or reason.  There's no continuity, it's just bad writing and bad acting.  Here's to season 3!"

UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,zsreport,9,Tue Jul 22 22:15:57 2014 UTC,"Hmmm, apparently the falling viewership is due to less marketing.  Really?  Pretty sure that viewership is falling because the show is terrible.  Stupid plot that picks-up and drops threads like it's playing hot potato.  A major event in one episode is not even remembered by the next (and lets remember one episode = approximately 1 day in Dome-world),  clunky dialogue, some mediocre acting, almost zero continuity and characters who act in ways that aren't believable."
UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,JimminyBobbit,2,Tue Jul 22 23:42:13 2014 UTC,This is the series that jumped the Sharknado. A series so unwatchable you have to watch it. At least Sharknado made people laugh.
UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,bloodshotnipples,4,Wed Jul 23 03:14:37 2014 UTC,I hope there is a finale before it gets canned!
UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,LOLRECONLOL,2,Tue Jul 22 23:40:42 2014 UTC,I agree. This was clearly a case of greed on the part of CBS. This show should have been 1 season and done. They could have done a great job in one season but they decided to spread it out and see how long they could go. They'll more than likely leave us with another cliffhanger even though its almost guaranteed that the show will not be picked up for another season.
UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,antiph3d,2,Fri Jul 25 01:24:36 2014 UTC,I have to know how they'll fuck up the ending.  No show has left me wanting an ending more than this one.
UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,venn177,3,Sat Jul 26 05:03:28 2014 UTC,"This is the problem.  CBS doesn't really care about the show.  It's costs are paid for by sponsorship and international licensing.  Ad revenue doesn't have to cover the costs, it's pure profit.  As long as the show keeps pulling enough viewers to keep the ad sales viable and the licensing in place, they have nothing to worry about.  There's no point replacing it or investing money in it just to try and bring in higher ratings, because that will cut into the profits.  The big networks are centered around monetizing mediocrity as effectively as possible.  They simply don't see as big an ROI on expensive shows even if they bring in higher ad revenue.  It's too bad the series wasn't being produced by one of the specialty channels, like HBO."
UnderTheDome,2bfrpn,maybelying,2,Wed Jul 23 00:40:51 2014 UTC,"This would have been a great five-part mini-series. As it is, I've just read that they want it to run for five 13-EPISODE SEASONS.  Jesus fuck, no. I'm now out."

UnderTheDome,2au8wt,UnusualOx,1 point,Tue Jul 22 02:07:59 2014 UTC,"Personally, it's very close and it might even tip more onto ""bad"" as far as crummy seasons of Dexter. Characters become caricatures and unlikable. Uninspired main plots...how many times do we need to see Dexter become close in some capacity to someone only to realize he can never be close to someone. Dull, forced side plots that are done out of obligation and not because the supporting cast is so interesting. Boring serial-killer-of-the-season arcs. And probably worst overall, the show was too cowardly towards genuine change and upset, if it was trimmed by a couple seasons and didn't have to spin it's wheels and leave Dexter basically back to status quo at the end of the season, it's legacy could've been much stronger. There were great moments and good episodes in its latter half, but when you average and consider the seasons as a whole, the show was pretty lackluster after season 4."

UnderTheDome,2au8wt,UnusualOx,1 point,Tue Jul 22 04:23:31 2014 UTC,"No, I would concede that. Under the Dome is in a special place of hilariously bad, where Dexter really only sunk to boring or unsatisfying because it showed so much promise early on."

Did you ever think when he was crying in episode 2 with Joe he may have been crying over losing his sister when he was younger?  I am not sure why the dome would bring her back, but I am 100% sure it is his sister just judging by the hints they are laying down. There is no way they would ever put in the dialogue hinting that they recognize each other or look familiar to one another without knowing they are going to bring up a past between the two of them. Even the scene where she was rooting through his stuff is definitely leading to when they say she is his sister.  And if you watched the scene where he is crying with Joe, and didn't instantly get the impression Barbie was crying over his sister you should go back and watch it."

The whole ""contract"" thing sort of gave it away that they killed her or knew of her death.   This is more of a general theory but I think it's obvious Jr's mom has a bigger stake in this whole dome thing.

UnderTheDome,2at0ol,Wizmaxman,3,Wed Jul 16 02:14:30 2014 UTC,"I like all of these theories, /u/venn177.   At first I too thought she was some strange re-incarnation of Pauline Rennie but that theory has been scrapped.   I now theorise that she is part of some plot that took place in '88 inc pauline, lyle & sam.. I also think that she was sent here by the Dome, and that in itself leaves me open to the possability of some kind of communication between Melissa and those responsible for the dome (aliens?).   Wether that means they want to learn about humanity through her, are using her and those under the dome in some cosmic game of chess, or if it is just some  kind of temporal/time-loop I can't begin to speculate, but it is interesting to wonder about.   I'd like to see Melissa meet Sam or Lyle or even Big Jim and see what their reaction is to her.. I think that in itself will answer a question or two.   Anyway, those are my thoughts, until next episode."
UnderTheDome,2at0ol,Desparia,3,Wed Jul 16 03:12:08 2014 UTC,"You guys aren't thinking like a writer. Melanie Cross is Barbie's daughter from the future, sent back to the 70s by Pauline's painting of a wormhole. Junior was caught up in the painting, but it rejected him, leaving him crazy. The painting attracted the attention of nearby aliens, who had a 20-year long council and then dropped the domes around the earth. They'll allow a moment of wifi but only after you sacrifice someone. It all makes sense!  I like Norrie. Sure, she's 'edgy' but that's fairly realistic for 15. I like her because she confronts people. Joe is spineless."
UnderTheDome,2at0ol,Foul_peen_witch,2,Thu Jul 17 14:10:05 2014 UTC,"If I saw last season's finale and this season's premier back to back, I would have picked up on this right off the bat. But remember how Julia was pulling the girl from the lake to start this season? She had just dropped the egg that was in the mini-dome into the lake to clear the darkness.   Well, keep that in mind with the knowledge that Junior's mom, uncle and Dwight Yoakam knew each other during the time of the yearbook they found the girl in. The girl was somehow placed in the egg back then and Junior's mom, uncle and Dwight Yoakam were somehow involved."

Anyway I posted my theory on a different post here, but I am pretty confident so I will copy and paste it:  ""She is Barbie's sister, which is why he recognized her in episode 2 and she recognized him in episode 3. Did you ever think when he was crying in episode 2 with Joe he may have been crying over losing his sister when he was younger? I am not sure why the dome would bring her back, but I am 100% sure it is his sister just judging by the hints they are laying down. There is no way they would ever put in the dialogue hinting that they recognize each other or look familiar to one another without knowing they are going to bring up a past between the two of them. Even the scene where she was rooting through his stuff is definitely leading to when they say she is his sister. And if you watched the scene where he is crying with Joe, and didn't instantly get the impression Barbie was crying over his sister you should go back and watch it."""
UnderTheDome,2at0ol,justterriblyconfused,2,Thu Jul 17 04:10:54 2014 UTC,"Barbie's full name is Dale Barbara. The girl's name is Melanie Cross. Unless Barbie legally changed his name at some point, I don't really see that being super accurate. Also, wouldn't he recognize his dead sister, even 25 years later?  And wouldn't he know if his sister was from Chester's Mill, a place he purportedly had never been to before?"

American actress Kiele Sanchez and Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro play the survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815.   The couple is introduced early in the third season.  The producers of the show were often asked what the rest of the plane-crash survivors were doing because the show only focuses on approximately fifteen of the survivors, and the characters of Nikki and Paulo were created in response.  Reaction to the characters was generally negative.  Lost's show runner Damon Lindelof even acknowledged that the couple are ""universally despised"" by fans.  As a result of this, the couple was killed off later in the same season. Both Nikki and Paulo are buried alive when they are thought to be dead by Hurley and Sawyer.

UnderTheDome,2apmcc,JamarcusRussel,13,Sun Jul 20 03:46:17 2014 UTC,No. I think it was just a coincidence.   I mean otherwise that would mean writers got in a room and talked about foreshadowing and actually seem like they have a plan. That would go completely against everything else we have seen.   What most likely happened is intern writer A thought it would be cool to put blood in a bottle . at the same time intern writer B watched lost and thought it was super sweet idea to do faith vs science.

Big Jim said he had a few people help him cover up the car crash, so maybe he was just lying (as he does) and really covered up her absence with her 'death'.  As for her introduction to the story, I've no idea how they plan to do so without defeating the purpose of the entire premise by focusing on plot outside the dome (achieved thus far through radio broadcasts, which is no longer available)."
UnderTheDome,2a91jg,haydonjames98,3,Fri Jul 11 07:33:52 2014 UTC,Why do the show writers think we give a fuck about Junior or Big Jim...or Junior's fucking mother? Those 2 characters are beyond unlink able.  Junior should have been lynched by now. The only reason is that the town for some reason seems to forgive & forget faster than a squirrel.
UnderTheDome,2a91jg,Maddoodle,2,Fri Jul 11 11:45:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but they choose to keep them as 'villains' so all the attention isn't on the dome; otherwise they'll actually figure a way out of the dome (God forbid)."

We're supposed to believe Angie got kidnapped, locked up, tied up and nearly abused by a .guy that and she was willing to almost forgive and stand to be around him in just 2 weeks?

UnderTheDome,2a91jg,_erti,3,Thu Jul 10 02:33:07 2014 UTC,"The government never attempted to nuke anyone. The bomb they used is The U.S.'s biggest non nuclear bomb. The funny part was they showed a missile hitting the dome. There's no way the MOAB could ever be put on a missile. It has to be dropped from a C130 or I guess a bomber. But I've veered off...  If you recall the bombing was an answer to the dome messing with the magnetic field. The government feared the world's magnetic field might be irreversibly damaged and were willing to sacrifice the citizens of Chester's Mill if it would save the world.   About the marking of the dome for planes... The government (FAA) are aware of the airspace and have more than likely shut it down per Barbie's request to the fire dept. Flying inside the dome is reckless and a suicide mission that Barbie got lucky with.  For the most part it all takes place under the dome because the important aspect of the show is how the people within the dome manage and cope with the ordeal. We've already seen that the people outside of the dome can do absolutely nothing about it. You're also assuming that the dome would even allow outsiders to assist. Remember the dome is as much a character as is anyone else.  I agree. the show and character reactions are extremely unrealistic but I pretty much expected that considering the topic of the show.   Lastly, to answer a few other people... The name of the town where Jr.'s mother is Zenith, I believe. I think I recall the name Zenith on the snow globe and on a sign in the town during his dream."

Season 1 should have ended with her throwing the egg in and a girl coming up. Then the viewer could put  1 and 2 together.   It's not like it was so deep mystery that required you to be smart to think of, it just required remembering she threw an egg down there last season."

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Monarki,6,Tue Jul 8 03:53:07 2014 UTC,Ah man I didn't even think of that. For some reason I'd just assumed we'd find out in the next episode or two. I can't wait til the end of the season to find out :(
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,RustEvents,3,Tue Jul 8 04:22:26 2014 UTC,"Any other show I'd assume this is a small arc, but Under The Dome is shitty enough to draw it out as a full-season story."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ConcordApes,2,Tue Jul 8 04:41:14 2014 UTC,"But we've seen hints that juniors mom might still be alive. Perhaps she has seen Angie trying to convince junior that big jim must die, and she killed angie or put sam and creepy girl up to it to stop her hurting big jim   My theory is that the ""dead"" mom is controlling the Dome and the actions it seems to take on Chester's Mill."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,venn177,2,Tue Jul 8 04:54:45 2014 UTC,"I keep thinking too that the creepy girl and Sam are the dome taking their human shape   I first thought they were going to be a Jacob, Man In Black type relationship."

Jack was forced to drink from the Overlook Hotel; which turned him into a killer, Junior was forced to drink by the dome?"

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,RustEvents,3,Thu Jul 10 13:19:38 2014 UTC,They went out of their way to emphasize it was a man's hand.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,deepr,4,Tue Jul 8 13:02:03 2014 UTC,"Yup. Could be a decoy. Hard to say. The writers could just switch it around to be a giant frog at the last minute, just because it would make about as much sense as anything else they come up with."

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,thinkingdolphin,6,Tue Jul 8 12:57:07 2014 UTC,Let's get the Tumblr/Social Justice Warrior crowd going after the writers & producers in on this. It is the only conceivable way to make this show interesting.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SawRub,8,Tue Jul 8 02:45:51 2014 UTC,It seemed after duke and Schmunways husband all the men  deaths were love loss dudes. What happened to Joe's Asian skateboard pal? Is he dead?
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,8bubbles8joe,8,Tue Jul 8 02:49:23 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah! I miss that guy. The way he talked was very much how middle aged white guys think teenagers talk, and it was hilarious."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,gymsocks,22,Tue Jul 8 02:57:15 2014 UTC,Let's not forget about the psycho who killed Angie and belongs in a horror movie.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,RustEvents,9,Tue Jul 8 21:40:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah even at the beginning of the episode where he was being all judgy towards Big Jim, I was like, yeah that's a bit rich coming up from a guy who locked a girl up in his basement for days when she wanted to leave him."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ConcordApes,63,Thu Jul 10 03:37:09 2014 UTC,"Everyone in this episode:      ""Omg Angie gone too soon RIP!"" ""Lol who's Linda?"""
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,roger_,8,Thu Jul 10 08:56:49 2014 UTC,Right?! They barely did anything... I don't get it.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,13,Tue Jul 8 01:32:32 2014 UTC,Angie's death was murder; people get scared...
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,upstage123,7,Tue Jul 8 20:49:10 2014 UTC,Let's just ignore all of the other murders & murderers currently walking about so very worried about another murderer.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SoulxxBondz,5,Tue Jul 8 02:59:14 2014 UTC,I think they hate  Linda as much as we do.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,upstage123,18,Tue Jul 8 07:49:08 2014 UTC,"Ohey, we can just walk into the jail as we please. Totally secure so nobody can come jail break the prisoners."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ConcordApes,14,Tue Jul 8 12:43:59 2014 UTC,So no one asks any details about who the girl saw kill angie? Like not even a height estimate or anything.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,soingee,2,Tue Jul 8 21:31:12 2014 UTC,They asked her if she saw a face.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Chimpeye72,7,Wed Jul 9 16:16:22 2014 UTC,"Yea I know, but no one asked anything else after that."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,7,Tue Jul 8 02:45:40 2014 UTC,It would make too much sense to ask what he was wearing.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,2,Tue Jul 8 03:04:21 2014 UTC,Or if the crazy dude pointing a gun at her in the jail was him
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,5,Tue Jul 8 03:12:26 2014 UTC,"If I had drunk so much that I blacked out for the whole night, I really wouldn't be in any condition to do anything functional, like move / talk. Want to know what Juniors hangover cure is."

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Tannysack,12,Tue Jul 8 02:21:57 2014 UTC,Haha Poor Linda ends up being just a blurb in Angie's funeral service.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SoulxxBondz,6,Tue Jul 8 02:31:42 2014 UTC,"Her death was so stupid, she just stood there and waiting for the thing to hit her.  She probably asked to be written out."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Nin_Fi,5,Tue Jul 8 02:23:06 2014 UTC,Apparently the townspeople hated her almost as much as the viewers.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,deepr,34,Tue Jul 8 21:32:52 2014 UTC,So the entire town has forgot they were about to hang Barbie a day ago and have accepted him back into the town?
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,8bubbles8joe,15,Tue Jul 8 18:13:30 2014 UTC,They realized he wasn't guilty.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SelfImmolationsHell,18,Wed Jul 9 03:04:03 2014 UTC,So they think he's now innocent but they don't seem at all interested in finding the guilty person.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Bluedemonfox,8,Tue Jul 8 20:21:05 2014 UTC,Everyone turned on a fucking dime. Except DJ/Cop; he still has his eye on Barbie.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SelfImmolationsHell,11,Tue Jul 8 02:12:45 2014 UTC,Yea the school is opening to teach and not because the script wouldn't work
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,foxtalep,20,Tue Jul 8 02:14:15 2014 UTC,Oh so everything is a test now according to Big Jim when in actuality he just wants to be the one to fly the plane.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,9,Tue Jul 8 03:41:07 2014 UTC,Big Jim actually seems like he might be turning around.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,foxtalep,11,Tue Jul 8 19:35:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, a bit too much. It feels like he will be turning the dome as part of some cult/religion and just turns into a zealot which is basically not much different from how it was before except that now he would be doing it at the behest of the dome rather than for himself."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Kerrigore,10,Tue Jul 8 02:05:57 2014 UTC,"Dammit, the dome doesn't want more death Joe."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,maybelying,16,Tue Jul 8 02:30:24 2014 UTC,"So we're burning the field. I'm sure this was probably brought up somewhere, but it made me think where all that smoke is going to go. Also, if the smoke is just sitting along the ceiling, it made me wonder why the evaporating water wouldn't pool atop then drip down every day the same way if you made a makeshift water purifier? Would this town realistically be able to create enough oxygen to sustain the living organisms inside?"
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Lilusa,13,Tue Jul 8 02:15:02 2014 UTC,"The fire in S1E2 was sooo terrible, now lets start one on purpose!"
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ConcordApes,4,Tue Jul 8 12:49:43 2014 UTC,That's right! I thought there was such a fuss about that dude's house burning down the first time.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ET_Phone_Home,11,Tue Jul 8 02:45:19 2014 UTC,The magnetic fields make the smoke turn into oxygen.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ForteShadesOfJay,9,Tue Jul 8 02:25:30 2014 UTC,"When smoke goes into the sky, it turns into stars, so my theory is that is where the pink stars come from.  Who's with me?"
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,foxtalep,16,Tue Jul 8 02:36:57 2014 UTC,"That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Lilusa,2,Tue Jul 8 02:58:17 2014 UTC,It can't be any stupider than what the writers will come up with.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,2,Tue Jul 8 20:20:08 2014 UTC,"In an episode in Season 1 (I think 2 or 3) Joe puts his hand against the dome, where on the other side the military is spraying it with water, and his hand comes back wet. So the smoke probably gets filtered through the dome itself."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,drofmot,3,Tue Jul 8 04:59:26 2014 UTC,Didn't it rain at some point? Basically they made the point very early on that this town was big enough that even with the dome over it could still be self sustaining. So they don't get a dripping effect but they do get clouds/rain. They have also gone though a fire and panicked about the oxygen thing (maybe even before the rain) but they realized that the eco system is big enough to filter or offset it. If you recall they were all panicking about water shortage but the rain solved this. They don't show rainy days but it wouldn't be out of the question that they still happen. There is definitely a ton of vegetation and trees. I don't know how much is needed to offset a town but it's enough where it's believable to me.  I think this show does so many stupid/unrealistic things that people go out of the way to find plot holes where there aren't.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,pipi55,2,Tue Jul 8 19:41:42 2014 UTC,"I definitely don't watch it to find plot holes. I do enjoy the show despite it having some terrible dialogue sometimes. That said, I am just curious about these things, like if it were to really happen."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ForteShadesOfJay,1 point,Tue Jul 8 21:44:41 2014 UTC,The dome purposely created a storm to force junior to touch the dome but it didn't rain.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SkittlezTrench92,2,Fri Jul 11 20:21:01 2014 UTC,"Earlier, when the crime and panic in the streets was happening it rained."

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,FullOfTerrors,25,Tue Jul 8 20:49:30 2014 UTC,"Its because those crops were already infected with eggs. If they hatch, the new butterflies can infect new crops. If you burn the infected crops, you stop it from spreading."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,OneOfDozens,16,Tue Jul 8 19:42:22 2014 UTC,She wasn't burning the entire food supply just the infested one. Not really a crazy solution.

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Rasalom,7,Tue Jul 8 02:22:46 2014 UTC,"Oh, man. This plot line is really rich. So why the amateur screenwriting/directing? Barbie sacrificing himself by stealing the crop duster, then hitting the dome while losing electronics and running out of fuel... C'mon guys, tighten it up."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,xLite414,6,Tue Jul 8 12:14:46 2014 UTC,I hope it gets better than this. This episode was pretty underwhelming for everything that happened during the premiere.   P.S. How many days have past in the series since the dome came down?
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,soingee,6,Tue Jul 8 18:29:39 2014 UTC,Crop dusting isn't exciting!?
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,deepr,3,Tue Jul 8 03:57:07 2014 UTC,A couple of weeks I think
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,sanguisbibemus,6,Tue Jul 8 02:49:08 2014 UTC,"I don't like how they just start flying planes. The whole intriguing idea of this show is that they are limited on fuel, food and landscape, yet by season 2 they're flying planes. What's next? Submarine chase in the lake?  The wing scraping the side of the dome without totaling the plane was the worst, too.   Jumped the shark? More like flew in the dome."

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Dudwithacake,12,Tue Jul 8 14:32:57 2014 UTC,"The butterflies are a symbol of the divinity of the Dome to him it almost seems. Of course she'd be covered in butterflies, they're mourning her too. Or something."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Hollywoodbnd86,3,Thu Jul 10 03:39:57 2014 UTC,"Oh, right, I was kinda thinking that, too, like he expects the butterflies so it's not odd to him."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,jpflathead,8,Tue Jul 8 02:00:00 2014 UTC,Or how the butterflies started moving towards Julias hand in the beginning so basically how they are attracted to certain people just seems to go unnoticed..
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Cryptic-Panther,7,Tue Jul 8 02:07:48 2014 UTC,Just needed those butterflies to cover Angie's double's face cos Angie can't make it for episode 2.  Move along.
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,Kerrigore,11,Tue Jul 8 02:47:01 2014 UTC,"God this show is such a pile of wet garbage, why am I doing this to myself? Things from season 1 that apparently every character has forgotten about:   All the teenagers in town having fits, has that stopped happening now that Julia dropped the egg in the lake (!?) The pink stars thing - has anyone even referenced that since it happened? I mean, I know the dome is doing a lot of crazy shit but are people literally just like ""OK, cool, whatever"" The FUCKING EGG, which nearly the entire plot revolved around last season, is now gone, and no one has said to Julia ""Hey, you know that egg? What did you do with it, by the way?"" Is it just gone forever? Has Big Jim forgotten about it? He hasn't mentioned it so far and last season he was desperate to get his hands on it. At the end of last season everyone in the town was ready to straight up EXECUTE a motherfucker, they thought Barbie killed like 5 people! Then the dome went black and now Barbie's just wandering around and everyone's like ""Oh, this guy's here? Awesome!"" If they've changed their minds and decided he didn't do it (for some reason), is no one concerned about who did? They've just forgotten about it!? Apart from DJ Justice, obviously. (ily DJ Justice <3) The whole Angie, Junior, Joe and ginger chick being like ""the four hands"" and being this special teen combo of dome communication, has that all gone out of the window now? I mean, Angie's dead so I guess so but still. Julia seems to have completely forgotten that she was married to another guy like...3 weeks ago, and that Barbie murdered that guy. They're acting like they've been together for years, they're only known each other 2 damn weeks! It's fucking ridiculous! Where the hell is ginger chick's mum!? She said they'd be happy to stay at Big Jim's house and then this episode she just...wasn't...there? You'd think with all the shit that's been going down in this place, losing her wife, and the fact that they don't know anyone in here, she'd want to supervise her damn child. Apparently not. I guess she's just fucking twiddling her thumbs somewhere. Also, where are the army? Are they just not bothered by the dome any more? And if they have just cleared off, why aren't there loads of outsiders hanging around the other side of the dome all the time? I can only assume every tin foil hatted weirdo in the country would want to check this shit out, but apparently nobody cares. Has the entire rest of the country just forgotten that this has happened and moved on with their lives. Although, that's starting to sound like a pretty good option for everyone watching at this point."
UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,DoctorBlueBox1,3,Tue Jul 8 03:24:17 2014 UTC,"For points 1-5:  the script writers forgot what they wrote last season, and the shit is so bad even they can't bare to read over what they wrote so they can have some sense of continuity.    Your post made me laugh so damn much, because it's totally true.  This show is a train wreck!  Also, what I want to know is WHY Julia hasn't said anything about finding that Dome/Egg Girl in the middle of the lack RIGHT AFTER SHE THREW THE EGG IN THERE.  Has she not connected those two things in her head.... like, at all?  She hasn't mentioned it to anyone, or tried to talk to the girl about it or asked what she knows about the Dome or... or... anything. I don't understand why??!?!"

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,SpaceRook,2,Thu Jul 10 09:12:39 2014 UTC,They didn't kill her.   That awesomely tight body of hers killed her along with that little shirt she wore all last season. Killed her off in that show. But will resurrect her in many other shows.  Also responsible for the death of many kleenex and socks.

UnderTheDome,2a3h9l,ConcordApes,2,Tue Jul 8 02:49:00 2014 UTC,"The writing is really terrible, the dialogue is clunky and unrealistic as hell.  When you add that to bad cinematography which holds on the actors reactions to something too long, with some of the terrible acting (especially the younger ones in the show) it's all quite a laughable result  B movie like.  The effects - like the smoke from the fire and so glaringly fake too, they look cheap and nasty.  The way the characters are written is often stupid, many of them don't seem motivated by anything.  Things will be really important for a few minutes then characters will just forget them and it'll never be mentioned again.  The way Linda died was pathetic.  She just stood there... waiting for that car to hit her.    I feel like they are using CHARACTER-DEATHS!! as something ""shocking"" as a way to try and add intrigue:  'we're not above killing off main characters!' as if it makes the plot more complex or interesting.  However, it's really not.  Lindas death was a total anti-climax and no one in the town seemed to give a shit.  Then the young girl died and people get their act together enough to hold some shitty little funeral, and they'll investigate some bullshit for a while until something else happens.  Oh god.  It's so bad. I'll probably torture myself with the next episode though."

Jess began appearing from series 4 episode 1, in which she was introduced alongside Finn (Nathan McMullen). Jess has the power of X-ray vision, which is down to her ability to ""see through people and their bullshit"". Jess is described as ""the person who will say the un-sayable, the person who’ll question social norms and etiquette"". Neela Debnath of the The Independent said that ""Jess comes across as the more likeable and ‘conventional’ social miscreant"" out of the new introductions of the show. Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy felt Crome made ""a strong first impression"" while Jordan Farley of SFX said Jess has her ""moments to shine"" but that she ""fails to make a big impression"".

Anytime the camera wasn't rolling he was cracking jokes, singing, entertaining the extras, making fun of the director. He was a really fun guy to be around.  However, the best conversation I had while I was there was with the director, Jack Bender. He was such an interesting guy to speak with, especially because of the sheer number of good shows he has been a part of. The best conversation I've ever had while in a queue for a men's room is due to me standing right between him and Mike Vogel in line."

One thing I would recommend is to sign up with a friend, so hopefully you'll have someone to talk to during the downtime.

UnderTheDome,28xk3y,uckTheSaints,1 point,Tue Jun 24 06:25:28 2014 UTC,"The season 2 finale was seriously lacking in deaths, but they had to have Joe come back. Him vs. Kevin Bacon are literally the reason the show is relevant. If you remove those two the show is Under the Dome."
UnderTheDome,28xk3y,uckTheSaints,1 point,Tue Jun 24 06:27:59 2014 UTC,"There are many excellent ways to keep Joe involved in the show, what they did was not one of them. It's insulting to my intelligence and it will be a shock to no one when he escapes prison for like the 3rd time next season. Should have just had him get the upperhand and escape in the finale.  But then again that kind of stupidity is exactly why I watch that show."
UnderTheDome,28xk3y,Moviefreak15,1 point,Tue Jun 24 06:43:49 2014 UTC,"I was expecting Joe to die, and he would come back as Hardy's 'demon' that he would constantly be haunted by because he has to come to terms with a life without Joe, and his conscious couldn't do it.  That would make for an entire season of Joe/Hardy banter without the insanely contrived plot devices."
UnderTheDome,28xk3y,Saeleth,1 point,Tue Jun 24 06:51:28 2014 UTC,That would actually be really good. I would've loved to see a season focused entirely on Lily Gray and the twins with visions of Joe driving Hardy insane. Then at the end of the season they could pull something out of their ass and reveal Joe is alive or something for one more go around.
UnderTheDome,28xk3y,finn141,2,Tue Jun 24 07:10:02 2014 UTC,"I thought a good twist would've been the catalyst for this: It's like two or three years later, everything is going good, but there's a copycat killer that's been doing every kill Joe did in EXACTLY the same way. So Ryan starts hallucinating him, and at the end the twist is that Ryan was actually doing the killing himself because he didn't know how to live without Joe as his adversary."

UnderTheDome,28xk3y,Dorkside,4,Tue Jun 24 20:09:23 2014 UTC,That's what I thought. On my 1st watch-through I found it pretty enjoyable. I was so into finding out what happened there that I didn't notice that the characters actually pretty stupid... Noticed that the 2nd time I watched it (with someone else). He seems to be having the same issue. Right now he likes it because of the mystery and he doesn't notice how stupid and inconsistent the characters actions are :(  But still I will enjoy it.

Putting the show on at 10 pm EST on a Monday night though...I can't remember, when did season 1 air during the week? I feel like 10 on a Monday night is a good way to kill a series."

UnderTheDome,27kc0y,NLclothing,1 point,Sat Jun 7 21:33:38 2014 UTC,"It won't be.  I only started watching because this was supposed to be a ""one and done"" season, and that the ending had been changed from the book (which is literally worse than cancer). But now that it has been extended, they are going to draw this convoluted nonsense out for as long as they can before leaving you without any answers. They took the best parts of the book and made them uninteresting, and they will probably make the explanation for the dome even worse.  SPOILER INCOMING!  The dome was placed there by aliens, child aliens to be specific. They where just having a gas playing around with people ""like ants under a magnifying glass"", so one of the characters went to plea with them to remove the dome, which they did because they felt bad about it.  I'm not making this shit up. Anybody who praises that conclusion deserves a brick to the head."

UnderTheDome,1wb6h2,ATAD,2,Mon Jan 27 21:58:41 2014 UTC,I think that the show is better.  The end of the book was sloppily written.  The Gone series by Michael Grant is much better if you want to read a Dome book.

It really creates some unrealistic moments where you know that no human being would ever act anything like that in real life."
UnderTheDome,1mvykd,TechnetiumWaffles,2,Wed Oct 2 23:00:23 2013 UTC,I take it you've gotten thru the season finale by now.  Opinions?
UnderTheDome,1mvykd,Stalked_Like_Corn,3,Mon Sep 23 18:07:25 2013 UTC,"Yes, i am through the season finale now.  I think the show is pretty good.  I mean, it has some ""WTF"" moments and doesn't answer a whole lot but LOST did the same thing and it was lauded as an amazing tv show.  I think that a show like this should be given a 1st season to build a lot of ""Whaaaaaat!?"" moments and mystery around everything.  The problem will be if next year it doesn't actually ANSWER any of these moments.    There is a fine line between just telling us everything and feeding us a little bit to keep stringing us along.  LOST failed to keep feeding us enough to at least make it interesting.  We will see next season if this starts to at least answer some questions.  If not then I'll stop watching (Just as I did with LOST until it was over and I watched all the episodes back to back).  I read the one review here that was pretty funny about ""Oh, lets just touch everything"" but it's a sci-fi show so you have to suspend disbelief a bit and just go with it.  If you start trying to wedge a sci-fi show into reality you're going to have a bad time of it.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd say it's a 7 right now but that could be knocked down considerably if no answers come next season.  Also, 7 is a pretty high score from me because I had a hard time the first couple of episodes taking this even remotely serious because I kept chuckling about ""Simpsons did it""."
UnderTheDome,1mvykd,TachyonGun,2,Mon Sep 23 18:12:38 2013 UTC,"It's a sci-fi show, but that doesn't mean that the individuals within said show have to act like complete morons. It's not ""bizarro"" or ""grotesque"" or even ""nonsense"" genre. The characters are just plain bad, with little to no backstory on most (like the kids) and no development. They are all one-dimensional except maybe Junior and Big Jim. Some of them are borderline rage-inducing (looking at you, Linda). They don't act like anyone that's in their right mind would act in such situations. And the kid actors are terrible. Just terrible! The only one that does an OK job is Junior but even he comes off as very awkward (and not because he's crazy)...   I disagree on LOST, though. I didn't particularly like it, but it did a much better job at mystery than this show has. Specially since the answers themselves were at least somewhat original. Here, they don't reveal much if anything (it seems they want us to think the dome is alien, but with this storytelling who the fuck knows?). Also, it had an impressive character development with it's flashbacks and flashforwards. I can't sympathize with half of the characters in UTD because I simply know nothing about them other than their names and their profession, and the ones that we do know a thing or two about are simply not very interesting.  I give this show a 4/10. That being said, I'll give it another chance next season and possibly the season after that. I was disappointed time and again and cringed harder than I have at any other TV show (and I watched all of motherfucking DEXTER), but the setting is still interesting and I love Stephen King. I can't give it up, but I agree with the people that hate-watch it."

We see them with a pink light shining on them, and we see the stars, but none with the whole town in front of the stars.   Creepy how the brain works.   Here are the three kids with the stars but no townspeople.   AFAIK, that's the best you're going to get until the show is released on Blu-Ray."

UnderTheDome,1mrw2l,francienolan,1 point,Sat Sep 21 15:00:34 2013 UTC,"The look of the pink stars was largely left up to us guys in VFX.  I was there on set and Cort the DP put a lot of thought in to the lighting and composition to give us space for the stars.  But myself and a few talented artists had to really sit down and go... okay, how do we make ""pinks stars""  cool and awe-some.  It took a few rounds before someone suggested the more line like pattern you see.  Also, for trivia's sake, the POV shots of the stars going up are actually all stills I took of trees on my Mark 3 (such amazing low light!) that we added some movement to in VFX.  So not principal photography.  EDIT:  I should add that we did 113 in about,er, two weeks from picture lock to final VFX.  Time gets tight at the end!"

UnderTheDome,1mkut6,Florist_Gump,1 point,Wed Sep 18 16:35:04 2013 UTC,"I've been worried of the show ever since another season was announced.  A short self-contained season would force a tightness of script while additional seasons leaves things open for LOST-esque padding for padding's sake.  As with LOST I loved the first season, gave up on the show with s2e1 when it became brutally obvious that no questions would ever be answered, only more questions would be revealed.  I suspect I'm done with Dome as well, reserving judgement until the first ep of the next season but my hopes are not high."

I wanted this to wrap up. If the show would have sucked, it would have been canceled a few episodes in. Since it was good, they stretch it out. I have no clue how they got to this point and I've watched all episodes.   What about the propane and the drug they were making? What about the crazy lady that saw all the deliveries? Why was Maxine introduced then quickly shot? Why did big him show up in a some touching event with stab wounds all over? Why did junior kidnap Angie? Why is it never brought up now? Why was juniors mom painting pink stars? Why haven't the kids had any more seizures?  I could go on but I'm just so frustrated."

She just heard that Julia broke out Barbie, she watched how hard those kids were trying to keep the mini-sphere from Big Jim, she's not asking questions you would expect someone to start asking, especially someone as filled with doubt as she was earlier in the season.

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,BangkokPeanut,7,Tue Sep 17 04:22:00 2013 UTC,Pimp my dome?
UnderTheDome,1mjdof,happypotamus107,12,Tue Sep 17 03:10:01 2013 UTC,Did they change the finale to prepare for the second season?  Can't believe they planned on ending it here all along.
UnderTheDome,1mjdof,roger_,30,Tue Sep 17 01:07:05 2013 UTC,I don't think they planned anything. It seems like they wrote each episode while filming.
UnderTheDome,1mjdof,Bluewind55,8,Tue Sep 17 02:22:40 2013 UTC,"They probably have about ten more minutes where there's some sort of conclusion, but they chopped it off once it was renewed. Like Julia or the kids run up and yell about how Barbie is innocent, maybe Linda stops being a moron, the whole town standing there turns against Big Jim and Junior as they want to still hang Barbie while they start having all these questions about the story Big Jim is trying to sell them."

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,rebuildingMyself,21,Tue Sep 17 03:09:20 2013 UTC,It's a toss up between Junior & linda for me. Both are halfwits.

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,cjfynjy,15,Sat Sep 21 03:07:18 2013 UTC,Yeah seriously they just dropped the Junior is a psycho thing. In the beginning of the series he was fucking nuts now he is a normal dude with a small temper issue.

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,agravain,15,Tue Sep 17 02:59:26 2013 UTC,Yes I was thinking it would have been a more dramatic ending. Like him at least pulling the lever..people disappearing....something like that.
UnderTheDome,1mjdof,wandahickey,9,Tue Sep 17 01:59:55 2013 UTC,"Barbie disappearing would have been cool at least. I would rather have the mystery of ""where did Barbie go?"" than the mystery of ""what the hell just happened?"".  They could have brought him back a few episodes into the next season with no memory of where he was and returned everything to the status quo. Yeah it's ripping off the X-Files but I would still be happier with that."

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,rebuildingMyself,37,Tue Sep 17 02:42:32 2013 UTC,I'm surprised I haven't seen any comments in here noting the supreme irony of Big Jim telling a black guy to build a gallows. That had to be intentional.
UnderTheDome,1mjdof,jcannon98188,17,Tue Sep 17 02:44:21 2013 UTC,I'm surprised he didn't convince Linda to build it. Wouldn't even be that hard.

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,Serdontos,7,Tue Sep 17 04:23:12 2013 UTC,When he said his grandfather was the last one to build a gallows in chesters mill I laughed because the gallows was probably used to hang black people. I also liked how many black people showed up to a hanging in the middle of the night. You would have thought they would hate that idea or something.

UnderTheDome,1mjdof,peeinherbutt,9,Tue Sep 17 16:50:45 2013 UTC,I don't think the dome is powered by the egg. I'm pretty sure it feeds off of Linda's brain and it went black because it ran out of food. Did anyone else notice that in episode one she actually made sense and the 12 episodes later she is a complete retard?

I'm going to assume that this ending was hacked together after they found out they were being renewed, and probably replaced what would have been an ending with proper closure (and maybe a couple of loose threads leaving the door open.)  Plus, Stephen King already implied that they had gone a different direction with how it ended from the book.  Sounded a little more final to me.  If they had planned this bogus ending as a mini-series without even knowing there was going to be a second season, then the writers are asshats."

UnderTheDome,1mj670,LeartS,4,Mon Sep 16 23:47:17 2013 UTC,"Nope, it's not that. I never read the book and I still think it's one of the worst written TV series ever made. It certainly is the worst I've ever seen. The story seems written week for week, and every week by a different person who knows only what happened previously and not the previous week writer intentions. The characters are all utterly retarded and they too change every week (except for the retardness, that is a constant). Lately the sounds effect and music has become ridiculous too!  And with shots like this one we reach the apotheosis of bad TV.  Why do I watch it? For the same reason people watch Sharknado and because I hate not having closure. Someone could just make a series where every 40 minutes episode consists of a married couple discussing about what could be inside a safe they misteriously found under they bed one day, and I will watch it just to know what's in there."

UnderTheDome,1mc0xc,jawni,7,Fri Sep 13 19:36:02 2013 UTC,"Who dies?   I think one of the non-essential cast characters, either Phil or Norrie's mom. Julia could end up dying, but I doubt that any of the core characters would be killed off.   Who is crowned Monarch?   Either Joe or Barbie. Joe seems to be a ""magical"" character so far that has a close connection with the dome.   Only one dome or multiple?   Only one.   Who if anyone kills Big Jim?   Nobody. He's the biggest star that the show has, and they aren't stupid enough to get rid of him.   WTF is the dome doing?   I think it's a power source that is sentient, and is protecting itself.   Although here is an interesting plot twist: The dome is some supernatural force that is being reborn into the world. In order to be reborn, it has to pick a host (aka the monarch). It protects itself and the host inside the two domes, and when it is ready it takes over their body. Every season would be a new one coming to life in a new city, and the plot line could expand from there."
UnderTheDome,1mc0xc,Heavenfall,2,Fri Sep 13 20:48:56 2013 UTC,I have a somewhat similar theory. I think that Barbie is crowned the monarch and together he and Julia are the monarchy. Essentially I think the monarchy is the dome choosing what it perceives to be the most impressive specimen to basically host the alien life. The monarchy would then be basically mind controlled by the dome to eventually convert everyone and I feel like Big Jim is really the only one even semi-aware of what's going on because his wife might have been aware of them earlier on(because of the paintings). Her death also seems too connected to the dome and mysterious to not have any deeper implications later on.
UnderTheDome,1mc0xc,SutterCane,2,Fri Sep 13 21:25:31 2013 UTC,Nothing we've seen so far has indicated that Big Jim is even thinking in those lines.

Who is Crowned Monarch: I think Linda will be the Monarch because the writers would not make Barbie the monarch because Joe has already mentioned that and they want it to be a surprise. The way that Linda found the mini-dome at the end just makes me believe even more that she is the Monarch.  Only One Dome or Multiple: One.  Who if Anyone will kill Big Jim: I don't think Big Jim will be killed but if I had to choose I'd say Junior because when they met in the police station Junior seemed to finally understand that his retarded father was a bad guy....but didn't.  WTF is the dome doing? I think that the dome is rebelling against either Big Jim being who he is or protecting itself from being destroyed from Joe and Friends."

That would be a cool way to end it, meaning we could follow some other UTD adventures. But then again in S2 we could see how the people outside the dome reacted to it as well....

Sure they'll run out of bullets and gas eventually but they can grow food and won't be running out of oxygen with all those trees. Maybe they figure out ethanol? Why doesn't the military just give them the process through the dome it's freaking see through. It's astonishing how little they care about interacting when they have an easy way of doing it. You'd think after blowing it up failed an apology and attempt of communication would be in order. Are they just banking that they never get out and they can just avoid that for ever. Also they figured out water can come through so why not try other liquids? I rambled a bit there the point was that it's self sustainable so they can take a page from Weeds and just cancel the show 4 seasons after it was beyond saving I'll still watch it.

She kind of crossed into full on ""duh"" territory when she found out how corrupt Big Jim was and then didn't even appear to hesitate when she turned on Barbie. She didn't even seem to hesitate in at least mostly trusting Big Jim at that point.   It probably would have been better if they had written her so that she had to do her job, find Barbie, but still offer some indication that she really doesn't trust Jim. It looked even sillier last night when she didn't wonder too much why Big Jim had two kids locked up in jail."

UnderTheDome,1m4r7k,blockithoops,3,Wed Sep 11 00:42:22 2013 UTC,I agree. I think they took out far too much from the book. They should've done a like 2 or 3 part movie that follows the book for the most part instead of a tv series that has almost nothing in common with the book.
UnderTheDome,1m4r7k,silentorbx,3,Wed Sep 11 03:00:04 2013 UTC,"The book sounds infinitely more morbid, i guess cbs wanted it a bit more 'Family Friendly', books sounds awesome i may have to pick it up."

UnderTheDome,1m4r7k,silentorbx,1 point,Wed Sep 11 11:59:31 2013 UTC,"I misunderstood. I thought this was a post to discuss the book spoilers lol. Let me repost what I posted.  In the book, Barbie is a military hero who's appointed an elite status under the dome. They actually communicate with the military outside as well. Linda's fiancé guy actually gets stuck inside and has a much larger role as a doctor person. Jim is an asshat from day 1. Junior is a psycho with a brain problem, and he kills Angie and Dodie and stuffs them in a pantry. He visits them on occasion like a sick fuck throughout the book. The TV story line doesn't even compare to the book. There's a dome and people stuck inside with the same names. Thats about all thats similar. If they'd stuck to the book a lot more, I think the show would turn out really awesome. I highly recommend the book. It's a good read. I won't spoil the source of the dome though, that you'll have to find out yourself."

Then the kids are brought to an ""undisclosed location"" - she doesn't bat an eye. In the show trial against Barbie without a criminal attourney, a judge OR written evidence, she doesn't even care to show up anymore.

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,leagueoffifa,13,Tue Sep 10 22:50:41 2013 UTC,"I have no idea and this is a total shot in the dark, but maybe it has some sort of energy signature? The fact that they called it ""the egg"" must mean they have seen it with some kind of surveillance; they mentioned drone surveillance. Or... do they know about it because they created or discovered it and are using Chester's Mill as a proving ground? ""It's been moved"" suggests that they saw it in the woods (or put it there).  It's a really interesting question that sent my mind in all sorts of directions. Do they know about it because they made the dome? Did they use the MOAB to test the defensive capabilities of the dome?  The fact that the egg seems to be interacting or reacting to the butterfly suggests an organic origin for the egg, or is it just an unplanned coincidence that the caterpillar was captured when the little dome was formed and it is causing an unintended technological malfunction?   As you can tell, I have tons of theories bouncing around, and no answers whatsoever. Basically what I am confident in is that they have either seen it, or they put it there. I agree that this was probably the best episode yet.  Edit: After re-watching, the military says ""thermal photography shows the unidentified object has been transported from the woods to 2 miles northeast of town center."""

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,coolhandsarrah,10,Wed Sep 11 12:27:40 2013 UTC,Poor Dodee :(
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Thx4theFish42,34,Tue Sep 10 02:43:49 2013 UTC,10/10. This is the episode that makes the series.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,mutatron,11,Tue Sep 10 02:53:33 2013 UTC,"I agree. It wasn't flawless, but this was the first episode to keep me completely interested throughout since the first."
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Parrot132,32,Tue Sep 10 02:29:11 2013 UTC,Nori is about to find out why they call him Big Jim.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,ReekuMF,27,Tue Sep 10 14:53:28 2013 UTC,I thought he was going to get a little rapey there myself. Big Jim she's too young for you!
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Thx4theFish42,11,Tue Sep 10 03:05:51 2013 UTC,"that was the dumbest possible way to look badass, Norrie. You're lucky you're on CBS or that sass would have landed you a one way ticket to rapester's mill"
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,tcatron565,11,Tue Sep 10 03:27:05 2013 UTC,"Why is no one asking what the ""necessary expertise"" Barby has and why the military is interested in him? I'm only asking because I have no idea whatsoever."
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,broncosfighton,5,Wed Sep 11 02:37:37 2013 UTC,"How does the government know so much about everything, yet they were stumped on how to deal with it earlier to the extent that they tried to blow it up with a MOAB, but now they know Barbie ""has the expertise"" necessary to do something about it?"
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Daffoo,10,Tue Sep 10 03:34:53 2013 UTC,There's only one more episode left for this season. I wonder how much closure and resolution we'll get compared to the amount of cliffhanger factor.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,oddboyout,14,Tue Sep 10 03:44:09 2013 UTC,Praying for a 2 hour finale...

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,unoladron,10,Tue Sep 10 03:05:48 2013 UTC,I think the series final will end with the camera panning back showing multiple domes around the world.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,coolhandsarrah,5,Tue Sep 10 08:34:10 2013 UTC,"They figure out how to shut down their dome only to learn that the rest of the world is now covered in domes. The next season they travel the world solving a different dome-puzzle each episode.  I hope not.  Additional brainstorm: After solving their dome's puzzle and traveling to the next one, Junior, Joe, Angie and Norrie discover that they alone have the ability to enter other domes, but cannot leave until they've solved the puzzle. They would have to deal with all different kinds of crazed dome inhabitants and environments. Maybe one dome surrounds a belching factory, a nuclear power plant on the verge of meltdown, a cruise ship, etc. They would be visiting the domes with the most dire situations. Maybe they are drugged and forced to do it by the government, simply being shoved into a new dome against their will. Eventually they find a dome they think they can leave peacefully in rather than having their lives controlled by the government, but they have to fight against the dome's inhabitants who want to be released.  Even more:  There could be Venn-Domes (Overlapping Domes), Domes within domes, etc. They have to decide which to release first. Maybe there is a small peaceful group in the middle of overlapping domes, but of course they can only solve one dome puzzle at a time, so they have to decide whether to release the small group into a larger dome with cannibals or to go into the dome with cannibals first."

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,clickformore,9,Wed Sep 11 01:36:28 2013 UTC,"No not really, they clearly have a decent sized budget but they must have  blew the acting and writing budget on Dean Norris because the acting is weak and the script is bad, even compared to FOX/ABC dramas. The dialogue is 70% characters describing exactly what we can see is happening and the conclusions we've already drawn and 30% cliches. It didn't need nudity, gore or swears to be a better story.  ""How do I know you'll keep you word?""  ""You don't.""  Oh damn screenwriters that was intense"

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,mutatron,7,Tue Sep 10 19:36:56 2013 UTC,So the military knows about the egg/mini dome. Interesting...
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,icyomer,11,Wed Sep 11 01:57:54 2013 UTC,And about Barby. Why?
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,wandahickey,7,Sat Sep 14 18:45:21 2013 UTC,They said last episode that they saw him on the visitor's day footage.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,mutatron,2,Tue Sep 10 02:15:43 2013 UTC,"Yes, but what do they know about his ""expertise."" I know he's former military, so what else do they know about him?"

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Parrot132,5,Tue Sep 10 04:44:16 2013 UTC,I guess Junior is crazy but he's not stupid.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Yackemflaber,8,Tue Sep 10 04:52:34 2013 UTC,You could also figure that he was a little suspicious and the smell of her cigarette jog his memory about Barbie.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,angrycommie,5,Tue Sep 10 05:14:54 2013 UTC,What the fuck is barby thinking? He should've left the clinic!!
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,geoffffff,10,Tue Sep 10 13:03:04 2013 UTC,Apparently he didn't talk at all the whole drive to the police station.

UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,BoobsBehindTheBench,5,Tue Sep 10 03:03:17 2013 UTC,This show has been renewed for another season right? Guess we know Big Jim must survive since we need a villain.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Rider797,2,Tue Sep 10 03:10:59 2013 UTC,"He could die, and we get a new villain for season 2."
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Hy-phen,5,Tue Sep 10 03:12:38 2013 UTC,"True, but I can't see any of the other characters besides maybe Junior going off the edge like Big Jim has and even I think he is realizing what a terrible person his father is becoming. It's interesting to see him be so manipulative here after watching him on Breaking Bad."
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,Classic_Wingers,2,Tue Sep 10 03:04:15 2013 UTC,I see it now: Big Jim dies during the season finale.  Then Big Jim's estranged twin comes strolling out of the woods S2E1 after hiding out all season.
UnderTheDome,1m2gr7,NamedForTheLotion,2,Tue Sep 10 03:28:32 2013 UTC,Except there's a giant villain that they can use... The Dome.

It was a great match. I'm looking forward to tonight's episode. Sometimes, you just have to deal."

UnderTheDome,1m2qso,maybelying,1 point,Tue Sep 10 10:28:30 2013 UTC,Fox does this all the time.  I grew used to Fox pre-empting The Simpsons for sports when I was fucking eight.
UnderTheDome,1m2qso,spockywocky,3,Thu Sep 12 05:33:08 2013 UTC,"Considering how much they paid for the rights, and how much they were charging advertisers, there is no way they were going to cut it short.  I've never heard of any network cutting a major sporting event early just because of their prime time schedule.  Consider it a credit to under the dome that it was delayed, and not pre-empted, where you would then be joining the broadcast already in progress."
UnderTheDome,1m2qso,jared1981,-2,Tue Sep 10 03:18:31 2013 UTC,The big Bang Theory is just a repeat. IDK why they didn't just cut it so UTD could air on time.
UnderTheDome,1m2qso,AANDREAS,2,Tue Sep 10 03:22:09 2013 UTC,"Because they charge the advertisers based on the audience a show draws, not the time slot it airs in."

It is unusual for a series to screen in Germany when it isn't yet completed in the US, but it does make the syndication earnings more visible which hopefully will help the show."
UnderTheDome,1lqffj,Alice_Dee,1 point,Wed Sep 4 19:32:58 2013 UTC,A lot of TV shows are just a few episodes behind the original US version. I enjoy watching the original over the German version though. German voice acting is bad or the voice actor doesn't fit the role 95% of the time.

UnderTheDome,1lp3rk,frayuk,2,Tue Sep 10 15:42:35 2013 UTC,He's dead now though
UnderTheDome,1lp3rk,ChiefBigTits,3,Thu Sep 5 07:04:52 2013 UTC,That old man who owned the well? I think olie was his name.
UnderTheDome,1lp3rk,Thugnificent01,3,Tue Sep 10 17:20:22 2013 UTC,"How is Big Jim lawful evil? He doesn't live or act by the law, but warps it to conceal the truth. He is chaotic evil. Maxine is more of a neutral evil because the work she does is lawful to the town (keeping drugs out), but evil (submitting the town to illegal means in order to keep the drugs out). Lawful evil fits the dome because it shows that it cares but can be an absolute bitch when it doesn't get its way (tornado forming,etc.).  I also think Junior is in the perfect spot contrary to what other people here seem to believe.. he doesn't act evil completely, he just has a warped, chaotic sense of view that makes him think he is doing whats right. He constantly switches sides so that puts in him in a perfect spot on that chart."
UnderTheDome,1lp3rk,illskillz,2,Tue Sep 10 17:00:38 2013 UTC,"Some folks pointed out Junior did not seem evil, that's why I moved him to neutral. I'm glad you agree.  Your points about Jim are well put. I think he acts lawfully because the people of Chester's Mill perceive him as the source of law and order. He has to act within that persona and warp the law to achieve his evil goals. Example: organizing a search party to find Barby under false pretense.  The dome is ambiguous at best.  Maxine is dead. She didn't last long enough for me to put her on the chart. I hope she comes back!"

UnderTheDome,1loqqi,Death_Star_,5,Wed Sep 4 03:57:59 2013 UTC,I disagree. I thought about this as well. It just doesn't make sense if you understand guns. You would think where did the other 2 bullets go gee I wonder if those 2 bullets went into the 2 dead people.
UnderTheDome,1loqqi,hightiedye,5,Wed Sep 4 14:48:20 2013 UTC,"I'm with you, plus it wasn't really a hurricane in the dome, it was an event causes by the dome, which itself is supernatural.  The guns, as far as we know, behave normally and true to real life, so this is something that the worlds worst cop could have noticed of she wasn't the worlds worst cop"
UnderTheDome,1loqqi,Scapone22,2,Wed Sep 4 15:31:26 2013 UTC,"Not to mention they assumed it was sentient just BECAUSE. ""Hm, maybe being trapped under a dome causes really fucking weird weather patterns."" Nope, ""ITS ANGRY AT US!"""

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,handsomegiant,60,Tue Sep 3 02:44:16 2013 UTC,she is pretty stupid
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,nooneastern,23,Tue Sep 3 02:53:23 2013 UTC,"Yeah, Duke was hiding all that from her in that tiny little town."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,mutatron,6,Tue Sep 3 02:58:44 2013 UTC,"I read somewhere that the dome goes to 9 miles above the town, so that makes an 18 mile diameter, which covers kind of a big area. But the town itself is tiny. I think there's a little bit of mismatch between the dome size and the town. In Maine, where Chester's Mill is supposed to be, there are places that have as much as 18 miles between towns, but probably not in good farmland like that.  Filming is in Southport, North Carolina, which has 2.3 sq miles and 2,350 people."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,mutatron,4,Tue Sep 3 05:04:16 2013 UTC,"Chester's Mill is based on Bridgton Maine which borders a lake. It's not a big town, but the show is pretty accurate. I know this because my best friend has a summer home there and do does Stephen king."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,handsomegiant,3,Tue Sep 3 05:29:20 2013 UTC,There's no way the dome is that high though.  They have helicopters dying near the top in the wide shots.  SH60s typically don't operate above 13K feet due to oxygen mask restrictions.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,chodeface,2,Tue Sep 3 19:40:52 2013 UTC,"The map shows that Chester's Mill proper only makes up about a third or less of the dome coverage; the rest was farmland, presumably like Ollie's farm.  Of course, that sort of incorporated/unincorporated land distinction isn't typical in New England, but the writers know most viewers won't know that."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,romulusnr,2,Tue Sep 3 19:47:24 2013 UTC,"(I understand this is an old topic).  As has been pointed out, that map is a map of the town in the book...it should be clear by now that TV's Chester's Mill is much more urban in planning than this.  The book map is pretty inaccurate in itself, but is mostly fine.  But no way is the radio station that freaking close to everything.  According to this map, the radio station is just a few trees away from the hospital?  Nope.  Rural towns in New England are very spread out.  My town growing up was 25 square miles (Manhattan Island is about 32ish) with 3000 people, and all the houses are spread about mostly equally, with higher density near the center.  Stephen King wrote it accurately in the book in my opinion.  The map provided with the book just kind of squished all the important characters' houses in the center and pretended that was the whole town.    It should also be noted that the dome conformed to the town boundaries, and the town was shaped by a sock. not like a rectangle."

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,nooneastern,8,Tue Sep 3 12:36:49 2013 UTC,"Very easily, because Jim is one of the few men under the dome she looks up to."

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,wandahickey,4,Tue Sep 3 02:42:36 2013 UTC,"Lots of industrial equipment have external input for remote controllers (timing relays, temporary probes, etc.) - the phone was just providing a low-voltage signal that the control system recognized as a dead-man switch."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,peeinherbutt,2,Tue Sep 3 02:48:08 2013 UTC,Most industrial equipment works at e.g. 10V or 24V. Certainly none of them would work with an AC audio-level signal. Especially since that panel looked like the simplest control panel in the entire world (two buttons).

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,SutterCane,2,Tue Sep 3 05:01:48 2013 UTC,"There'll be no investigation now, but I'm saying if Barbi made his case Julia might have tested for residew which would at least prove his innocence."

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,shaktown,33,Thu Sep 5 01:57:55 2013 UTC,"But if she's not there, how are we going to know that the show is ultra-progressive?!"
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,__ADAM__,9,Wed Sep 4 02:33:45 2013 UTC,She's so ultra-progressive that she doesn't even need to be there! Good redditors will remember her.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,shiftingtech,7,Tue Sep 3 02:08:22 2013 UTC,Not even a mention by any character.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,andrewthemexican,5,Tue Sep 3 02:16:17 2013 UTC,i think Norrie mentions that she is upstairs grieving at some point
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,kuiperbelle,9,Tue Sep 3 03:00:20 2013 UTC,Like two episodes ago
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,nooneastern,3,Tue Sep 3 03:07:55 2013 UTC,"Yes, last week, but not this week. Unless it was a repeated mention I missed."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,wandahickey,5,Tue Sep 3 15:55:56 2013 UTC,i think we are just supposed to assume she is just sitting in the dark somewhere by herself being sad
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,Sanjispride,3,Tue Sep 3 12:30:56 2013 UTC,"I'm gonna laugh so hard if we don't see her again for the rest of the season. Two episodes left, and unless she has some type of epiphany, she won't bring much to the plot.  Maybe as a roadstop to keep Norrie from going out and affecting the dome."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,nooneastern,3,Tue Sep 3 21:04:46 2013 UTC,She's in the next one based on the preview
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,mutatron,3,Wed Sep 4 01:27:07 2013 UTC,I watched Star Trek: Into Darkness recently. I saw her there. Really. She was in the Enterprise. I felt bad not knowing her name so a quick Google gave me Aisha Hinds.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,nooneastern,2,Wed Sep 4 02:00:13 2013 UTC,She has a name.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,haakon,19,Wed Sep 4 02:06:38 2013 UTC,Points to the show for not treating a flat-line with paddles.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,kuiperbelle,8,Wed Sep 4 02:09:30 2013 UTC,What's the proper way to treat it? With a pen and a plastic bag?
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,handsomegiant,14,Tue Sep 3 19:43:52 2013 UTC,"Heh, I'm not a doctor, so I am not sure about air. I'm sure getting rid of the air would be a good first step. I'm not sure if Barbie did that correctly though.  In a lot of TV shows though, when someone goes flat-line, they bring out the paddles and shock them until they get a pulse again.  Defibrilators are specifically for De-fibrillating (fibrillating meaning flutter).  If the heart is beating out of its proper rhythm, they use that shock to sort of reset the rhythm and hopefully get it back to normal.  If there is no pulse though, trying to change the rhythm isn't going to do anything when there is no rhythm at all.  What they typically do in that case is to use CPR to try and restart it along with certain drugs that might help."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,lydocia,3,Thu Sep 5 18:06:57 2013 UTC,Interesting. Didn't realize that. Thanks for the thorough reply.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,littlexav,2,Wed Sep 4 04:19:13 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but this pressure release technique, I don't think it works by suck the air out. When pressure builds up, as soon as something hollow is put, it's released.. No medical experience. Have been seeing that around a couple of different shows before, House being one of those. I like to think House had a proper medical consultation process."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,LegendOfBen,2,Tue Sep 3 03:11:25 2013 UTC,"Unless the air pressure is in pockets, between muscles, etc. IANAD but it doesn't seem implausible."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,broncosfighton,44,Tue Sep 3 03:22:21 2013 UTC,When you all catch up...explain to me why outside the dome it is all green again and not dead from the bomb.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,maybelying,31,Tue Sep 3 03:31:29 2013 UTC,Because a MOAB wouldn't take out the entire outer circumference of the dome just one side.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,LegendOfBen,7,Tue Sep 3 03:38:47 2013 UTC,But I thought if it was so huge that it could?
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,romulusnr,15,Wed Sep 4 00:18:45 2013 UTC,"First off, a real MOAB isnt a missile, its just a bigger version of bombs dropped in WW2. Its really only capable of taking out a block or two, let alone a town. They made it seem like a mini-nuke in the show, but not even a nuke that small would be able to take out everything like that, the shockwaves (assuming an invincible wall) would bounce back leaving about a quarter of the domes outer edge damaged."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,haakon,5,Fri Sep 6 09:52:22 2013 UTC,Ohhhhh. The way they talked about it and then at the end of the episode everything around the dome looked charred and blackened made me think it did serious damage.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,efraglebagga,13,Tue Sep 3 02:39:07 2013 UTC,Only the western side got burned and blown up? Idk that's my thought
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,AANDREAS,5,Tue Sep 3 02:40:04 2013 UTC,"I also feel like there would be some evidence of the military moving back onto the perimeter.   (after the bomb didn't work)    I might be giving the show too much credit, but maybe NONE of the outside they are seeing in that scene is real?"
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,romulusnr,17,Tue Sep 3 03:16:40 2013 UTC,The whole Dome being active and responsive to the kids is making me think of the Island in LOST.

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,lydocia,11,Tue Sep 3 16:03:21 2013 UTC,I think it is because Junior decided to quit being the 4th hand.

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,Heavenfall,7,Wed Sep 4 01:54:38 2013 UTC,"Ah, ""vengeance shall be mine"" said the dome."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,JerseyBricklayer,4,Wed Sep 4 01:59:44 2013 UTC,I was thinking because Julia got shot and the twister would then suck up Maxine because it's pissed at her. But then I saw your comment and that sounds like the answer
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,gvsb,2,Tue Sep 3 02:18:45 2013 UTC,I think it's both.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,Dickton_Bungeye,2,Tue Sep 3 02:20:08 2013 UTC,Junior will obviously think it's because Angie admitted (begrudgingly) that she needed him.  EDIT: autocorrect
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,Classic_Wingers,15,Tue Sep 3 19:53:21 2013 UTC,Couldn't of barbie just show linda his ammo clip? If it's full he couldn't of shot those people. Jim's gun would of had 2 bullets missing.
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,wandahickey,16,Tue Sep 3 02:19:09 2013 UTC,Not really because he had Big Jim's gun in his hand
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,romulusnr,11,Tue Sep 3 02:21:10 2013 UTC,"No, he knocked it to the ground and pulled his own gun with his other hand.  I was thinking that same point at the time."

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,Jagxyz,3,Wed Sep 4 03:01:03 2013 UTC,"I kind of wish he didn't clock Linda and run. Seemed like a bad long term plan. He'd have a better chance if he hadn't run and had been put in jail and been able to talk his way out -- say after Julia wakes up, or Joe or someone else backs him up. Now he's The Fugitive and everyone in town is out looking for him. Great idea... not."

UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,dentwreckless,2,Fri Sep 6 09:50:47 2013 UTC,"Do you think the writers realized about five minutes after creating her that if they didn't kill her off, she would dominate the plot of the show and ruin it forever? Instead of Under The Dome it would be Constantly Trying To Defeat Maxine's Latest Depraved Profit Scheme.  edit. I'm trying to think of shows where this exact thing has happened. An unnaturally indefeatable character is introduced to the show to provide plot and motivation but rapidly becomes repetitive because all the show ever does anymore is to deal with or defeat all the constantly new pain and suffering they cause. I know I've seen it before. I recall USA's Dead Zone potentially going that way with the Satan-esque Malcolm Janus character, but then they (a bit too late) unceremoniously bumped him off in a house fire, and acted like he never existed. Anyway, that's kind of an obscure example."
UnderTheDome,1lm7dt,lydocia,9,Tue Sep 3 19:51:57 2013 UTC,I don't think Barbie likes the idea of being the monarch..

UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,nedthedragonslayer,3,Thu Aug 29 11:56:41 2013 UTC,I live in a small town and it has nearly 10k. You'd be surprised how many asshoels you can fit in a small area.
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,JimmyGBuckets21,2,Fri Aug 30 23:34:18 2013 UTC,But are they fight-club-do-whatever-some-woman-says kind of assholes?
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,Sanjispride,3,Fri Aug 30 23:40:17 2013 UTC,A good chunk of the people here do nothing but get high and hang out so if she had weed then yes without a doubt.
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,JimmyGBuckets21,3,Sat Aug 31 05:55:06 2013 UTC,"Indeed. Her introduction was sloppy as hell too.   ""How'd you get in?""  ""Oh, you know, I've been here all along, just waiting in a house with the tough guys waiting for the drama to unfold so we can come out and make a fight club."""
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,crackdan56,1 point,Thu Sep 12 05:42:06 2013 UTC,"I thought the same thing at first, but if the town has at least 500 people and maybe ~50 were at the fight club place, it's believable."

UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,nedthedragonslayer,8,Thu Aug 29 11:55:48 2013 UTC,"I also dislike her storyline. Maybe if she was introduced in the first episodes and acted weird and then hid away, then the story wouldn't appear so much like what it is:  A cheap ploy to delay the story and keep the show going longer than what it should be.  Her character sucks because it suggests that the writers will always have some new hidden bigwig that will appear from thin air when they want to slow down the story. Like in the middle of season two, ""Hey look! It's the secret secret partner in the drug ring that had been in the dome since day one but was in a tiny hole the entire time and no one noticed!"""

UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,SeverePsychosis,19,Fri Aug 30 03:25:59 2013 UTC,"Max showing up out of nowhere was the ""jumping the shark"" moment for me. The whole fascination with UTD was a very concretely limited cast. It was like they just ran out of ideas and had to write someone new in, coming up with a completely unbelievable story that she just hid in a house all this time. Essentially the dome might as well be gone and not play a role anymore if they're just going to introduce major new characters. And she seems omniscient, which is boring. Meh."
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,haakon,9,Wed Aug 28 18:07:07 2013 UTC,"While I agree with most of what you said, the premise of the show is that ""none of our secrets are safe"" under the dome. They need a wildcard to get things to happen, otherwise everyone would just sit around not telling each other shit about their past - why would they? So as stupid as it sounds, the show needs someone like Maxime to stir things up, otherwise the show won't ever have the kind of drama that they want.  Maxime should have been in the show from the start. Now she just ended up as a patently obvious deus ex machina."
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,Heavenfall,2,Wed Aug 28 18:57:26 2013 UTC,"Judging by what happened last week I don't think she's going to have much more story. Barbie chose to confess instead of give in to Maxine and Big Jim has his own stuff to deal with right now with Linda. And who knows if Agatha survived. How long can she keep her power, when she doesn't have either of those 2 helping her, and people's needs become bigger than the risk she poses? Bad storyline, but I think it's over if not close to it. Now we can get back to those pink stars."

Granted with 1000+ pages you shouldn't have to add in anything extra, but I like the idea.  The execution on the other hand - just seems a little cheesy that here comes this magic lady that controls everyone and everything - and somehow she had this ring going that none of the main characters knew about until a week or more later."
UnderTheDome,1l9rlu,EatingSteak,3,Fri Aug 30 18:40:10 2013 UTC,"I said it in another post and I'll say it here:   I feel like Max's existence can be attributed to the writers not wanting to make Big Jim the ""big evil bad guy"" of the show."

UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,NamedForTheLotion,5,Tue Aug 27 03:24:08 2013 UTC,"I feel like Max's existence can be attributed to the writers not wanting to make Big Jim the ""big evil bad guy"" of the show."
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,SecretDragoon,12,Tue Aug 27 02:27:01 2013 UTC,"I am giving this show one more. That is it.  An outline of the issues I had with this eps:  The woman that knows the secret is a very very poorly wrote character. Her dialog is lame, just everything about her is so out of left field. It is almost like she is from a different show.  The egg effects are really bad. The concept of the egg is gut wrenching, even the actors are almost rolling their eyes when the have to pretend effects are going on.  Jr is just a horrible character, he seems to have no motivation. His drive to kidnap and kill people seem to go away conveniently.  A case for the bad dialog: When the little boy says that is is a chrysalis not a cocoon, and everyone looks at him like he is retarded. And the girl gives him a look like, that is what she likes about him"". It is really really bad.  Why did the woman jump off the boat, then act surprised that he didnt save her?  The whole red-light district makes no sense, every day-player or rather extra is a robot. Watch the bit again, they just hand items back and forth, looks really odd.  The fight, wow....  Err.  Overall issues:  Loved the first episode but the writing is just god awful.   Any scenes with the teens are so myopic and forced. The little girl is annoying and acts 4 years younger than she is supposed to be. I dont really blame her, the actor, just the script. The boy is too stereotypical. The older sister, I dont care what happens to her, she has no redeeming qualities. The only thing the writers seem to give the characters for sympathy is crazy/dead/ parents.  Jr, err, it seems like he is doing a parody of Andy Samberg, not because they look a like just a silly person.  Barbie makes no moral justification. Let me guess he is a war hero with a past drinking problem. I will bet you money.  The red head is dumb as bricks.  Way too much makeup on the actors, the cuts and such look very fake. The clothing they wear make no sense in the environment they are in.  Big Jim handles well in the story Ill give it that. I do like Barbie, It seems that they have a different writer for him, but the story is still being wrote by , for me, seems someone rushing.   It is just terrible."
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,lydocia,5,Tue Aug 27 22:24:18 2013 UTC,"At this point the only storyline I can bother to pay attention to is the mini-dome, and it's surrounded by horrid ""teenage"" acting. I think I'm done."
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,Iamdarb,1 point,Sun Sep 1 15:39:39 2013 UTC,Someone else mentioned in regards to the boat - that she slipped off.  All of her lines were consistent with it being an accident.  I think they just did some really bad producing on that scene.
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,NamedForTheLotion,5,Wed Aug 28 12:55:54 2013 UTC,"Stephen King's work doesn't always lend itself well to on-screen adaptation.  He tends to rely heavily on internal dialogue with his characters, which is hard to translate to the screen.  That, however, doesn't even begin to forgive some of the tripe that has been created bearing the names of his stories.  Lawnmower Man and Running Man, for instance, bore absolutely no relation to the actual stories, they basically just licensed Stephen King's name.  Some stuff does translate well.  Shawshank did well because the story was narrated, and that makes adaptation easier.  Ditto for Stand By Me, which was narrated and relied heavily on interaction between the characters.  Creepshow, I think, was intended to be campy from the beginning.  Other stuff translates ok.  The Shining was a great movie, but still left out much of the impact of the novel and left you without much of an understanding of the back story.  Same for Carrie.  Interestingly, both were done by top notch directors, which probably helps.  I think The Stand is probably the best standard to hold Under the Dome to.  The Stand is my favorite King novel, so I was apprehensive about the adaptation.  I think they did an ok job.  They kept as true to the novel as they could, but there is quite a bit to the story that just can't translate to the screen.  I get the impression that they may have had the best of intentions in the beginning to make a mini series somewhat faithful to Under the Dome, but then executives got involved and decided that they had a possible Lost 2.0 on their hands.  Except it's not.  Every episode feels like it was written by someone that hadn't read any of the previous episode scripts, and has a vague idea of what the theme is about.  The main reason I keep watching is Rachel Lefevre.  Not her character, just her.  If they kill her off, I'm done."
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,Iamdarb,2,Tue Aug 27 18:20:55 2013 UTC,"You know what an EP does, right?  Hint: sits back and rakes in the cash."
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,Peetrius,1 point,Tue Aug 27 19:37:41 2013 UTC,"Oops, I'm not the commenter you were replying to. I agree that is what he was implying though. And I'm not sure it's inaccurate. On many productions, the EP (or some subset of the many EPs) is responsible for acquiring financing. Here, I'm sure, like Jerry Bruckheimer, the role involves little more than checking his mailbox for a check every month. For instance, he said he was excited when the writers told him their new source/backstory for the dome, not that he let them change it or that he approved it or that he helped them come up with it.   It's all reading between the lines though since obviously none of us are on set or in the writers' room."
UnderTheDome,1l5ixo,lydocia,3,Fri Aug 30 18:46:44 2013 UTC,"I am the commenter in question, and yes, you are correct about my implication.  Stephen King isn't really one to let principles get in the way of a pay check.  Not that there is anything wrong with it, hell, I'd take the wheelbarrows full of money myself.  My point was that the writing feels disjointed.  One episode is about the lack of water and how rain is going to save them.  Then another episode ignores the fact that it rains and splits the town into a civil war over somebody's well but it's ok because they blew up the well and so everybody goes home and forgets about.  Then fight club.  I mean, WTF?  They don't even seem to be trying to a complex interwoven story, they just seem to be creating filler to drag out the story arc about the kids and the dome itself.  The fact that King is somehow trying to justify the mangling of his story doesn't change that.  Although I will give him credit for having the good sense to sue in order to get his name taken off the credits for Lawnmower Man."

No doubt Stephen King has a soft spot for the printed page, seeing as how it's been his bread and butter, but newspapers are seriously anachronistic. Even for small town papers.  Even if Julia did get a paper published, how would it get distributed? Broadcast is much more efficient and takes up much less time to generate content for."

UnderTheDome,1ktj3u,Death_Star_,6,Wed Aug 21 23:41:27 2013 UTC,Watch last week's episode during the shootout.  She skidaddles across the water property like she's in high heels and manages to one-shot-kill a guy in a process without really aiming.  It made me cringe.

And now the audience is expected to pull a complete 180 on Junior's character and start trusting him just because his mom had a dream.

In the book he was truly an innocent character but I have no remorse for him in the show now that he was involved in the meth trade.   I hated Angie in the beginning because she was stupid for not doing things differently with Junior trapping her, she should have been more discreet about stabbing him and when she realized he thought she was getting better she should have just played up so he thought she wasn't ""sick"" anymore.

I've enjoyed them all, really, despite the low reviews I've been seeing (such as the really poor reviews for e03). I don't see it as absolutely vital watching, but it's a great way to kill an hour and for someone who hasn't read the books, there's actually a good layer of intrigue running through it as to what the egg may be.   The acting could definitely use some work though, and some of the plot threads seem a little forced. The introduction of this new woman seemed very sudden and forced, and I was expecting a whole lot more tension from that scene between Jim, Barbie and the grieving guy not willing to give his guns up. It felt like it was building up to something big, and that was actually a few tense moments when you first saw the grenade, but within ten seconds he'd pulled the pin, grabbed it off him, stuck the pin back in, and then it quickly cut to him being led out of his house. That's it? Story over? Fair enough...  I'm looking forward to seeing how it'll pan out. I can't say I'm too excited about the goings on in the town compared to what will happen with the mini dome and the egg (especially now that Angie is involved with it (ey gurl)). Hopefully the season doesn't end just as the mini dome vanishes and the egg begins to open though. It'll feel like the ending to the first season of Lost all over again."

The only thing that has interested me in weeks was the progression of information about the dome. As it seems, anything involving anyone else but the ""main 3"" (or I guess 4, but we don't yet know who that is) is just pointless filler.    I really think the writers just made up the plot, episode by episode. Nothing makes any sense. ""Oh, we made some new drug that no one else but 2 of the main non-dome related characters know about, and everyone is involved. Also, some woman is now here and will now allow for an additional, nonsensical plot point that leads to nothing that actually matters.""    I really hope the writers were in 3 different countries, spoke different languages, and only made contact through email, or else I'm going to be really disappointed. You can't just make plot points when you feel like its necessary.   The acting is absolutely awful.    I don't know how this show aired."
UnderTheDome,1kp1sf,mutatron,4,Tue Aug 20 21:19:32 2013 UTC,"To be fair the drugs are the answer to many things that we didn't know about. The crazy preacher, Hank's stash of propane, Duke's presence, how Barbie is connected to all of this, and so on."
UnderTheDome,1kp1sf,TechnoAllah,3,Tue Aug 20 12:22:00 2013 UTC,"The drugs are...crazy. This town (and the involved) suddenly made some new drug that requires huge amounts of propane as the main ingredient? They had to have been making this stuff for a long time, given the amount of propane that was stockpiled. Therefor they would need a client base in order to make a profit off of the drug. But...no one has heard of this ""Rapture"" drug that the preacher was making and selling to people in the town? Not only that, new drugs aren't exactly ""made."" I would have preferred they used an actual drug, and not one that conveniently gives the town a huge amount of propane to use when a disaster occurs. A huge, 1 km2 area in the ground under the city with a meth cook the size of the Pentagon requiring the propane would be more believable.    The way that Barbie is connected to this also doesn't make sense. Suddenly, a new character appears that 2 of the main characters know, and that gives Barbie's character a bit more of a background? I know how this is going to play out. In the next episode, there are going to be 5 scenes with Max threatening to tell people Barbie's secrets, while at the same time giving the audience a convenient, quick background. Not my idea of a great development in character story."
UnderTheDome,1kp1sf,mwagner26,5,Tue Aug 20 22:22:28 2013 UTC,"My guess is Jim seems smart enough not to shit where he eats. They wouldn't sell Rapture in their own town, at least on large scale. I think the preacher became a loose end and started selling within the town a little. As for Barbie here's what I was able to patch together:   Barbie was in the military After he got out he couldn't find work and went to bars At one of these bars Max sees his build and thinks she has use for him, so she buys him a drink He becomes an enforcer for the drug operation Kills Julia's husband when he fought back   That's all I can gather from his past."

UnderTheDome,1kpt7f,Phalt,6,Tue Aug 20 08:50:11 2013 UTC,"The Fourth Hand, or ""key"" for the mini-dome, is Barbie's. The foreshadowing in the first episode was the bloody hand he placed on the dome.

Or do you think he did that so once he killed Ollie he could prove to his dad that he is not a loser..? Either way it is compelling. I also think Norrie needs to stop being a little bitch.
UnderTheDome,1kdlxa,chrisncsu,11,Wed Aug 14 22:13:53 2013 UTC,"I personally don't think there is any way that Junior joined Ollie with any intention of turning on him, but was swayed after the events that took place.  He just said what he did to make himself look better.  And I don't see how Norrie is acting wrong in anyway.  She's been an average teen and good to Joe virtually the whole time, and reacted to her moms passing in a pretty standard way, showing a range of emotions and needing to come to terms in her own way.  She was fine and apologized at the end."

UnderTheDome,1kc0gj,Florist_Gump,7,Wed Aug 14 11:21:10 2013 UTC,"I agree with you.  She is...of course...mourning, and is a hormonal teenager, and is pretty much experiencing a SHIT-TON of stress.  OP is an ass for blaming the character for being inconsistent on these things...of course she would be.  Her mother just DIED.  That said, she shouldn't have to accept that all this was her fault.  Was it her fault her family had to drive her three thousand miles to attend a bad-girls school?  Yes.  She should feel guilt for that, or should've before the dome fell.  Was it her fault that her family was locked in the dome, and her mother died?  Of fucking course not.  It is NOT her fault her mother died, by any stretch of the imagination.  She's not psychic; she had no idea touching that egg was going to do anything (and we don't even know if touching it caused her mother's death, instead of just foreshadowing it)."

UnderTheDome,1ka959,superjavy,8,Wed Aug 14 09:35:49 2013 UTC,"Well, it's because almost nobody thinks the show is good. It's that simple. I think it can safely be said that it's an objectively awful show, but there's a lot of people who loved the novel - and even more people with not much else to do on a Monday evening - that would rather watch the show and laugh about how absolutely terrible it is than just pretend it doesn't exist and ignore the fact that somebody spent millions mangling and butchering a very succesful book.  I, for one, don't get your logic of ""don't like something? Then you must never say so, just leave!"" which always floods every piece of criticsm that gets posted on the internet. The first step towards improvement is criticsm, and I rather doubt this show would improve if, as you want, everybody who dislikes it just shuts up about it. This is a community about a TV show, and if an overwhelming majority of the people who decided to wach it think it sucked, that'll set the tone of the discussions. If most people thought it was good, it'd look more like the Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones forums where people talk about how great it is.  I mean, the alternative is clearly that nobody must talk about this show at all. I've visited quite a few forums and the atmosphere is the same in all of them: Under the Dome is hilariously bad TV, but it can be mildly entertaining to watch bad TV and then share a laugh over how bad it was. If you're in the clearly very small minority who actually likes this show, do you really reserve the right to tell the vast majority that they mustn't talk about it simply because they disagree with you? Is that a resonable stance?  People talk about circlejerks, but there's never a worse circlejerk than when people like something and go berserk whenever someone disagrees."
UnderTheDome,1ka959,EdgarFrogandSam,4,Wed Aug 14 14:42:59 2013 UTC,"Especially with Breaking Bad coming out, I think many of us are realizing how bad the show actually is compared to what a good show can be."
UnderTheDome,1ka959,hero0fwar,2,Fri Aug 16 15:41:53 2013 UTC,"It's especially because the shittiness doesn't stem from the obvious difference in budget between this show and shows like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones. If people were criticising Under the Dome's visual effects, sound score or set quality, it'd be reasonable to point out that it's network TV on a Monday (as its small group of fans nevertheless keep doing).   That's not what's wrong with this show, though. What's wrong is that the writers are hilariously inept at telling a story, writing dialogue and believable characters, and making a series of episodes that interconnect instead of having it so each one stops mattering the moment it ends. That's not an issue of budget, so it's absolutely fair to compare this show to any other."

UnderTheDome,1ka959,CrankedCat,5,Tue Aug 13 20:20:12 2013 UTC,"At first I thought this would be the next Lost, but then I started re-watching Lost and realize there's absolutely no comparison. Lost gave you stereotypical characters from diverse backgrounds, and then showed you their actual character through flashbacks that typically completely altered your perception of the character, or at the very least made them more interesting.  Ex: Charlie looks like your average stoned rocker, but it turns out he hated the partying lifestyle he had and his brother dragged him into drugs, Jin and Sun's marriage was on the rocks, Kate was a criminal, John was a looser, Hurley was a millionaire etc. None of them were what they appeared.  In UTD just about everyone is exactly who they appear to be. I watch it for the same reason I watch The Walking Dead; the concept is intriguing enough to keep me hoping eventually it will get better."
UnderTheDome,1ka959,EdgarFrogandSam,2,Tue Aug 13 16:12:19 2013 UTC,"In other words, it's carried entirely by the story's premise, which is Stephen King's and not the writers of this TV show. Everything they've changed is a detriment while the few good things about UTD are where you can still see the influence of the novel's author. I wouldn't want to know what abomination of a show would be concocted by these guys if they had to come up with the whole thing themselves."

UnderTheDome,1k8n4m,irrational_abbztract,4,Tue Aug 13 02:48:30 2013 UTC,I didnt!! But how is she crowned?
UnderTheDome,1k8n4m,D4RKL1GHT,7,Tue Aug 13 03:16:40 2013 UTC,"Well one of the later comments says its not a monarch but for the sake of discussion, lets assume they just screwed up the tattoo.    The crowning could be her ascension to power (I'd assume through her control over Big Jim) or the crown is another term for the top of the head, I believe. To crown=to hit someone on top of the head?  EDIT: the commenter who said it wasn't a monarch has had been corrected.  No solid evidence but there's no reason for them to put so much attention on the tattoo for no reason."
UnderTheDome,1k8n4m,Heavenfall,1 point,Tue Aug 13 03:28:51 2013 UTC,"I think that while your idea that the phrase is hinting at Angie's accession to power, I have to say that there seems to be another entwined event that will take place.  If you remember the episode where the dome was covered in butterflies, the butterfly seen at the start of episode 8 is the same as Angie's tattoo which in turn is the same as the butterflies which covered the dome. I don't think that's a coincidence.  I think what is being suggested is that the butterflies are being attracted to the dome. Maybe this is suggesting that the egg is causing something to happen even in its current form. Something similar to the magnetic field disruption that led to the MOAB attempt?  Also, the monarch butterflies are seen in many regions across the world. I think this, while it may be an unsubstantiated and vague assumption, could suggest that the dome may get stronger and ""spread"" (get larger or maybe widespread consequences?).   OR it maybe just hints at Angie's increasing influence.  Either way, I can't wait to see what happens in the next episode."
UnderTheDome,1k8n4m,Doxep,3,Tue Aug 13 03:36:47 2013 UTC,"Well monarch butterflys have a dominant alpha monarch that reins supreme in the butterfly kingdom. It must be a reference to the monarch monarch. The monarch monarch despises being talked about and portrayed in media. The monarch monarch is outraged by this and may start world war 3. Adolf hitler was one of these monarch monarchs, the real reason behind the holocaust is that jews are actually moths, which the butterflys wanted to exterminate. World war one was triggered by a moth assassin killing a lesser monarch monarch, franz ferdinand. Source? Im a historian biologist."

Angie being in somewhat of a position of power really makes things more interesting, and I like it. I really noticed that during this episode. However, I would have never guessed that she would be a ""monarch"", or anything to do with the dome for that matter.  Maybe the reason that Joe seems to have something to do with the dome is because he is the ""monarch's"" brother? Probably not, but just a theory."

Everyone was way too quick to up arms and start fighting, they are people shooting people, I can't see anyone entering into that lightly (even though it's set in 'MURICA).  Also the farmers who also wanted the water for crops, if the whole town is starving then they will just steal the food...or it will all be taken into a central food bank and rationed, therefore they should have just told Big Jim's nemesis to bog off.  Everyone suddenly shooting left, right and centre just didn't sit well with me for the small town it's supposed to be."

UnderTheDome,1jzjds,Cdresden,16,Thu Aug 8 22:19:47 2013 UTC,"The show has an interesting concept, but a pretty lacklustre execution.  Mainly for me it's the writing, which has been pretty lazy in a lot of spots.  Angie's whole journey for the first half of the season was just annoying, lacked tension and then the 'resolution' was as arbitrary and random as Junior's whole insane plan was to begin with.  Each episode has a simple crisis to resolution cycle that spans only one episode, and each one is just a variation on the same old theme.  The mysteries around the Dome are potentially interesting, but nobody in town cares, everyone is just bumbling along from crisis to crisis.  Epidemic, fire, water shortage, fugutive, birth and so on.  There's way less of a sense of an overarching narrative going on here, even though the obvious one of a Lord of the Flies drift from civilization is unfolding in the background, it's hardly articulated.  Still watching, but it's getting harder to justify coming back to this show."
UnderTheDome,1jzjds,Autobrot,7,Fri Aug 9 11:37:06 2013 UTC,They seem to me like episodes of 'Eureka' just with a slightly different sort of strange town. The sheriff especially seems like a carbon copy of Jo.

I can't tell yet whether they simply watered them down or are delaying the real antagonisticness(?) until even later episodes, but whatever the case, it's making for a very dreary show that can't hold a candle to the novel. Coupled with the predictable and formulaic one-episode crisis recipe, it's just hard pressed to impress anyone. Add a sprinkle of irritating characters with constantly barely-believable behaviour and you've got the full package of an underwhelming, half-assed product."

UnderTheDome,1jzjds,wandahickey,3,Wed Aug 14 00:58:21 2013 UTC,I think that because Stephen King's storytelling is so descriptive and detailed that it is always a struggle to bring it to film unless they write the screenplay almost verbatim.  It is hard to take these long and involved novels and shorten them to fit into a movie or mini-series format without cutting scenes and characters that are important.  Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me were a couple that succeeded because they were adapted from short stories and were pretty straight and to the point.  They also kept a majority of the scenes and dialogue intact.  I also feel that his writing is also so descriptive that what you create in your mind as you read can never live up to the expectations of what you see on the screen.

When I found out it would be on CBS, however, my reaction was okay.   It's a terrible network for such a violent, rapey story! It's also a terrible time slot. So the writing is terrible because it has to be more family-friendly, and therefore the whole fucking story is neutered. It's not awesome."
UnderTheDome,1jzjds,Jakabov,9,Wed Aug 14 20:33:16 2013 UTC,"Very poor writing. Like, extremely amateurish and cringeworthy. The premise is great because it's Stephen King's, even though they took rather extreme liberties with the actual story in making this show. The parts that are good are the parts that still remain his while everything bad about it is what they changed. It'll be hard for the producers to take any credit for whatever moderate success this show enjoys. The only thing that saves it is the fact that there's still a little bit of the author's brushstrokes left.  They've basically mangled a good story, but the original story was good enough that it's still acceptable after this hamfisted butchery and thus not a complete failure. The show is carried entirely by the fact that the premise of a town trapped under a dome is so interesting that you can do almost anything with it and do well, but the writers are so bad that they've taken a fantatic premise and made a very average, unsatisfying product out of it.  I was interested at first, and then after realizing it was awful, I decided I just wanted to see the new ending they'd come up with because it was the most contested part of the novel. Now that they've decided to drag the story out into several seasons, I'm not even going to bother."
UnderTheDome,1jzjds,ttmlkr,2,Fri Aug 9 11:44:52 2013 UTC,"After I started watching subscription based tv like Game of thrones, The Tudors, Boardwalk empire, etc. its been so hard for me to find any good television on cable tv. There are a few exceptions like breaking bad, but for each exception there are 20 other shows that I just cant stand.   It always comes down to what you described. The writing is always awful. It seems like these shows are constantly trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. They drag out dialog, and explain everything like they feel people are incapable of filling in the blanks."

I don't know what it is but I feel every performance is weak and never feels right.  I guess the only reason I watch it is to see what happens in the end, what is the dome, what caused it etc. I hate the acting and writing a lot of the time.

UnderTheDome,1jryb1,dentwreckless,1 point,Sun Aug 11 09:27:06 2013 UTC,Also inside the inner dome there is just the black egg. There seems to just be dirt otherwise. That would suggest it didn't come down from above.

UnderTheDome,1jryb1,dentwreckless,2,Sun Aug 11 20:13:28 2013 UTC,I'd like to respond do your complaints. Not telling anyone about the epicenter: Why would they tell anyone about the epicenter? I sure wouldn't. I wouldn't trust anyone with that knowledge.   Blowing up the propane: It didn't seem like he blew it ALL up. Just whatever was loaded into that car. I got the sense there was  A LOT of propane still.  Insulin: Yeah I don't get what the fuck that was about unless most of it was stolen?  Baby name: If she didn't have a name ready she most likely felt like the woman that just safely delivered her baby was worthy to name her child after.
UnderTheDome,1jryb1,terriblehuman,4,Wed Aug 7 06:12:49 2013 UTC,"Why would they tell anyone about the epicenter? I sure wouldn't. I wouldn't trust anyone with that knowledge.   I totally agree. Plus, they know that they are somehow connected to it all. I wouldn't trust anyone else either. Maybe the moms but then again one of them was dying so they really didn't have time to do it either. Maybe they will tell someone in the next episode.    Blowing up the propane: It didn't seem like he blew it ALL up. Just whatever was loaded into that car. I got the sense there was A LOT of propane still.   Yeah he didn't blow up all the propane, just what was in the truck. I think his reason was that he wanted it to look like an accident the same way it looked like an accident when he killed the reverend.    Insulin: Yeah I don't get what the fuck that was about unless most of it was stolen?   I think they mentioned in the previous episode that all the insulin was stolen by the reverend which is why Norrie and Joe tried to break in to houses were people with diabetes lived. Which means that unless someone else were willing to die by giving up their insulin there was nothing they could do about that really. They were going to run out no matter what. It was just a matter of time.    Baby name: If she didn't have a name ready she most likely felt like the woman that just safely delivered her baby was worthy to name her child after.   I know a lot of people who have chosen a name only to change it after they had the child cause it didn't fit. Or maybe she just had not come up with one yet. I don't see anything weird about it either."
UnderTheDome,1jryb1,littlexav,1 point,Wed Aug 7 12:13:43 2013 UTC,"I must admit i fail to follow your logic behind these questions.  ""Oh, we found the epicenter and its super cool but let's not tell anyone about it and cover it back up too. Tell the journalist? Or the techie girl? Nahhh.""  Of Course not why would they share it with somebody they don't trust?Joe told Carolyn that they couldn't share it with anybody yet and she agreed. Julia and Dodee all so agreed not to share their secret because it could endanger them.  ""The farmer stole my propane so I'm gonna blow it all up so no one can have it even if the town might need it later.""  First i think he wanted to take revenge which usually blind peoples logic and further more he had been drinking whisky through the whole episode and when he shoot the cars propane tank you see him standing with an empty bottle which would also impair his logical thinking.  ""Only doctor in town needs insulin? None for her, sorry. BTW clinics closed too.""  I'm glad they chose to it ""quick"" instead of us have to watch four more episode with her laying in bed, and just sort of being a filler for the episodes. Besides Joe and Carolyn had already searched for more insulin.  ""Been in labor 8 months and had the ultrasound but don't have a baby name prepared, I'll just go with the doctor's name.""

""The farmer stole my propane so I'm gonna blow it all up so no one can have it even if the town might need it later.""   He was drunk, and it seemed to be more about power to him.

""Been in labor 8 months and had the ultrasound but don't have a baby name prepared, I'll just go with the doctor's name.""

Then my insights (NOT IN EXACT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER)   More flirting and joe finally getting a make out session!  (The flirting of joe and forehead queens getting really sexual now.) Dome hallucinations confirmed, The pregnant neighbor sees her husband and touchs the dome!  (Personally, where the fuck has she been this last week? I'm totally fine with introducing her as a character, but what the fuck. Everyone's seems to know the rules of this dome except her.) OH SNAP TOUCHING THE DOME MADE HER BABY ARRIVE A MONTH EARLY, Thank god this car hasn't been raided yet! Barb left for town, leaving gingerqueen to take her to Alice the lesbian doctor since apparently the clinics closed.(Perhaps the dome makes people age a month? also why is the clinic closed?)   4.Junior gets kicked out of his house, Angie leaves to the diner.  (Fuck junior, First episode where Angie gets a god damn break.)   Big joe gets extorted by the farmer. (All I can say, bad idea.)   6.Angie buries rose with radical Asian kid. (Rose was deffinetly the ""Angie"" of this episode :/ R.I.P)  7.Street robbery! Roses murderers robs the car as their on the run then escapes barb to their hideout! (POW POW!)   The dynamic tween duo head to the middle of the dome to find ANOTHER DOME WOAH RADICAL. Where they see a black egg in the middle. (Power source?) They touch the dome and see Alice in the forest, another Halleucination. (Maybe the Halleucinations represent death?) They finally walked the pregnant neighbor to the house and start taking care of her! Alice starts delivering the baby but her loss of insulin shows. (Personally, I think all the Insulin should have been donated to the one of the only doctors left.)   11.Roses murderers are killed! (Juniors has killed now.)  12.Jim kills the farmers propane stealing bodyguard.(nobody fucks with big Jim.)   The baby's delivered and is named Alice(2), Alice(1) has a heart attack. The teen duo arrive home, forehead runs upstairs to her mothers. ANGIE AND JOE FINALLY REUNITE. Alice(1) Dies in a really sad death. TRYING TO MAKE DEALS WITH THE DOME HAVE FAILED.

I have to agree that the insertion of the surface pro feels incredibly forced, while the Apple products on Ray Donovan feel very natural. Apple products being a sign of wealth, definitely. I would buy one if I could afford one. I'm even considering buying myself a MBP and iPad Mini if I get the money I'm expecting. Been wanting a tablet for ages, and I'm looking for a laptop or comp that will last me a few years."
UnderTheDome,1jlgef,rskoopa,1 point,Sat Aug 3 01:06:10 2013 UTC,"Good luck to you! If you do want to get an Apple product, wait until September at the very least. That's when they will announce all of their new products, and the existing products will significantly drop in price."
UnderTheDome,1jlgef,sowx,1 point,Sat Aug 3 01:24:31 2013 UTC,"Sounds good. How big of a price drop are we talking? I've never owned an iPhone or anything, so I don't know. I prefer everything I buy brand new, honestly, but I was looking at refurbished."
UnderTheDome,1jlgef,mrshamino,2,Sat Aug 3 01:40:35 2013 UTC,"If you want an iPhone, then wait. Apple is pretty predictable when it comes to releasing products. I've owned 5 iPhones, so I have the routine down very well. They release everything in 1 year cycles. They released the iPhone 5 last September, and the 4S the September before that. Whenever a new iPhone comes out, the older one that it is replacing becomes free with a contract,vs having to pay the upfront fee for it. So the price basically drops $300-$400 depending on which iPhone you are getting. If you want the brand new, state of the art one, then wait until September, and just get the new iphone when it's released, if you don't care if it's the most recent one, then wait until September, then get the iPhone 5 for free with a contract. Same goes with most other Apple products, a new version comes out every year, and the older version drops in price."
UnderTheDome,1jlgef,MarkHawkCam,1 point,Sat Aug 3 02:03:40 2013 UTC,"This used to be the case, but be careful though, things might be a little different this time around.   With the release of the 5, we saw the iphone 4 drop to being free with contract, the 4s being 100 with contract, and the 5 being 200 with contract. If they are following this pattern, then the 5 should drop down to 100. However, the 4s most likely will not be continued, and be replaced with their new low-priced iphone (unnamed yet, but most likely happening?). So their probably won't be a free high-priced one this time around."
UnderTheDome,1jlgef,WarmakerT,-1,Sat Aug 3 04:07:57 2013 UTC,I think you guys are overthinking this. The props guys and production assistants in Hollywood are gonna buy something they want to use. That's how you end up with MacBooks.
UnderTheDome,1jlgef,motchmaster,0,Tue Aug 6 14:14:13 2013 UTC,It used to be that Microsoft's license didn't allow you to film the operating system in TV and movies without their consent.   I think these days its just because that's what different directors already learned once so they continue to use apple products as the safer bet without looking up a bunch of legal garbage. They just want to create. Also most writing and journalism is done on Apple computers. So it makes sense that the people writing and creating these shows would place apple products.

UnderTheDome,1jkp4k,mrkrabz1991,6,Fri Aug 2 19:12:33 2013 UTC,Angie's brother is already doing that. I think his name is Joe. They showed him marking points with a map earlier in the season. He said that the dome has a 10 mile radius.
UnderTheDome,1jkp4k,j_tracy,2,Sat Aug 3 00:56:59 2013 UTC,"I would do the same. In fact, Big Jim has a map of the area in his office. In the last episode he used it to point out Ollie's well. The dome cuts the edge of a bridge, curves around the back of Duke's house, the front of Julia's house and the big red barn where Barbie's car crashed. Those points are specific enough to plot on a map and at the very least estimate a rough circle."

UnderTheDome,1jkp4k,paalmsread,3,Fri Aug 2 19:23:37 2013 UTC,"The following is assuming, that you can somehow walk in a straight line (maybe by compass?) and measure 90° angles. You can use the theorem of thales (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27_theorem). So put a 90° angle on the dome, follow the ends and mark the spots where they hit the dome again. now connect them and you have a diameter. do that twice and you have two diameters. The crossing of the diameters marks the center of the circular cross-section.    There are probably easier ways, but that's how i would do it. It's alot of work to pull of alone, but get a couple of people and it could be done in a reasonable time. Then again, get a map, draw the dome and find the center on there."

My robotics/shop teacher told me a handy trick for finding the center of circles.  I still use it today:   Draw a chord across the circle.  It can be any chord. Measure the chord to find its midpoint. At the midpoint, draw a line perpendicular to the chord.  This line will pass through the center of the circle! Next, draw a second chord, find its midpoint, and draw a perpendicular line from there.   Both of the perpendicular lines will intersect at the circle's center!  But how would this scale?  You'd need surveying equipment and the ability to measure long distances.  How accurately could you mark a perpendicular path?  Anyways, there's probably some crazy sh*t going down at the center.  So I'd want to find out where that was."
UnderTheDome,1jkp4k,anonynamja,3,Fri Aug 2 17:18:18 2013 UTC,"You're way over thinking it lol. You're also assuming you already know where the dome ends.  Just walk along the edge of the dome with a map of the town. Put a dot on any landmark that the dome passes through. At the end, you should have a bunch of dots on a map that are in a circle. Get a ruler, and draw 2 lines across the circle both perpendicular to each other. There's your center."

Sure, some of the characters stumble upon the dome's secrets every now and again, but most of them are just deer in headlights most of the time.  Everyone is reactive, and no one is proactive.  There's no John Locke from LOST or Milton from the Walking Dead.  John Locke showed no fear as he walked the island in search of truths.  And Milton, while somewhat spineless, performed experiments to gain insight into the nature of the biters.  Back to this show:  I originally thought the redhead was going to take on this role, but she kind of bounces from one mystery to the next.  Then I thought the boy was going to fill this role but he's distracted by the girl and having seizures...

So if the missile hits the north side, the south side should remain largely unaffected. Not sure how realistic this is though."
UnderTheDome,1jkfhz,mrkrabz1991,3,Fri Aug 2 15:14:58 2013 UTC,"Mine did the same.  We were watching and I even rewound it to look again.  Crazy.  I do not think it is realistic, as a missile would demolish a ton of stuff, but maybe not in this case."
UnderTheDome,1jkfhz,j_tracy,2,Fri Aug 2 15:27:19 2013 UTC,"If you want to talk about accuracy and realism. The missile they used isn't even a missile in real life. Barbie stated that it was a ""MOAB"", which is a real thing, but it isn't a missile. It's a bomb that has to be dropped from a bomber. Also, it would do absolutely nothing to the dome. It's meant to take out troops, not hardened structures. So I don't know what the show was thinking, but maybe they just thought it sounded cool, rather than focusing on realism and accuracy. Also, someone said in the show that the dome is about 10 miles wide. A MOAB in real life only explodes a few hundred feet, so it would only destroy a small area outside of the dome. Stupid producers and writers. Sigh"

UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,spockywocky,16,Tue Jul 30 16:14:30 2013 UTC,She could have decimated the other guys nuts and his nuts and eyes. I wish we'd get a female character willing to get her hands dirty.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Wheatiez,18,Tue Jul 30 02:32:02 2013 UTC,"It's CBS, you can't expect that much."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Shit_The_Fuck_Yeah,4,Tue Jul 30 02:35:38 2013 UTC,Except for Kate to be a bitch.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,wandahickey,1 point,Tue Jul 30 03:04:31 2013 UTC,"Wait, what now?"
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,remscheld,4,Wed Jul 31 13:31:12 2013 UTC,I was referring to the scene when the two guys came into the restaurant and killed the owner.  Angie jumped on the back of the guy and was hitting and kicking him and she had her hands on his face.  She should have dug her finger's into his eyes while she had the chance to try and save herself. Instead she got knocked out and almost raped.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,28wiseman,63,Sat Aug 3 06:16:57 2013 UTC,An appliance delivery truck? Seeiously - did someone order a new refrigerator while the town's under the dome?
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,spockywocky,12,Sat Aug 3 13:56:12 2013 UTC,"Yeah, and apparently it can only turn in one direction."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,mutatron,7,Tue Jul 30 02:07:43 2013 UTC,My driver's manual told me trucks cannot brake/change direction that fast. :/
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Yackemflaber,22,Tue Jul 30 02:08:45 2013 UTC,"That's what I came here to talk about! And where the heck was he going in such a hurry? Is there even enough room under the dome for a delivery truck to build up a head of speed like that? Not only that, but there was a heck of a lot of traffic going on behind that scene in the first place."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,klusark,25,Tue Jul 30 02:09:45 2013 UTC,I was wondering why everybody isn't riding bikes to save fuel yet.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Death_Star_,6,Tue Jul 30 02:10:55 2013 UTC,"They might not have enough bikes in the town. Although, I don't think I've even seen one bike..."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,wandahickey,6,Tue Jul 30 13:04:55 2013 UTC,"Seriously.... if people are still driving, there's going to be some major greenhouse effect going on."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,jmarquiso,5,Tue Jul 30 15:52:15 2013 UTC,"Because, screw the environment even when living in a biosphere.  I wonder if that rain is acid rain?"
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Shit_The_Fuck_Yeah,6,Tue Jul 30 17:29:56 2013 UTC,Must have been moving a fridge from one side of town to the other.  edit: or a fridge full of life saving insulin
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,28wiseman,1 point,Tue Jul 30 17:34:52 2013 UTC,...new appliances with no electricity?  This was my favorite plot hole this week.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,mutatron,19,Tue Jul 30 05:27:41 2013 UTC,King's appliance hahaha
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Crazygoingslowlyami,17,Sat Aug 3 06:27:56 2013 UTC,That is a cool image with half of the landscape destroyed.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,mutatron,13,Tue Jul 30 02:11:40 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but a MOAB wouldn't have done that much damage, only has a blast radius of 500 feet."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Crazygoingslowlyami,3,Tue Jul 30 02:04:47 2013 UTC,"So out of curiousity, because I know nothing about any of this stuff, (and I know you can't apply logic to this show, but maybe relative logic? I don't know. Bear with me) when they shot the gun at the dome, the bullets bounced back. Which I don't think is normal behaviour for bullets. So theoretically, when firing an (x) strength missile at the dome. After it detonates would it behave in a similar way and reverberate/bounce off at (5x) radius or what have you? In theory of course. Edit: spelling"
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,TheLittlestRed,6,Tue Jul 30 02:17:46 2013 UTC,"Well, in theory if you're just making up stuff, anything can happen, especially with aliens or magic. To make an explosion 5x bigger, the dome would have to add energy in a reactive way to whatever touched it. Also, bullets do ricochet off of metal, rocks, anything hard enough to make them do so.  Now that you mention it, I don't recall anyone interacting with the dome except by touching, shooting, running a truck into it, or exploding a large bomb. While I've been watching it no one has tried poking it with sharp instruments, scratching it, attacking it with chemicals except water, burning it, or whatever.  Now that I think about it though, my original comment was really just catty. I mean, good sci-fi is about whatever point the author is trying to make by setting up a situation that takes some current fear to an extreme, which is almost by definition highly unlikely and often impossible. There are a lot of Twilight Zones and Star Treks, for example, with magic or dubious science, but they're still good because of what the author was saying about the human condition.  There's one Twilight Zone, ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"" (hulu link) which has aliens just turning electricity on an off to freak people out in a little neighborhood. They didn't use much special effects, the main thing was how people reacted to it. It's similar with Under the Dome, the main thing is how people react in this extreme situation, and it gets you thinking about what you would do, and how it relates to real life."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Dan_P326,3,Wed Jul 31 03:34:26 2013 UTC,"All good points! Sci fi is definitely like that. And thanks for responding! I find suspending disbelief to be really difficult sometimes but when a show can make me do it I consider it a success! Haha I guess that's true. Nobody has really tried to interact in other ways. Maybe if they asked it nicely it would just leave!!!! Some loving petting and a lullaby! That's the thing with science fiction. You never really know what under the umbrella of ""solutions"" is going to work. It's pretty interesting to think about some days!! Thanks again :)  Edit: because I reread your comment after replying! Would it make sense if the blast radius was increased because the explosion did pick up energy from the dome? We know it shocks people. And has some sort of energy field... Hmmm"
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Doxep,33,Wed Jul 31 05:16:09 2013 UTC,Am I the only one here that actually really enjoys the show? Everyone here seems to hate it.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,AllergicToKarma,25,Wed Jul 31 06:20:04 2013 UTC,"I enjoy it, the writing can be pretty lazy though."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,bluechartreuse,10,Tue Jul 30 12:19:52 2013 UTC,"I enjoy it too! When the truck destroyed the water supply I was like ""Oh no you didn't!"""
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Doxep,14,Tue Jul 30 12:53:22 2013 UTC,"That wasn't even the laziest piece of writing!  Barbie gets angry with looter. Barbie chases looter. Barbie wants to kill looter. Other characters trying to stop the looting are instantly on scene, but coming from the other direction.  Wait, why? I can almost understand the fact that Barbie is pissed and wants to chase someone down, but why do the other officers leave the scene and show up in the opposite direction of said chase?   Were they leaving the scene of the riot because it was under control? Then they were running counter clockwise to the chase in order to try and find Barbie?"
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Death_Star_,3,Tue Jul 30 14:17:58 2013 UTC,"Dude, that totally ground my gears. Also, the Barbie-Shumway kiss was so artificial it was cringe-tastic. Not sure if bad writing, shitty execution, or both, but the show is rapidly losing my attention."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,terriblehuman,4,Wed Jul 31 02:01:36 2013 UTC,Wow... you're right.... I didn't think about that!
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,venn177,12,Wed Jul 31 06:55:37 2013 UTC,"I enjoy it, but it's summer writing.  If it were tossed into the mix in the fall season, it would have no chance."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Rider797,2,Thu Aug 1 21:36:13 2013 UTC,"I haven't read the book, but I expect that that explains why I'm enjoying the show while so many people here hate it. I imagine while King probably isn't completely pleased with changes to the book, they pretty much have to change a few things to keep it from being a show where everybody knows what's going to happen. Also, keep in mind that many television shows start out with a really terrible first season, but find their footing by the second season. I am a little annoyed with how much people are nitpicking every little detail. Top post is about how stupid it is that there's an appliance delivery truck driving around under the dome. I don't really understand why that's stupid. I mean maybe he's moving supplies, maybe he's just using the only vehicle he has access to to get around."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,devils_advocodo,7,Wed Jul 31 09:03:27 2013 UTC,"It's a lot like Dexter: As long as you don't play a drinking game involving plot holes, you can enjoy it."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,The-Nard-Dog,5,Tue Jul 30 17:42:42 2013 UTC,"I do, everyone here may hate it, but apparently there are a several million people that don't share the dislike."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Death_Star_,3,Wed Jul 31 01:57:49 2013 UTC,The crappy writing and ridiculous plot devices bother us so much because we enjoy the show. It could be so much better....
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,paalmsread,31,Fri Aug 2 17:50:48 2013 UTC,NOOO  Why would they kill Rose :'(
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,sje46,32,Wed Jul 31 01:15:38 2013 UTC,"Rose   After Barbie tells Sheriff Linda ""Rose is dead,"" WHY DIDN'T HE SAY ""Oh, by the way, the killer/rapist is still inside the diner""??!!  It makes ZERO sense.  I totally understand the urgency of getting Angie medical attention ASAP; but I cannot, for the life of me, fathom how Barbie couldn't toss in a casual ""Weyland is still inside!""  Now, they have to chase them."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,ActionFilmsFan1995,8,Tue Jul 30 16:16:40 2013 UTC,They didn't even use the word 'rape'. Must be due to some rule.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Shappie,10,Tue Jul 30 15:55:35 2013 UTC,"""No one would want to R her."""
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Shit_The_Fuck_Yeah,30,Tue Jul 30 02:33:01 2013 UTC,"She was the character who everyone liked, but wasn't important to the plot in any way. Her entire purpose was to die at some point."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,nooneastern,20,Tue Jul 30 09:57:45 2013 UTC,"I wanted Barbie to kill the would-be raper.  I mean, shit, he killed Rose without a second thought.  Who's to say he won't kill again?  He's obviously the scummiest of the scumbags.  I would have snapped that piece of shit's neck in a second."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Doxep,2,Tue Jul 30 13:38:31 2013 UTC,It's like the Red Wedding all over again.

UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Dan_P326,8,Tue Jul 30 08:50:07 2013 UTC,"Hey, it makes sense."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,SutterCane,3,Sat Aug 3 06:36:01 2013 UTC,More than some of the other subplots anyway.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,wandahickey,2,Tue Jul 30 02:41:10 2013 UTC,Great porn-parody title rat there
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,SutterCane,10,Tue Jul 30 02:44:00 2013 UTC,If they give her a hat the dome will go away.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,wandahickey,14,Tue Jul 30 13:57:24 2013 UTC,"Ugh, the book kinda suffered from this Murphy's Law writing too.  Someone's going to help? Dead.  This evidence proves wrongdoing? Gone."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,SutterCane,4,Wed Jul 31 13:32:30 2013 UTC,This is one of the few King books I have not read.  Is it worth the read after seeing this series?
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Death_Star_,5,Sat Aug 3 06:53:13 2013 UTC,"I think overall the book is worth the read. But there are problems with it.  Edit: I guess I should expand a little...  I feel the bad guys don't really get what's coming to them, there's a whole plot throughout the book is entirely dropped and has a terrible ending, and like I mentioned earlier, Murphy's Law writing is in effect and I got really tired of it fast. But the characters are all interesting and practically different from the ones on the show. And then there's the okay but not really great ending that everyone has already heard of by now. It was alright for me, but others may not like it."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Iamdarb,6,Tue Jul 30 12:50:04 2013 UTC,"Now I have a dilemma, do I click on the spoiler and possibly ruin reading the book or do I just say screw it and read it.   Damn you Suttercane."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,wandahickey,5,Tue Jul 30 02:32:36 2013 UTC,"Nothing too too specific (at least I think so), but just a general feeling of the book I got after reading it. Although it might be enough to piece together as you're reading the book, which is why I spoiler tagged it."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Iamdarb,2,Tue Jul 30 02:37:03 2013 UTC,"I think it's sort of like the natural selection of critical characters.  Non-essential characters that do not create conflict (or too easily solve conflict) get killed off, otherwise there would be no story."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,sje46,3,Tue Jul 30 02:40:10 2013 UTC,Overall it is definitely worth the read. I think the audiobook is on youtube if you wanted to give it a shot.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,spockywocky,6,Tue Jul 30 03:17:54 2013 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm old school, I'll download it onto my e-reader."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,snubdeity,3,Tue Jul 30 03:22:23 2013 UTC,"I understand and agree. Matthew Broderick does a good job at narrating, but it was much more enjoyable reading it. I bought the book in 09 just because of how big it was. I thought to myself, I hope this is as good as The Stand, and honestly while it doesn't even come close, it is still an excellent read. I would say it is a little more tame than The Stand."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,ActionFilmsFan1995,2,Tue Jul 30 17:35:53 2013 UTC,"I believe Stephen King--or another famous writer, or a bunch of them--has said that the best writing involves being as sadistic as possible to your characters.  It increases the tension.    I wish I could find that famous quote.  But yeah, I have no problem with that kind of writing."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,OneOfDozens,13,Tue Jul 30 02:49:05 2013 UTC,TIL that the MOAB doesn't destroy things in a radius.
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,spockywocky,12,Tue Jul 30 02:54:24 2013 UTC,"Well, it did clearly show the bomb came in on one side of the dome, from and angle.  If it didn't destroy the dome, it would make sense for the dome to have a ""shadow"" of sorts that the MOAB didn't reach..."

UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Rider797,14,Tue Jul 30 20:21:24 2013 UTC,"I couldn't believe the reaction of the people.  They were 2 seconds earlier ready to kill each other, there were guys literally beating another one and right when the rain starts everyone starts shaking hands and shit.  I can understand people relaxing but ""oh hey guy who i nearly just killed, lets hug and be best friends!"" terrible  and everyone was rioting and stealing goods, not water"
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Iamdarb,11,Tue Jul 30 02:50:19 2013 UTC,Seriously Big Jim? Your son kidnaps a girl and you tell him to clean up the mess?

UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,Kaygee12,5,Tue Jul 30 07:05:20 2013 UTC,"I'm surprised Big Jim didn't just kill her off.  He killed off the Reverend, whose darkest secret was that Big Jim was a meth supplier.  I think Angie's secret would be even worse, and they'd be more likely to believe Angie's story than the Reverend's (since no meth was in town, and the Rev has been acting a little crazy)."
UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,ActionFilmsFan1995,2,Tue Jul 30 16:17:24 2013 UTC,"I thought about this, and it wouldn't make sense for him to kill her off there. Barbie and Linda saw him taking Angie away in his vehicle. If she goes missing they will ask about him first. Barbie might not have leverage in the town, but Linda does. Jim would be the most likely suspect considering Angie never showed up at the clinic."

UnderTheDome,1jbj3v,-alex-,10,Tue Jul 30 02:29:18 2013 UTC,"It's almost completely backwards.  Grossly simplified:  Without insulin, your body would (slowly) break down due to its inability to process glucose; you would die relatively slowly, most probably from organ failure.  Too much insulin (or that combined with too little food) and you can fall into a coma or simply die. If untreated too much insulin could kill someone quite quickly."

This is the basis for a whole sport.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_direction_finding  It gets complicated when you get radio reflections off the terrain using 2m.

Your left ear notes how loud it is to it and your right ear notes how loud the object is to it, and your brain does ""calculations"" to figure out what direction it is, and when you move, that gives you more information to figure out direction and distance.    In other words, the third point in triangulation is the thing you're focusing on.  You're using basic geometric with the other two points to figure out where it is."

At the top of its TCA presentation today, the network announced a second season renewal for the series adaptation of Stephen King’s novel to return next summer. King will pen the second season’s opening episode. “This is the way television should be,” CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves said. Under The Dome, originally developed at CBS’ sibling Showtime, has been a strong ratings performer. After a big premiere, which soared to a 4.6 rating in 18-49 and 17.8 million total viewers in Live+7, Under The Dome kept steady. Its ratings have been on a growth path for the last two weeks, most recently drawing 2.7/8 and 11.4 million in the fast nationals last week."

Vaughan and his team of writers have been of necessity, and I approved of them wholeheartedly,"" he continued. ""Some have been occasioned by their plan to keep the Dome in place over Chester’s Mill for months instead of little more than a week, as is the case in the book. Other story modifications are slotting into place because the writers have completely re-imagined the source of the Dome.""  Yes, that's right; in trying to allay complaints about differences between versions of the story, King has only revealed that there's far more upset for purists on the way. ""If the solution to the mystery were the same on TV as in the book, everyone would know it in short order, which would spoil a lot of the fun,"" he explained, adding ""(Besides, plenty of readers didn’t like my solution, anyway).""   Anyhow it's Stephen King. He wrote The Langoliers which was made into a very silly but oddly very watchable miniseries.   http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/1ipcbb/the_langoliers_1995/  I reckon a bit of latitude when adapting it for TV is basically OK."

Now imagine something like the dome happening.  All it would take is one person in LA getting in front of a camera or calling a reporter saying, ""my friend Norrie/my shrink/my lawyer was driving through Maine that day and we haven't heard from her.""

Deputy Linda (Natalie Martinez) reconnected with her boyfriend, who capitalized on her isolation by getting them a cover of People magazine (which he showed her on his handy and functional Microsoft Surface™ tablet). They made out through the dome, and surprisingly neither of their tongues got stuck to it. Norrie (Mackenzie Lintz) also got a visitor from her birth father, who her moms had told her was an anonymous sperm donor. I don’t really care about this storyline because 1) the guy is obviously a jerk, and 2) it’s pointless if he doesn’t own a Surface™.   lulz.   Actually it would have been funny in the finale if S1E05 TV SPOILER.   Also if the Windows Surface devices were mysteriously immune to the dome's malevolent effect on non Microsoft branded devices."

As far as the popular ""find a similarity with Jericho"" game goes, though, this kinda reminded that episode in the very beginning of Jericho where the town people were hiding in some abandoned mines because of the acid rain (and some people were trapped outside for various reasons). I know that here in Under The Dome this situation didn't seem forced at all, but still this is yet another similarity."
UnderTheDome,1iuq0x,alexlp,15,Tue Jul 23 01:45:11 2013 UTC,"I have a theory that the Dome makes everyone act like a retard:   ""I need to have a private conversation with one of the soldiers outside the Dome. I better have the blabbermouth with her own radio channel to read his lips, I'm sure she won't tell anyone and cause town-wide panic."" -Barbie ""Big Jim! Please get me out of here, please get me out of here!"" (Big Jim gets her out of there) ""Why did you do that for?!"" -Angie ""Nobody is allowed to touch the Dome, and I mean NOBODY. If anyone gets near the Dom-- Hey look, it's my boyfriend, I've got to go and kiss the dome."" -I don't even care about her name at this point   Eeegh.

The dome probably makes things 100x more confusing. Also they thought they were going to die from the explosion when she comforted him.
UnderTheDome,1iuq0x,exxplicit,16,Thu Jul 25 20:12:00 2013 UTC,Bit of Stockholm syndrome mixed with the fact that you thought you were going to die in 5 minutes. A lot of things become easier to forgive when your told your going to die in a city leveling blast.
UnderTheDome,1iuq0x,LegendaryProductions,4,Tue Jul 23 05:36:45 2013 UTC,Exactly. It's actually kinda easy to see where she's coming from. Also the fact the he put down his gun right next to where he was sitting and I think you could see her glancing at it when she held him.

The dome is actually holding the town in it's own reality. Outside the bubble is actually an alternate reality. This would explain the 'Dear John' letter and the woman saying ""The dome brought him back to me!"". It seemed too overdone to suggest that her son died. Those dead within the dome are not maintained in that reality. I suspect that touching the dome alters the reality outside (hence the initial shock). Plus Kings comments on the show: ' As for me, I’m enjoying the chance to watch that alternate reality play out'"

UnderTheDome,1iv8fk,bubbagumpshrimpcomp,4,Tue Jul 23 05:31:40 2013 UTC,"hard to say, but i don't think it's that. I don't have any theories on who put it there and why, i've been focusing more on what the dome represents. My best shot so far is that the dome is a symbolization of society. The dome has created its own sort of mini society within itself and look what that's done. It's turned the corrupt into leaders, and is demonstrated through the amount of influence they exert. I also think that it's a subtle attempt at satire to try and get the viewers to reflect on our own society. There are people who want to do good, whilst there are others who are overwhelmed by the notion of greed. That's just my view on what the dome represents, and I'll be glad to hear what others have to say."
UnderTheDome,1iv8fk,FAT_SNAIL,3,Tue Jul 23 07:52:38 2013 UTC,"But you're looking at the role of the dome in terms of the moral of the story, ""what the dome does/shows to the viewers"". But this role is played not by the dome, but by the TV show itself. It's the story that shows sides of human nature, not the plot devices.  I'm pretty sure this discussion is about the nature and role of the dome in-universe."
UnderTheDome,1iv8fk,cjfynjy,2,Tue Jul 23 08:23:29 2013 UTC,"yea, you're right. I've tried to think about what the dome is, why it's there and  who put it there but they all are really far-fetched ideas. It's too early right now to speculate."

UnderTheDome,1iv8fk,RobotBuddha,1 point,Tue Jul 23 18:54:30 2013 UTC,"I like the idea of the dome being in place to protect Chester's Mill from an impending disaster. Be it aliens or the government doing it, I think it would be a really cool finale (Season or series) to have the town watch as nukes decimate the rest of the world.   Let's say the series runs for multiple seasons. The writers announce the finale season a year in advance and end whatever current season their on with the above nuclear holocaust. It would drastically change the show in its final season. The townspeople would be terrified that the radiation would seep in and they would instantly hope the dome stays in place indefinitely.   I think that would be cool to see.   As for the cause of the dome, I have no idea. A government conspiracy seems to be where I'm leaning. Maybe a malevolent corporation put it there as a step toward holding the world hostage or something. That would be a great way to tie in the Sombra Corporation from the dark tower (if only in name)."

I wouldn't really bet on aliens 100%, although I think I've accidentally spoiled for myself that in the book it's aliens, but in general the idea of the dome being actually the protection device instead of a trapping device is a good one. The dome's purpose is for the times when things go south on the outside, not the inside.  Also, I think the propane is something more than just a plot device to show what a bad guy Big Jim is. There's just too much constant reminding about it in the dialogues; one or two would be more than enough to explain that the councilmen and a few other folks are running shady business. Don't forget the old lady in Episode 1 who told Julia about propane - it was even before the ""evilness"" of Big Jim was introduced.

UnderTheDome,1idzvc,andrewthemexican,5,Sat Jul 20 19:34:12 2013 UTC,I don't think he was as unlikable in the book simply because you're told early on that his increasingly erratic and violent behavior is primarily the result of his progressing brain tumor.

UnderTheDome,1idtmk,Corvese,1 point,Tue Jul 16 02:17:28 2013 UTC,Toward the ending I thought he also handled the mob well. I wrote that comment when he ran into the hospital with the shotgun and told everyone they were quarantined. That was stupid.

UnderTheDome,1idtmk,dentwreckless,2,Wed Jul 17 12:40:41 2013 UTC,Exactly. If they were both equally important to the town Linda stills win the drugs based on her youth. The fact that she is the only sheriff is just the icing on the cake.

UnderTheDome,1hxw5k,Dorkside,14,Tue Jul 9 15:59:50 2013 UTC,"It's surfing on the quality of the novel and the popularity of its author. The show itself is really underwhelming. If this hadn't had Stephen King's name associated with it, it would have been received far less favorably; and it's not as though the show has met widespread praise as it is. While the ratings might look flattering, it's clear from any discussion forum that people are largely of an ""I'll give it one more episode to stop sucking"" mindset. Common consensus appears to be that the pilot was pretty good but the two subsequent episodes have fallen flat, and the writing is so bad that it borders on unintentional comedy."

UnderTheDome,1hyvb9,ScalpelBurn2,2,Wed Jul 10 03:48:33 2013 UTC,Exatly. It reminded me of Game of Thrones.
UnderTheDome,1hyvb9,Doxep,5,Tue Jul 16 16:33:22 2013 UTC,"Duke was supposed to be an upstanding police officer who had shit on Big Jim before the dome came down.  His death in the book is supposed to open way for Big Jim to deputize Junior and his friends, who are basically his brown-shirt shock-troop force of sociopaths and rapists to rule over the town.  For that reason, in the book, it is very important Duke dies because if he hadn't, Chester's Mill wouldn't have become a dictatorship.  I don't know if they're going to do that in the series, but I hope they do, since it's the most important, you know, thing in the book."
UnderTheDome,1hyvb9,sje46,3,Wed Jul 10 04:46:37 2013 UTC,"Well, Duke is playing a role in the subsequent episodes, even though he's not there. His relationship to the other characters, what he knew, and the warning he gave Linda are all important parts of the plot. So it's good that we got a sense of who he was.

UnderTheDome,1hxc5t,jivemasta,2,Tue Jul 9 14:28:12 2013 UTC,"It brings to mind the same issues Jericho had.   This feels a LOT like Jericho to me. I loved the story, liked (but wanted more from) the plot, but not all of the characters felt real.   I read the book but I don't expect to see the same thing on the screen as the page, I just know certain crazy parts CANT be on TV. Like all the dead body sex and without some of those pieces I feel the characterization is off. Maybe it just has ""Season One Syndrome"" and all the actors need to work on their chemistry.  I'll continue to watch, but just saying it's better than most other stuff on tv doesn't really make it worth my time in the long run."
UnderTheDome,1hxc5t,thinkbox,2,Tue Jul 9 21:22:17 2013 UTC,"Well, it is important to remember that the show is not meant to be an adaptation of the book. I think it is more like a different story with the same premise, setting and many of the same (or similar but modified) characters.  I think (to respond to the OP) that the kids are portrayed reasonably. Kids are not notoriously long-term thinkers, and since they don't seem to be in imminent danger, it makes sense that they see the upside (a lot of rules and obligations are at least temporarily suspended) rather than the possible* longer term consequences (we're all going to die). Although they touch on that at a few points.  *Recall, also that we have insight the characters do not. As far as they are concerned, the dome could disappear (or be removed/defeated by internal or external agents) as quickly as it appeared."
UnderTheDome,1hxc5t,bge951,0,Thu Jul 11 17:34:00 2013 UTC,"Kids are not notoriously long-term thinkers   Some might be, but they certainly aren't notorious for it.  My problem is that Barbie is pretty much the only character that is likable and most the characters feel a bit bland/empty/going through the motions. Not very memorable portrayals."
UnderTheDome,1hxc5t,thinkbox,2,Thu Jul 11 17:47:10 2013 UTC,"I may have phrased that poorly. I meant that kids are notorious for not being long term thinkers.   My problem is that Barbie is pretty much the only character that is likable   I think Joe is pretty likable, though we haven't seen him developed much yet. And the deputy has potential. I think we'll see more of the radio engineer as well.  So far, I like the show. And I'm enjoying pondering the divergences from the book, and where they may lead."
UnderTheDome,1hxc5t,bge951,1 point,Thu Jul 11 18:19:37 2013 UTC,I definitely get the Jericho vibe.  Jake and Barbie might as well be the same person. Actually Barbie is like a Jake/Hawkins mix but his backstory is literally the same as Jake except he's an outsider instead of a townie.

WE'RE SETTING UP CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CITY INTERLOPERS AND THE DOWN HOME FOLKS! BET YA DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!  And in the very next scene we're giving the rural guy a gun - so either city lady will have to save him with her street smarts or they'll bond, he'll have a change of heart and look out for the ladies like a country boy does. He'll still be a bit racist, though. Episode 6/8. Well, you never saw that coming, did you?"

Also, Barbie seems to be going the way of Jake from Jericho ( guy with mysterious military past that can do literally anything you need him to do)."
UnderTheDome,1hwo58,klahaya,7,Tue Jul 9 13:01:51 2013 UTC,"Damn right! The show even follows the same formula as Jericho (at least for now): every episode is centered on some new kind of threat. There was a fire; there was a person gone crazy with a rifle; there will be a disease epidemic in the next episode... All these things are like ""a problem of the week""."
UnderTheDome,1hwo58,McGravin,2,Tue Jul 9 15:45:16 2013 UTC,"I think they mentioned it being ""like a day and a half"" somewhere in the episode... So it's like a problem a day."

UnderTheDome,1hwo58,28wiseman,3,Tue Jul 9 02:56:38 2013 UTC,The ending was by far the best part of that movie.
UnderTheDome,1hwo58,InterstateExit,4,Fri Jul 12 18:00:42 2013 UTC,Yes I couldn't think of them all but out of his repertoire it's been very hit or miss. I wish HBO would do The Stand.

UnderTheDome,1hwo58,Thinkyt,2,Fri Jul 12 18:01:41 2013 UTC,"I agree, I am trying so hard to like this show, but it's not very good.  This is one of the few books of his that I haven't read.  I don't think his works can be condensed very well.  Stand by Me is probably the one movie I really liked other than Shawshank.  I think both of those had really solid stories, a small cast of characters with fairly uncomplicated backgrounds."
UnderTheDome,1hwo58,Moscamst,12,Wed Jul 10 03:19:43 2013 UTC,"Since there is a lot of bashing going on here, I thought I'd throw in some positive stuff I noticed:  Tension between characters.  There is a lot of it, and it's very tangible for a show that's only had 3 episodes:  Julia and Barbie tension:  Why did he beat up Junior?  Why is he in  town?  Why did he kill her husband?  Barbie and Junior tension:  Insane guy vs army guy.  What will happen?  Big Jim vs Junior tension:   Daddy is disapointed.  Son is crazy.  Dad likes Barbie.  Son hates Barbie.    Big Jim vs Barbie tension:  Barbie doesn't play well with others.  Big Jim wants to be in control.  Barbie beat up his son.  Big Jim knows Barbie will be very useful in his bid for power...or very dangerous.      Julia vs Junior tension:  Alone in the dark with a pyscho....and they mysteriously bond.   I think these 4 characters have already shown more interesting conflict than many TV casts do in an entire season."

Their faithfulness to the book is also pretty close to 0%, they've kept only the basic concept of the dome and then some character names and partial personas. Calling it Under the Dome is completely dishonest at this point, it's almost false advertisement.

Barbie and Linda are the only ones I even remotely give a crap about. But that's only because they're the only ones that aren't being completely stupid. Although, Linda falling for the crazy guy coughing in the cell was questionable.   I've ranted about Junior being terrible a hundred times before so I'm not going to do it here.

UnderTheDome,1hwo58,jmarquiso,2,Tue Jul 9 06:35:52 2013 UTC,"This show bears so little resemblance to the book that using the same title is just wildly misleading, bordering on false advertisement. Literally nothing in this entire episode took place in the book. Not a single scene. They've kept nothing except the basic concept of the dome as well as some character names, some of which have vague correlations to their book counterparts while others share nothing but the name. This is so different from the book that I think using the same title and suggesting that it's a televised rendition of the novel is simply dishonest.   Stephen King implied that some things had been changed in order to better adapt to the screen, not that it was an entirely different story. This has no more in common with the Under the Dome novel than Dungeons & Dragons has in common with Lord of the Rings, sharing only a few very loose concepts and a fundamental theme. Most importantly, the show doesn't tell a better story than the book. I don't really see the point of changing everything for the worse. Sometimes a bad movie/show can appeal to fans of the book from which it derives, but this won't even have that."
UnderTheDome,1hwo58,BasementTrix,5,Tue Jul 9 12:27:38 2013 UTC,"There’s only one element of my novel that absolutely had to be the same in the novel and the show, and that’s the Dome itself. It’s best to think of that novel and what you’re seeing week-to-week on CBS as a case of fraternal twins. Both started in the same creative womb, but you will be able to tell them apart. Or, if you’re of a sci-fi bent, think of them as alternate versions of the same reality.  As for me, I’m enjoying the chance to watch that alternate reality play out; I still think there’s no place like Dome.  As for you, Constant Reader, feel free to take the original down from your bookshelf anytime you want. Nothing between the covers has changed a bit."

UnderTheDome,1hs2h6,xLite414,15,Sun Jul 7 01:25:01 2013 UTC,"I don't think you understand much about the production of TV shows. It's not one guy sitting there drawing up an episode, there's the same writing team working on all the episodes together (including Vaughan who is the showrunner). The writing credit is generally given to the person who penned the outline or did the majority of the penning, but it's still created in collaboration. It's not one guy churning out some shit and everyone else throwing their hands up and going ""well, guess this week is a shitty episode"". If an episode is bad, the entire writing team failed to bring it together - not one person.   Also, the director (when it comes to a TV show) has little to no impact on its quality. The decline here is the result of the show's pilot establishing a promising premise, but the week to week stories/characters/pacing not being strong."
UnderTheDome,1hs2h6,ScalpelBurn2,2,Sun Jul 7 15:44:00 2013 UTC,"You typed out a very well written and researched post and yet everything you said was completely ridiculous. There is no scientific formula to figure out a ""quality decline"", in large put due to it being partially an opinion.  I can assure you that there was no quality decline that can truly be pinpointed.  If you didn't like the second episode, that is obviously fine, but many had no problem with it.    All TV shows are written by a group of writers, and one or two are usually tasked with taking the lead, outlining, drafting etc... but they dont write all the dialogue alone, and they dont come up with the main story either.  The directing was top notch for TV in both episodes and doesnt have too much to do with what you're saying anyway.  Even going by the few commenters here only one really comes out and agrees with you, so clearly there wasnt an obvious decline.  I preferred the Pilot episode but thought 2 was a better follow up then i expected out of it.  It was a highly anticipated Pilot that CBS invested a lot in, so its logical that they went all out for it, to start the series on a high note."

UnderTheDome,1hqkfz,starryknight,2,Wed Jul 10 03:15:46 2013 UTC,"Probably for money. State government give productions huge tax credits and cash grants to film in their state, because the production brings jobs and boosts the local economy. I guess Maine didn't fork over enough money."

(Or is it implied that the producer at the radio station has equipment besides the big antenna?)  The army hasn't set up big whiteboards on the free side of the Dome to communicate to the residents. At the very least the Maine Department of Revenue would want to make sure the owner of the diner is still collecting sales tax and the Lottery Commission would make sure the gas station is still selling lottery tickets.  I think my son is a dumbass who can't do anything right. So when he tells me the bomb shelter is completely flooded, I don't even bother to check for myself.

I would really like an episode or too about what's happening outside the dome. I know that's not the point of this show, and the show is more about survivor-group-psychology and the events just happens to (probably) supernatural. But I would still like to see how it is being dealt with from the outside world.  In the newest episode, Big Jim I think also mentions that the dome is a big incubator for the possible outbreak, but noone thinks twice about still driving around cars. Yeah, the dome seem permeable, but not to a great amount, so the air might not get refreshed at the same rate, and maybe not at the necessary rate.  But you are wrong about the spines in BSG. It did happen later in the series too. The plot hole is, however, does noone in the BSG universe have doggy style sex ... or ever just happen to see the red glowing spine ..."

The problem is that some of the vehicles batteries werent shown to explode when they touch the dome even though this is what 'should' be happening, but I think that was more due to dramatic effect, this is the reason big Jim stops the tractor, for fear the tractors engine would explode, killing the driver...  In reference to the reverend kicking the can, big Jim asks if he was using their 'stuff', without spoilers ill let you guess what 'stuff' hes referring to that would make a grown man clumsy and slow as pig shit."

As for water, there's no confirmation they have it.. just that they hope it still works. Considering it looks like the dome goes underground, you can probably safely assume there's no water. Unless it's sourced from within the dome from like a lake or something. Either way, it will probably be touched upon in a future episode."
UnderTheDome,1hqkfz,Veysa,2,Tue Jul 9 14:58:27 2013 UTC,"The dome is ten miles across, and they show a water tower in the opening, it's not a stretch to think the water source for such a small town is local and mostly inside the dome.

There's many reasons why this is in place and if I get the time I'll write up an examples post, explaining all the reasoning behind the spoiler system. In the end, what it boils down to is it protects a lot of people from information which would otherwise spoil their experience of the show and/or book.

UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,pyrs,20,Tue Jul 2 15:01:25 2013 UTC,"My two cents: We are watching way too many good shows. Everything on HBO, Showtime and FX have this high level of quality that network TV can't do because they are afraid of taking risks. Under The Dome is a good show for CBS standards. I'm watching it because I love Stephen King and read the book. I can ignore the diferences and I know what an somewhat unfaithful adaptation is.   But what I can't wrap my mind around is that for every little good thing that this show has, there's a bigger mistake around the corner. And I'm not bashing the show. I'm just being critical. Yesterday I watched ""Ray Donovan"", the new show from Showtime and then logged on Reddit to see if people were talking about it: they just said the worst stuff about it. And I didn't agree, I thought that show was awesome.   But it's becoming hard to defend Under the Dome, much to my dismay. But I'll keep watching, 'till the end. For better or for worse."
UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,SecretDragoon,1 point,Tue Jul 2 18:44:27 2013 UTC,"Hear, hear! I, too, enjoyed Ray Donovan. I always end up limiting myself to watching nothing every time I set my standards stupidly high after watching such amazing shows from cable networks. There just isn't enough to go around, especially during the Summer.  Ray Donovan, and especially Under the Dome, have been a very welcome addition to my watchlist recently. A watchlist which would otherwise be empty, only capable of possibly being filled by the same old reality TV shit.  Whether or not it's in the league of the big hit cable TV shows, I enjoy this show for what it is. Some great actors from Lost, Prison Break, Breaking Bad and Bates Motel. I really look forward to what they bring to the table in future episodes. Also.. Stephen King, I mean, come on."
UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,SnapeWho,3,Tue Jul 2 18:52:07 2013 UTC,"Let's just be graceful with what we got. Everybody shot down True Blood after the second season: I liked it. I continued to love Dexter and it's on Showtime and it has some of the same wrongs of Under the Dome. Even Breaking Bad had some moments of cheesyness (they gonna crucify me for this). But when I stick to a show, I'll stick with it and take it for what it is. They just better hurry up some of the pointless character conflicts and start investigating the source of the Dome otherwise they will lose the more sci-fi crowd. But, if they end up showing lots of character conflicts, then they better be good and bring the story forward. I read Y: The Last Man in high school and Brian K. Vaugham did not disappoint. Let's see of he can do it again with Under the Dome."

That's just how much I fucking hate him.  But I'm with you that I only care about the people that actually want to figure out what's going on. Time spent on that interracial lesbian couple(why the fuck are they even on the show?) is time that could be better spent on showing more about the dome.

I complained about this in a rant last week saying that he's just badly copying what other psychopaths do in TV shows and movies. Right down to that boring as shit monotone voice he has going on.  It's impossible to believe no one suspects he's crazy when he openly picks fights with strangers and talks like he's permanently constipated."

UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,hammond_egger,15,Wed Jul 3 12:27:30 2013 UTC,"Episdoe one was simply okay. Episode two got very bad, very fast. -bad acting -cheesy dialogue -Junior...just everything.  Phil Bushey is not far behind.  -just random objects burning duing the fire -Instead of being AROUND Chester's Mill, the dome falls right through the middle of neighborhoods.  -Instead of just taking what he needed and leaving, the reverand had to toss the house and then attempt to burn the receipts in a garbage can.  Even if the house hadnt caught on fire, what was Linda going to think when she goes into Duke's house and the office is ransacked and there is a pile of ashes in the garbage can. Just sloppy, lazy writing.  -Who knew you could stop a house fire from spreading by pushing the house over? -Joe and the the other kid walking the perimeter of the dome out in the open and acting like the were surprised when they got ten feet away from the scientists performing experiments. You couldn't see that as you were approaching from a hundred yards away? -The cops looking over and Barbie is just randomly walking through the woods.   It's a bit of a circle jerk around here. I don't expect the mods to leave this up long."
UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,Hedonopoly,9,Tue Jul 2 13:11:20 2013 UTC,"For the record, knocking down a house does help put out a fire, the same way that knocking over a logstack helps put of a campfire. Houses go up so quick and stay that way because they are perfect for fires. They are well ventilated and full of fuel. Knocking them down causes the fire to be smothered and much easier to extinguish.   And the reverend did need to toss the house. He couldn't find what he was looking for. He had limited time, and he didn't care because his plan WAS to burn the house down. He straight out kicked the flaming barrel at the curtains. Unfortunately for him, it went up fast and he ended up trapped in the room. Plus, even if he wasn't trying to burn the house down, who cares if they see it ransacked.  Someone was looting during an insane event. It happens."
UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,sje46,1 point,Fri Jul 5 12:46:23 2013 UTC,"People don't loot in a town the size of Chester's Mill, everyone knows everyone else.  And you aren't going to ransack the house of the sheriff that just died after he told the officer he just left the house to that something was up.  That would just scream for her to start investigating. He didn't mean to set the house on fire, if he had he would have just ran out of the room when the curtains caught on fire.  As far as knocking the house over, that kind of makes sense but I've never seen a fire department do it.  And if it works so well, why not?"

UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,SvenHudson,6,Tue Jul 2 13:20:48 2013 UTC,"Another person in this thread or another said that this show is ""good for network TV."" I think that's a good way to put it. But is ""good for network TV"" really good enough these days. Cable TV shows are miles ahead of anything on network TV, including this show, excluding Hannibal. But it is miles ahead of shows like Revolution or Terra Nova, that's for sure.  But I still feel like it's got a lot of work to do. First and foremost, do something with Junior or just kill him off. He's boring, cliched, and he takes time away from the interesting plotlines.  Secondly, they need to quit being so fucking dramatic.   ""We're in a dome?  ""I have no idea what that even means.""  ""I do, Mom..."" cue dramatic as shit music. ""It means we're gonna die in here.""  Then it cuts to commercial.   The last major problem is probably the characters. Like the other poster said, the reverend was being a serious idiot. Why would he burn the papers in the house he fucking broke into?"" That's treading into the territory of The Walking Dead in terms of sheer stupidity.  Ugh. Another rant turned out much longer than I intended it to be. I guess I just hate seeing shows with so much potential squander it on easily fixable problems.  Anyway I plan to give the show another 2 or 3 episodes before I decide whether or not I plan to stick it out in the long run. Right now I don't know."

UnderTheDome,1hhp9p,ScalpelBurn2,1 point,Wed Jul 3 03:37:32 2013 UTC,"I instantly quit Revolution after that terrible mid-season finale.   Stupid mother gives crazy warlord an endless supply of electricity. As if that weren't bad enough, the villain near instantly has a helicopter up and running. It's been what? 15 years since the power went out? And you just happen to have a helicopter pilot on standby that isn't at least a little bit rusty?   As if that wasn't bad enough they end the episode with the helicopter chasing them, like that's some sort of super interesting cliffhanger. We all know they're going to get away from it. It's just plain lazy to end any episode that way. Regardless of whether or not it's a mid-season finale.  I don't know if Revolution got more interesting or not but I don't really care to find out. It's a great premise ruined by terrible writing/acting/plotholes, etc.   So far Under the Dome has been hit or miss. But when it misses, it misses by a mile. Exhibit A: Junior's entire fucking plotline. That shit is just bad. I complained about this last week too but this week's episode was even worse. I was truly hoping that Barbie killed him just so we wouldn't have to deal with him anymore.  He's just flat out the worst ""mentally unstable guy"" that I've ever seen on TV. It's impossible to believe that this guy isn't in a fucking institution somewhere already. A good ""insane"" guy needs to be intelligent. Junior is an idiot.   Anyway, I could rant for hours about how much I think Junior ruins the show but I've already devoted too much time to it as is.  I'm sure many other people don't feel the same way as I do, but his entire plotline sours the show for me and if they don't do something interesting with it in a few episodes I'll likely just quit watching altogether."

And the rest of an ensemble cast, with intertwined plots and flashbacks, you know the formula, got to be worth it for either of those two, right?  But it's not, because most of the ensemble really didn't work, despite trying to hit every target demographic there was; and the intertwined plots just emphasized the premise's plot holes and made the audience feel more trapped in the story than the characters.  So you see where I'm going with this for Under the Dome: a couple of worthwhile actors (and I'll let you pick your favorites) aren't going to make up for Junior and the ""my daughter needs a real doctor"" moms, and the premise is going to stink up the air faster than a house fire under the dome if they don't start doing something with it really fast.  I like the show, but I'm not sticking around for Bomb Shelter Stockholm Syndrome and pointless demands that someone do something.  So far I like the radio crew, Big Jim (he's not likable, but at least he's interesting) and the teen boys who see the bright side of disaster.  The deputy and the reporter are on the so-so list.  I like watching Barbie put Junior in his place but otherwise he's forgettable; and apparently I've forgotten the others already."

UnderTheDome,1hgd1w,wonderwoman888,1 point,Tue Jul 2 03:02:23 2013 UTC,I was wondering if a second season was possible.  Since its based on a book and presumably the book has an ending.    They either get out or don't.  Either way end of story.  I think it's reasonable to do that in one short season.   Personally I'd rather they just tell a story and resolve it.  Then CBS can take another Stephen King book and do it again.  He's got enough of them for many years of shows.
UnderTheDome,1hgd1w,StayGoldPwNyBoY,1 point,Tue Jul 2 03:07:52 2013 UTC,They have stated that they changed several aspects of the story.
UnderTheDome,1hgd1w,sje46,1 point,Tue Jul 2 03:10:32 2013 UTC,"Including...well, everything. So a second season can be made. But my fear is that if they don't start investigating what is causing the Dome and just stick to conflict of the residents of Chester's Mill, the audience may loose interest.  EDIT: that happened to LOST. Lost kept things interesting when the audience discovered something new about the island or this guy or that woman. Then that show kinda collapsed a few seasons on because of love triangles and conflict because characters did dumb stuff."

UnderTheDome,1hgd1w,Kongo204,1 point,Tue Jul 2 07:29:39 2013 UTC,"Well Dexter works as long as the main character,  Dexter, is still around.    Under the Dome sorta implies there's gonna be a dome.    I guess they could string it along and go all ""The Killing"" season 1&2.  But that really didn't make people happy.    Perhaps it's a sentient, malevolent dome.  Once the people figure out how to defeat it,  it comes back elsewhere on the planet with adapted defenses.  Sorta like the Borg shields in Star Trek.   But even then, the mystery of its source would likely have to be revealed.  At that point it's just a big plastic bowl that's being a dick."

UnderTheDome,1hfi9v,sje46,2,Tue Jul 2 02:06:23 2013 UTC,"It wasn't written by CBS.  It was an unfunny addition to the rules CBS posted, added by the previously.tv website."

UnderTheDome,1hfv7n,opiate46,3,Wed Jul 3 18:55:30 2013 UTC,"That's how I understood what that scene was supposed to be telling us, too.  If a little bit of water can get through the dome, that air could as well.  I'm not sure if enough air comes through, or if enough of the stuff from inside the dome can get out, so they're not breathing in exhaust, but I'll bet we find out."

UnderTheDome,1hfv7n,Black_myst,1 point,Tue Jul 9 20:01:33 2013 UTC,Hmm maybe..  But I've heard stories of hangars big enough that they had weather.  Surely an area as big as the Dome is supposed to be can have thermal variations large enough to cause wind.  Only quick link I could find regarding weather in a large building --  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building#Construction
UnderTheDome,1hdcw7,pyrs,6,Sun Jun 30 16:37:35 2013 UTC,"It's been a long long time since I read the book. I thought about rereading it before the series started, but decided against it. Because I am always disappointed in the movie adaptation of King's books, and I always much prefer the books.  I'm glad I didn't reread it, because apparently I forgot a lot about it. And now I'm not as disappointed as I might have been if I had reread it and remembered the details. Yay senility?"
UnderTheDome,1hdcw7,olily,1 point,Sun Jun 30 23:56:36 2013 UTC,"Had to submit the link again 'cause I didn't mark it as a spoiler. I think he is right, although I didn't like some changes. You could say ""yeah, but Game of Thrones is as faithful as it can be."" Well, Game of Thrones has a lot more books to adapt. Just glad we have some King on tv, changes or not."
UnderTheDome,1hdcw7,ChiliCloud,3,Sun Jun 30 16:44:25 2013 UTC,I agree!  I've never really understood why book readers have this idea that everything has to be exactly the same - otherwise it's bad. Change can be good and I think you have to view the tv-show with an open mind and like it is it's own story (much like with The Walking Dead).   I did not go in to this hoping that it would follow the book page by page. I actually hoped they would do something new. I want to be surprised!  If I already knew everything it would not be as fun to watch. Now I am on my toes and guessing and at the same time everything is kinda familiar. I really liked it and I'm looking forward to the next episode! :)
UnderTheDome,1hdcw7,ChiliCloud,2,Mon Jul 1 19:47:51 2013 UTC,"You got a point! The book is in my shelf, like every other book and if I wanted a replay, I would just read it again. The only thing I am kinda bummed about are the less violence, less bad language and less sinister stuff going on. But it's network TV and it doesn't have to be faithful to be good. The show is good. Acting wise and dialogue wise...it's good. Could be better, yes, but let's not bash it just because it's not faithful. Still, let's see how this thing goes and I too can't wait for the next episode."
UnderTheDome,1hebu3,Kongo204,7,Mon Jul 1 01:18:44 2013 UTC,You could see it was a dome at the end of the episode.

UnderTheDome,1hebu3,PzzDuh,3,Tue Jul 2 00:23:37 2013 UTC,"Maybe so, but I think you could see the ground in the crevice where the dome is"

Is an explanation of how the dome works really a spoiler, though? If not, I'd love to read it (you could even PM it to me if other people don't want to read it). Because, at the moment, it's spoiling the ""reality"" of the situation for me, that this dome which has supposedly cut this town off from the outside world is selectively filtering the electromagnetic spectrum.  But if it really is a plot spoiler, then I suppose I'll just wait for it to turn up in the show."
UnderTheDome,1hcexi,Sachiano,3,Sun Jun 30 11:24:49 2013 UTC,"It's a spoiler in terms of the origin of the Dome.   I'm on my phone, if this sub has spoiler tags I'll write it up later :-)"

UnderTheDome,1hcexi,SeriousWorm,2,Sun Jun 30 11:56:25 2013 UTC,"I think if it was magical, there wouldn't be the leakage of some frequencies like where the radio guys heard the emergency broadcast describing the Corps of Engineers report.  That sounds like something built by the lowest bidder (or a cost-plus contract) for the Department of Defense."
UnderTheDome,1hcexi,Panfish,1 point,Sun Jun 30 15:31:22 2013 UTC,"My guess is that the dome is a high-pass filter. All of the blocked frequencies are way below visible light frequencies, so there's some cutoff frequency from which the dome no longer affects signals."
UnderTheDome,1hcexi,xLite414,1 point,Tue Jul 2 00:05:48 2013 UTC,"I agree. You would probably want to let through IR radiation also so they don't freeze.  The Dome could even be beneficial by reducing cancer rates and birth defects if it blocks UV, X-rays, and gamma rays."

However, feel free to speculate providing you haven't read the book."
UnderTheDome,1h9lmx,Icanhazcomment,2,Fri Jun 28 19:13:47 2013 UTC,"I bet it's going to be a spherical force field with most (50%+) of the field underground.  I thought it was curious that the force field was shown to be <1"" thick when the cop and the firefighter were trying to touch hands, but the gap that the Dome cut in the tree line and the barn was much thicker.  Maybe the force field comes out as a wider beam when first established and is then becomes narrower when it is focused."
UnderTheDome,1h9lmx,Panfish,2,Mon Jul 1 02:22:11 2013 UTC,"If you pause at the right moment in episode 1, exactly when the field appears (cutting the cow in half), you can see that it actually descended into the ground, like a lowering curtain. So perhaps it originated high above the ground, in the highest point of the sphere, and spread out, forming the dome shape. It could be that the ""bottom edge"" of it is wider than other sections."

UnderTheDome,1h9lmx,Gladianator,6,Fri Jun 28 21:35:00 2013 UTC,Hopefully they will explain this in the upcoming episodes.  Here's how it's explained in the book:   it's really more like a globe than a dome and it stretches down below as well as above them. Otherwise it wouldn't bee much of a story if they could just dig their way out :P

UnderTheDome,1h7g5b,WheresMyBezel,4,Thu Jun 27 21:41:58 2013 UTC,"Yes. That scene was turrble. Also, I felt every scene where you're reminded that the Sheriff has a pacemaker weren't the best either. It seems like a bunch of the foreshadowing/mysterious stuff didn't work as well as some of the other things in the show.  So yeah, there are a few dicey bits of the pilot but there is enough promise to keep me coming back."

I felt like throughout most of the pilot the acting was a tad off... especially from big names like Dean Norris and Jeff Fahey.  The scene where Barbara and Angie were smoking felt waaaaay to over dramatized and almost forced.  However, as someone who read the book (albeit the week it came out, so it's a little rusty), they seem to be doing a great job with it and I can't wait to see more."

UnderTheDome,1h3bnx,RDPhibes,3,Wed Jun 26 20:54:35 2013 UTC,"The biggest thing that annoys me is how completely unlikable Norrie is.  Most of the other things I understand as them trying to add more drama, or because of the limitations of broadcast tv, etc.  But Norrie was one of my favorite characters (along with Joe and Benny...I love how King writes children of that ageish), and the series made her a completely unlikable piece of shit.  Joe seems fine, though, even though he doesn't have the same uber-smart personality."
UnderTheDome,1h3bnx,sje46,1 point,Wed Jun 26 13:55:09 2013 UTC,Woah. Why such strong feelings about Norrie in the show? I can't think of anything in the pilot that'd urge me to hate her that much.

Does he appear in the pilot? I'd be worried if not, he is an awesome character."
UnderTheDome,1h3bnx,sje46,4,Wed Jun 26 10:07:01 2013 UTC,"The chef is Phil Bushey (name in both novel and series), but instead of being a fucked up religious meth-head, he's a well-rounded ultra-cool black radio DJ for a rock station (I feel like I emphasize race too much when talking about the series, but it just amuses me because there are WAY too many racial minorities in this series for a rural Maine town.  The book explicitly said zero black people live in Chester's Mill.  Take this as amusement, not moral outrage. :P).    I'm a bit sad to see they're not going to have the whole Andy/Chef subplot, which was my favorite in the book just because of how demented it all was.

I kinds dislike King's writing style (Liked The Mangler and The Long Walk but that's it) so I probably won't read the book but it's always interesting to read about differences :)"
UnderTheDome,1h3bnx,CWagner,5,Wed Jun 26 12:04:25 2013 UTC,"In the book, Barbie is a short-order cook at the restaurant, who has been there for not a very long time.  Angie was a waitress.  Her and Barbie flirted a bit but Barbie didn't go beyond that (mostly because Angie was a bit too young and had a boyfriend, Junior).  Angie finally tried to have sex with him but Barbie refused, so then Angie lied to Junior so Junior and his friends beat Barbie mercilessly in the parking lot.  Because Junior is the selectman's son, they got off scot-free.  The book begins with Barbie fleeing town because of it.  I actually don't think that backstory is necessary at all...all that really matters is that Junior irrationally hates Barbie, which already happened in the series.  The Angie in the show and the Angie in the novel are pretty different characters.  They both are dating Junior, but they have different last names (and it seems clear that the Angie from the show is going to last much longer.  Angie from the novel died within the first 20 pages or so.)"

(like this for example [spoilers ahead]: http://i.imgur.com/mqp9Ywk.jpg)  There was plenty of action, great acting and for a pilot episode this was certainly one of the better ones compared to most other shows. Very solid, polished feeling but not revealing too much to keep you interested in what happens next week etc.  I haven't actually seen Jericho so I can't comment on similarity but this certainly exceeds the quality of The Walking Dead from season 2 onwards (haven't seen enough of UtD to compare to TWD season 1).  I'd recommend you just give it a watch, you'd be hard pressed in believing this was from CBS after watching it."
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,xLite414,3,Tue Jun 25 21:50:55 2013 UTC,"Jericho is my absolute favorite show, it does start off slow and drama heavy but it gets over that after around episode 10ish, Under The Dome did not have a good pilot in my opinion."
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,tucker277,2,Wed Jun 26 16:01:13 2013 UTC,"It was much better than I expected, and not as typical as I expected (considering it's network TV). I've read the book, and I'm annoyed by a few changes, but it's very promising so far. That being said, I always would prefer a show like this to be on HBO or something."
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,zombiesingularity,1 point,Tue Jun 25 22:26:56 2013 UTC,"Oh man. I LOVED the opening in the book. Set everything up so perfectly by not just focusing on Dale. The opening of the show was just shit. It's a nice show, I could watch it, but all of the changes are too irritating."
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,Gayburn_Wright,1 point,Wed Jun 26 11:33:40 2013 UTC,"I've just begun the show now, and am thinking about how difficult it is to get into. The changes from the book are killing me."

So many things just completely fucking wrong for no logical reason whatsoever. Like, Junior didn't imprison Angie in their Fallout shelter, he killed her immediately and stuffed her into Angie's pantry."
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,Gayburn_Wright,1 point,Thu Jul 18 12:02:11 2013 UTC,"I just finally got into the pilot last night, since I've been away for work. Couldn't for the life of me do it. Had to stop already"
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,deeferg,1 point,Thu Jul 18 12:18:49 2013 UTC,It's certainly not a bad show. As a standalone piece of brand new IP. But as a TV adaptation it's fucking garbage. I haven't read Under the Dome in a loong time now but I can at least remember when they're doing something entirely different from the books. And I am 100% certain the lesbian couple with their weird-ass goth child weren't in the books.
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,Gayburn_Wright,2,Thu Jul 18 12:39:33 2013 UTC,"To me, definitely worth it. The characters each has their own conflicts but not so much that it shadows the Dome's importance. For now, the conflicts are just under the surface and the mystery of the Dome will most probably be the thing of interest. I'm hoping to see both the conflicts and the Dome's mystery overlap in one episode, meaning the characters deal with two problems at a time.   Right now, yes, it's worth watching. Later, who knows?"
UnderTheDome,1h1cqi,mushaslater,2,Wed Jun 26 12:48:01 2013 UTC,"Was it good? Sure. Was it great? heck no.  Personally, I found the premise great and there seems to be great potential for this show to really hit some awesome heights. The only thing that really bugged me about it is that it seems to be relying on stupid drama that has little to do with the situation.  As long as they keep the drama about living in the dome the main topic it will be worth the watch (see: The Walking Dead).  Also to help you through their dry spell I can suggest some TV I watch during the summer   Copper (Second season premiered last Sunday) Futurama (Wednesdays June 19-Sept 4) Dexter ( Last season premieres this Sunday) Ray Donovan ( First season premiere this Sunday) Camp (First season premieres July 10) Whose Line (New season premiere July 16) Hell on Wheels (Third season premieres August 10) Breaking Bad ( Final season premieres August 11)"

UnderTheDome,1h0s3c,alexanderdrake,3,Tue Jun 25 05:33:31 2013 UTC,"Flair me! Please! Premier in Australia was a few hours later than yours, but was still here reporting in. :D  And to make this post worth reading to others viewing this thread; I am a horror novelist, a hack at best. But Under the Dome marked the third time I had handed out a first draft of a novel to hundreds of friends and 'fans' of mine only to--within a month or two--find King had released a novel of a very, very similar pretense.  This time it had a plane crash, car crashes, and birds breaking their necks into an invisible barrier. But to add to my paranoia my main character (Andrew Sanders) was also a character in Under the Dome (Andy Sanders) leading to a few of my more tin foil hat fans being convinced I was a shill for King 'testing work' on a closed audience.  I had to actually point to publishing dates, etc, to PROVE that I wasn't just some marketing gimmick persona or some such for a few of the more die hard conspiracy fanatics amongst them. But it marked a hiatus of mine from writing as clearly three in a row is a sign I'm not original enough, or at least on the same narrative developmental wavelength as someone with a vastly superior marketing and publishing team and thus redundant!  I am thinking about getting back into writing, but taking a stark new angle, switching entirely from horror to science fiction, but one of the things about writing is--like art--if you change your style your 'brand' ceases to exist. You have to keep pumping out the same cookie cut delivery or fans will turn on you pretty fast. So I'm still hesitant, but hey it makes a great story!  I can be found on Twitter as CreepyAlex or just about anywhere else as Alex Drake. I'd like to say hi to this community, and hope to share some great nights watching UTD with you all, hoping it'll keep up with the fast delivery skipping out on King's very ... verbose and drawn out style that, well, let's face it ... scares most people away from his books. :P  So, it's a pleasure meeting you all! And remember, if you have a pacemaker, do NOT go within six feet of the dome!"

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,sje46,1 point,Tue Jun 25 03:03:30 2013 UTC,Whats funny is that it was out on torrents about 2 hours before it actually aired live (East Coast).
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,sje46,15,Tue Jun 25 03:53:17 2013 UTC,"Book reader here. Really excited about this series, and very happy there's a sub for it, too! Enjoy!"
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,sje46,8,Tue Jun 25 18:47:37 2013 UTC,"I got the book for Christmas when it first came out. Absolutely loved it, never read a book so fast.   I'm halfway through the first episode and I have to say I'm disappointed with all the changes."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,taste1337,1 point,Tue Jun 25 02:06:31 2013 UTC,I am actually really excited to hear about the changes.  I loved the book but thought the source of the dome was kind of hokey.  Looking forward to see where they take it.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,sje46,-1,Tue Jun 25 13:19:43 2013 UTC,"Perhaps book readers should stop getting disappointed when shows don't exactly follow source material. Rather take everything with a pinch of salt, ""it's inspired by and based upon"" the book more than anything else. No book has ever managed to perfectly fit the complex and compact format a story needs for the small screen."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,ryushe,17,Wed Jul 3 18:02:05 2013 UTC,Seems like the kind of show where trying to remember individual names is going to be a bitch.

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,aleatoric,8,Tue Jun 25 03:37:41 2013 UTC,"I think it's pretty good so far.  Changed a lot from the book already, but that's really not as important as people make it out to be."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,InterstateExit,3,Tue Jun 25 02:21:36 2013 UTC,How different is it from the book? Is it something where they took the premise and created their own characters and build stories around them?
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Faustyna,8,Tue Jun 25 02:23:43 2013 UTC,"EDIT: as a show of good-faith, I spoilered this, although I do not think they are spoilers.  Avoid if you're really paranoid about ruining the book for yourself!. A lot of the characters have the same name but totally different personalities/jobs/circumstances.  Dodee (who is Asian in this) is a huge idiot in the book, but comes across as intelligent.  Her boyfriend is a meth head who plays music at a country station.  In this he's an ultra-cool half-black guy who plays rock music.  Barbie doesn't bury a body at the beginning of the book.  Rusty (Linda's husband) is not a firefighter...he is a nurse INSIDE the dome, and one of the main characters.  The teenage characters were very different and were 13, not 17 year old little punks.  Barbie is a newcomer to the town but he made enemies before the dome fell, not after.  But yeah, they created a lot of new characters but kept the same names."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,prozach64,3,Tue Jun 25 02:25:29 2013 UTC,"I'm guessing there is reasons for the changes though, probably to add more drama. Do you recommend the book?"

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Aequa,1 point,Tue Jun 25 02:40:36 2013 UTC,I'll pick up then. I need a good book to read.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Crazygoingslowlyami,5,Tue Jun 25 02:46:15 2013 UTC,So far what I have seen is that every change made so far is completely unnecessary and several seem to be outright damaging to the story. The book is amazing.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Aequa,2,Tue Jun 25 02:48:29 2013 UTC,Well I haven't read the book yet but like most stand alone books adapted into a television show has to be drastically changed in order to have enough content to be able to go along more than one season. I'm guessing if they stayed as true to the story as you would like it would only need one season and then they would run out of content.   The job that has fallen upon the creator/writers of the show is to turn one single book into a successful television series that may be able to last a significant amount of time because I have to say I was impressed with what I saw on tonights episode and I am excited to see what happens next.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Crazygoingslowlyami,-2,Tue Jun 25 02:55:35 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to ask you to edit that with a book spoiler tag.  [like this](#book)"
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Aequa,3,Tue Jun 25 03:01:59 2013 UTC,"I'm not actually sure what part of that needs to be spoilered.  It's all at the beginning, basic setting up of characters in the book.  I don't think I revealed anything that was a twist or vital plot point, I just described the characters o.O"
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Crazygoingslowlyami,-4,Tue Jun 25 04:17:08 2013 UTC,"It's difficult to say considering I haven't read the book. Although just in case they decide to introduce some of these details later on in the TV series, it's usually best to leave it to the discretion of the redditor as to whether they want to know them or not. I am just trying to be precautious as no one really knows what future episodes will bring."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Aequa,12,Tue Jun 25 04:26:51 2013 UTC,"As a mod for this sub, please do yourself a favor and read the book. It'll make moderation here a bit easier for you, especially if you're not sure if something is a book spoiler or just speculation. Or at least give someone who actually did read the book moderation rights in posts.       That being said, the episode was OK. It's got me hooked enough that I'll watch next week to see how it goes. Bit disappointed with Barbie though, and Junior has a horrible character setup so far."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Crazygoingslowlyami,0,Tue Jun 25 04:39:33 2013 UTC,"From what I hear, that makes sense. My friend said there is no way for them to continue the story if it ends like they did in the book, but BKV said they're treating this like a season 1"
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,StealthGhost,0,Tue Jun 25 05:17:36 2013 UTC,Like a season one meaning an introduction to the characters and overall plot development?

I just don't see how it would be possible without changing the story almost entirely in order to keep viewers interested. They're going to have to do a Lost type thing then, and I don't see how that would work. Interesting though.."

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,jman2477,2,Tue Jun 25 20:19:18 2013 UTC,I read the book a couple years ago. I thought about re-reading before the show but figured it'd mess with my head a little.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,bethanyj,7,Tue Jun 25 02:26:11 2013 UTC,"I've never read the book. I mainly watched because Game of Thrones and Mad Men are over and need another show to hold me over. Plus Brian K. Vaughn's name is attached in addition to a bunch of LOST actors, so that was another attraction for me.   My thoughts on the show: a lot better than I expected it to be, but not amazing. I think the premise is OK, but I'm not sure how much longevity it has. Characters seem OK so far but some are more fleshed out than others. It's the kind of show I'm almost afraid to get invested in because I fear it ultimately getting cancelled. I guess I could always read the book, though. Bottom line: I'm willing to watch the next episode. That's more than I can say for a lot of pilots."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,jman2477,1 point,Tue Jun 25 02:35:14 2013 UTC,"Totally agree, I do wish they had just decided to do the book in 13 hours tho, instead of try and artificially create scenarios that would lead to more seasons. I'll watch next week, but I'm looking forward to amazon streaming without those huge commercial breaks."

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,pokerdan,2,Thu Jun 27 17:14:14 2013 UTC,My guess is that in the show he's going to turn out to be involved in Big Jim's drug operation and the opening scene was just a drug deal gone awry.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,sje46,5,Tue Jun 25 02:43:01 2013 UTC,"I haven't read the book, I want to ask for theories on a few things, but I don't want answers from anyone who has read the book as you would just be speaking from memory:   Why the seizures near the dome? What was the real reason for buying all the propane? Is the Sheriff dead or will he be saved at the hospital?   Other thoughts: I thought Juniors character was completely unbelievable. He loves some girl from 3rd grade til now, but he only now snaps that she won""t return his love? How could that scenario even occur? Wouldn't it have been a lifetime of chasing her? And how wouldn't she see how crazy he is until today?  As for communication, I believe some kind of optic communication device could be assembled on both sides of the dome."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,avenged56,10,Tue Jun 25 22:10:17 2013 UTC,"I totally agree about Junior. I hate his character-- he is so unrelatable/unbelievable and to me, when I look at his face, I can't possibly take him seriously. He's always got this face like he just told a joke and he's waiting for a reaction? That's how it looks to me.  I think the worst part about this premier was Junior haha. I love a good character with flaws (I am obsessed with John Locke from Lost), but from the acting to the character he's just terrible.  /end rant haha"
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,Wtfox,4,Tue Jun 25 04:06:26 2013 UTC,"I think the one redeeming quality as a character that he has is how absolutely bat shit and unpredictable he seems. More like Ethan or Ben, less like Locke. He seems manipulative and psychotic. Which although make for a terrible person can definitely make for an interesting character. And the stupid smirk makes him even more unnerving in my eyes. If you watch The Mentalist, almost how I'd imagine Red John to look. Like all of these horrible evil things he's doing are actually funny in his mind."
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,peeinherbutt,4,Thu Jun 27 01:43:00 2013 UTC,Okay! I hear you there! I can see him as an Ethan I suppose. I don't think he's anywhere near smart enough to be a Ben.  And I will try to look at his face that way! I'll try to think of it as a sign of a sociopath haha. See if I can believe him more that way.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,alwayspro,2,Thu Jun 27 06:28:59 2013 UTC,Haha that's what he reminded me of. That skeezy guy that you hate from the start and you just pray dies really fast because he's so disconcerting.  I agree not smart enough to be a Ben. Plus I found that Ben had redeeming qualities in that he really tried to do what was right even if it wasn't actually right. He genuinely thought he was doing good.  But Ethan was just a creepy sociopath who found killing people to be like a game. I hate that guy to my very core.
UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,qqg3,2,Thu Jun 27 18:49:09 2013 UTC,"110% with you! I understood Ben by the end, but Ethan? Never. Even when he would show up after he was gone, any time I get a sight of him I get the spooks!  Hopefully Junior develops that way!"

I found a lot of parallels between the pilot and Lost, apart from the actors. And I think it would be wonderful if Brian k Vaughan made this like Lost. I miss that stupid show -.-  So anyways, I'm hoping for the best!!!"

Guessing the shock you get changes you in some way.  Implants something in you or what not.   What was the real reason for buying all the propane?   Not sure about this.  It'll probably be something big that we can't guess.  Seems to do with money some how.  In reality I'd say hes just a conspiracy nut since he has a huge shelter too but they made way too big of a deal about it.   Is the Sheriff dead or will he be saved at the hospital?   Reality, yes.  Looked like his pace maker jumped out of his heart.  Thing is though maybe the dome is healing him or transforming him and everyone else who touches it, who knows?   As for communication, I believe some kind of optic communication device could be assembled on both sides of the dome.   They probably won't do that but it's a great idea.  Might ruin the show too much or something.  Less of a ""we're totally on our own"" kinda thing."

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,jman2477,2,Tue Jun 25 16:46:30 2013 UTC,"In regards to Junior, my interpretation is that he's tried to play it safe the whole time so that he doesn't ruin any chances with her.

I felt that was better than what we got with the show as everything pointed to it happening and everyone had to talk about the pacemaker with the guy until the final scene.  2) The dome coming down. The show has it come down with a loud boom and big effects shots of dirt and crap flying everywhere and an earthquake and vibrating noises. It made me like and appreciate how the dome came down in the book. No flashy noises or sights, everything just gets cut where the dome lands and no one is none the wiser. A very understated moment for what will deeply affect the town and everyone in it.  And to the characters, it's a mix and match of like and dislike. Sweet, they jumbled a bunch of people so I have no clue what will happen and when. Less sweet, we haven't really got a chance to meet them all so we get the cliched little hits to cutdown run time. Not sweet, changes to Barbie to make him more mysterious, those just seem a little out of place especially if he's supposed to still be the 'hero'."

UnderTheDome,1g8vmu,JPMalone,2,Tue Jun 25 04:23:45 2013 UTC,"I'd say that anything that ""sets the scene"" isn't really a spoiler.  That is, stuff like characters jobs and relationships before the novel sets into action.  If it's something that does change the events of the story, though, it's definitely a spoiler.  I'd argue that Duke's pacemaker exploding is definitely a very important plot point that significantly changes the events of the rest of the novel."

I'm curious to see how they explain an ex-military guy who randomly shows up in town, whom no one knows, and murders a guy, before trying to flee.. I'm intrigued but definitely thrown off. Everything will escalate MUCH slower if the series is to continue.  TL:DR, In short, was disappointed with changes initially.. Hoping that most characters stay true to original character..

From an over-reliance on terrible child actors, to the routinely ridiculous dialogue, to silly plots based around butterflies, I don't think I've ever sat through an entire season of a worse television drama. Even Dexter's disastrous final season was less disappointing. I don't think that 90% of the people in r/UnderTheDome love this show. In fact, I think the subdued nature of this subreddit in general provide pretty compelling evidence that the show has failed to generate a passionate fanbase."

I hadn't read the books but I thought the premise was cool and the writing did a good job of piquing my interest.   The second half of the season, however, saw the acting worsen (especially the young actors) and writing deteriorate. I feel like it may have been a result of the show receiving the green light for a second so the writers need to stretch it out and add some plot twists. I continued to watch in spite of this seeking answers, but ultimately I received no closure and lousy writing/acting."

UnderTheDome,1orbij,testbug0,0,Sun Oct 20 02:48:08 2013 UTC,"No not exactly, criticism isn't a bad thing, if you actually give a reason to it. Other than saying 'emo dome omg wtf this show is shit' But the amount of hate on this sub-reddit is ridiculous now."
UnderTheDome,1orbij,SmokeontheHorizon,1 point,Sun Oct 20 14:13:19 2013 UTC,"It's because the writers have given absolutely no reason for anything that happens. There's plenty of reason for criticism because the writer's haven't even tried to deflect it. Fuck, the show's actors have gone on record saying they need to change the pace fast because even they don't know what's going on. It's a god-awful show by any storytelling standard."

UnderTheDome,1orbij,Philibustah,1 point,Sun Oct 20 14:56:39 2013 UTC,"85%? Really? If that were the case then there wouldn't be as much hate as you describe.   No one ""loves"" this show - I dare you to find me one so I can ask what they apparently love about it. I know you don't love it because you're not defending it, just asking people to stop complaining about things that have been complained about in television for years.  There is nothing redeeming about any of the characters or the things they do. The writers have over 1000 pages of award-winning source material and they chucked it out the window. And for what? Random moments of unexplained ""twists."" Every single ""climactic"" moment is a carbon-copy of Lost - unexplained apparitions, person screaming ""What do you want from me"" at an inanimate object, baby born as soon as someone dies... I mean, come on."

If you acquire one of the coveted talismans, you can pass through over a number of painful hours. But the townspeople inside see these escapees soon pounding on the glass to get back in.

They can have Microsoft surface tablets, that isn't even the issue, just every shot starts with the perfect swipe browsing tiles as if it was an advertisement.  I can handle 10sec of product placement per episode if it increased the budget."
UnderTheDome,1ivno7,SutterCane,2,Tue Jul 23 12:49:44 2013 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. Deeming a group of people haters is the wrong way to go about liking a show. Especially when for almost every hater you actually identify, you probably dismiss a lot more people with legitimate gripes.  It's like what happened with Community's fandom. They deemed everyone who disliked the show as haters and then when the dreadful fourth season came along... legitimate criticism was thrown away as mere 'hatedom'. It was terrible."
UnderTheDome,1ivno7,SutterCane,1 point,Tue Jul 23 12:15:32 2013 UTC,"Your point is valid. However sometimes I dont want to write an essay about why something is awesome, I already went to college for 100 years. I suppose the entire point of this community is to logically critique the depths of this show. I could just say nothing until I feel like writing a complete, perfectly edited and argued response to all the people that spend their time saying negative things about a show that has a bizarre sci-fi premise."

UnderTheDome,1iff91,StokedforLocust,2,Wed Jul 24 06:38:36 2013 UTC,"I agree. Since the first episode all the discussion threads are just filled with people who complain. I don't understand why people keep watching it if they think it's so horrible? I've been enjoying it so far and would like to discuss the story and the content of the episodes, not just ""omg junior is such a bad actor, this show is so cringe worthy""   The last discussion thread was not as bad as the first three with the bashing and hopefully the complainers will just stop watching and coming here. Why waste time on something you don't enjoy?"
UnderTheDome,1iff91,Moscamst,2,Wed Jul 17 07:31:46 2013 UTC,"I'm still a bit on the fence with some aspects of the show, but I am enjoying it as a trashy sort of entertainment. There are parts they definitely screw up, but there's a few redeeming factors too. That said, I do find it fun and enlightening to come here and get the opinions of the group - it makes me evaluate my own perspective in a different light, which is always refreshing."
UnderTheDome,1iff91,anonynamja,2,Wed Jul 17 12:41:52 2013 UTC,"I, too, think that the show is not actually that bad. Sure there are some idiotic moments (the female reporter's matches, the way teenagers talk, etc.) but overall it seems pretty solid entertainment.  I read the book when it came out and can't remember all the details, so the show still manages to keep me on the edge of my seat. I really hope they have a better ending though, the book ending felt forced and lazily made."

UnderTheDome,1hy8il,LukasKulich,1 point,Tue Jul 9 20:39:34 2013 UTC,Junior goes insane in the book pretty much as soon as he is mentioned.
UnderTheDome,1hy8il,k1yle,2,Wed Jul 10 00:04:07 2013 UTC,"Also, in the book he's got a brain tumor growing in his head, which explains his behavior. On the tv show he's just a spoiled bitchy kid."
UnderTheDome,1hy8il,littlehobbit,1 point,Wed Jul 10 15:37:11 2013 UTC,I was wondering how much of his behaviour we can blame on the tumor. I want to say all because what he does is fucked up but I'm not sure
UnderTheDome,1hy8il,k1yle,2,Wed Jul 10 20:19:11 2013 UTC,"I agree. It seems like the tv show is implying that the dome turns people into assholes when in fact, it's just the writers that do so with their poor writing."
UnderTheDome,1hy8il,littlehobbit,1 point,Wed Jul 10 22:01:28 2013 UTC,yea im waiting for the reveal that it will still be the tumor.  but at this point if they reveal that to be the case it might seem like a cop out.

UnderTheDome,1hj61n,wobbily,2,Tue Jul 2 23:45:46 2013 UTC,"It seems they intentionally changed quite a lot about the story. They pretty much kept only the core concept of the dome itself as well as some of the characters (often liberally altered/merged) and then set about telling a story that only vaguely resembles the book. Apparently this was a conscious decision all along, one that Stephen King approved of, but I agree that it does feel a bit like someone skimmed the Wikipedia plot synopsis and tried to recreate the story based on that."

UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,johnnybsd,8,Thu Aug 8 02:47:44 2013 UTC,"Well even before the show premiered, it was stated that the show wouldn't go directly by the book. If you read the book and expected the show to be like it, then I can see where you probably wouldn't like the show. Plenty people I know that have read the book don't like the show; I haven't read the book, so the show is fantastic imo, sometimes the acting isn't excellent but I am overall pleased."
UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,Rider797,1 point,Thu Aug 8 03:03:31 2013 UTC,"I started reading the book after the show premiered, and compared to other modern shows, it has poor writing and acting, so even without comparing it to the excellent book, i could tell its lacking.  I started reading the book after ep4 and finished it before ep5."
UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,MentalSloth,3,Thu Aug 8 05:01:09 2013 UTC,"A problem I know I'll face is reading the book afterward and feeling the opposite. I guess it's just going to come with whichever media you partake in first. All though, the show is giving off the vibe that ""Cell"" did when I read it, so I'm not so sure how I feel. But I don't want to read the book until the story is told in the show on the chance that everything will be ruined for me."
UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,MilkFlavoredCheerios,-1,Thu Aug 8 03:07:16 2013 UTC,"The book has over 100 DEVELOPED characters, a much more realistic humanistic plot, and of course delves into SK's specialty the human condition. Once you read it you will wonder why you wasted your time with a tv show that just rips off an interesting premis....although I am still watching every episode if not to infuriate myself :)"
UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,runealex007,3,Thu Aug 8 03:19:09 2013 UTC,"I am currently reading the book, about halfway now, and I like both of them. they are perfectly great in their own way. if it was the exact same I don't think it would be that entertaining for me. it is pretty much based off the names and a dome and then they are let loose but it is perfectly fine, good story on both ends to sum it up. if you wanted stories to match you wouldn't like the walking dead then."
UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,MentalSloth,1 point,Thu Aug 8 03:15:31 2013 UTC,"I can understand your opinion. I guess I was real excited when I first heard that it would be made into a series. I expected a little bit of a closer storyline, and more of the dark morbidness. I guess this is what you get when it's a network tv series. At least Walking Dead got more freedom being on basic cable"

UnderTheDome,1jxi6o,gudnbluts,3,Thu Aug 8 03:29:49 2013 UTC,"What I can't fathom about the show is why the writers felt the need to change not only certain plot points and arcs, but the very nature and motivations behind certain characters. When adapting a book I understand you must make some changes to the plot just because the pacing in a TV Show or movie is different from a novel, but It is absolute sin to change the nature of a character. Nearly every character represented in the Show is wildly different from their book counterpart."

He was a great character in the book, and this is difficult to do for that kind of straight lead role. Leading men type characters can be very bland, and that's exactly what's happened in the show by them trying to make him some badass right from the start (and doing it badly), rather than a young, hippie greasy spoon cook. just a nice easygoing guy that the townsfolk all know and (mostly) like. And later you find out he used to be military, but people don't know that."
UnderTheDome,1kvs2u,SpackleButt,2,Thu Aug 22 16:27:26 2013 UTC,I think when it all washes out Barbie will not be the guy we think he is. I think that Junior will be the 4th hand and not as crazy as he has been.
UnderTheDome,1kvs2u,SpackleButt,0,Thu Aug 22 19:31:10 2013 UTC,Junior just had a screwed up childhood. But he seems to know what's going on. He did say that Barbie couldn't be trusted.
