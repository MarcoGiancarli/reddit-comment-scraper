Megaman,3e3yx7,the_twelfth_dr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:52:53 2015 UTC,"III was my very first MM game ever, so it holds a special place in my heart. That, and the remixed music I think sounds incredible. Also when I first encountered Punk (the original boss in the game) I felt a Batman vs. Bane vibe because of how much bigger he was and how much I kept losing. But the Wily castle music and end credits music are some of my favorite MM tunes ever. Try it out."
Megaman,3e3yx7,Dash2110,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:44:07 2015 UTC,"IV and V are the best IMO, III was ok but I wasn't crazy about I and II. II was definitely the worst by far, from what I remember reading, it was outsourced to some other developer and they just didn't know MM.  While on the topic of Game Boy games though, it's worth mentioning Xtreme 1 and 2 as well. I thought those were pretty decent spin-offs of X games."

Megaman,3dyjj3,Dash2110,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:09:55 2015 UTC,"Man, I remember the hype surrounding this game, it was announced not long before I graduated high school and at the time I remember reading the news and seeing some early screens on one of my go-to fansites. After X6 there was a lot of hope X7 would get the series back on track. Obviously good intentions but fumbled the delivery in almost every way possible.  Looking back I think they really should have tied the X series up after X5, at least story-wise. Nothing wrong with going back and doing some spin-offs or ""in-between"" games like they did with Command Mission and Xtreme 1 and 2, but by X6 the narrative was getting pretty redundant and you could tell the games were being developed by the B or C team."
Megaman,3dyjj3,Ice_Climbers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the series supposed to be finished after X5, but executives at Capcom didn't want the series to end?"
Megaman,3dyjj3,Dash2110,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's been established that Inafune wanted to wrap things up with X5, but Capcom decided to develop X6 pretty much off to the side with little or no input from him and had to retcon Zero's story as a result.  By that time Inafune shifted most of his attention to the Battle Network and Zero games and thus didn't contribute much to X6-X8 and Command Mission."

Honestly didn't expect their Act I and Act II albums to be ENTIRELY based on Megaman. So when I listened to the first 30 seconds of Hope Rides Alone, and suddenly you hear ""Or so Dr.Wily believed"", I got goosebumps and I was SO IN. Immediately bought both albums"
Megaman,3dqyyj,88MilesPrower,5,Sat Jul 18 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"Try to catch them live sometime if you can! We'd love to have you over in /r/protomen as well.  Also, great picture!"

Megaman,3dqyyj,ntrotter11,3,Sat Jul 18 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"I've never gotten into the Protomen, but if they're as good as The Megas, then color me excited to give them a try."
Megaman,3dqyyj,Jeff1pnt3,3,Sat Jul 18 23:10:15 2015 UTC,And I've never listened to The Megas honestly. But I'll look into them for sure. The Protomen are incredible. Craft such an amazing narrative in their albums that genuinely brings me in and invests my feelings. Can't recommend them enough. But I recognize people's music tastes will always differ. Not every band is for everyone
Megaman,3dqyyj,ntrotter11,3,Sat Jul 18 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"I love how the Megas turned each boss from the games they've done into whole story-songs. So from what I've heard, the Protomen are an even better version of the same."
Megaman,3dqyyj,Jeff1pnt3,3,Sun Jul 19 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"It's really not even fair to compare the two bands. One attempts to adds a more coherent story to previously established Mega Man universe, while the other uses the Mega Man characters as a jumping off point to tell their own original story, very loosely based on the Mega Man mythos."
Megaman,3dqyyj,ProsecutorBlue,2,Sun Jul 19 03:40:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I just assumed it was the same deal, when I get home, they're definitely on a priority list!"
Megaman,3dqyyj,ProsecutorBlue,3,Sun Jul 19 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, when I first heard their music I wasn't a fan (I was expecting them to be more similar to The Megas as well), but after going back and fully listening to their album, and then listing to it again, I realized how brilliantly interconnected the writing was (the reprisals get me every-time).  I definitely recommend them, man. :)"
Megaman,3dqyyj,GizmoKSX,2,Sun Jul 19 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"The Megas, as you described, took songs and made stories out the characters they're for.  The Protomen really just took a few basic elements from the Mega Man lore and took off in their own direction with original songs, characters and stories.  If you're looking for more straightforward Mega Man fan service, the Megas are the way to go.  If you're looking for really good music, characters, and stories, with a bit of Mega Man mixed in, the Protomen are for you."
Megaman,3dqyyj,ntrotter11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:04 2015 UTC,"The two end up being compared often by fans, but really the only things they have in common are Mega Man and Rock.  One isn't necessarily better than the other, because they both do incredibly well what they set out to do. I will say though, the Protomen are amazing live, while the Megas thrive more in their studio work."
Megaman,3dqyyj,Dash2110,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:10:37 2015 UTC,"The Megas base their music on Mega Man themes, mainly sticking to rock. The Protomen write original music, with concept lyrics loosely based on Mega Man, stylistically ranging from hard rock to 80s synth rock to Ennio Morricone-inspired spaghetti Western music. They're very different bands, but both worth checking out."

Megaman,3do6dc,ReasonableGhost,11,Fri Jul 17 21:55:11 2015 UTC,[Final product of the 1st kickstarter hasn't been played and reviewed by the masses yet. So we should be weary of funding another project before we get and enjoy(hopefully) the first one.]
Megaman,3do6dc,ceol_,3,Fri Jul 17 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Which, speaking as a backer of both, is entirely fair. I can understand wanting to get your studio onto another project ASAP, but I think it would have gone so much better if MN9 came out and, as everyone was hyped up for it, he blew open the doors with, ""We're remaking MML now."""
Megaman,3do6dc,mouseywithpower,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:49 2015 UTC,"i just know that every developer that comes to mind does that though. what i can assume is that MN9 is done (it comes out in like 2 months, it's either done or damn close) so comcept needs another project to keep people hired and working. the first kickstarter was a huge success, so why not go back? japanese devs never get this kind of freedom from investors and producers. i totally understand them wanting to keep some of their projects truly independent."
Megaman,3do6dc,trap_clap,0,Sat Jul 18 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"the first kickstarter cannot be a ""huge success"" if it hasn't come out yet.."
Megaman,3do6dc,mouseywithpower,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:28 2015 UTC,they broke the record for most funded game at the time that it finished... that's pretty successful.
Megaman,3do6dc,Strider_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you're wrong about that. But anyways, I think this will make the minimum to get funded, probably barely. My concern with that is, MN9 had 4 million dollars and doesn't look so hot, and it's 2d gameplay. Red ash with less than a quarter of that wants to do an open style 3d world that's gonna need a hefty story to make it worthwhile."
Megaman,3do6dc,Zyr47,9,Sat Jul 18 19:10:56 2015 UTC,"Too soon and the current one doesn't look like what was advertised. I backed MN9 for the $80 dollar tier and so far the game has been pushed back and looks nothing like the concept art. I realize games don't look exactly like their concept art but Beck and Call look so dumb in their ""3d clay style"" when I expected the proportional characters every single design up until after the kickstarter ended. The gameplay is awkward too (having played the beta so that's all I know first hand since) with the emphasis on scoring points through dashing than actual platforming and well.....megaman type gameplay."
Megaman,3do6dc,Zyr47,4,Fri Jul 17 22:36:22 2015 UTC,"I don't even think the 3D looks that awkward, what gets to me is the janky running animations for Beck. Megaman always had a really cool, powerful walk/run cycle in his games, but meanwhile Beck is just kinda bouncing and floppin about. It's really distracting, especially considering that's what you're going to be looking at for most of the game (except for the BLOOSH BLOOSH dashing).  I dunno. I've seen/played better looking Kickstarters. Could still be great, but it may not quite live up to the hype."
Megaman,3do6dc,maharito,6,Sat Jul 18 07:11:10 2015 UTC,"I hope the final build really surprises us because yeah as you say, the flip flop running just looks awful. As it is I ended up moving my order to 3ds because;  A) On a smaller screen the flaws aren't as noticable  B) I don't think my computer can run the final build even though the specs are fine. ""Not Iceman's"" level freezes up my computer (pun intended) and when I asked about it they refused to acknowledge that something int he beta might be janky and look into it but just that my computer was inept."

Megaman,3do6dc,Dash2110,2,Sat Jul 18 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty scumbag move that reeks of desperation on the organizers and Keiji Inafune's part. First you advertise that the game is going to be a prologue, but all of the sudden, you're adding the possibility of playing a main campaign without going into further detail as to what the main story encompasses? I get that it's still in concept, but why risk making your pitch sound so incoherent and messy? Also, I can't imagine that people will be comfortable giving more money for something that is purely in concept stage rather than having more meat (be it through story/gameplay art/gameplay vids/etc.) so to speak. This is just a mess.  Honestly, they should've taken time to develop their pitch such that they'd pitched the full game rather than copy-paste what Legends 3's development sought. Especially when you consider that Legends 1 didn't really need a prologue in order to introduce the player to the story, the tutorial dungeon was fantastic for that purpose."
Megaman,3do6dc,dragonitetrainer,3,Sat Jul 18 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that Inafune's messaging at this point is coming across as messy and a bit desperate. ""Upgrade your pledge and you'll get access to the FULL game, whenever we decide what that looks like"". Is it me or is Inafune pulling the same stuff we tear major developers apart for?  The thing is, it doesn't look like any amount of ""flash sales"" or voting contests are going to do it for this game. Take a look at the daily numbers on Kicktraq, even the biggest announcements are only getting them an extra 20k, and the day after is always a huge dropoff. The number of backers has only gone up a few hundred in the last handful of days as well. I think they're mostly just squeezing every bit out of their current base of support and aren't attracting a whole lot of fresh backers.  I think this might go down as a lesson in humility for Comcept. They thought they could crank out MM-clone franchises before fleshing them out and simply use nostalgia or ""sticking it to Capcom"" as justification for being trusted, but the fans are proving otherwise."
Megaman,3doyo0,ClumsyG,11,Sat Jul 18 01:46:34 2015 UTC,"The flicker and slowdown SERIOUSLY need to be optional. As ""authentic"" as they would like the collection to be, they were just detrimental to the experience."

Megaman,3doyo0,FYININJA,2,Sat Jul 18 03:28:52 2015 UTC,They need an option to disable the flicker and slowdown.  Also really need an Endless Mode like in 9 and 10 that lets you pick weapons and utilities from all 6 games.  They mentioned that 7 and 8 aren't a part of the collection.  Ok.

Megaman,3dmt9o,CloudWolfZero,7,Fri Jul 17 15:26:40 2015 UTC,The classic series is easily the most cartoony of all of the Mega Man series. It's easy to fit aliens in there without need of a narrative reason or any reason at all.
Megaman,3dmt9o,GospelX,6,Fri Jul 17 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that there's probably no narrative reason to include them post Classic series.  While I don't think it would make sense to have a full scale alien robot invasion like MMV in the X series, I think something like an alien robot/weapon crashing on Earth could be pretty interesting.  This robot or weapon could turn the tide of the war one way or the other, so X and company must stop Sigma from finding the weapon (spoilers: Sigma will find it first) and using it for his own nefarious goals.  I haven't played through Zero or ZX, so I can't really say much about how an alien anomaly would play out in their respective timelines."
Megaman,3dmt9o,badgeometry,3,Fri Jul 17 16:34:06 2015 UTC,Don't forget Mega Man 3.  All the stages are supposed to take place on different planets.
Megaman,3dmt9o,DaveSW777,3,Fri Jul 17 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"In addition, it's mentioned that Shadow Man is actually a repaired alien robot"
Megaman,3dmt9o,shadotterdan,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:46 2015 UTC,..... From 3200 years ago or something. Right? That's according to the comics at least.
Megaman,3dmt9o,DudeWynaut,2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"Haven't read the comics yet, I just remember that being mentioned in the behind the scenes books."
Megaman,3dmt9o,shadotterdan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:14:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe they all died to some enigmatic cataclysmic threat which was making its way toward earth, and eventually caused the cataclysm that preceded Legends."
Megaman,3dmt9o,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Another reason why the classics are the best! But I digress, in all honesty I don't know why they wouldn't continue to include them. It seems to fall in line with the ""high technology"" of all of the series. It seems like a perfect fit for the X games for sure. My guess would have to be that they assumed that robots are already alien like enough and adding them to the mix in the post classic series would have required more background on them and a whole new story possibly."

Megaman,3djx5t,Xhynk,2,Fri Jul 17 04:05:17 2015 UTC,I should have asked a better question... who is making this and why? It looks awesome!

Megaman,3djogj,3rdOption,6,Thu Jul 16 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"X and zero needed to go away, and this was a good way to start the slow fade for our favorite heroes as we headed into the legends timeline.  Not only that..but come on.  From a gameplay standpoint, it was wayyyyy fucking cool.   Like...playing as harpuia?   Fafnir?  Fuck yeah."
Megaman,3djogj,cronoes,3,Fri Jul 17 01:11:31 2015 UTC,"Now, if only Capcom will just bridge us into the Legends timeframe..."
Megaman,3djogj,Dash2110,3,Fri Jul 17 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"I got the basic premise of them, but they didn't really build much on their character, especially for X and Zero. They were pretty much like ""I'll lend you my strength"". Compare that to say, X as a cyber elf, who IMO was a deeper character and to me felt like a continuation of him from the previous series."
Megaman,3djogj,shuupadoopdoop,3,Thu Jul 16 22:53:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the game doesn't explain exactly how Ciel made the DNA for Models X and Z. Are they complete recreations of them, or did Ciel just download their cyber-ghosts from Cyberspace and put them in the biometals?"
Megaman,3djogj,yay855,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'm more in the cyber-ghost camp, personally. In large part because I'd like to think Ciel wouldn't try to replicate X again after the whole Copy X fiasco."
Megaman,3djogj,Model_Omega,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:05:29 2015 UTC,But don't you think that pulling X and Zero from the afterlife is pretty cruel now that both of them are at peace?
Megaman,3djogj,iristhetortie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:42:53 2015 UTC,"I'm more of the opinion that both methods are used; Ciel most likely learned from her mistakes when trying to clone someone, but when people are completely dead like X, Zero, and Phantom, she can't really extract their minds into a new shell.  She had to create a new, imitation heroes for those who were dead, but those still probably alive, like Harpuia, Fefnir, and Leviathan, were easily transferred to biometal form."
Megaman,3dlhi0,Protteus,2,Fri Jul 17 06:06:52 2015 UTC,"I guess the answer is none... I've fished around for a while and haven't found anything except Corruption. The lack is pretty disappointing, but what can you do (other than make your own, which I don't have the skills for)?"
Megaman,3dlhi0,kindarilwraja,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"That is disappointing.  I wonder why, there are so many fan games of the mega man variety but not MMX types :/  Well thanks for looking around I guess I shall have to wait it out for Corruption."
Megaman,3dlhi0,kindarilwraja,2,Sat Jul 18 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's because the graphics are more complicated, which makes the whole thing easier to create and maybe more appealing to work with. It may also be that it's harder to modify the original code for some reason, which would make creating hacks harder. And there may be a smaller fan base, but I'm not sure on that point. You'll notice there aren't many (any?) fan games of the original series that are 16-bit style either. More challenging or just more daunting? Not sure."
Megaman,3djkuy,coolguyblue,5,Thu Jul 16 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"Use Xpadder or Joy2Key, some program that lets you map keyboard inputs to a controller. It worked when I tried playing X7 a second time."

Its definitely not as good as the other megaman games, but i find x7 and x8 are still pretty decent games on their own, they did some interesting stuff that would be cool to see someone revisit on 3DS at some point (and then capcom can cancel it mid development and we can all continue on with our sadness)"

Megaman,3demfl,xeth1313,14,Wed Jul 15 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"I feel this opinion won't be popular, but I really don't want to back this as it's just concept art and ideas. I want to see a working prototype of the gameplay and engine. I want to see something other than ""oh yeah we're totally doing thing"". I've seen plenty of other video game kickstarters that had something to show, just look at the one for Yooka-Layle, so I don't see why Inafune couldn't just wait until he had SOMETHING to show."
Megaman,3demfl,Katatonic717,5,Wed Jul 15 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"I'm betting it's because of where they're sitting right now with Mighty No. 9.  Above someone said that the physical retail is causing some delays.  Though I'm sure Keiji Inafune is busy, the rest of his team or contractors are waiting for the next assignment.  The earlier he can get people working on the next project, the better.  At least that's how I'm interpreting this."
Megaman,3demfl,Zaemz,8,Wed Jul 15 20:34:36 2015 UTC,Here's the next project: Give us something to show for our next Kickstarter.

Megaman,3demfl,TibsChris,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:27 2015 UTC,It really sucks to see how it isn't going well. Comcept really should have waited until at least Mighty No. 9 is out.
Megaman,3demfl,GoldGearOne,7,Wed Jul 15 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"wait, another KS? has Mighty No. 9 even released yet?"
Megaman,3demfl,donpedrox,6,Wed Jul 15 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"I agree.  It's too much, too fast.  He needs to let us absorb MN9 and its lore before jumping into something new like that."
Megaman,3demfl,happy_pants_man,3,Wed Jul 15 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kinda don't want to back until I see MN9. From the videos I've seen, I'm not sure if I'm gonna enjoy it as much as I thought I would, so I want to play it before I give more money to comcept.  If MN9 turns out good and they're doing some other sort of donation thing outside of Kickstarter, I'll back it, but I'm a bit wary after the last one."
Megaman,3demfl,digikun,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:24 2015 UTC,The only problem with that is the kickstarter will be over by the time mighty no 9 comes out. Another thing to think about is that it is being made by a different set of people and the game style will be vastly different than mn9.
Megaman,3demfl,CRUMSON,3,Wed Jul 15 22:03:43 2015 UTC,Well that's Comcept's problem then. They should have waited longer.
Megaman,3demfl,dragonitetrainer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I totally get they want to keep busy until MN9 comes out, but it's not our obligation to keep Comcept afloat between projects.  Unfortunately, that's how I saw this particular Kickstarter."
Megaman,3demfl,TheGutsyBat,7,Thu Jul 16 03:15:14 2015 UTC,Im pretty sad to see this isnt doing well.
Megaman,3demfl,TheFlea1,5,Wed Jul 15 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's bumming me out. I didn't read all the stipulations but, if the first part gets funded at $800k, I wonder if they would release the rest at a later time and charger per chapter. I gave $30 but I would have easily done $60 had they not run out of slots at that award level. I can't really do more or my wife will probably kill me."
Megaman,3demfl,BoringAeneas,5,Wed Jul 15 19:48:02 2015 UTC,It'd probably be doing a lot better had Inafune waited until Mighty No. 9 was out. The timing of this makes it look like he's jumping the gun and trying to milk things too soon.
Megaman,3demfl,OMorty,4,Wed Jul 15 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Wasn't MN9 originally due out this month? Because of the physical retail release of the game, it got pushed back. Considering things like this are generally in the works for a while, I bet the debut was in the works for quite some time and couldn't be changed.  I agree, though, that trying to Kickstart this before MN9's release was a bad, bad idea."
Megaman,3demfl,GospelX,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:23:38 2015 UTC,It was originally due in March. They've been delaying it over and over
Megaman,3demfl,dragonitetrainer,3,Wed Jul 15 22:23:38 2015 UTC,It was delayed once.
Megaman,3demfl,ceol_,3,Wed Jul 15 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"My b, for some reason I thought it got delayed to may and then september"
Megaman,3demfl,dragonitetrainer,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"That's probably got something to do with it, but I feel like that would at least get the community riled up. Instead, no one's really talking about Red Ash. I think folks just aren't hyped for a new MML the same way they were a new MM, which I'm very sad about."
Megaman,3demfl,ceol_,2,Wed Jul 15 22:37:34 2015 UTC,"I think many of us are just starving for that MM gameplay.  Those are few and far between these days, which is why MN9 got so big.  As for MML, we want the story, the characters and the world of THAT series.  We wanted MML3.  We, or I guess I, don't particularly see the need for a spiritual reboot."
Megaman,3demfl,TheGutsyBat,2,Thu Jul 16 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's not that people aren't hyped, it's that  1) The KS is only for a sample of the full game  2) Most folks see Inafune as a crook at this point with his obsession with turning Mighty Number 9 into a media franchise even though the first game hasn't even come out yet and Comcept has a track record of lousy or canceled games  3) This is the third or so time Inafune has asked for money from fans, even though his first funded project, again, has not released, and his company apparently has the backup of a publisher now, and  4) ""Kinda sorta Megaman Legends starring a bunch of treasure hunters/thieves"" is not the same thing as ""MML3, where Roll and Tron ally themselves with a biker gang to procure funds to make a rocket and save Volnutt""  So naturally people are cautious"
Megaman,3demfl,red_sutter,2,Thu Jul 16 10:06:09 2015 UTC,"Comcept has a track record of lousy or canceled games   Not really. They've developed a good amount of games, and the only one I can remember being cancelled was Kaio. Not sure where you're getting this idea of ""most folks"" seeing Inafune as a crook.   This is the third or so time Inafune has asked for money from fans   Comcept's KS page only has MN9 and Red Ash (along with the Red Ash animation.) If this is the third time, what was the second?   his company apparently has the backup of a publisher now   For MN9. They're self-publishing Red Ash.  1 and 4 are good points, though."
Megaman,3demfl,ceol_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:15:50 2015 UTC,"In addition, I think people are really underestimating Point #4 as well. I'm seeing a lot of ""shaming"" of MML fans from Red Ash supporters, claiming that Red Ash IS Legends 3 and that they need to support it. It's been laid on thick enough that there is actually some backlash from the MML fanbase, and they are claiming that Red Ash supporters are showing they aren't so much MML fans are they are fans of the basic design style of MML."
Megaman,3demfl,Dash2110,2,Thu Jul 16 12:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first thing I thought when I saw this kickstarter is ""Wait, what about MN9?""   I've yet to see a video that makes me want MN9, so I'm already on the skeptical side of things when it comes to MN9, the fact that they're kickstarting ANOTHER game before we even get a chance to see how well received the first game is kinda worries me. I realize that's probably not why they're doing it, but it still seems horrifically ill advised. While Legends had a pretty big following, it didn't have the popularity of the classic/X series, had MN9 released and been well received, they would have been able to throw in an advertisement for the kickstarter into MN9 (Maybe at the end credits, or on the start menu...or something) and if people were enjoying it, they'd go back it because they liked MN9, rather than relying soley on people who want Megaman Legends."
Megaman,3demfl,FYININJA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:21:29 2015 UTC,It's really fishy that he would do this. I have a feeling that MN9 is going to be very mediocre so before word gets out he's trying to fund this before no one wants to give him any money.  I can't think of anything of another reason why he couldn't wait a couple of months to ride on MN9s possible success. It's so goddamn shady.
Megaman,3demfl,coolguyblue,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking too. If he/they felt MN9 would be a good enough game, waited until it released and rode the wave of good reviews and praise, it wouldve been much smarter. Between this, the delays, and what I've seen of MN9, I don't think it's gonna be better than mediocre and I honestly think they're rushing this kickstarter out to get backing before the MN9 reviews come out. People would be less likely to take back their donation if MN9 is mediocre than they'd be to donate after they've played something mediocre.    They should start a kickstarter for a MN9 game that actually looks like the concept art. That I'd back."
Megaman,3demfl,Strider_,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way brother. That concept art got my dick erect but then the actual game play just ruined any excitement that I had. Come on Keiji, y u do dis?  Edit: Even after all this I'm still tempted to buy MN9 just to see how it is."
Megaman,3demfl,coolguyblue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"Well, while I agree that's it's shady, there's at least one possible somewhat legitimate excuse, and that's that the MN9 team are done. They've got nothing else to do. Perhaps they wanted to start the kickstarter now so they'd be able to work on it ASAP instead of waiting. It's still stupid at the very least, but it doesn't have to be purposefully misleading."
Megaman,3demfl,FYININJA,0,Thu Jul 16 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not. ""Here's some art and ideas, gib money plz."" If this is successful, it encourages more like it.   clearly visualized in the minds of the creative team   Yeah. Ideas are worthless. If you want it funded, show me something that took actual time and effort to make."
Megaman,3demfl,tdlop,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:17 2015 UTC,I'm afraid that this wont get the full 800k backing. I only hope that Inafune has a plan for if that happens or that he wont just let this die out.

Megaman,3dgkz7,8_Bit_Armada,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:23:53 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion for what it's worth.  I've read the hate. I've read the praises. Mega Man was my all-time favorite game growing up. I could not financially back MN9 when the campaign was active. I was able to snag a Signature Edition from Amazon and I couldn't be more excited. I'm not expecting a life-changing game that will wow me and make me wet my pants. Apparently, many people were expecting MN9 to be this huge giant of a game that would be better than Mega Man. It's a Kickstarter, guys. If you expected that, you probably set yourself up for disappointment. What we should expect is a game that is as simple and fun to play as Mega Man. If you don't like the game, that's your prerogative. But I'm here to say many probably expected too much.  About Keiji... I've read comments such as ""I'm so done with this hack""... and ""fuck this guy""... It blows my fucking mind that this kind of hate is going on. Kids these days are so entitled with video games. Kickstarter is awesome, and I feel like the haters need an explanation.... A creator presents an idea. Their idea will cost them X dollars. You can donate to that and receive a reward, or choose not to.  REWARD -a thing given in recognition of one's service, effort, or achievement.  You are not purchasing a product in the traditional sense. You are DONATING to somebody trying to make a product. Keiji has done nothing wrong here. He has a vision, and if you don't like it, move along and quit crying. Nobody is forcing you to follow, like, or donate to his projects.  Now, Red Ash. I initially backed this game, then I canceled it. I think part of me felt like I was missing out on something if I didn't back it because I missed out on backing MN9. Then I realized, I didn't even think Mega Man Legends was as great as everyone else seems to. That and the fact that they didn't have a console edition as a reward made me decide to cancel my donation. What have I lost? 45 seconds of time? I haven't lost a single dime.  TL;DR Don't like the project? Don't back it! That's exactly how KS works. Most of all, quit acting like a jackass about it. Simply don't back it.  Edit: down votes without constructive feedback? Guess I found the butt hurt entitled kiddies. By all means, down vote. Doesn't mean I don't have a valid point."
Megaman,3dgkz7,Jennite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you, but I feel like you're missing the bigger picture here. First of all, people have a right to be upset about not receiving backer rewards, which is something that's come up in a lot of discussion about Comcept. It's a breach of trust and the biggest way to ruin reputation.  Now, the issue with Red Ash specifically is not that people are upset that Comcept is asking for money. People are upset because it seems like Red Ash is rolling solely on the Mega Man Legends name with only concept words. It seems underhanded because it's a company riding on rapport that they haven't earned yet.   And just because you can choose not to participate doesn't mean it's ok for them to try to get money for such little content. It's like if your friend started going around asking people to fund his game that he has an idea for, would you be ok with him asking money from you and your friends for something that just has concept art and ""it'll be like MMLegends?"" Maybe I'm cold-hearted, but I'd be frustrated with that friend for even asking something like that without some proof of delivery.   Comcept has been all talk for a while now, and with recent developments, people are worried that the ""vision"" they promised to help Comcept achieve is no longer what Comcept is trying to do. It'll all come to a head when Mighty No. 9 releases. While a lot of people might have grand expectations, Comcept is definitely partially to blame because there was a ton of hype coming from them back in funding days. They have to deliver, or their reputation will be ruined."
Megaman,3dgkz7,8_Bit_Armada,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"People have not failed to receive their backer rewards. So there's no right to be upset by it. Estimated delivery date is not a hard delivery date. This is part of the risk that the backer (not purchaser) assumes when supporting any project. What exactly have people 'failed to receive'?  Why does it ""seem"" like they are using the MML name only? Isn't MML3 what fans have wanted for years and years? Now the creator of the franchises namesake offers a potential solution and he's suddenly ""rolling"" solely on the MML name? How does this seem underhanded? This is pure speculation.   It's like if your friend started going around asking people to fund his game that he has an idea for, would you be ok with him asking money from you and your friends for something that just has concept art and ""it'll be like MMLegends?"" Maybe I'm cold-hearted, but I'd be frustrated with that friend for even asking something like that without some proof of delivery.   People are getting their feelings hurt too easily. Which is my whole point. If you don't trust your friend, why would you be so angry at him? Just say ""no, sorry"". It's that easy, it really is.   They have to deliver, or their reputation will be ruined.   I don't disagree, but you have to remember this is also part of the risk assumed by Comcept. It's all going to be ok, I promise. The game will be fun or the game will suck. Their reputation will be ruined, or it won't be ruined. They'll deliver or they won't. It happens all the time, and due to the nature of KS, risk is more prevalent.  My suggestion is- don't back anything if your faith in that company is shaken. End of fucking story."

Now the creator of the franchises namesake offers a potential solution and he's suddenly ""rolling"" solely on the MML name? How does this seem underhanded? This is pure speculation.   Red Dash is not the same as wanting to see Volnutt return from Elysium, and that's why I don't want to back this project. I'm aware that the goal is to emulate the Legends feel and gameplay style, but for me personally (and I can't speak for all Legends fans, though some have expressed similar ideas), the lore of the Legends series was so great that I want to see how the conclusion of the story is, rather than a new coat of paint on a structurally similar game. The problem I have too is making the game a prologue when he could've just went ahead and made the first game in the series like he did with MN9, it just doesn't make that much sense to me, especially with a game that's supposed to be an RPG. You need to focus on telling a grand story and essentially, create a ""legend"" in which the game is based around."

Megaman,3ddpev,astrobear,2,Wed Jul 15 17:39:54 2015 UTC,"Metal Blade and how it destroys a majority of bosses and larger enemies in the game. Honestly I feel if they limited the ammo much more it would have been better.  Speaking of too much ammo, do I really need 112 Quick Boomberangs?  The game is honestly the easiest in the series with nothing other than occasional endless pits being a challenge. The only 'difficult' boss is boob-wall because the minimal error it allows.  Sure the idea was cool but MM2 definitely has the biggest letdown in terms of final boss difficulty. Jump, throw a bubble, jump, throw a bubble, jump, throw a bubble, win!  MM2 definitely helped solidify the IP as a series but it was not the best by any means."
Megaman,3ddpev,Skaarg,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:51 2015 UTC,"Why are you being downvoted for stating valid points?  I like Mega Man 2, but I feel that it's given a free pass if only because it's superior to the first in all aspects, and set the stone for all the series staples.  Also, Wily 1 ranks nowhere near my top list of stage themes."

Megaman,3ddpev,Skaarg,0,Thu Jul 16 00:09:07 2015 UTC,Metal Blade is seriously imbalanced.  The Boobeam Trap should not have been vulnerable only to the Crash Bomb.  The death beams (Quick Man) and vanishing blocks (Heat Man) should have been a bit easier to do.  Some of you need a reminder: a downvote means the comment does not add to the conversation.
Megaman,3ddpev,TibsChris,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you on the metal blade being OP and that boss being a ridiculous amount of trial and error puzzling, the beams in Quick Man's stage can be frozen, and Heat Man's level can be bypassed by one of the adaptors.  I find the action pretty perfect, and the design is 100% better than the original.  There are SO many staples of the series in that game."
Megaman,3ddpev,astrobear,0,Wed Jul 15 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that the design is better than the original, but the beams and blocks require those techniques by all but the most skilled platformers. This puts some limits on the order you could beat the bosses.  Those concerns are minor compared especially to Boobeam Trap, and while MM2 is fun and contains great music and many series staples, it is far from the best of the set because of those flaws.  I also forgot to mention how damn long it takes the ""cutscene"" to introduce the new weapon (without even demonstrating it). The first time I beat Heat Man was as the last of the eight, so I went straight to Wily without making much use of the fire weapon. I had no idea it could be charged until years later. Weapons that are only rarely conditionally useful are not good weapons. The MM2 weapons aren't great.  For my money, MM9 got this mostly right: the array of weapons has multiple uses as the game progresses."
Megaman,3ddpev,TibsChris,0,Wed Jul 15 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"I responded to a comment about mega man 2 in a previous thread...  I think it sums up what's wrong with MM2:   Man. You did it.  You won this whole fucking thread.  Mm2 was far too easy. All bosses had ridiculous weaknesses - if you just fuck around with the weaponry, you are guaranteed to find something that could INSTA KILL A MOTHA FUCKA! (Don't care that it was for normal mode only).  Like...cmon, man. Don't reward me THAT much for deciding to fuck around with a charge shot that I don't care to use outside of this battle.  Like, these bosses had close to four weaknesses a piece. Paper, rock, scissors gameplay? How bout rock beats bigger rock? Which is ok, because everything is a rock (man)! It all wins!  The game is overrated in terms of megaman gameplay.  Music is cool, but again, bro...  You won the thread.  Because that wily stage 1 theme can go fuck itself deep into the ass with how much I have heard it remade. You want hip hop? Got it. Metal? Try 80 different versions. Oh, do you want some Enya??? We got that too!  Fuck, let's just go all Mozart on that shit, then add in some Kanye because it's the greatest theme ever (but don't worry, ima let you finish).  Fuck megaman 2"

My main point is that when I think of Mega Man, I almost always go to 2 because that's what my mind immediately goes to for the staple of the classic series.

Megaman,3ddpev,Doommarine23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:33:20 2015 UTC,Interesting list but I feel that it would just be more interesting with actual reasons you feel these games are so good? I am genuinely wondering as to why you feel that way. I am always up for a good chat.
Megaman,3ddpev,Doommarine23,2,Wed Jul 15 20:57:00 2015 UTC,X2 and X3 lack the extra details of X1 but are still fun. X5 love it but really hate the small text boxes but X and Zero are the most balanced.
Megaman,3ddpev,Doommarine23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"I'd agree to an extent. I think X2-X3 lacked  music detail as well, they were nice songs (some of X3's are very lacking) but they did not sound as dynamic and the instrumentals were more plain.  I really did miss the level changes X1 had, I don't think either X2-X3 did, though X3 to its credit, did have some things like the little gun-bots losing their cannons and turning green, and the little details like killing bit/byte early or how Zero can be called in at certain moments or how Doppler/Zero can help you at the end. The ride-armor system wasn't used perfectly either but it was a really cool system to have. Though I feel X3 shows obvious signs of rush and perhaps even reaching SNES limitations.  I haven't played X5 myself, I heard its really good, if you don't mind me asking, how come you love it? I haven't had the chance to play it yet.  Thanks for the chance for a little chat about this, interesting to see your input."
Megaman,3ddpev,Doommarine23,2,Thu Jul 16 01:37:59 2015 UTC,Also X2 and 3 lacked useful weapons and being able to affect bosses(like cutting of launch octopus' tentencle). The snes games did have the normal lemons being useful where as X4-6 the charge shot is only useful. As for X5 Falcon armor! And I really just like it. I just do
Megaman,3ddpev,nachoiskerka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"Man you really reminded me of that, at least like 3-4 bosses got dynamically affected by their weakness in X1 and in X2-X3 that is pretty much gone, I don't even think minor-changes like how chill penguin burns or spark mandriller freezes is in X2-X3. (at least not that I remember).  I'm a bit mixed about the pea-shooter's damage myself, but I haven't played X4-6 as much as I've played X1 so I'd need to play more myself really.  I agree the Falcon armor is great looking."
Megaman,3ddpev,TriumphantBass,2,Thu Jul 16 01:56:19 2015 UTC,God I love Megaman . People also bash X8s design but I like them X looks more mature and dark mantis is the coolest. Command Mission has the best character designs as well.

It looks kind of interesting.  I like the X8 designs quite a bit. Honestly I think X8 was a great game, maybe not perfect, but imo was the first right step into a 3D Megaman Game that sadly in a better world, would have gotten a sequel that would iron it all out and be amazing."

Megaman,3dclwc,Frigatedate,3,Wed Jul 15 05:35:52 2015 UTC,"I think as a series, x evolved in a cheap direction sometimes.Pop quiz: what's the difference between quickman's stage in megaman 1 and megaman x5's bad ending zero stage? Answer:scrolling. In megaman 1 quick man's stage paused as you fell to give the layout of the stage as you fell like a picture book while you took in the pattern and ran with it. Megaman x5 just dropped you down and told you to die for your bad ending. The scrolling doesn't allow you to take in the pattern at all for the lasers and the stage drops. In this case, the level design didnt necessarily think about how the laser mechanic might be affected.  Now thats not to say x5 is a bad game, but that it was when the x series started to lose it's way in the brilliance of earlier level design like x3 or x.  Now that said,x5 had some of the best boss fights of all time. The x5 series  '''' x  deserves all the praise itll ever get for the epic way it presented its boss fights. The warning siren, the taunts and even the prelevel boss descriptions gave the fights a big, main event wrestling match feel. But more than that, it made bosses feel dangerous. I mean, thats impressive in a game where you just spent the last 5  minutes wrecking an army of hundreds of mooks atop a spiked roller coaster platform of death."
Megaman,3dclwc,nachoiskerka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:14 2015 UTC,"Quick Man was in MM2. Also, the lasers aren't an example of evolution; they're just simply an example of falling back to series tradition for the sake of tradition, despite all indications that absolutely no one likes the lasers, and we sure as shit didn't want them in X5. Other than that, your example is spot-on."
Megaman,3dclwc,nachoiskerka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying that it was an evolution, only that in Quick Man's stage it paused and the screen scrolled down so you coulld see where the lasers were gonna launch. In mega man x5, the active scrolling screen works to your disadvantage since you can't really see where they fall before you get there and get a bunch of cheap deaths."
Megaman,3dclwc,curiomime,2,Thu Jul 16 02:06:43 2015 UTC,"The music from the early SNES titles was always pretty stellar in my opinion.

So colorful and jamming!"
Megaman,3dclwc,Dash2110,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the hard-rock style music the SNES games went for - to the point of indifference to X4 and maybe X5, and outright disgust for X3's PSX version.

Megaman,3dclwc,egnards,2,Wed Jul 15 07:08:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sure most of my feelings on the X games will be echoed by others, but one aspect of them I loved were the intro stages. When playing the Classic games, it felt a bit isolated. However, with the X series the intro stages gave me this feeling of conflict on a larger scale. X and Zero on their hoverbikes (RIP Green Dude), riding copters while others were getting shot down, etc. It not only made you think that the Maverick Hunter vs. Mavericks conflict was more like a full-fledged war, but it made playing the games that much more exciting."
Megaman,3dclwc,Weltall548,2,Wed Jul 15 12:56:08 2015 UTC,Its funny because while the famous Sequalist video by Egoraptor talks about how amazingly genius the intro stages were I never really enjoyed playing them - Having grown up with classic Mega Man I always felt slowed down when I had to jump into these intros - However I still find the series as a whole to be amazing.

Megaman,3dclwc,rlrthesecond,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"I believe that X6's more glaring flaws are holdovers from X5. It's interesting to wonder how X6 would've come out different if, even if they rushed it or not, they would've changed up some of X5's mechanics, such as: * the two-armor system * the stupid-as-shit parts from reploids system * starting with the last game's armor and treating it as the de facto loadout * ropes, ducking and walls blocking shots.  The first one is unfortunate, as once again, the armors are pretty awesome (especially the Shadow armor). The starting armor thing is a point of contention, too: the fourth armor was excusable by virtue of giving you hover and the powerful as fuck plasma shot, while the Falcon armor... the Falcon armor gave you a gimped charge shot, for fuck's sake. And the walls blocking shots? They should've just removed it entirely. Want to see why the game isn't fit for it? Use the Yanmar Option."

Also, the music was forgettable (save for a few choice tracks). In my mind, it's like they gave X3's remastered soundtrack the X4 treatment, only more half-assed."
Megaman,3dclwc,Archangel489,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:55:56 2015 UTC,Zero sucks in X4 and x needs mark gatha. The 90s cartoon ruined X's character and shat on the X series.
Megaman,3dclwc,DudeWynaut,2,Thu Jul 16 00:26:07 2015 UTC,I loved the movement and utility of weapons that you got in X2. Its a shame that not much other of the weapons are designed that way in any of the other games.
Megaman,3dclwc,Archangel489,2,Wed Jul 15 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"Spoilers!  The X series, for me, is something that went on too long in the chronological/ numerical sense. You could tell by X2 that the story was getting exhausted. That's not to say that it was bad, but in all honesty, as much as I like a lot of the games, the series is 7 games too long. Here's how the series goes:   X1: Zero dies and X saves the world. Feel like a badass. X2: X brings Zero back. This defeats the purpose and meaning of Zero's death in X1, as well as the purpose of your mad gains from the first game. Also RIP green biker dude. X3: X and Zero do stuff. It's the first game you get to play as Zero. Because why be stronger than Zero when you can play as him? That's what we wanted all along, right guys? Also X is supposed to destroy Zero but this isn't revealed until the credits. Get it? This is how we kill the franchise! X4: Zero is revealed as a creation of Wily (he doesn't know this though, you're supposed to figure that out) but we can relate to him because he has a girlfriend (human gf? Robot gf? Who cares), but she dies so that makes Zero personable and human. X5: Inafking intended for this to be the last one. You have to play the X story for both of the endings. In the true ending, Zero dies and everything is over... which is a restatement of X1. X forgets him and then the Zero series was supposed to be next. Awesome. Beautiful. In the alternate ending, X picks up the Z-sabre and does stuff... which leads to X6. Also the bosses have stupid Guns N' Roses names because the translator's husband liked the band. Then they divorced. What a way to leave us with an artifact of a failed marriage. X6: Stuff happens and Zero is back. Again. Then he's supposed to seal himself for the Zero series. ""I mean it this time guys really lol."" - Capcom X7: Axl happens and it's just the worst. BURN, BURN TO THE GROUND. X8: Inafking kills the series by killing Sigma, by giving us a girly bad-guy male(?) antagonist, and by providing a generally uninteresting story. Thank you based Inafune. It was actually an improvement from X7.   A better alternative to giving us so many numbered sequels would have been, in my opinion, to give us stories with a subtitle. Something similar to a comic book series. Sound familiar? Megaman X: Command Mission. Now that was a good game. It came totally out of left field and it departs from all the crap. We get little-to-no mention of Sigma, characters die and betray you, and it's story-driven. It's not the best game, imo, but damn was it fun for an RPG and compelling.  X9, as a continuation of the series after X8, is a bad idea. There! I said it! Why not give us Mega Man X: The Maverick Wars? The guys that made Mega Man X Corrupted had the right idea."
Megaman,3dclwc,DudeWynaut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"I sorely wish that they continued the Maverick Hunter X reboots. I'd kill to see the additional characterization that they would've brought.  But yeah, you have a point there. While the games continue to chronicle the Hunters' war against Sigma, the first game's theme of X's growth and unlimited potential felt left behind. By X3 (or even X2, depending on your tastes), finding capsules lost its charm and became another routine thing to do in the game.  That said, it'd be interesting to see how the remakes would've followed through with its theme of X's growth. Or maybe it would've yet again chronicled Zero's rise to stardom, I dunno."
Megaman,3dclwc,Archangel489,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"X5's canon ending was zero dying and X takes on the mantle. After 100 years of more  fighting X was supposed to become worn down and tired, then slowly be corrupted as he stopped caring."

Megaman,3d9ion,waterfromhell,9,Tue Jul 14 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"My main gripe without having played the game is that the world looks so uninspiring. Most of the levels from what I have seen look like warehouses and gameplay looks okay, probably real tight and everything but so drab at the same time. Maybe it will be a smash hit but I am afraid that it will go down as a failure."
Megaman,3d9ion,Deivid89,8,Tue Jul 14 16:21:02 2015 UTC,"My main problem is that the graphics look really dull, and they don't look anything at all like the concept art. If it was hand-drawn like the concept art, it would have been amazing.  I still really want to try it, though."
Megaman,3d9ion,JBroXNari99,2,Tue Jul 14 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"yeah, it really lacks the Mega Man charm we have all come to love and is abnormally dull"
Megaman,3d9ion,shows7,5,Wed Jul 15 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"I played the very first Beta and that's it. I made the decision to not play anything else until the game came out. I'm still pretty hype for it, especially now that's mere months a way (Though I have to poo poo them for missing the opportunity for a September 9th release).  If I had to guess, it's because the game's main mechanic, shoot-n-dash, maybe a bit too much of a departure from Mega Man's jump-n-shoot (something that sounds really silly as I'm writing it but makes perfect sense once you play the games side by side).  /u/dragontrainer is also right that a lot of the negative reception was overhyping it. I can't exactly blame people for this given Capcom's treatment of MM in recent years. Having only played the very first beta, I'm reserving judgement for whether or not Beck is boring until I actually play the game in its entirety."
Megaman,3d9ion,badgeometry,3,Tue Jul 14 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"The dash is a good bit of it, specifically that the dash is required.  It's like being forced to fight every enemy in Mega Man 3 by first hitting it with several shots, then getting in close and finishing it with top spin, but if the spin hits a second enemy, you'll take damage.  Part of the fun of MM was the choice between playing a long or short range game.  I'm mostly a distance (and a plodding) player, preferring X to Zero in X4, so the swap to short range and ""rush rush rush"" doesn't appeal.  When it comes out, I'll play it and once I get over it not being what I really want, will probably come to enjoy it on its own merits, but it has something like the uncanny valley working against it.  It's so close to what's wanted, but not quite.  I can't say Beck has less personality than Mega Man (who honestly doesn't have much, just a few cutscenes and boss intros).  If anything, the problem is Beck has more ""personality"": http://www.mightyno9.com/en/project2-overview%EF%BD%B02 Specifically, he's Slimer from ""The Real Ghostbusters"".  Mega Man is supposed to be the initially outgunned but competent hero.  Beck seems written as someone the enemy wouldn't take for good reason.  No judgement on Dr. White vs Dr. Light and Dr. Wily vs Dr. Blackwell yet.  Dr. Sandra looks FAR too happy and glowing for the plot.  (Not classic MM's ""the robots are going to take over"", but X's ""the robots are here to kill us all"".)  Reminds you of a certain ""clumsy"" character in X4.  Call... no, we didn't need another Alia.  If you're going to give us that though, give us the option to have the game auto-pause when a transmission comes through, or for the transmission to wait until we select to receive it from the pause menu.  I hate missing things because I'm in the thick of battle, then there's no way to get the text back.  On the other hand, if we can play the game as Call/Roll/Alia or Ray/Protoman/Zero and one of them doesn't have the ""must-dash"" mechanics, that will be my favorite character.  Do we need an annoying sidekick bot or 20 (Rush, Beat, Tango, Fliptop/Eddie, Auto, whatever the power plug is called in M#9)?  On the plus side, I think after losing to a boss a few times, the plug started consistently giving me an extra life and an e-tank.  Some will consider it being too easy on you, but it allows you to practice until you figure out the patterns.  I'm fairly sure that even as you're trying to dash through the end boss so it doesn't regen hit points, the boss'es shots can still hit you.  Hopefully the special weapons will cause a paralyze effect."

Megaman,3d9ion,protochief,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people played it in Beta  It's a combination of over-hyping the game, and the game itself. The stages are extremely boring, and Beck is boring too, the game has too much emphasis on dashing to kill. Watch how many times Beck dashes in this 80 second trailer. It's wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to many (I think i counted like 19 before)  Also the graphics are kinda shit"
Megaman,3d9ion,dragonitetrainer,8,Tue Jul 14 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah man fuck dashing. I mean look at this shit game and how many times he dashes. Obviously indicative of a bad game when the player utilizes a central mechanic to complete a level.  /s  As someone who was in the beta, it was pretty fun, and that was without having any weapon swapping. It felt like classic Mega Man with a great twist. The graphics are also pretty good considering they didn't have a full budget to work with."
Megaman,3d9ion,ceol_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:51 2015 UTC,Have you played Azure Striker Gunvolt? How does it compare to that?
Megaman,3d9ion,LumberjackPirate,3,Tue Jul 14 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Not the guy you asked, but I've played the MN09 Beta and also Gunvolt. Gunvolt feels more like MMZ than Classic MM. The game's main mechanic is tagging enemies with barbs and then draining their energy with an electrical attack that targets tagged enemies. Very different from MN09.  It's a short game, but pretty enjoyable. If you like a challenge, 100%ing the game will really test how well you use your skills. The plot is pretty standard. My only complaint is that the art style doesn't really jive with the overall tone of the game. The protag looks like your typical shonen hero but talks and act like a hardboiled cop. But that's a nitpick.  If you find that it's up your alley, you'll be happy to know that there's already a sequel in the works."
Megaman,3d9ion,badgeometry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"This is based off of my time with the beta client (which was an old build with only three levels) as well as information that's been released.  I would say they both fall in between Mega Man classic and Mega Man X, with MN9 skewing more towards classic and ASG more towards X. They're more similar than different for sure.  MN9's levels feel a bit more open than ASG's, but they're both still ""run to the right"" and feature similar levels of platforming and ""run-and-gun.""  Their combat feels different from each other, but they're both the same complexity, if that makes sense. Gunvolt has his electrical charge that works as both an offensive weapon, a shield, and a ""parachute,"" so that's pretty complex, but he doesn't have access to any major weapon changes that alter his playstyle drastically. MN9's combat is simple -- i.e. stun and absorb -- with no ""gimmicks"" like ASG, but the way he goes about it changes depending on his weapon.  They both have the same amount of story, which is given to you as you play in little dialogue boxes. However, ASG has a very ""teen"" feeling (you're rescuing an anime princess-type and end up living with her) while MN9 seems to be aiming more towards kids (but still offers gameplay difficulty for adults.)  They both have a grade and highscore mechanic to increase replayability, and they both have variations on the ""challenge mode"" concept: MN9 has stages that you complete (either solo or co-op) while ASG has a challenge log that you check off as you replay the old stages. MN9's score is tied to how long you chain together ""perfect"" absorptions, which is when you have very little time between stunning the enemy and dashing into them. It changes how you approach levels, which is pretty neat.  While ASG has an equipment and crafting mechanic similar to Zero, MN9 allows you to absorb temporary buffs from enemies in the level that alter your gameplay. For instance, after defeating a certain enemy, Beck's shots will pass through enemies and walls for a brief period of time.  Honestly, if you enjoyed ASG, I'd say MN9 is an instant purchase. A lot of folks were thinking it was going to be an exact remake of Mega Man classic with new stages, so they got upset when the dash mechanic was shown off, but it's really fun to play. Dashing puts a cool spin on gameplay and allows the level designers to do interesting things."
Megaman,3d9ion,ceol_,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to the game, but I think most people are down on it because it's so obviously a ripoff of the Mega Man character, levels, soundtrack & franchise. I know it's the same creator but still."

One thing I always did was to basically sacrifice a life (assuming you have more than one) to understand the pattern more than trying to beat him.  It's tough to not get hit at the beginning when he's first coming into the room, but for all other shifts once you understand the pattern, you can jump over the ""blocks"". In some cases you will jump over only one, and in others you will want to clear two.

Megaman,3d106f,CaptainSidekick,2,Sun Jul 12 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"Obviously Capcom will do something with the franchise, but Mega Man has had at least one title per year since 1987. Nothing has really come out since 2010...plus Keiji Inafune isn't working in Mega Man...I don't get why this sub, which is all about Mega Man thinks this hyperbole."
Megaman,3d106f,Dash2110,12,Sun Jul 12 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"It's hyperbole because there's no real criteria for calling a franchise ""dead"". Mega Man may be pretty dormant right now but what constitutes dead? No game in 5 years? There was 8 years between Super Metroid and Metroid Prime. 5 years between Link's Awakening and Ocarina of Time (7 years if you want to count only full-size console games, Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time). I can probably name a handful of other franchises that had bigger gaps but made resurgences.  Then there's the notion that Keiji Inafune is the only reason why Mega Man existed and without him at Capcom nothing will ever come of the franchise again. The reality is Inafune isn't a god, he was a single artist who may have later produced numerous Mega Man titles, but does not have some kind of mystical power where him leaving Capcom has doomed the IP for all eternity.  Are things a bit depressing right now for lifelong Mega Man fans? Sure. Does that mean there will never be another game and Mega Man is ""dead""? I can't say that with any certainty and I don't think any of us can."
Megaman,3d106f,bobbybobster55,3,Sun Jul 12 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"Kid Icarus also took around 15 years to get a sequel after myths and monsters. Granted not that many people knew what it was until then, but you get the point."
Megaman,3d106f,CaptBakardi,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"Then there's the notion that Keiji Inafune is the only reason why Mega Man existed and without him at Capcom nothing will ever come of the franchise again. The reality is Inafune isn't a god, he was a single artist who may have later produced numerous Mega Man titles, but does not have some kind of mystical power where him leaving Capcom has doomed the IP for all eternity.   Well, saying ""a single artist"" sells his contributions short even if you add some of what he brought to the franchise after. However, the real issue isn't that Mega Man can't exist without him but that Capcom seems opposed to Mega Man existing without him as evidenced from their cancellation of every title when he left and their lack of original material and constant rehash of the same games (i.e. Legacy Collection) which is ultimately one of the biggest issues that Keiji, Hideo and myself all have against Japanese gaming and specifically Capcom. The lack of originality is difficult to come to terms with (though, Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty, et. all beg to prove that it is not just Eastern gaming). However, you are right, the franchise is not dead.   I honestly expected Capcom to Guitar Hero it and attempt to milk the cow once MN9 was so successful much as some crappy looking Guitar Hero game was announced shortly after a great looking Rock Band shows its face...it just looks mostly bleak for the foreseeable future outside of spiritual successors."
Megaman,3d106f,Dash2110,2,Mon Jul 13 02:27:33 2015 UTC,"Good points. Yes, he was an artist who later became the creative head of the franchise and produced many of the titles we know all and love. I don't want to sell his efforts short, but just wanted to temper some of the feelings that Mega Man can't live without Inafune.   If we want this franchise to last decades, I think we need to accept that major players in its development will eventually leave the scene and move on to other things. It's up to Capcom to be good stewards of the Blue Bomber, and although many can validly say they currently are not, doesn't mean the future is doomed."
Megaman,3d106f,CaptBakardi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"If we want this franchise to last decades, I think we need to accept that major players in its development will eventually leave the scene and move on to other things.   I think the most interesting thing of all of this is that they have already moved on and they're currently working under Inafune again on spiritual successors. This isn't the final nail in the coffin per se, but to use my other analogy, while Guitar Hero lives on, Harmonix makes Rock Band and they're better...so. Take it all for what you will. I don't disagree with any of your points but I do completely lack faith in Capcom (Super Hyper Turbo Edition)."
Megaman,3d106f,-worriednerds-,2,Mon Jul 13 14:15:56 2015 UTC,"Hello, so I wrote the article being discussed here. First off, it is awesome seeing my stuff on Reddit and being discussed, and your response was great. Yes, I did use a bit of hyperbole in my title, there is no denying that. I'm a fan like everyone here, and I'm fully aware that Mega Man will be back before we know it. I picked the title so people would read the blog post. I stand by the idea, that at least for the moment, that Mega Man is dead. I'm sure he'll be back and that there will be awesome games in the future. I do feel though, that if nothing else, the Keiji Inafune era of Mega Man is dead. The franchise has been put on ice, and like so many other great franchises, will be resurrected. It's a constant theme in the world of video games to die and come back. If the language was too severe, I apologize. The title ""The Death of Mega Man"" is just a lot more attention grabbing than ""The Hiatus of Mega Man"". Not trying to mislead anyone, and thanks for taking the time to both read and discuss the article. If you haven't I really recommend checking out the Keiji Inafune article linked at the bottom."
Megaman,3d106f,digikun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I reckon the title is to just get people's attention. I did not think it would be meet with such a push back because the author said that mega man is dead. IMO, which doesn't seem to be popular in this sub, is that Capcom spitefully pulled the plug on Mega Man because on Inafune. Hyperbole or not, I thought it was an interesting article."
Megaman,3d106f,jaamfan,2,Sun Jul 12 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think there's something coming soon from Capcom. Mega Man is in Smash Bros, and Sakurai said that he didn't want any characters with ""no future"", so he at least thinks something's happening. Combine that with the collection coming out (which is itself pretty weak, to be honest) and the cartoon leads me to believe Capcom is trying to bring Mega Man back into the public attention once again.  Here's to hoping that they're not judging his popularity on the sales figures of the collection!"
Megaman,3d106f,Terbose,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm done with your sob stories.Capcom has realized that there are many Mega Man fans out there clamoring for a new game. As much as I hate to say it, and I have already purchased Mighty No. 9, it is entirely possible for the creative team at capcom to make a new Mega Man game without its beloved creator. Yes, the legacy collection seems like a total cash grab, and yes, we haven't seen a Mega Man game for some time, but I haven't yet lost hope. This article is meant to play on your emotions and make people angry/sad while Capcom has not completely forgotten him."
Megaman,3d106f,Terbose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Has anyone done any assessment of how much the Mega Man IP is valued to Capcom? In other words, how much would it cost to straight out buy all rights, assets, etc, to Mega Man from Capcom?"

Megaman,3d27eb,Zeebor,10,Sun Jul 12 22:46:52 2015 UTC,And it's been only 5 years since the last game. Several big name franchises have been through similar sequel gaps. I haven't given up hope on the Blue Bomber.
Megaman,3d27eb,winter_pony4,7,Sun Jul 12 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree with a lot you've said here. But, I think you're giving way too much credit to Capcom. I grew up with Capcom games and in so many ways they've shaped my gaming preferences, but they, and a lot of other Japanese developers, have really put out poor quality products in recent years. Capcom has completely run down resident evil and I feel they've lost touch with their audiences. Inafune isn't a god, but his break up with Capcom is a symptom if the changing face of Japanese developers. Thanks for the post, this is a worthwhile discussion."
Megaman,3d27eb,go_destroy,6,Mon Jul 13 01:26:25 2015 UTC,This. Another reason why we shouldn't freak out: 'Tis better to have no sequel than a terrible sequel. This may be actually doing Mega Man a favor until Capcom gets their s*** together.

I much prefer the cartoony hijinks of Legends and the classic series. Regardless, no one can say the disparit elements of Zero and ZX weren't done better elsewhere, and nobody likes X7 and 8; at least not while sober."
Megaman,3d27eb,Jeff1pnt3,4,Mon Jul 13 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"You make some decent points that I myself have been considering for a while. However, just because you, one single Mega Man fan, don't like the more serious series, does not make them mistakes. I honestly enjoyed that Mega Man was versatile enough to stretch across so many different universes with different settings and moods. Not trying to insult, I am just pointing out that those aren't necessarily grounds to be upset. Otherwise, I agree on many points, especially on people being stale with ideas and just making the same thing over and over. (Inafune sometimes acting like this hero of Mega Man doesn't always hold up with me. He seems to be very much stuck on his ideas of making the same gameplay over and over, which can sometimes be good for fans, but only in moderation and done correctly.)"

For me personally having not completed every single Megman game.  Classic:  Worst -Probably 8 just never got into it. Didn't really play 4-6 much either though  Best - 2 definitive classic Megman.  X:  Worst: Everyone says X6 but I didn't play it. I was really unhappy with X7 though fuck that game.  Best: X1 my favorite Megaman of all time tied with Legends. Just perfect in everyway.  Legends: Both are good. Not sure about the Tronne Bonne game.  Battle Network: Didn't try it much, not a fan of the aesthetic.  Of the other more recent series I can't say as I haven't given them equal attention."
Megaman,3cx2dh,xtromp,4,Sat Jul 11 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"Oh shit son.  Talking about game time.  Ok, as dudeski before said, this should be taken as per series.  Each series presented something different - a change to the dynamic of the gameplay WORLD (know what I am sayin, son?)  So, I am now going to be unoriginal as fuck, because u/xtromp got it going down right.   Classic (and we aren't including any soccer or pc games here)  Worst: 1.  Dropped that fucking bomb. But let's face it - we give this game far too much c....wait..I just remembered that this had the best wily fortress of the bunch (copy bot, yellow devil,  the gauntlet...that...shuriken thingy that refilled yo shit )  Fuck.   It's not 1.  Damnit.  I can't say that in good conscience.   So let's add a 0 to that 1.  10 was utterly forgettable in every possible way.  There is a reason why 11 wasn't made. (Sorry guys, 8 gets too much hate).  Best: 3.  2 had better music and cooler robot masters, but 3 nailed down the balance in gameplay.    X series:  Worst: X7.  By a long shot.  Sorry bros,  x6 may have shit for story and explanations,  but I would be damned to fault it for its music and armors.  Best: X4.  I loved X3 the most of the snes games (Hyper max armor...fuck yeah), but x4 was more polished, and...zero.  Zero series:  Worst:  zero 1.  Nothing to see here.  Bland music, gameplay too basic compared what was done after (but much love for the original crash theme).  Best: zero 3.  And I say this absolutely loving zero 4 and it's ending.  You can't go wrong with either.  To be honest,  this series is arguably the best of the bunch in terms of quality.   ZX nor legends will be spoken of because they are all good...and I dun wanna compare just two or 3 games.  Battle network/starforce  Worst: BN4.  I mean...it's just...like, you don't even have to play this game.  It still has some merit but...eh.  Best: BN3.  Just because I love that undernet stage part.  Fighting Bass and Serenade at the bottom.  Fuck yeah.  I had fun  So yeah.  Did I miss anything?   I dunno."

As for the X series, X1 was my favorite (X4 comes in a close 2nd) with X7 being my least favorite.  I didn't play all the BNs, but I liked BN2 and started losing interest around BN4.  The Zero, ZX, and Legends series all have too few games for me to really rank a best/worst. I liked just about all of them anyway (I own ZX Advent but have yet to play it)."
Megaman,3cx2dh,Liryok,2,Sat Jul 11 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"I'm really only qualified to talk about the classic series, but I agree with your choices.  3 feels to me like the game where the Mega Man game play really came to fullness, the story - with Proto Man's introduction and Wily's ""reform"" - finally started to matter (a little), and the music and MM2 boss callback was spot on for me.  7, to me, is the ""worst"" because it just feels kind of sluggish to me. Maybe the upgrade to 16-bit made the animations last too long for the tight play on the NES. Maybe it's purely psychological. 8 also felt like that, but not as much."
Megaman,3cx2dh,Dash2110,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"Agree with your thoughts on 7. I think it may have been them trying to use too much of an animation for running, that made the game feel sluggish. Not to mention the larger sprites overall, gave the game this kind of ""Super Mega Man"" feel, only problem is that in turn made the stages feel cramped to me.  I liked 8, I think despite the lighthearted feel and bad voiceacting, it had some good moments and the musical theme of the entire game kind of grew on me well after I first played through it."

IMO, MM3 had pretty decent weapons(I don't care what anyone says about Top Spin; I got a helluva lotta mileage out of it), good music (especially Wily Boss <3), and is when the series really started to expand its horizons.  Likewise, MM5 had some pretty bad weapons, annoying as hell bosses (and enemies.. Dachone, anyone?), and the music wasn't as catchy as the previous games. Really, the best part about it was Beat."

Megaman,3cx2dh,themegamankingdom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:59:21 2015 UTC,"By the series I have played enough of to form an opinion:  Classic: Best is 3, had very creative ideas and is often overshadowed by 2. Worst is MM&B, the game is not very open ended, you are pretty much forced to follow a particular order for bosses, and the game doesn't really try to form it's own identity, instead creating a frankenstein of 7 and 8.  X: Only played X1 and barely anything of the rest of the X Collection, so no favorites here yet.  Zero: I liked Zero 2, the form system was well laid out and was nice in that you could adapt the play style you wanted. Worst is Zero 1 since it's a mess and it really doesn't feel the developer had an idea of what to do yet.  Legends: Currently playing though 1, so no opinion.  Battle Network: Love 2 because of the simple streamlined story (no major backtracking, except FreezeMan), great post game, and the PowerUp system felt like I was growing throughout the game. I don't particularly hate any of them, but 1 is a giant mess with a horrendous internet, and it just felt lifeless with the lack of elemental panels, names for viruses, and variance in music.  Starforce: These are really close, but I like 1 the best, because of the character development of Geo in the game, and 2 the worst because it didn't really stick out like the other two did.  ZX: I like the original ZX over Advent because of the great plot (although a bit rushed) memorable Pseudoroids, and it really felt like you were making the Biometals your own, as opposed to just transforming."
Megaman,3cx2dh,VintageGrace,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about the best, that's a very tough question. For me it might be either X4 or Zero 2. Those games were amazing. Although maybe the first X game is better than X4. I could never decide.   The worst is easily X6 though. I don't think this is a debate. I know a lot of people hate X7, but at least X7 is actually beatable. The level deisgn in X6 is so bad you can only beat it if you get all the armor pieces. No X game did this before and no X game did this since. It also ruined the X series's story and was overly difficult for all the wrong reasons. It's not hard, just frustrating. It's a bad game.   This is me personally, and a HUGELY unpopular opinion, but I actually do like Megaman X7. I loved it as a kid. The voice acting is laughably bad, not ear ruining, just so bad its legitametly funny. Axl's is a VERY well designed reploid. He's sleek and well blending colors, just looks really cool. The music is top notch as always. Idk, I know its just me and I definitely know it has its flaws, but I enjoyed it. Guilty pleasure I guess.  I'd be interested in hearing why you hate X8. I thought it was the saving grace of the series after 6 and 7. Everything was the best it had ever been since X4: the music, the graphics, the bosses, the voice acting. It was amazing."
Megaman,3cx2dh,NotJustAnyFish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure on the best.  My favorites were 2 from the original series and 1 from the X series though a lot of that is nostalgia speaking.  With a few tweaks, 8 from the original series could have been the best.  (Add e-tanks, take out ""jump, jump, slide, slide"", fix some of the voice acting.)  The game was beautiful, some of the intros (the crab and Tengu Man) were delights to watch and the special animations for hitting the enemy with the right weapon were improved from 7.  X took the ""start wimpy and upgrade yourself"" mechanic and threw it into overdrive, I'm sure there's better X games after X1, and I can't say how the Zero and ZX games compare.  Legends did an awesome job of bringing the upgrade mechanics into 3d, even if the upgrades weren't always directly connected to bosses.  As for the worst, one person mentioned the Game Gear game, which was just a rehash of levels from other games.  Many hold the PC games (1 and 3, no 2 was made) as being the worst.  The absolute worst, however, have to be the Tiger games.  (2 and 3, no 1.)  An argument could be made that at least the Tiger and the PC games follow the basic mechanics, and Soccer is the worst for being an entirely different kind of game, or the Misadventures of Tron Bonne for not including Mega Man and being nothing but a collection of minigames.  Another runner up is battle chip challenge, since the game is largely on auto-pilot."

Staring at it, I think it comes down to proportions.  Disclaimer: I've cosplayed as Mega Man and it certainly was not the most sexy sight to grace that anime con."
Megaman,3cv4oi,Dash2110,2,Sat Jul 11 05:30:24 2015 UTC,"It might just be because we all know Mega Man (especially Classic) to be a child, maybe 10-12ys old at most (I always imagined X a little older, like around 16-18). So seeing a grown man in the same outfit just looks...off."
Megaman,3cv4oi,FractalBear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely agreed. The kids face matches more. But the more I look, the more I'm convinced that the adult proportions are just off.

I checked my Paypal today and saw that it charged me and went ahead and withdrew the funds from my bank account (which until Wednesday are pretty much non-existant) so thanks to Digital River I'll have a nice overdraft fee or two on Monday.  I called to cancel my order and they said they apologized for me misunderstanding this paragraph on their page: ""If you have ordered physical products we don't think you should pay for your order until it is actually on its way. We will not bill you until your product(s), including backordered or preordered items, are actually shipped. If your items are shipped separately you will be billed each time an item is shipped."" So they won't do anything about my fees, and they said they cancelled the order, but I've yet to receive an e-mail saying such.  So you might have better luck using a different payment method, but I wouldn't trust the assholes..."

Megaman,3ctyj0,atriax,2,Fri Jul 10 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"This kickstarter has made me realize a lot of things about the Legends series and Inafune's possible attempt at creating a successor for it. I can't speak for all Legends fans, but I feel like making a spiritual successor is the wrong way to go about it.   Mainly because, the one thing I want most is closure for the Legends series. I want to see Volnutt make his triumphant return from Elysium. I also want to see what the Elder system looks like, now that Eden, and Elysium's Master System are deactivated . I don't really care about Red Dash because of it. It can try to be Legends as much as it wants, but my money is reserved on Volnutt's story, however long I'll be waiting."
Megaman,3ctyj0,HowToBeaGoodLeader,3,Sun Jul 12 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"I second this.  While a spiritual successor may be a fun game, a huge part of what made Legends, Legends, was the story, characters, and mystery in the world."

Megaman,3ctyj0,SkyHookofKsp,4,Fri Jul 10 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Actually disagree.   He hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt.  Are you playing mighty no. 9 right now?   Have you played it yet?  And that's one point kotaku makes really well - inafune hasn't released his last kickstarter yet.  We don't know if investing in a new project is worth it.  What if beck does nothing to make you forget about megaman?   Hell, what if you play it, and ultimately say ""....but I want da supa fighting wobot""?  Not just that,  outside of pc, we don't even know what PLATFORM the console version would be on.  Why should I donate to something that I may not even be able to play anyway?  If they interpret this as a definite ""nobody wants legends...."", then that's on their ignorance.  I don't give money to people in fear of their ignorance"

The mother fucker thought it was a fantasic idea to use ghost pepper as a special seasoning.  Fire spit out from both ends, and I saw a vision of a post apocalyptic future, where trained martial artists that remind me of Bruce Lee fought each other for girls.  It scared me...and when I woke up,  my wallet was gone...the cart and sausage guy nowhere to be found.

Demon's souls, which shares a hefty core concept with it, you don't forget the original.  I want Red Ash to be good, not to replace my need for Megaman, but just because I want it to be good.

Yes, I know Capcom isn't doing much with our beloved Blue Bomber, but despite that I just can't see myself playing any of Inafune's games and saying ""Yes, this is Mega Man to me"".  But when you head over to the Kickstarter for Red Ash, or the 100k Facebook page, you see a lot of ""Real Mega Man fans would support Red Ash"", or ""If we don't support this Capcom will see that as nobody wanting a Legends 3"".

Megaman,3cptd5,TheRealSlimSaiyan,2,Thu Jul 9 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"A bit of critique:  The picture I think is fairly good, its clear that its X and has a distinct style to it with actual forms and shapes and strong shading. So I think as a whole its a pretty good job. I really enjoy the attention to detail such as his helmet ear-cups and helmet lining being drawn and shaded, gives a great sense of 3D depth.  However I feel that some changes could improve it quite a bit.  His shoulder pads are shaped differently, His Right (Our Left, Lighter one) is rounded while his Left (Our Right, Darker one) is triangular. I assume you might have been implying they were both triangular and its simply that the Lighter one got cut off by the page?  His body is nearly symmetrical, but I do notice that parts on the left vs the right look a bit different, the angle seems a bit warped and he looks sort of like his belly/lower torso is facing FRONT but his chest/upper torso are facing maybe like 30 Degrees RIGHT.  The shading is mostly consistent but I wasn't too sure where it was coming from, and his face seemed to affected less by the shadow/shading. I suggest drawing some arrows when you draw, so you know where your light projects from, just as a little artistic tip.  I think some anatomy refreshing could come in handy, he is a robot of course and not exactly human, but while men do have stocky torsos, I feel his waist/tummy area could use just a small bit of thinning, its just as wide as the rest of his body and I think pressing it in would help a bit.  Beyond these, its a great picture and I quite like how it looks, if you would like me to give a more detailed analysis or critiques on other art, I can if you'd want me to.  I really hope the best for you and I hope to see more drawings, have a great day!"

Megaman,3cjsuv,Cortte,7,Wed Jul 8 13:42:02 2015 UTC,I bet this would be more successful if they waited until Mighty No. 9 had been released for a bit.   I can see people not wanting to Kickstart this while they're still waiting for MNo9.
Megaman,3cjsuv,ADifferentMachine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"What if they included that in the backer rewards? A copy of MN9? It would help build hype for the Kickstarter and incentivise people to part with their money, and show confidence in their games."
Megaman,3cjsuv,LumberjackPirate,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:11:15 2015 UTC,I think that would be a kick in the balls to people who backed MN9. I don't see a good way of doing that.

Megaman,3cjsuv,otheranotherbrother,3,Wed Jul 8 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a good time for them to do another kickstarter. MN9 kickstarter is still viewed negatively by a lot of their biggest supporters, because they haven't gotten the product yet to offset all of the other drama.  It would make sense with their original release schedule (in May) to have it now. But with the pushback... eh."

Most money comes in at the very start, and the very end (last 24 hours when reminders are sent out). The middle of a campaign seems to usually be the slowest time.   Red Ash might get funded, but I'm not sure it'll push all of its stretch goals. The Shantae Kickstarter had a similar slow funding situation happen due to backlash about Shantae's initial skin tone. It didn't end up reaching all of its stretch goals (I believe quite a few were missed)."

Megaman,3cjsuv,sbima,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:23:16 2015 UTC,"You're not alone and that's why it's moving so slowly. As someone else stated, the reason why MN9 did so well was the ""screw you"" factor to capcom. The whole community manager debacle doesn't help. I recall them trying to get now funding for some dlc but can't find it. I played the beta and wasn't impressed by the game.   They seem to be viewing us as more like big venture investor and not fans."
Megaman,3cjsuv,Erif_Neerg,2,Thu Jul 9 18:40:48 2015 UTC,I just hope this is at least remotely like megaman legends and that it actually gets released. I don't think i can cope with another cancelled project
Megaman,3cjsuv,sbima,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think another reason why this is going a lot slower is because Legends has a very niche fanbase even among overall Mega Man fans. MN9 was not only a ""screw you Capcom"" for the hardcore fans but appealed to less virulent ones with its nostalgic platformer style.  Let's face it, Legends never sold very well for a major release and I know there are a good number of old-school Mega Man fans that never really got into Legends, just as there is a whole group of ""Mega Man fans"" that only really got introduced to Mega Man via Legends."

Megaman,3chszo,MarcusRaven86,8,Wed Jul 8 00:41:23 2015 UTC,"If we want to get AMAZINGLY technical, Akari Kitamura would be the one to credit as the creator of Mega Man, but Inafune served as artist on the original team and led the entire series as producer the following year.  That said, Hideki Kamiya is talking out his ass.  If anyone is insulting the Mega Man franchise it's Capcom.  Five games cancelled in two years, an utterly humiliating gutterball of a 25th anniversary commemoration, and the repeated insistence that if they just keep re-releasing the 1987-1994 collection ad nauseum the franchise is still relevant.  Is Mighty No. 9 derivative?  Of course it is.  But hey.  You snooze, you lose, Capcom.  And no amount of bitching and moaning (and certainly not deciding to directly compete with your own new cartoon and slapping together the bajillionth Classic-Retro game) will fix that.  (Seriously, if they make a Mega Man 11 in the NES style, I'm giving up on them.)"
Megaman,3chszo,ricdesi,3,Wed Jul 8 12:12:02 2015 UTC,"Going anti-retro style for a new classic megaman game.  Bold move, cotton.  Let's see if it pays off."
Megaman,3chszo,cronoes,0,Wed Jul 8 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"Well no, Inafune wasn't the producer. The producers for the classic games were Takashi Nishiyama and Tokuro Fujiwara. Inafune didn't receive a credit for being a producer of the main series games until Mega Man 8.  And Yes it's indeed unfortunate that Capcom cancelled several Mega Man games, but we have to remember what they were:  Mega Man Unlimited: An extremely Americanised-ish Mega Man spin-off. It seemed a lot like what became Super Mario Maker (going by what limited footage was released). Maybe it would have been fun, but I wonder if it was just intended to be purely user-content driven.  Mega Man Online: Capcom didn't really technically cancel this, other companies were at fault. Fell apart. Mega Man Legends 3: Unfortunately during the time when Capcom and Inafune were at heads with each other. Would have been cool to see, but fan support was barely there. I was disappointed, but I also think it likely wasn't the right title to re-invigorate interest in the franchise.  Maverick Hunter: It was a Mega Man fps. It reminds me of the Bomberman re-imagining.  L-least we got that weird Japan-exclusive Mega Man iOS game, right? lmao"
Megaman,3chszo,ditybear,0,Wed Jul 8 18:01:34 2015 UTC,"There was also Mega Man Universe, Rockman Rockman 2, Maverick Hunter X2, etc.  Five years ago, Capcom more or less took Mega Man out back and put him down.  While Inafune wasn't the producer until the 16-bit era, he was team lead starting with Mega Man 4 (after the new lead for Mega Man 3 had, as he put it, no idea what made Mega Man Mega Man)."
Megaman,3chszo,ricdesi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"I did mention MMU, but were Rockman Rockman 2 and Maverick Hunter X2 ever actually confirmed, because I only ever remember them being ""oh yeah they're totally gonna happen""s from the fanbase. Expectations. I know it's kinda a long time ago in the current game industry, but I still never remember them actually being anything.  Honestly, I'm kinda holding out for more Mega Man. Capcom seems like the kid who was into something his friend was into but his friend moved away so he's like ""I dunno I dunno I don't know what to do"" and just files it away for the future."
Megaman,3chszo,ditybear,5,Wed Jul 8 18:41:42 2015 UTC,Definitely don't ever go on the Steam Community forum for the game. That's pretty much all it is.
Megaman,3chszo,amedeus,5,Wed Jul 8 04:57:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think it IS possible for Inafune to ""copy"" Mega Man. To me personally, Mega Man is much bigger than Inafune or any one Japanese designer or developer. I love Mega Man more than I do Inafune, and if the guy decides to put himself in a position to no longer touch the IP (no matter how valid his arguments are for leaving), he's not really anyone special to me."
Megaman,3chszo,Dash2110,2,Wed Jul 8 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand why but the internet is a place that can truly allow pure hatred. It is blind and powerful and needs no reasons for the fire it bellows. The game is nearly finished and all I see is rage about it. I mean, being a crappy game is one thing but considering it's not even released is just something else.  Everyone is allowed an opinion but how constructive can anger really be? What does hateful text on the internet really do for the world?"
Megaman,3chszo,legato32x,2,Wed Jul 8 08:41:33 2015 UTC,Do people even do research anymore?  Keiji Inafune didn't create MegaMan.  Akira Kitamura did.
Megaman,3chszo,SaitoKojima,2,Wed Jul 8 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"Its because (A) Kamiya isn't a fan of Inafune (thinks he's a suit, not a game designer) and (B) Inafune was an artist who designed the character but the gameplay was someone else's work."
Megaman,3chszo,Not_a_Zaku,3,Wed Jul 8 06:22:18 2015 UTC,"He refined Mega Man's design, the concept isn't originally Inafune's.  Considering how much Inafune ended up pushing Zero (basically Inafune's own Mega Man), I'm surprised Beck isn't more Zero-like."
Megaman,3chszo,ditybear,3,Wed Jul 8 11:36:02 2015 UTC,"To add onto your point  ""Inafune also revealed that he wasn't responsible for the creation of Mega Man himself. ""I'm often called the father of Mega Man, but actually, his design was already created when I joined Capcom,"" he explained. ""My mentor [at Capcom], who was the designer of the original Mega Man, had a basic concept of what Mega Man was supposed to look like. So I only did half of the job in creating him. I didn't get to completely design a Mega Man [protagonist] from scratch until Zero (Mega Man X, SNES). Back when the SNES was coming out, I was asked to give Mega Man a redesign, so I created this character. But I realized that this design wouldn't be accepted as Mega Man, so I had another designer create the new Mega Man, and I worked on Zero to release him as the 'other main character' that would steal all the good scenes!""  http://www.gamespot.com/articles/tgs-07-mega-man-celebrates-20th-anniversary/1100-6179759/"
Megaman,3chszo,HowToBeaGoodLeader,3,Wed Jul 8 16:08:17 2015 UTC,"To a certain extent, he might be. While visually, Might No. 9 is more reminiscent of early NES Mega Man, mechanically it seems like another permutation of the series, something like following the line of Mega Man X to the later platorming games, but with an AU feel of Battle Network instead of a continuation feel of the continuing story of the platformer games."

Megaman,3cg6ox,Aaron__G,3,Tue Jul 7 20:53:25 2015 UTC,wait until you try the other series bro.  you won't regret it.
Megaman,3cg6ox,Phoxxent,2,Tue Jul 7 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"Battle Network was what got me into Rockman. Give them a try, they are amazing games! If you play BN1 and aren't into it, wait until BN2 before you decide it's not for you: From BN2 and onwards, there are a whole lot of features not in 1. BN1 has no forms or transformations but that is only in BN1. Still a great game though :)"

Megaman,3c9afu,choogiesaur,6,Sat Jul 11 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"Protoman is definitely my favorite. His design is just so cool to me. I started with Megaman 7, and Protoman was just kinda there, hiding in certain areas, waiting for you to find him and giving advice. Then I played the Battle Network series, and Protoman got a bit more...diverse from Megaman, transitioning into a badass Spartanish dude."
Megaman,3c9afu,FYININJA,2,Mon Jul 6 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"For me, I'd have to say Proto Man. At first I didn't really care to much for him, but as Smash 4 started the whole ""alternate costume"" thing, it got me thinking how cool it would be if Proto Man were Mega Man's alt.   I did a bit of research on his character, found out about the Protomen, made a few(3) Proto Man amiibo figures, and ""voila!"" Proto Man is now cemented as one of my favorites."
Megaman,3c9afu,Jeff1pnt3,4,Mon Jul 6 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, may seem like a generic answer, but Zero is just amazing.  He's written so well and pretty much shares the protagonist spot with X. I like his playstyle and his swagger, and his design is amazing.  His transformation to someone who's based and doesn't give a fuck to someone who actual cares was an interesting road.  I'm also a fan of Bass and Wily ,as well as Pandora and Prometheus."
Megaman,3c9afu,Angst-Incarnate,2,Mon Jul 6 04:38:06 2015 UTC,Zero from the X series and Tron Bonne from Legends.  I was OK with Roll up until Legends and her dialogue box took up half the damn screen during fights. I couldn't see or skip/fast forward and it got annoying really fast.

I mean, if you want to rank the themes in order from worst to first,  dynamos theme is the median.  It is the perfect example of music you get from x5.    And that theme was cheesy as fuck.    So no...no love"
Megaman,3c9afu,cronoes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way, I could have taken the obvious route, but when I see ""reoccurring character"" I think of characters that weren't mainstays of the series.  Kind of wish he made an appearance in X7 or X8, since he never really dies. But again, they love making new characters for a game only to have them destroyed for that game."
Megaman,3c9afu,omegakingauldron,2,Mon Jul 6 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"And that's the problem.  There are really only 3 recurring characters that made a difference:  bass, protoman,  or zero.  The rest were recurring but extremely minor (roll,  auto, ciel, ciels robot sister that I don't give a fuck about), or mainstay villains /protagonists  (sigma, wily...vile...which would fit into the protoman, Bass category).  And of those, if we narrow it down to the first category, its pretty much any of the three.  Well, really.  It should be bass.  That mother fucker is cool, but laughably ineffective in the original series, but godly in the battle network series.   Protoman is pretty consistent in both...and zero became his own main character,  so he is thrown out of the running."
Megaman,3c9afu,cronoes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"If we're going with that theory, Sigma wins hands down. He always comes back with a new weapon (sword/claws/shield/scythe/giant gun/giant sword) and always comes in with style."

Megaman,3c9afu,RopeADoper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think almost all of the returning characters and even game specific ones are very charming and fun in their own ways. Its hard to really pin one down, but I'd honestly go for left-field and actually say the enemies, in specific the Mets and Servbots are tied for me as some of my beloved recurring ""characters"".  I think the enemy design in almost all the games is incredible, they're fun and colorful, expressive and unique and fitting to the style of that sub-series and specific game. They are honestly characters in of themselves and for me, even the minor enemies/henchmen are memorable. How can I not love the cute little hardhat blobs or childish cylinder heads?  If it had to be a specific character, I'd have to say Zero. He has an awesome design, great fighting style, and excellent character evolution, in both story and visual appearance from the X series down into the Zero games."

Megaman,3c8x98,FYININJA,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:44:30 2015 UTC,I've heard time and again on various retro podcasts that due to audio rights we wont be seeing it. Last time I heard was on retronauts with a former community manager.
Megaman,3c8x98,CossackBueh,2,Mon Jul 6 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken it's because Capcom partnered with a few companies putting their products/images/etc in the game. They no longer have those partnerships so they'd have to change those assets. Unfortunately Sony doesn't allow modified releases for the older games, apparently it has to be a straight 1:1 copy from the retail version. So they're just unable to and it has nothing with the audio or Teisel's actor being arrested for pedophilia like many people claim as the Tron game would be unable to be released as well."
Megaman,3c8x98,Liu_Shui,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"With the release of Tron Bonne on the PSN, I think it's fair to say that audio rights are not the issue here. /u/Liu_Shulman is right, the problem seems to be around assets within the game referencing real life property (mostly stuff like YAG animation school, and the real life cola brand being represented in the game). If a PSN release is likely, I think Capcom may consider bringing Legends 2, since it's less of a problem than Legends 1. Ideally, I would just remaster them for the PS4 and Xbox One since it seems to be in super high demand.  http://www.rockman-corner.com/2015/05/regarding-mega-man-legends-and-property.html  http://www.rockman-corner.com/2015/05/lets-talk-about-mega-man-legends-2-and.html  These two links are interesting reads regarding speculation on why these games may have a difficult time getting released on the PSN."

If enemy copying was taking too long to implement correctly, they would have to make compromises to it. However, if they weren't spending time on stretch goal features (i.e., they didn't reach them), they would have had more time to get enemy copying to work correctly."
Megaman,3c4mie,Zupwat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:09 2015 UTC,Features take time to implement.   Core features are more important than superfluous extra features.  They don't build Protoman DLC and extra enemies and bosses AND THEN scrap lemons because muh scope. Lemons first. Movement first. Items first. Bosses and boss powers first. Then they can work on DLC and the like.

Yes, this is also a spiritual successor, but its also a spiritual successor to a game he's been trying to make for years. For example, the engine used in Dead Rising was genuinely meant for a console Megaman Legends 3. Capcom over and over said no, so he made other games to show off the tech to get approval.  Finally, after 3 got officially cancelled he even offered to make it on his own time and budget after leaving the company. Megaman as a franchise is effectively dead, Beck is our boy though, and that's what Inafune is trying to establish."

All I'm saying is that I adore Megaman Legends, I still have my original copies of 1 and 2 and have been trying to get a copy of Tron Bonne.

Wily thought that would significantly reduce the touch hazard to Mega Man, so he added some instant-death spikes to the casing for next-level melee threat.  Wait, what's that?  ""INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DR. LIGHT"" ""-W-"" ""GET EQUIPPED WITH WOOD SHIELD"" ""GET YOUR WEAPONS READY!""  Mega Man activates the weapon, and he protects himself with splintered pieces of Wood Man's body, swirling around him in a mecha-grotesquerie of Mega-proportions.  Air Man takes one look and--""F*** this, I'm outta here.""  Psychological factor + actually meaningful physical defense = best shield in the series"

Megaman,3c3k9m,Neoicecreaman,6,Sat Jul 4 12:40:15 2015 UTC,there is absolutely no cohesion to this. it's chaotic and random. Good first try but it has no direction.
Megaman,3c3k9m,Kotef,2,Sat Jul 4 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"That's fair, I based this off piano sheet music for the song, then tried added what I thought would make the two repeatable sections sound unique from eachother.  Do you have any tips of how I could get that effect while still making them blend? That's my next goal."
Megaman,3c3k9m,Kotef,2,Sat Jul 4 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah i wasn't an amd not trying to sound like a douche. Please don't take it that way. It sounds all over the place. When it first starts it's just some random noises. then it kinda finishes the first part seeming like it's something. then it goes into cerebral palsy mode.  It's fun to be different. I couldn't tell you keys and other technical things. I have an ear for music but haven't ever taken the time to learn more than what sounds right. and this sounds just off.  I'll try and add some of my thought process to this.   At the start it sounds like you tried to take the intro notes and layer a harmony on it but it's all sorts of off. The way you've staggered the notes you've chosen has completely thrown any scale out the window. it sounds like someone is hitting a couple random notes on a keyboard. and got lucky and it kind of sounds like something with a pattern.  then it does the faux guitar slide thing. I don't remember the name for it. and that's not too bad, still sounds a little off like one of the notes is just a little too different than the rest.  after that it goes into full potato mode. it's an assault of notes. your backing rhytim tracks are too over powering. there is way too much going on. It sounds like it is loose and shaky. the lead part over it isn't all to bad. needs a little more definition of the notes. like there is too much effect over it. or you are making it sounds different entirely through effects. it lacks cohesion. nothing brings it all together. it's like everyone plaything the instruments is trying to do their own thing based on the same idea.  the bridge between that and the next part is pretty good and feels to fit the theme you are trying to go for. 34/35 seconds in is what i'm talking about.  then its back to chaos.  when it hits the next part at about 46 seconds it's not too bad. it still lacks cohesion at though. there isn't any definition. it's again like a band all doing their own thing with same idea but not as bad.  the part starting at about 1:24 is alright. sounds pretty good still some random noises that don't mesh but it's not terrible."
Megaman,3c3k9m,Kotef,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Hey. It took forever to upload, but I added a new version where I tried to take what you said to heart. Does this sound a little bit more like what you were talking about?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_xM2R4oI10&feature=youtu.be"
Megaman,3c3k9m,DudeWynaut,2,Wed Jul 8 01:01:57 2015 UTC,It's a bit better actually yes. Sounds like you compressed it differently and adjusted some of the levels.

Megaman,3c3k9m,Jeff1pnt3,3,Sat Jul 4 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"The song itself isn't too bad (reminds me of the Anniversary Collection remix), but it sounds a bit compressed."
Megaman,3c3k9m,Jeff1pnt3,2,Sat Jul 4 16:17:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think it's due to some of the files I was using to make the reverb. I'm hoping to learn better ways of doing it for sure."

Megaman,3c1rh5,yourehilarious,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:16:48 2015 UTC,This is dope! Always a fan of a harder take on cool music. Boss battle sounds especially cool.  Edit: The changes you made to the Password song are also really interesting!
Megaman,3bys40,CRUMSON,6,Fri Jul 3 06:46:47 2015 UTC,"God man...see, the biggest thing that makes all of this so bittersweet is that, yeah, the games themselves will be what we have been wanting...  But Rock is now forever stuck on the moon.  We will never know what master Thomas was going to do to blow up the world and lead into the legends timeline.  And I will never see my iconic blue bomber in a new game...ever again.  Makes me wish I was 16 or something so I haven't had the lifetime of growing up with megaman.   Well, except that being a 16 year old boy is the worst thing of all time.  So maybe not"
Megaman,3bys40,cronoes,3,Fri Jul 3 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"It would not surprise me if the story of this somehow was made to loosely resolve the story of MML.  Something along the lines of Red Ash going up to the moon to retrieve ""the trigger"" and stop the villain ""tom""."
Megaman,3bys40,IngwazK,3,Fri Jul 3 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"I mean...that's cool if they do.  But it's just not the supa fighting wobot...mayyyga maaayn.  Haha, oh well.  When I play some mighty no. 9, I will see how on board with these different characters"
Megaman,3bys40,cronoes,2,Fri Jul 3 17:30:43 2015 UTC,But we get new characters to love. Characters with Glocks and revolvers! Here is to hoping we start the game where legends 2 left off..just with the new characters.

Megaman,3bw80f,wayoftheninja,15,Thu Jul 2 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"With how many times it says ""Legends"" in the teaser qnd how the character designs are, I wouldn't doubt it"
Megaman,3bw80f,jaamfan,14,Thu Jul 2 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"on the more subtle side, red ash = re-dash. rockman dash = megaman legends. it has to be another spiritual successor!"
Megaman,3bw80f,mouseywithpower,9,Thu Jul 2 17:46:42 2015 UTC,Illurmernati confirmed!
Megaman,3bw80f,De_roosian_spy,3,Thu Jul 2 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"I keep thinking ""Re: DASH"" as in ""Regarding DASH (let's make good one the fans)""."
Megaman,3bw80f,for_ffxiv_sake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:54:16 2015 UTC,that works as well!
Megaman,3bw80f,mouseywithpower,6,Fri Jul 3 02:59:20 2015 UTC,I know right?  It's like they're rubbing it in Capcoms faces with it
Megaman,3bw80f,GospelX,7,Thu Jul 2 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"That's one way of looking at it. Another way is to make the connection clear to the intended audience in order to get them on board. Early videos for Mighty No. 9 used imagery evocative of Mega Man, but it wasn't for Capcom's sake. It was to make it very clear to fans that while it couldn't be a Mega Man game...it totally was."
Megaman,3bw80f,allthemegamans,11,Thu Jul 2 17:57:53 2015 UTC,Inafune is a master at being completely not subtle.  Totally not Tron at 0:33.  brb shitting bricks.
Megaman,3bw80f,psm510,2,Thu Jul 2 21:17:40 2015 UTC,Just built a house with the bricks i shat.
Megaman,3bw80f,YellowDevilCS,8,Fri Jul 3 03:18:54 2015 UTC,Red Ash = RE-DASH  Mega Man Legends is Rockman DASH  combine that with all the legends references in the trailer and yeah they're not even subtle with it  definitely super duper cool though
Megaman,3bw80f,De_roosian_spy,7,Thu Jul 2 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"In this Q/A someone asks if there will be a legends successor he responds with ""only if the fans show me they want it, do you want it?"". And the crowd goes nuts. https://youtu.be/BJ-VTpXdHLU"

Megaman,3bw80f,ditybear,3,Fri Jul 3 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how I feel about this. I'm not super liking the look of Might No 9, so I'm wary."
Megaman,3bw80f,hodge_podge11,5,Fri Jul 3 04:09:34 2015 UTC,I want a mmx successor :(
Megaman,3bw80f,mothman607,2,Thu Jul 2 17:42:44 2015 UTC,I always thought of the Zero series as a successor to X- both in gameplay and story.
Megaman,3bw80f,FYININJA,2,Thu Jul 2 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly Mighty No.9 looks to have a more X feel to it than a classic feeling, at least in terms of movement. Lots of dashing, much faster paced than classic megaman. In terms of character design and stuff it's closer to the classic series, but from what I've seen of the gameplay it looks more similar to X."
Megaman,3bw80f,badgeometry,4,Thu Jul 2 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"I see MN09 as more of an in-between game. The core gameplay is more akin to X, but the characters and themes are straight out of Classic."
Megaman,3bw80f,NotJustAnyFish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"It's not just that you CAN dash, you MUST.  You shoot an enemy until it's unstable, then dash through it to defeat it.  Many enemies recover if not dashed through.  With a boss, you'll go through several ""destabilize-dash"" cycles before they're done.  With the original Mega Man, you could play a close up game or a distance game depending on your taste.  With 9, for many enemies (though there are exceptions), you're forced into a close game.  The dash is the attack, the shooting just the prep."
Megaman,3bw80f,Samccx19,6,Thu Jul 2 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"I know this is obviously just early days, and that's assuming this is a MML successor (although I'm guessing it will be), but those concepts look fantastic, I'm already getting excited."
Megaman,3bw80f,IngwazK,3,Fri Jul 3 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"Right?  If comcept put up a kickstarter for this, I would throw so much money at them."
Megaman,3bw80f,grangach,3,Thu Jul 2 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"I would rather they make it themselves this time, I want them to prove themselves without other people's money."
Megaman,3bw80f,coolguyblue,2,Thu Jul 2 18:19:38 2015 UTC,With how Mighty number 9 turned out I'm not so sure.
Megaman,3bw80f,IngwazK,2,Fri Jul 3 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"Considering its not even out yet, I think its a bit early to be talking about how it turned out in the end.  My main concern for mn9 is that it won't be difficult enough.  If they have an advanced difficulty or buff the bosses up and make their AI more come, I'll be happy."
Megaman,3bw80f,IngwazK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:16:41 2015 UTC,Have not heard that.  I'm more worried about boss AI.  they were far too easy for the most part in the beta.
Megaman,3bw80f,IngwazK,0,Thu Jul 2 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, when you go to a resturaunt and order a sampler and it's all shit, what do you expect your meal to be?"
Megaman,3bw80f,IngwazK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"That's not analogous.  However, the point you're trying to make is obvious.  If you do indeed think the beta is that bad (assuming you've played it) then you will probably think the finished game is no good as well.  But most don't think the beta is that bad, so I would say that you're the outlier here."
Megaman,3bw80f,IngwazK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:14 2015 UTC,"But most don't think the beta is that bad   Where the hell are you browsing? I've yet to see anyone say anything good about it outside this thread, and a bunch of people were still pulling their donations even after the twitter drama because the demo had come out."
Megaman,3bw80f,supercuntscicle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few people say it's bad but i've also seen plenty of people disagree with them on the mighty no 9 sub.  On top of that, i've talked to other people who have played it and they enjoyed it as well.  I'm not saying no one thinks its bad, just that majority does not seem to think so.  I suspect you may be having problems with confirmation bias."
Megaman,3bw80f,Burning_Kobun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"on the mighty no 9 sub   Oh yeah, people shill for a product on a special forum for the product, how interesting. That's like saying 4chan doesn't hate DA3 because /dag/ exists.   I suspect you may be having problems with confirmation bias.   With no hint of irony?"
Megaman,3bw80f,for_ffxiv_sake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"here's one, and another, and another, and another, and another, and another, and this one kinda, and this one, and here's one where someone talked about how bad it was and got downvoted (presumably because people disagreed)  These are all comments taken direcly from this sub.  Sure, there are also plenty of negative comments, such as this one and this one, and plenty more apart from that as well, but to suggest that no one is interested in this game on this sub is just plain silly.  That is confirmation bias on your part.  You believe the game to be terrible, you see some others making similar remarks, thus, everyone must think it's terrible and to think it's even decent is folly.  Also, if you disregard comments on a sub that's dedicated to a specific game on whether or not that game is actually good, then you're dismissing evidence without any real cause.  Is it a mega man sub?  no.  However, it was created largely by mega man fans and many mega man fans inhabit it.  To say that it's shilling is just absurd."

Megaman,3bw80f,HowToBeaGoodLeader,2,Thu Jul 2 23:52:47 2015 UTC,I hate studio 4c though.
Megaman,3bw80f,triloknight,2,Fri Jul 3 07:42:34 2015 UTC,I remember about 5 years ago Mega Man Legends was considered an average game at best. In fact I remember people on GameFAQs were angry that Mega Man Volnutt was added to Tatsunoko Vs Capcom instead of classic or X. Then Mega Man Legends 3 got announced and people conidered it pretty good and a small fan base appeared. Then it got cancelled and now there are fans who claim that its the best Mega Man series.
Megaman,3bw80f,for_ffxiv_sake,2,Fri Jul 3 11:05:10 2015 UTC,"I dont think its that people think its the best, its mainly it was the one series that really needed finishing."
Megaman,3bw80f,NotJustAnyFish,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"Opinions can change over time, how many times have we seen people crap on one game just to slowly view it in a different light over time?  Also, is it really that big of a deal if fans claim it is the best series? Everyone has their own best Mega Man series."
Megaman,3bw80f,techemeche,2,Fri Jul 3 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel. I'm excited that they're doing something with the general idea, but as a spiritual successor it's not going to have the lore and characters that I got attached to and have waited 10 bloody years to hear from again. If it's a success maybe it'll cause capcom to stop acting deaf to the cries of its fans and restart legends 3."
Megaman,3bw80f,maharito,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"ditto, I'll probably like the new one ok but I feel you man."

Megaman,3bz65p,winter_pony4,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"I go for Metal Man last for the challenge. It's pretty fun going the hard way, considering that ('murican) Mega Man 2 is one of the easiest Mega Man games (Heat/Quick Man and Boobeam Trap notwithstanding)."
Megaman,3bz65p,omegakingauldron,0,Fri Jul 3 15:47:18 2015 UTC,Heat Man's Yoku block puzzle is a pain in the rear. I always need Item 2 to pass it.  Yet the Mega Man 9 Endless Attack version is simple to do wit hjumps alone.
Megaman,3bz65p,winter_pony4,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I've gotten a Game Over or two doing the Yoku puzzle normally (The rest of the level isn't that great either, due to the Tellys).  Then I proceeded to kick Heat Man's ass into next week."
Megaman,3bz65p,XtremeGamer1989,0,Fri Jul 3 15:18:13 2015 UTC,I guess flash man is an ok place to start. I normally do Metal man first just for his blades

Not everyone is into the genre obviously but it's a nice change of pace to have Mega Man ""covers"" that aren't your standard rock-fare.

Megaman,3bmpg6,Dash2110,2,Tue Jun 30 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"Would there be another way for Inafune to put out a true MM-style game, though? Because Capcom seems hell bent on never expanding the IP."

Once they start going down a different path with one of their IPs (in MM's case, Starforce), and find that people really aren't into it, they're like ""IP is ded, let's bury it"", and when fans ask for a new game from an older line (Original, X, LEGENDS) it goes completely ignored."
Megaman,3bmpg6,Hobokun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I'm with you, and I'm no Capcom apologist. For me it's just a personal choice. I have a tough time replacing 25+ years of stories, characters, etc. from my childhood for a crowdsourced game that has some MM style to it, even with it being developed by the co-creator of MM and all. Will I play it? Sure. Is it the new MM? Not to me."
Megaman,3bmpg6,Dash2110,2,Wed Jul 1 12:45:48 2015 UTC,"I generally don't even like rap, but MegaRan is just too good. I'm really looking forward to seeing him again at Orlando Nerd Fest!"
Megaman,3bmpg6,Hobokun,2,Wed Jul 1 02:25:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is a fantastic rapper. I love him and this is great news"
Megaman,3bmpg6,Mega_Manatee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm the only one that didn't jump on the ""spiritual successor"" bandwagon and have Beck replace Mega Man in my eyes.    I am the same his design isn't anywhere close to Mega Man. Having said that I am more excited for the game after recent impressions coming from E3. However I am 90% sure that someone will come up with a mod for the PC version that will actually put Mega Man or X into the game."
Megaman,3bmpg6,megatom0,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"his design isn't anywhere close to Mega Man   I don't feel like he's far away enough that he wouldn't be considered a Mega Man.  Rock, X, Volnut, Hub, Geo Stellar, the biometals, etc. were all distinct, and I don't see how Beck is more different than any of those two."

Megaman,3bmpg6,FlyLikeRabbi,2,Tue Jun 30 20:06:15 2015 UTC,Doing it officially or just like all his mega stuff?
Megaman,3bmpg6,xGhostCat,2,Tue Jun 30 14:28:48 2015 UTC,Officially.
Megaman,3bmpg6,xGhostCat,2,Tue Jun 30 14:34:24 2015 UTC,Fucking A
Megaman,3bmpg6,otheranotherbrother,2,Tue Jun 30 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"His ""Mega stuff"" is official too. He spoke about that during his concert. He literally recieved a phone call from Capcom and was told he had the legal go ahead and ""licensed"" by them."
Megaman,3bmpg6,otheranotherbrother,4,Tue Jun 30 14:48:58 2015 UTC,He meant in the game or not.
Megaman,3bmpg6,otheranotherbrother,2,Tue Jun 30 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"oooooh, my bad."
Megaman,3bmpg6,tmc_2011,3,Tue Jun 30 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"This is awesome. I've only seen been to one of his shows but it was amazing, and I've been a fan of his music for some time."
Megaman,3bmpg6,DudeWynaut,4,Tue Jun 30 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, that's awesome! Mega Ran is a great, hard working dude who deserves this! Puts on a great show at Magfest every year he's there."
Megaman,3boagh,Lord_Nihilum,2,Tue Jun 30 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"I hated that game so much, especially when program advances consumed ALL chips and it was hell leveling up Megaman's base stats. Oddly enough I loved the wonderswan game (literally rockman.exe Wondersawn I think). Exact same style of gameplay but the way chips were consumed made more sense and base stats were more fair."
Megaman,3boagh,-mickomoo-,2,Wed Jul 1 08:32:44 2015 UTC,"I love it! Always have a good time during my replays of it. It's so interesting, Cannon and Bomb chips have so much more use throughout this game more than the GBA games. The music in the game is just phenomenal.  My only real complaint is the terrible, terrible difficulty curve."
Megaman,3boagh,MidniteW,2,Wed Jul 1 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Transmission is probably the game I regret the most buying for the Gamecube as a kid.   The localization was lazy, only translating text. The lack of dubbed voices was disappointing, especially as I had liked the anime playing at the time.   The game was hard, with the difficulty compounded by the wait time you had for battle chips. This made boss fights incredibly difficult.   To this day, I still prefer the mainline Battle Network games to Transmission."
Megaman,3boagh,Critic_Kyo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:20:23 2015 UTC,Was that the one for GameCube?
Megaman,3boagh,DudeWynaut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:58:33 2015 UTC,yes
Megaman,3boagh,alphaProto,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:57:40 2015 UTC,I've never played a harder mega man game.
Megaman,3boagh,DudeWynaut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:41:39 2015 UTC,it was hard but in the wrong ways. Megabuster was absurdly underpowered but when leveled up absurdly overpowered. Chip consumption wasn't fair and made boss battles way more difficult than they should have been. I wanted to kill myself when I fought brightman.
Megaman,3bo8r7,Kman2097,2,Tue Jun 30 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Don't think there is an actual date yet, but it's looking like a Q4 release.   On a side-note, kudos for wanting to get into MM, I really hope there are more people out there like you. Hopefully with a combination of longtime fans and newer ones being introduced to it we could one day have a revival of the franchise."
Megaman,3bo8r7,Dash2110,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"Oh ok I thought I read something about a possible summer release, thats a bummer I was hoping it would come out before mighty no 9  Yeah I've gotten a newfound respect for older games and I plan on buying a raspberry pi 2 to make an emulation machine for my tv so I can play games like the original castlevanias, mega man games not available on PS4, and probably some other classic games. Any recommendations?"
Megaman,3bo8r7,DudeWynaut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:02 2015 UTC,Originally announced for a Q3 release. I'm not sure if that's changed.
Megaman,3bo8r7,mistermoomoo1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"""No solid release date yet, only summer"" source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKx0NdM_-xU that's a great video by the way, the devs talk about the changes and go really in depth."
