This would be accurate for the witcher 3 or gothic, not for skyrim.  bethesda uses a leveling system for foes, meaning that when you get better at something, the foes get better too. While you are learning to lockpick, the draugr are training. I Hope the link is correct because I'm at work and it's blocked  That means that whatever level you are, you can never be so good that what happens in the gif can happen because the foes are always getting better when you do. This is a major cririque of Skyrim and TES in general, because it makes progress sort of pointless, but make explorative open world much more ludicly managable."

analogygifs,39h6rx,xkcd_transcriber,0,Fri Jun 12 11:12:45 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly in agreement with this sub banning (I've seen fatpeoplehate leak before), but I disagree with that XKCD comic.  Provided it doesn't dip into harassment (as a friend used to say/quote:  ""my right to throw punches ends at another man's face""), I think groups like this shouldn't be chased away. Sunlight is the best disinfectant; sometimes the best argument is a counterexample.  But, more, it wasn't all that long ago that all the great social causes were on the opposite side of things.  It used to be the case that you couldn't even mention the existence of gay people in mainstream pop art because homosexuality was ""gross"".  For most of history, that's the face of 'community standards'.  It is entirety possible to backslide.  The ""it isn't censorship if it's not the gov't"" crowd are only singing that tune because their views are now strong.  And, even though I'm in agreement with those views, this attitude disgusts me.  Free discourse is an ideal, too!  Back when we needed it, we upheld it.  Now that it's inconvenient, we throw it aside?  I don't think ideals exist to be abandoned at their earliest convenience.  And, besides, we're not a perfect society--we may still need it.  With a greater and greater proportion of visible public discourse passing through the hands of fewer and fewer private entities, it is very likely that we will need it."

analogygifs,39dgnh,Pargelenis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:12:20 2015 UTC,"Fph was on for a long time.

Has nothing to do with censorship, as they will not remove any subs, even if they should, as long as they play ball"
analogygifs,39dgnh,Explosive_Diaeresis,-1,Thu Jun 11 11:55:56 2015 UTC,"An arbitrary, ambiguous application of censorship is not indicative of the ""open platform"" that the creators of Reddit advocated. Chairwoman Pao, the interim CEO of Reddit, is attempting to change the open platform that Reddit was supposed to be into some nebulous ""safe space"".   Any subreddits or users that step out of line and say something controversial can expect to be shadowbanned or banned outright under the new regime. How is this not censorship?? Unless what people are saying is actually illegal, there should be no banning of subs on a site that is supposed to embrace free and open discussion."
analogygifs,39dgnh,intrepiddemise,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:50:14 2015 UTC,Did the CEO just say that reddit was not a free speech platform?
analogygifs,39dgnh,Rushel,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"Short answer? Yes. She basically said so back in May. It's free-speech-oriented until someone gets offended and complains to the mods/admins. ""Harassment"" is a very ambiguous term, especially with regard to subreddits and their individual cultures."
analogygifs,39dgnh,intrepiddemise,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree in principle, but this is not going to be on the point I defend it. Reddit as a community engages in so much arbitrary self censorship via downvotes and modded communities, I'm not sure argument really holds water in practice.   And really this reeks of hyperbole, when we have so many egregious examples of truly reprehensible speech that Pao has said she is prepared to defend.  As a public company, Reddit has gone much farther to protect what is really garbage hateful content more than most social media companies.   Honestly, if there are things people can't feel they can talk about in Reddit at large, they are perfectly free to make a private subreddit and keep that trash amongst themselves."
analogygifs,39dgnh,Explosive_Diaeresis,0,Thu Jun 11 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"What egregious speech has she said she'd defend? She hasn't been in charge that long. The former CEOs said they'd defend a lot on free speech grounds, but I haven't seen Pao saying things like that. By contrast, she  uses the word ""safe"" a lot."
analogygifs,39dgnh,intrepiddemise,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"When asked specifically about /r/coontown (/r/niggers successor), she said they were not going to shut that down as long as they did not engage in harassing behaviors. She also said specifically they were going after the behaviors of fph and shitniggerssay. The fact people are glossing over and plain unaware of this is amazing to me, especially when espousing such vitriolic things toward her."

analogygifs,38pkev,Cheeseologist,3,Sat Jun 6 01:11:12 2015 UTC,"It's centered around a few techies. That's pretty much as much similarity it has to big bang. Other than that, it's good. No sitcom garbage. HBO is the best"
analogygifs,38pkev,Cheeseologist,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:47:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say there is more to it. For one, the show is about nerds as nerds. That is, they are markedly not normal. It's not just that they have similar professions ('cause they actually don't), but rather, it's that both shows focus on the characters' nerdiness as a main theme of the show. However, whereas Big Bang Theory makes their nerdiness the butt of meaningless jokes, the nerdiness of the characters in Silicon Valley aids them in their endeavours."
