computercollecting,3b42bd,8bitaficionado,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:14:11 2015 UTC,Of course the advantage of no-one wanting the stuff I collect means that I get it for cheap or free. ;-)

computercollecting,3az3sq,YeastPeople,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:39:15 2015 UTC,Wasn't that the issue that inspired Bill Gates to write Microsoft BASIC? EDIT: yes
computercollecting,3az3sq,8bitaficionado,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:52:30 2015 UTC,That has the Altair 8800 and is collectible.
computercollecting,39qv6v,mrpippy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't buy any of them (and not sure how much they would have wanted). Unfortunately I don't see much of a market for these games on eBay, which makes me sad since there's so many classics in there.  Anyone know if there's another forum or subreddit where people might be interested?"
computercollecting,39hlnm,8bitaficionado,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:41:34 2015 UTC,And there goes my hobby when speculators decide they can cash in on it for investment purposes.
computercollecting,38dhk9,8bitaficionado,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"""Because I couldn't when it wasn't.""  As someone who owns a six-rack Onyx2 system and a fully stacked Sun E10000 (amongst other stuff), I know exactly what this guy means. I remember whoring over the Sun.com HPC pages back in '98 and my little heart going pitter-patter looking at the monster E10k images. And now I have one of my own. Amen to obsolescence?"
computercollecting,3837wj,8bitaficionado,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:09:40 2015 UTC,Well he may be able to get $500
computercollecting,38337e,8bitaficionado,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:35:55 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know how much this is worth. But I figured I would post it.
computercollecting,380b96,flanintheface,1 point,Sun May 31 22:18:14 2015 UTC,Why can't people leave me Apple Is? People want me to pay $500 for their Commodore 64 without drives and covered in nicotine from years of smoking.
computercollecting,3711ny,11justsomekid,1 point,Sat May 23 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"Craigs list and local thrift stores for cheap buys. C64, Atri 800XL, Atari ST & Amiga are easy to get into cheaply and they benefit from a huge fanbase for help. Plus, you can get a disk/hard drive update for all of them and use a compact-flash card for file storage, very good for convenience and loading times on the Amiga & ST!  Radio Shack's Tandy CoCo 2 and 3 are a bit more obscure but can be found on ebay relatively cheaply and it has a huge library of fun.  Colecovision Adam is an interesting find, it's a tape-cassette based system with enhanced games over the Coleco console. Not a huge amount of fan support.  Tandy's Model 2 & 3's are interesting all-in-one units. SInce the hardware is pretty much all in one, there's no need to fuss with add-in cards. Which brings me to IBM clones, like 286, 386, 486. Honestly I find that a waste of time in the end. You can find them cheap and the cards cheap as well, but you have to fuss with IRQ's and crap that just make the things frustrating (I lived through that age, bah! Humbug!). You also won't want to run an old windows on those systems, if you do get into those old PC computers, keep it strictly DOS and find a multi-tasking utility called Desqview. It'll help with sanity a bit.  Hope that helps."
computercollecting,3711ny,BlueBrat,1 point,Sun May 24 19:39:12 2015 UTC,"I say get a cheap Commodore 64..  I see people practically give them away on craigslist. They are the Volkswagen beetle of computers and Commodore People are cool people to hang with.   You should be able to get one working with drive for $40  Ti99s are like $10 and are a lot of fun if you can find carts.   Amigas & STs are great but are getting expensive to find. Same with Apples... You used to be able to get a Apple IIe or Mac SE for like $20. Not anymore.   If you can get your hands on an old PC (pre-pentium) to play around with that's cool too because they are cheap.   Anyway I see a lot of stuff on Craigslist, thrift stores and garage sales."
computercollecting,36t6qf,chickenxhat,1 point,Thu May 21 22:38:20 2015 UTC,I checked craigslist in your area and I cannot believe the prices.. No way I'm paying $300 for a Mac+
computercollecting,36t6qf,8bitaficionado,1 point,Tue May 26 15:29:30 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. It's absurd. I recently saw a screen grab on here of a mac in a dumpster. You won't see that around here in free box town. Savvy pickers scoop everything up and turn it around for profit. Disturbing.
