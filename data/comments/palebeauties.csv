palebeauties,2twtjv,ninjavanish72,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:20:28 2015 UTC,If i had the chance i would still date her despite the toys. I think all of the girls i have dated have liked some type of cartoon or toy that isn't exactly viewed as mature. I think it has normally been Disney or anime but that could be just the type of girls that i like.
palebeauties,2twtjv,kwyjiboner,1 point,Wed Jan 28 03:44:50 2015 UTC,Honestly no one cares about the state of you penis or you aversion to ponies. Everyone is childish in some ways and to judge someone because they like something is juvenile.
palebeauties,2twtjv,ninjavanish72,1 point,Wed Jan 28 03:13:10 2015 UTC,You're judging me for being juvenile right now. Mr. Pot.
palebeauties,2twtjv,kwyjiboner,1 point,Wed Jan 28 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"My apologies, i had a bad day and i said some harsh things. But i really hate generalizations. You basically said liking a certain thing can make someone unattractive. People are more complex and can't be defined by one thing. Not all sports fans are jocks, not all girls that watch twilight are emotionally unstable, not all male dancers are gay, not all black men are thugs, and not all people that watch cartoons act like children, etc. So far i found out that no matter what type of fans you find there are good people, bad people, and some that take a fandom to seriously. People should be judged on what they do and who they are, not for their current fandom."
palebeauties,2twtjv,ninjavanish72,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:21:39 2015 UTC,"You basically said liking a certain thing can make someone unattractive.   It can. There is more to a person than physical beauty. This woman is quite physically attractive, but the assumptions I've made about her personality would be a deal breaker for me. I should stress that we're talking about the hypothetical person represented by these scant few modeling photos, I know nothing of the real person, nor will I ever. There's no need to defend and no person in need of defense; just a concept."

With all my posts i try to use the models name if i know it so i don't repost the photo on accident. But with this one i couldn't prove one way or the other so i made up a title.
