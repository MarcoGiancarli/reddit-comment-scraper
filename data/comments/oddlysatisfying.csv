It builds a temp file for every new file that comes in so it can scan it for threats - except it sometimes bugs out and never deletes the temp files causing it to slowly use up the entire drive's worth of free space.  It's a god-awful program.

Windows usually will delete temp files (as you need space) or will let you know you have low disk space. The time it might be an issue is usually with gamers and needing to install a 20+GB game.

oddlysatisfying,3dx9fm,slightrightofcenter,16,Mon Jul 20 14:54:13 2015 UTC,The attention to detail and the care given to small wonders is what makes ghibli films really special to me. One of my favourite examples to give is the tiny scene where Sen from Spirited Away taps her shoes on while picking up her little socks. The treatment of light through windows and the way wind is depicted are also some of my favourite aspects of ghibli films <3
oddlysatisfying,3dx9fm,theaether,6,Mon Jul 20 15:03:31 2015 UTC,Oh I love that shoe moment too! :) I also love their skies.

The first one because everything looks so sumptuous, especially when they're dipping the food into the sauces and picking it off the platters, and the second because I've definitely cried into my rice before and that scene portrayed it perfectly."

oddlysatisfying,3du11g,waytoomainstream,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:18:19 2015 UTC,Can confirm that this is done by hand. I used to work as a pipefitter helper and the welders would lay some beautiful welds like this all day. The way they do it is have the tig welding torch in one hand and a tungsten rod in the other. They first start it off by flicking the rod on the tip of the torch like a match. Then they slowly feed the rod into the torch tip and slightly whip their wrist back and forth with the torch while also walking around the pipe to get that consistent pattern you see. When the welds are gold like that it means they were perfect with their motions and with the speed that they were traveling. I was always amazed watching people do this.
oddlysatisfying,3du11g,DisaronnoInMyCup,2,Mon Jul 20 07:59:10 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the guy used a torch at least.

There are shitty jobs in $10-15 range. You would have to take one and learn and learn and sweat and learn. After a year or two, you move to a new job, slightly better pay, but not great. More sweat, blood and learning. After a few more years... You're getting there. It took me 5 years of crap jobs before I got decent pay. 5 more to get good pay.

oddlysatisfying,3dsfrr,fawkkyall,13,Sun Jul 19 13:16:17 2015 UTC,Man y'all are gross. Do you say these things out loud in real life too or do you have the sense to keep it to yourself?
oddlysatisfying,3dsfrr,smittywrbermanjensen,10,Sun Jul 19 08:42:39 2015 UTC,Don't worry. I highly doubt they have anyone to talk to in real life.
oddlysatisfying,3dsfrr,Hexodus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:14:40 2015 UTC,I try not to surround myself with humourless uptight people so that when I do say something funny I'm around people who can enjoy it.
