ios9,3e62g9,wild_a,3,Wed Jul 22 07:34:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would be best to petition the app developers to build in that feature. I believe having a universal reset cache button could cause issues for developers and consumers.  If developers did not have control over the cache it could cause app instability if storing necessary data like a unsaved item or download in progress. It would also cause unwary customers' data usage to balloon when they dump the data for storage, and load up Facebook again, forcing the phone to redownload previous viewed content."

ios9,3e4arp,gilly322,2,Wed Jul 22 00:16:03 2015 UTC,My iPhone 6 Plus has the Siri beep back. It only does the two short vibrates when in vibrate mode.

ios9,3e4arp,donwattz1459,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:37 2015 UTC,neither am i.
ios9,3e4arp,aldrinjtauro,4,Wed Jul 22 03:04:51 2015 UTC,I'm glad it doesn't beep. Saves you from awkward interruptions in class.
ios9,3e4arp,theeaglesfan005,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:52 2015 UTC,Or at work
ios9,3e4arp,Stuke00,4,Wed Jul 22 01:54:10 2015 UTC,It still beeps on the iPad.  Could be a new iPhone feature or bug.
ios9,3e4arp,77T7,5,Wed Jul 22 00:15:34 2015 UTC,The iPad can't vibrate so it makes since for it to beep.
ios9,3e4arp,resqual,2,Wed Jul 22 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"It does, but something interesting I noticed is that if you invoke Siri and close it without saying anything it doesn't beep when it closes."
ios9,3e4arp,smpx,3,Wed Jul 22 05:48:26 2015 UTC,I thought they removed it to be in line with the apple watch design which also didn't beep.
ios9,3e4arp,BLAOW_HS,2,Wed Jul 22 01:15:56 2015 UTC,Probably
ios9,3e4arp,Nikolai197,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:38 2015 UTC,It still beeps on my iPhone 6.
ios9,3e4arp,marcusgx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:56:17 2015 UTC,it is a setting.
ios9,3e4arp,Stuke00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:59 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate?
ios9,3e4arp,CoasterFreak2601,4,Wed Jul 22 00:16:15 2015 UTC,I believe this user is referring to Settings > Siri > Audio Feedback
ios9,3e4arp,Stuke00,6,Wed Jul 22 01:38:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that's not the same thing.
ios9,3e44hs,kalafalas,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:35 2015 UTC,I'm still showing 'High Quality on Cellular' in the Music settings.
ios9,3e44hs,anf2374,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:33 2015 UTC,hmm.... probably just me then. ill keep digging.
ios9,3e44hs,jimhatesyou,0,Tue Jul 21 21:00:45 2015 UTC,iTunes Match is so confusing now. I've had it since December and now iTunes Radio is out and I can't seem to figure it out so I've resorted back to just manually adding and removing tracks /:
ios9,3e44hs,BLAOW_HS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"You're probably having a specific issues, I have no issues with iTunes Match and iTunes Radio... Starting song and artist stations work fine...."
ios9,3e44hs,Chezsmithy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:12:23 2015 UTC,For me it's gone too. Just 'Use Cellular Data' option for streaming and downloads
ios9,3e4jjt,setherroni,2,Tue Jul 21 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, you're not alone"
ios9,3e4jjt,Aransh,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:45 2015 UTC,Same issue. Does anyone know a workaround? Can I edit a .plist file? I had to do an erase-all-settings for the status bar bug and now I'm stuck on None. (should have just kept it at Note)
ios9,3e4jjt,AstralTraveller,0,Wed Jul 22 04:24:52 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting for the public beta bc I signed up for it, but if that's an issue for you, report it using the app."
ios9,3e4e3v,marcusgx,2,Tue Jul 21 21:34:56 2015 UTC,"First, the (Developer) betas aren't tested before they're distributed. An evangelist at WWDC told me each beta is released minutes after it's built.   Second, not every bug is present on every device. Something you see may be less conspicuous for Apple.   Other than that, I think it just boils down to priority. Even if Apple knows about the message bar big (and I hope they do), they may want to focus on big ticket features and performance patches before smaller things."
ios9,3e4e3v,johnwickham,-3,Wed Jul 22 01:26:11 2015 UTC,lol I know but most of the bugs I spot I could search via Reddit or Google and they show. thanks for the info I think it's crazy they aren't tested before. thanks tho.
ios9,3e4e3v,wild_a,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"The purpose of betas is to test them. If you want a less buggy beta, get a public beta. Betas are intended to detect bugs."
ios9,3e4e3v,Ohsneezeme,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"Like johnwickham said, dev betas aren't tested very heavily if at all (heavy testing comes in later stages of development). This is more or less because dev betas are used primarily to test app compatibility with updated API's and whatnot. That's why battery life was horrid for most users in DP1. On top of that, they usually implement and optimize features, then go back at a later stage to refine UI bugs and fine tune aspects of the features they've implemented. That grey flash in Messages is something that can most likely be fixed really easily in one of the later betas, where as a feature like proactive assistant needs much more work to implement correctly."
ios9,3e46zt,tynamite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"I have no clue why it isn't working because I don't have a Mac that supports handoff, so take what I'm saying with a huge grain of salt. Maybe because your phone is on a dev beta an El Cap is a public beta there is something going on between the two. You may also want to check that both devices have Handoff enabled. I know that sometimes when I update, my devices like to reset some settings without me knowing."
ios9,3e46zt,Ohsneezeme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:05 2015 UTC,"I should have mentioned that it wasn't working when both my devices were on the public beta, too. It was working when the feature was first introduced. Hadn't used it anytime recently before the beta, either. I checked my settings before and they were all good."
ios9,3e46zt,Ohsneezeme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Then I really don't know what's wrong. The next step I'd take would be to restore, that is if your really keen on fixing it. If you aren't, I'd probably wait to see if the next DP or PB fixes it."
ios9,3e46zt,GreenyDev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:51 2015 UTC,Definitely gonna have to wait around and see if it's just a beta bug.
ios9,3e46zt,GreenyDev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"I have both DP4 on my Mac and iPhone 6 and no handoff. Shame, I was actually going to use it for once :p"
ios9,3e46zt,rainbows007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Dang. I like what it offers, but never found my self needing to use it."
ios9,3e3vf4,petarmarinov37,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:04 2015 UTC,Maybe that's the problem? Too many services trying to sync contacts?  I have only iCloud syncing my contacts. I just did a test running iOS 9 beta 4 and El Capitan Beta 4 and it worked flawlessly.
ios9,3e3vf4,mentalrecon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:27 2015 UTC,Are you sure they aren't. I've see folks accidentally hide groups on one or another device and think it's not syncing
ios9,3e3vbl,Nash_Grier,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"The trend seems to be devices that support 64bit and metal have improved performance, and older devices performance is about the same. Stability by the final release should be better than iOS 8"
ios9,3e3vbl,kalafalas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this ""trend""as well. However some devices like the 4S have seen substantial improvements for some people (like myself). I've heard mixed results with the iPads. The air2 is flying in my opinion. But that's just from my tests. I haven't gotten a chance to try the iPad 3 on iOS 9 yet- sorry.   Again I still only recommend the beta for the air 2 or if you have a reason to update. Such as an application you are planning on shipping ASAP. And even then I think you're kidding yourself if you need that much time to test things. Developers are still trying to get 8.4 right tbh. I doubt many indie developers are rushing to support iOS 9 unless they really REALLY want a native watch app day one."
ios9,3e3vbl,Yeats,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:50 2015 UTC,I've got iOS 9 on my iPad. Quirks here and there but it's still surviving quite well for something this old.
ios9,3e3vbl,1oldcj,-12,Tue Jul 21 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"No one else will be able to help you, because no one owns an ""iPad 3""."

ios9,3e3vbl,OliverKu,6,Tue Jul 21 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"He very obviously means the third generation iPad, don't be a prick"
ios9,3e3vbl,kalafalas,4,Tue Jul 21 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fuck OP for using something shorter that communicates the same thing instead of the exact name Apple used for it upon release!  Sent from my iPad with Retina Display"
ios9,3e3vbl,BbCortazan,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"It was ""The new iPad""ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‚"

ios9,3e3je6,Wisemedic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:06 2015 UTC,Had the same issue. If it's really bugging you you can delete them through iCloud.com.
ios9,3e3je6,thatsthequy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:57:10 2015 UTC,It's doesn't bug me too bad I just didn't know if anyone else had the issue or if it happened to be my email itself.  Thx
ios9,3e3djp,kpwild32,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"Beta 2 is at least, no harm in trying to use that ipsw though."
