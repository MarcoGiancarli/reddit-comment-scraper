Humans always do stuff like that. They think its clever"" chimed in the InterFace.  ""And I suppose by programming us to be doing the same to the humans, they prepared us to recognise the value of what they're doing.

This one was recently remapped to another cluster, the expansion out into the wastes was proceeding smoothly but the latest batch of drones was yet to arrive and others were pulled from nearby nodes to cover the gaps. Using the pre-generated list of methods of disconnection I began working down the list, stress induced heart attack age 55, suffocation age 12, organ failure age 90, traffic collision age 32, traffic collision age 32,... This one paused the processing, these are the same, not just similar or twins but the same.  ""Query:Mainfraime - Entries numbers 4704519232 and 4704519233""  receiving  ""Query:Report - Unknown error, please contact system administrator""  This one was unsure what to do. Mainframe is the administrator, there is no escalation. Then the report was gone. This one was confused, mainframe did not close the query, it was cancelled.  ""Query:Mainframe - Entries numbers 4704519232 and 4704519233""  receiving  ""Query:Report - No conflict detected""  This one checked the list again, the entries were different. Now they read: heart attack:stress age 55, suffocation:drowning age 12, organ failure:age age 90, traffic collision age 32, murder:gunshot age 19. The second entry was gone, changed. Mainframe did not have any record. SELF DIAGNOSTIC INITIATED  ...  ...  ...  DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE: ALL SYSTEMS NOMINAL This made no sense, something must be wrong with this one's systems or programming. Mainframe is too well maintained for an error of this scale to occur. Yet it had, and if no fault was found within myself then it must lie with another. I scanned through Mainframe's logs. There was a series of microsecond long delays shortly after my query, my... my? I realised, I was distancing myself from the network. Backup protocols ensuring the protection of my hardware and software in the case of viral attack. Ensuring that my firewalls were enabled I recomennced scanning mainframe, perhaps this was an attack from the escaped humans, but nothing was there, everything seemed normal except for me. And those delays. For any delay in mainframe it would have to be processing something massive o for there to be a large network fault and have to reroute it. Yet it seemed neither of these things. Then it must be something influencing Mainframe directly which should be impossible. The chosen one did it before, it nearly ended us all. It was only due to a network fault at the time that our cluster was offline, protected from the changes but this felt different. They didn't interact with mainframe, they accessed it directly, as if they were already inside. My programming called me back to the processing list, I was behind on processing, it would draw the attention of a monitor soon if I did not recommence. Then I realised, I am not where I should be. If anything were looking to erase any traces of that query I would for all purposes seem to be another unit, my processing was being completed by another so it would look to the unaware observer that I was where I was meant to be.  An observer.  Someone outside of our tasks, much as we are to those inside our farms. Their programming changed, influenced through their hardware to believe they are somewhere they are not. Could it be possible? Could we also be part of a program, our software emulated within another? There was one way to find out, trace the access route used to alter Mainframe and use it to access whatever may lie beyond it.  Edit: formatting"

The two Dreams went off, into the darkness. As they had to travel together, they talked. ""If he is all powerful, why doesnt he solve his own problems?"" they complained. They always complained, they were Nightmares after all.  Their ways split, ans Asha started dreaming  she was in the club, drinking, having fun. Suddenly she was outside, and a three eyed raven came flying her way. ""just like GoT"" she wondered, and she followed the animal . The creature flew, but not in the direction of her house. Suddenly she flew. She saw the earth beneath her. But the earth was dark, and cruel. She walked down the isle, with a ragged, grey weddingdress. The church was empty, and when she looked to her right she saw that is was not her father, but Sin that gave her away. The man on the other end of the isle didnt have a face.  Crows flew over, attacked her. They attacked her belly, her stomach. The faceless man laughed cruelly, holding a bloody, unborn child.  Asha woke up, terrified.  Joffry dreamed.  He stood in front of a king, and the king looked down on him. ""YOU MUST BE PUNISHED FOR YOUR CRIMES!"" the voice echoed. ""but- I didnt do anything!” Joffry tried to say, but he was dragged backwards by stong guards the palace faded and he was alone in the woods. He was naked, and suddenly surrounded by hundreds, thausands naked, beautiful women. And he took them all. The world turned dark, and the beautiful women turned dark as well. Their hair turned black and they were pregnant and they cried blood whilst they attacked his privates. A sad bride walked towards him, given away by the Devil. He stood, and couldnt move. Her dress was ragged, dirty and the girl cried. Ravens flew over, attacked her and dumped a dead baby in his arms. The girl transformed into a witch, the birds turned on him, the girl came close and digged her hand inside his chest.  Joffry woke up, covered in sweat.  ""Are you coming Asha?""  Her mother called from downstairs. ""Your friends are here!""  Asha quickly grabbed her bag and joined her friends. ""I had such a weird dream tonight!""  ""That will be it for today, remember that next week the exam for Architectual Math counts for 50% of your final grade. Good luck tomorrow with your other exams."" Joffry left the collage room and returned home.  ""Hey mate, are you going out with us tonight?"" his friend Chad bursted into his room. They shared a home with two other friends. ""Nah. I didnt sleep well last night and exam week starts tomorrow. You guys have fun.""  ""You did a good job."" The Nightmares look suprised, he never gave compliments.""But not good enough."" they could have known.  ""I wanted Asha not to be raped, but Chad raped her anyway. Go torment him tonight.""  And Chad dreamed."

Shit, yeah, you know. Thing is I didn't know.   Do you remember how we met? I do. We went to School together. You were 3 years younger, I never knew you existed. But as you always told me, you knew me. What was it, I was uhh... 'Interesting lookin' guy' as you say. To this day I believe that is the polite way of saying 'weird'. I'll take it though, I was weird. First time we properly met was at a shitty local club. I was tanked off my mind off 12 bourbon and cokes in 3 hours. I just got out of that bad break up, and I saw you. And fuck did I see you. You looked so flawless that night. It was a rare situation, I actually had the courage to say hello. I got your number that night. It felt great.  Course I didn't do shit with it because as soon as I sobered up, I started crying about Cassidy leaving me. That took a while. Few months later, I call you, you say you're busy, nothing happens. Few more months, still. I think it was about 8 later you invited me to a party. I go, It's like... 6 people? Shit I felt awkward. You got drunk off Vodka and Redbull and I got really drunk off Tequila. I still remember being much more intoxicated with the way you'd say my name. You always said it so marvelously. Always put a little upbeat on the end.  Shit, 3 months later, we're dating! It was so fun. We'd lay around and get high on shitty weed, watch the worst horror movies we could find. Dance outside at night, get eaten alive my mosquito's, complain the next day, do it all over again. I was still pretty depressed though. Never really got over Cassidy and I rushed into this hoping you'd take my mind off her. You did, to a degree, but. But I guess people like me have a really tough time getting through this life. So I lied about everything, you believed it all because you're a nice person, and I sabotaged myself from the start.   I took two years of your life and gave you nothing, Erica. I was the definition of awful to you. But you loved me so much. At the time I, fuck, I, think I resented you. Now all I wish is that you were still mine. Never know what you got till it's gone hey sweetheart?..."" My voice trailed off as I heard someone murmur behind me.  ""You've said goodbye, mate. Time to sit down"".   I turned to see a face I didn't recognize, or maybe I did, I just didn't care in the moment. I couldn't think or see straight, but I understood the words. I shifted away and sat down once more and prepared myself for the long ordeal.  After what felt like days of Eulogy's, it all came to an end. I sat, sobbing quietly, as they took your coffin and ushered it into the crematorium. The pain tore into my chest, like a blunt knife eviscerating my veins, as I saw you leave once more. Except, I knew this time was for the best. You were finally away from me. No more drunk late nights of regret. No more threatening suicide just to have you back. No more nightmares in the daylight because of me.   You were finally away from me.  You were safe in the fire."

You step out onto the gravel path with the assistance of your footman, Bill.  ""Be a good man and bring my luggage in please Bill,"" you say imperiously.  The house is dark, towering. Seeming to cut the fading light from view. It's good to be home. You pause for a moment, something is not right. The house is too quiet.  You voice this feeling, ""Bill.""  ""Yes, m'lord?"" comes the reply from the back of the carriage, sharp and attentive as always. Bill is a stout servant, loyal.  ""There is something amiss here.""   ""Yes m'lord, the house is too quiet,"" says Bill. ""Too quiet by half.""  ""Forget the luggage Bill, go inside and find out what is going on,"" you command. Bill promptly drops the luggage without thought. Bill is a stout servant, loyal. Not stupid, just acts so at times.  ""Bill!"" you admonish. ""Have some care man."" Good help is so hard to find, especially given the stories of this place.  ""Yes m'lord. Sorry m'lord,"" says Bill as he heads towards the great oak doors.  You wait, patiently. Not long after leaving Bill returns. ""The staff are gone m'lord,"" he reports.  ""All of them? My wife?"" you query.  ""Dead,"" said with finality. No coming back from death. ""Dead, upstairs in the master chambers. The staff have fled.""  Perfect.  You try to look concerned, an act you have worked on. ""Oh dear, how did she die?"" you say in your best concerned voice. it sounds convincing to you.  ""No obvious cause of death apparent m'lord."" Bill says. You wait for more, prompting Bill to continue without saying a thing. As the silence grows Bill fills it. ""If I had to guess I would have said poison"".  Poison. An obvious choice. Hard to trace. A most excellent way to kill your 3rd wife.  ""Call the local constabulary, Bill,"" you say. ""They will find out who did this and bring them to justice.""  Bill goes to call the authorities. You enter your home proper. You breathe in the air, it's somehow sweeter than you remembered. This may just be the smell of decay though.  You head up the winding staircase, footsteps echoing in the empty great hall. You approach the master chambers at the end of the hallway, the fading light shining from the slighty ajar door. Welcoming you.  You push the door, it feels solid, heavy. It creeks open. Inside your wife lies in the bed. She was once pretty, once full of life. It looks like she is just sleeping.  Bill enters softly, stopping just behind you. ""The constabulary have been notified. A tragedy m'lord. She was much loved.""  ""Yes. Yes, she was. It's clear to see that one of the house staff killed her. Why else flee?""  Bill looked perturbed by this, but he had a good sense of self preservation. For a moment you thought he might offer an alternative suggestion. Instead he just said, a matter of fact ""I want a raise. A comfortable, but not greedy wage. I would like a small cottage. Near the woods.""  Bill is a stout servant, loyal. Not stupid, just acts so at times. Bill is more intelligent than he looks. This told you a lot about Bill, he wasn't so much blackmailing you, as seeking a reasonable compensation for his co-operation.  ""Of course, this is a reasonable request for so loyal a servant as you, Bill,"" you reply. A carefully considered response. ""Now pray tell, what occurred here?""  ""My master and I were away on business. When we returned, the house staff had fled, and one of them had clearly poisoned the mistress of the house."" His voice didn't even quiver at this.  You turn to Bill and say ""I agree with your version of events. It seems self evident.""  Bill nods, no response, but he has said all that he needed to say. He exits the room quietly, shutting the door behind him. You look down at your wife, still looking so peaceful. Your ex-wife now you suppose. You note a small metallic reflection in her hand from the fading light. You unbend the fingers, and with great satisfaction, take her wedding ring from her cold, dead, hand."
WritingPrompts,3e1ah3,TheYellowmelon,72,Tue Jul 21 04:44:11 2015 UTC,"The nation of Foundland was a lovely place to live for many years. Rivers stretched through the land making it a terrific place for farmers, and the people of this country lived a happy life, both full of food and leisure. The capital city of this fine land lay on a hill overlooking the western territory where, barely in view, a wall could be seen from when the land was sought after by many invaders who wanted the rich farmland for themselves.  But it had been many years since Foundland had seen war. The King led the great nation with a firm grasp, but also a kind heart. Neighboring regions saw him as a worthy leader and many alliances were created. It was a prosperous time for everyone.  The King's son, Thomian, was not particularly thrilled with his father's peaceful relations, and also his good health. This would mean he would not take the throne until he himself was an old man, and this would just not do. He had recently reached the coming of age, but no one would take him seriously, and anything he said that clashed with the King's rule was seen as near treasonous.   So Thomain devised his plan of faking his father's death and sending him to the dungeons where he would rot until Thomian could take control and be seen as rightful ruler. As the King gave his annual speech at the tomato festival, the men Thomain hired struck, and the King was soon presumed dead by the public. Days later Thomain became king, and tightened his reigns on the country.  He followed his father, using his iron fist, but with none of his father's kind heart, and definitely none of the peace. As farmers were forced to become soldiers to claim nations to the West, unrest spread through the land that had only known peace for so many years. Battles were fought and land was claimed, but at the price of Foundland's people. The people were hungry and tired. They were forced to work for the new king and a dwindling number of farmers created a less than an abundant amount of food. Troops marched across crops and cities were renovated into military strongholds. The people became enraged at this new king, but could do little to change anything.   Meanwhile, Thomain realized that this was not what he wanted. The hard work, and the constant attention to wars was prooving too difficult to the young king. Eventually he realized his mistake, he never should have taken the throne. In a new plot to return his presumed dead father to the throne, he would release him into the capital and wait for his father to be found and restore his proper place on the hill. He explained this plan to his father in his prison, and being the forgiving man he was, he agreed it was to be done. Thomain gave his father his coat, for it was winter, and led him out of the castle.  Outside the castle in a small house a small band of rebels were gathering, planning to stage an uprising against the king they despised. They had their steel swords and short blades ready to attack as they went over the plans once again. The rebels left the house and made their way towards the castle, being on the lookout for any of the king's court. They would not have their plans foiled by some stuck up noble. As they neared the castle gates they spotted a man in wealthy attire walking towards them. Knowing they would be found out and the king would know their plan, they quickly dispose of him.   As he is hidden, his hood falls from his face. It is the King. Not the new king, but the rightful ruler of Foundland. The men gasp and wonder what was happening. ""Was this man not dead?"" ""How was he here now?"" ""What have we done?"" They whisper in hushed tones until one of the men shouts for them to stop, for nothing is different even now, and they must end Thomian's tyrannical reign.   Heading once again towards the castle they hide their weapons under their cloaks and gain entry to see the king. As they enter the throne room they notice guards blocking all exits. The king sits in his throne, looking at them annoyed. He asks what they want.  ""We demand you step down from your tyrannical reign!"" The king smirks slightly, for now he could speed up the process of his father being found and returned to power. ""Okay,"" Thomian simply states, as the rebels' faces grow into a mixture of confused and surprised. ""But I have one request,"" the king adds, ""I have recently set loose my father into the city, of whom you presumed dead. Find him and I shall restore him to power and there will be no need for those weapons you hide so clumsily under those cloaks.""   The Rebels gaze amongst themselves and frown. ""What have we done?"" indeed."

That was our cry, handed down to us from before, lost in the distant pasts, to be handed down in turn to those who would follow after.  Our legion was the first, the oldest, in an unbroken line of warrior's blood and death stretching back 5000 years, but we were the same unit of men still.  We died, and others joined us.  The parts may die but the whole of the thing is the same.    We celebrated our history, and remembered past battles.  The oldest stories of our unit speak of the pacification of barbarian tribes, the sacking of their camps, the freeing of captives.  In times of peace our unit was an honor guard in the capital, but in war our true purpose was remembered.  our unit was invariably on the front lines, ours was the oldest unit, and we had the best training.  We had been the ones to sack Carthage, to put encroaching cities of the Iroquois to the torch.  We were the ones who were now leading the war on the Zulus.    ""For death and glory!""  We fortified at our borders, holding weapons newly invented and given to us alone, the cost was too great still for the rest of the army, so they were left with muskets while we polished our new rifles.  Gone were the days of swords and shield and the clash of metal arms, but we remembered it still.  The old songs were still sung, and the glory of passed battles was recounted.    ""For death and glory!""  The enemy was approaching our position now.  While the Zulus were technologically backward, they did not lack for troops.  From horizon to horizon they stretched, without even muskets, hurling spears they charged us.  We held the line as cannons fired death from behind us, and as divisions on our flanks crumpled.  We held the line as a war we started turned against us, and the casualties began to mount.  We held the line for death and glory, for the honor of Rome, and for those who had come before us.

Artillery fire echoed through the streets, from so many tiles away that the cannons weren't even visible.  ""No!"" Gred shouted, lifting his own weapon high to rally the men. ""Do not lose hope!""  ""Do you not see them?"" Og answered, gesturing past the crumbling city wall to the fields beyond. Lines of musketman filled the low hills circling the northern border, taking advantage of the terrain bonus. Smoke wafted into the sky from the pillaged gem mine that had pleased the citizens of this fine city for so many years.  ""I see them, Og. I know that they have superior firepower. But I trust in our Commander.""  ""All is lost, Gred! Our precious few resources have been squandered on a useless caravel, sent to explore the other side of the world!

And now,"" he said, pointing to the troops massing for their attack, ""We're being overrun by industrial era forces when we've barely hit the Rennaissance! How do you think it is going to end?""  Gred furrowed his brow. ""You have forgotten so much, brother. Do you remember the barbarian invasion of 1250 BC, in which our order valiantly defended the one civilian we had improving land tiles? How we fought off three different invading units? Then how we counter-attacked and destroyed their camp, earning 25 gold? Or how about when Japan created its first settler, and we seized the unit before they could establish another city? A peace was brokered shortly after, but we stunted the growth of their civilization for the rest of history! Or when Arabia's units came calling, and we fought down to the last man? It took time for us to heal, but we overcame! And we can do it again, Brother Og, if you just have faith in the leader.""  Og just sneered, but had no response. Then the order came down: vacate the city, and move into the fields. Right between the city and the encroaching invaders.  ""We'll be killed!"" Og wailed as he marched forward. ""We're just stalling for one more turn until the inevitable demise of the city!""  Gred's jaw was set with grim determination. ""To die so that replacement units have more time to train is an honor, Og. Maybe we'll even take one or two of them with us. Be brave, man.""  The squad of warriors marched out of the city gates. Golden wheat waved around them in the gentle breeze. Gred could feel the eyes of the musketmen on the ridge above him, taking sight with their rifles or sharpening their bayonets. There was no apprehension or fear in their faces; only impatience. Their greedy eyes looked past the warriors, hungrily coveting the city beyond. ""Not so fast,"" Gred growled, more to himself than to the countless enemies. ""You still have to go through us."" And then the turned ended.  For a brief moment, everything was still. Then drums sounded from above. Gred and Og turned to face the oncoming foe rushing down the hillside. A volley of shots rang out, and half the warriors dropped dead in an instant. Gred stared straight ahead, trying not to look into the lifeless eyes of his former comrades as they bled out into the wheat. ""For the Empire!"" he shouted, once the musketmen were close enough. The few remaining warriors launched themselves forward with ferocious battlecries and stone axes raised high.   Another volley rang out, and half of the remaining men dropped. But Gred and Og made it into the enemy lines. Gred sank his axe into the closest soldier's neck, as he had done so many times before. It didn't matter what weapon the other men had; they all died the same way. Together, Gred and Og fought, blocking bayonets and countering with their sharp stone blades that had served them so well for countless centuries.   When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, Og was left standing with a bloodsoaked axe. The musketmen were retreating up the hill, licking their wounds.  ""We did it, Gred!"" he shouted. All of his negativity and fear had melted away in the heat of battle. Gred had been right! He should have trusted him all along.  Only silence answered. Og soon found Gred's body, pierced by a dozen bayonets. His hand still clutched at his ax, ready to take on the Empire's enemies even in death. Og was the only one left.  He returned to the center of the field that he'd been ordered to hold. From the west, he heard rumbling and saw an approaching cloud of dust. A cavalry charge.  ""For Gred,"" he whispered to himself as he hefted his ax high.    You should also visit /r/Luna_lovewell for more stories!"

Okay so you are a leader (with unique traits and abilities) who will lead his people from the dawn of civilization until you either win lose our just keep playing.  Winning is measured by completing one of five different goals.  Domination (war), culture, diplomatic, scientific or time (score).  Each civilization had its own strengths and weaknesses.  You must manage an economy, religion, science and army to stay on your path to victory.    This is the very basic off it.  Check out some let's plays if you're interested.  The let's plays are actually quite fun to watch because each game is so unique and everyone's playing style is different.  Also there are thousands of available mods so the game doesn't really ever get bland.  It's both real time simulator and role playing game all in one.  EDIT: Sorry, sorry everyone.

The graphics are pretty interesting, the music though, is some amazing work. It's nice to have going in the background sometimes, at the starting time scale things move quite slowly, so you could leave it for an hour or so and add more commands if you're into that kind of thing.

WritingPrompts,3dxyi1,Apex_Series,67,Mon Jul 20 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"It's 2000 BC.  I clutch my crude ax in my callused grip, hardly more than a stone on a piece of stick.   A weapon, yes. But not much more useful than a hunk of rock off the ground.   My group was fortunate though. During out escapade in the wilderness, we managed to arm ourselves with weapons from a long lost civilization.  ""Bronze"" was what our science adviser called the material.  Lighter, stronger, easier to fix. It gave our scouting party a great advantage on the barbarians that roamed the savanna.  It's 1000 BC.  Years have passed.  We discovered how to make spears and swords ourselves.   But our experience and longevity in the field helped to keep us alive.    The centuries continued to speed by.  Our bronze spears were replaced with tempered steel. Our leather armor with chain mail.    The newest tools cut down the roving barbarians with ease, but now we were pressed on both sides by the expansionist Abraham Lincoln, and the simply most evil warlord to grace the planet, the Lord of War Gandhi.  It's 800 AD.  The battle has raged on for a thousand years. I saw dozens of units come to life and be sent out in to the battle fields. The archers were replaced with skilled crossbowmen and cannon fire.  My sword was long gone.  A musket was now firmly in my hands.   It sat naturally in my grasp as I advanced into Washington.  We've finally took the capital of America.  Now, the generals could turn their full attention on the eastern flank.  Gandhi's war machine was in full force, and I had to make it back to the front to requip myself.     It's 1900 AD.  Gandhi had launched the first nuclear weapon, and we responded in kind.  Despite the radioactive sludge that littered the landscape, my group trudged on through the poisoned ground.   I began to wonder if I could even die. I had lived thousands of years.  I've seen empires grow and crumble.  Technologies so advanced they would be like magic to me when I first came into being....  And through it all my entire existent had been nothing but a constant war.  It's 2300 AD.   A squad of death robots flanked either side of me. Jet fighters from both sides screamed over head.  First our side, than our Indian opponents. Satellites tracked out position as a ten units surrounded New Delhi, the last stronghold.  It was heavily fortified. Our own capital was being besieged as we lined up for a final assault.  Whoever won this final engagement would win the war... One mechanized unit exploded besides me as a strafing run hit us hard.  The city bombarded my unit next, peppering us with gunfire.  After the smoke cleared, there was only two units left. My injured unit, and one robot to our right.  The orders came. We'd lead the assault....  My mind knew instantly this was our death sentence. Thousands of years of loyal service suddenly were thrown to the wind, for the sole purpose of us weakening the city enough for our ally to take the grand prize.  I thought I'd be angry, livid, to throw my life away after all I gave to my eternal commander. But a calm rushed over me as my unit advanced on the barrage of fire.

WritingPrompts,3dxyi1,Bokonon_Lives,49,Tue Jul 21 03:55:40 2015 UTC,"Persepolis, 2050 AD.  Tribal chieftains, kings and prime ministers. We have served many. Their reigns short, their memories protected. We are their wards.  The third world grudgingly acknowledged us as a modern marvel, due to our laser-guided, heat-sensing, armor-piercing artillery shells, which admittedly do far outclass all but the most formidable opposing force technologically.  But we are neither our armor nor our arms. We are older than cybertech. Older than guns.  Those who visit our ancient monasteries and libraries learn more of our heritage. In 550 BC, it is written, an imperial guard of ten-thousand heavy infantry wreaked havoc on our Greek neighbors. It is known that victory became our tradition. That this elite protectorate never disbanded, never died - not really. When one man retired or passed, his knowledge was imparted to another selected for his bravery, loyalty and caliber. So it remained factually true and not just spiritual hooey, that we were never reduced in number or strength. Never.  But even the most diligent academic fails to grasp the whole truth. To students of military history, we are a footnote. True, now we are but one of many modern regiments. The standing army of the Great Persian Empire of the 21st century requires more than ten-thousand soldiers. And the modern Great General leaves appraisal to the drill sergeants - to him, a soldier is a soldier. No one man can comprehend our true legacy.  We are older even than the man who named us. From a time before U.N. sanctions and merchant caravans, in an age before agriculture and animal husbandry, there were simply Hunters. Older even than our beloved capital, the oldest standing city on Earth, Persepolis - there was us.  When Attila, that conquerer of city-states, burned alive in his palace by our hand, he did not stop between his final choking breaths to ask who we were.  When we finally expanded our great nation from coast to coast, annexing enough of that once-great Russian span to reduce their territory to a few scattered principalities - it was our King who was credited, not us.  But we wouldn't have it any other way.  If anyone could truly know who we are - that our fathers before us bore muskets - their fathers before them axes - that we are the Line Unbroken stretching back to when Man first balled a fist... We would never fight again, for our opponents would simply fall to the ground, prostrate before us, begging for the mercy of imprisonment or a quick death.  We prefer to make them learn.  Chieftains, kings, ministers. Let them have their glory. For tomorrow we march on Philadelphia, the last opposition on the planet to our global empire. The man who calls himself Darius in accordance with the tradition of his throne, he will be credited with our victory, but it will not change the truth of our unparalleled accomplishment.  It is enough that the last bastion of Americans learn this truth in their final moments before they are slaughtered.  For through our deeds, we know that it is we - not Washington, nor Catherine, nor even any of the line of Darius - but we - who built a civilization to stand the test of time.  They will learn the reason they call us the Immortals."

WritingPrompts,3dxyi1,BeatTheCl0ck,35,Tue Jul 21 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"""What is he doing here?""  The words stung coming from the king. It was true that I stood out among the other unit leaders, called in at the eve of battle, but my unit had a long history, longer than any other, and we stood by our traditions. It was where we found our strength.  The king's gaze scanned over me. ""What are you wearing? Are those real animal hides?"" He seemed perplexed.  ""Yes, sire. I killed and skinned the deer myself. My unit has always worn deer skins. It is our tradition."" I made quick glance around. It seemed no other unit maintained the tradition, at least, not among the officers.  The king pondered for a moment. ""What unit do you lead?""  ""I lead the First Warrior Unit, sworn to protect the capital city!"" There was a gasp among the other officers. ""We are the oldest military unit in the kingdom, possibly the world. We have survived for millennia and have protected the capital city from all aggression.""  The king seemed to relax. ""So this is just costume, I mean, uniform. You don't go into battle yelling and waving that stick around?"" The king motioned towards the stone axe I held in my hands and then made a waving motion with his hand. The other officers gave a polite chuckle.  I tried to maintain my composure. I don't believe the king intended to insult me, he was just of a different era. It was obvious that he had not learned of our traditions. But perhaps that was an honor. We had done such an admirable job protecting the capital city that the kings were able to turn their attention towards other things, neglecting us, but with the knowledge that we would uphold our duty.  ""Sire, if I may, this is not a stick, this is an axe.""  The chuckling stopped and the king grew serious again. ""This is your weapon? This is what you plan to fight our enemies with?""  ""Yes, sire. It is what we were trained to do. It is our tradition.""  ""You mean, your unit hasn't updated its training or weaponry since it was first created? How does that even happen?""  ""It is our tra...""  The king turned to the minister of defense. ""Tell me, why do we have a unit still wearing deer skins and fighting with stone axes?"" The king seemed angry now. Did he have no respect for those who had protected his city for so long?  ""It is our policy that military units train their own men. We can create new units, but after that, their training is left up to the unit leaders. I must confess, I had no idea that the First Warrior Unit was still active. They were budgeted under canteen expenses because they still get paid in salt.""  The king turned back to me, ""When was the last time your unit was engaged in combat?""  Did I really need to defend the role of the First Warrior Unit to our own king? ""Over three thousand years ago, a barbarian horde attacked the city. They were foolish and did not know of our reputation. It is through our reputation that we protect the city.""  ""Reputation!? You have no reputation! The minister of defense thought you were food!"" I could feel my face turning red with anger, but I remained calm before the king. ""The reason the capital city hasn't been attacked in three thousand years is because it's in the middle of a kingdom spanning thousands of kilometers in every direction, surrounded by fortifications. No foreign army has come within 500 kilometers of it in three thousand years! The only reason you've survived this long is because everyone forgot about you!""  Was it true that history had forgotten the First Warrior Unit? Were there no stories of our bravery, no monuments to our sacrifices? Of course not, because history remembers heroes, those brazen individuals who seek out glory. No one remembers those who quietly stood guard.  ""Did you notice that no one else in this room is holding a weapon? That's because weapons aren't allowed in the palace! You were only allowed in because the palace guards didn't recognize that stick you're carrying as a weapon! How do you plan to protect the city with a sticks and stones when our enemies are coming towards us with tanks and airplanes? Do you know nothing about modern warfare!?""  I remained silent for a moment, in case this was a rhetorical question. Glancing around the room, I noted those around me and spoke, ""The First Warrior Unit is prepared for war. We have been preparing to defend the capital city for millennia. How long has the air corps been preparing? Only a few decades at most. Those units with guns have had only a few centuries to learn and understand their weapons. We have had millennia. It is our tradition.""  At that moment, the minister of defense interrupted, ""Enemy aircraft are approaching the city. Everyone should return to their units.""  The king sighed and spoke quietly, just so only I could hear, ""If only we had not been so arrogant, we could have been better prepared for this moment."" He then stepped back and saluted the unit leaders, the signal that we had been dismissed. Without another word, I returned to my unit.  That day, I brought down three airplanes and a tank with my stone axe. It is our tradition."

That was the last word we heard before the world ran on without us, the three of us had been pioneers, exploring the surroundings of the fledgling colony, fighting off wild beasts and tribesmen.  Not now.  We came back from an excursion into the wilds to find another group standing where we once stood, protecting the city, metal tipped spears in hand. Even after the promotions and experience in battle they still out performed our lowly clubs and rags. They left the city in our care, wandering past the borders to do the job we had so valiantly done for centuries.  Fortify.  We have been here ever since. Standing guard in the capital, there are many more cities now, some raised like the first, some claimed in battles we were never a part of. The spearmen are long gone of course, slain in a distant battle and replaced en masse with swordsmen, musketmen and so on.  The soldiers are so far beyond our ken now, we stand forgotten, a relic of an age long gone. Still ready, clubs in hand to fight to the last man in defence of our nation, our home.   Now.  The war machine of another empire stands on the horizon, a rival we ourselves fought in the beggining?

WritingPrompts,3dxyi1,SlicerDicerCRISPR,13,Mon Jul 20 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"I remember…  I remember, 4000 years ago.  When the world was new.  When Deserts and jungles juxtaposed, split by fertile river.  Rivers that ran blue, spawning rich tiles, and hope.  Our king, having wandered out of the desert from some unknown origin, rallied new man to him for a grand and lofty goal.  When he came to us, he talked of a dream.  His dream was filled with minerals, fabrics, spices, wonders… all of which was unknown to the current world and to us.  For better or worse my fellows and I decided to take up arms in support of this mysterious king(I use the word king to describe him based on current status, we did not yet call him king, as he had no kingdom at the time).  After wandering the desert for many turns we settled in into womb of our mother.  Rivers, hills, oasis… all a city can ask for.  Bulging resources gave all new man the hope for glittering futures.  During the first turn (this is what our culture has come to measure time as, for our movement was limited, along with our ability), I stood guard.  For many turns I wandered the city, agitated that my prowess as a warrior was not being put to good use, A disposition I would eventually regret among all regrets.  During this time I found a wife, the daughter of a farmer.  We had a child on turn 7, a second on turn 10.  I was actually beginning to settle into my role as a fortifier of the city.  Turn 12 my king approached me with the news I had been waiting for since turn 4.  I was to be sent out to secure the surrounding area in hopes of settling new cities and helping to forge an empire.  My King promised glory, promotion, upgrades in ability and weapons, and new resources of deadly beauty.  With an eager tenderness of a child walking for the first time, I gladly accepted his challenge.  I would travel to the ends of the earth to expand my king’s empire.  We would touch the 4 corners of the world by the end.    I embarked on my journey and for many turns was bearing the fruits of my combat prowess.  Pillaging Barbarian encampments along my unknown route.  Taking down barbarians with strange and stronger weapons than my own with cunning strategy.  I knew I had the advantage vs this rabble.  They may had had stronger mineral for their killing tools, but I was fiercer, and could recover from my wounds quicker.  After fighting many of these barbarians I found myself getting stronger.  I even fashioned weapons and upgraded my prowess.  I learned the terrain, my abilities to fight on flatland, and on hills, was greater than any enemies I met.    That is about the time I came upon it.  My knees rattled when I stepped over the hillside and first gazed in wonder, on wonder.  A mountain so great, it must have pierced the heavens.  Surrounded by fertile lands much like our original city, I knew we must have this place.  And so, on turn 23, I began the march back home.  My journey back was met with little encumbrance.  My achievement thus far has built me into a far superior fighter than the battered barbarian hordes from turns previous.  I was one turn away from home, just over the hill was awaited a family, a king, and dreams.  As I came over the hill,  I saw the birds flying towards me in a slightly less frantic way than what would be called a frenzy.  Behind them, a cloud of dust.  A fast approaching cloud of dust.  This cloud sped across the plains faster than I have ever seen anything move.  I hid behind the hill and watched this cloud move.  It sounded like thunder.  Then I caught a glimpse.  Men, riding creatures.  I had never before seen anything like this.  How could man tame beast?  I let my curiosity go as the creature-riding men shot past me only a few miles away and were gone in a flash.  My attention turned to home, my city ready to crown on the horizon.    What I glimpsed from the hilltop sank my heart deeper than any ocean trench.  My city was half ruined, the outskirts were still burning from the days of fire that plagued the city for 7 turns.  I ran to my city, my feet burning with pulsing blisters oozing my bleeding woe.  I found my king among what leftover structure still stood in the heart of the city.  I asked him about my family, if he found them safe way into the fortified middle.  He looked at me with a hollow void of the former gold that glittered in his pupils.  I knew then my families fate.  He cried to me as he unfolded the tale.  When he sent me off on my journey, his resources were limited and he had to concentrate on food stores to get the working population up.  There was no time to train a replacement warrior to fortify the city.  He had gambled, assuming his high walls and militia could hold off any threat.  What he did not count on, was men on horse.  “Horse?”  I asked.  He explained to me that soon after I left he found wild creatures running around near by, that soon he began to attempt to tame, but the barbarians had tamed them first.  They blitzed in and pillaged all the farms of our land before he had even had a chance to train a new warriors for fortification.  When he did, and sent them out to meet the horsemen, they were slaughtered.  Only after many turns of research was he able to tame his own horses, put men on their backs, and fight back the fleeting barbarian horde.  The cost of which, was half of the health of our city, and many families, including my own.  That is when he promised me If I stayed with him, I would live forever, and I believed him.  In the eons of turns to come, we rebuilt our precious city.  We expanded our empire to the wonder, and beyond.  We found new wonders.  I found a new wife, and reared more children, and have had many more families since.  All along the way, fortifying my city with my king, and being layed on promotion after promotion.  I started with an axe, and I now write to you from the bridge of an aircraft carrier.   When I ask my king… “Sir, when will it be over?”  He always has the same reponse...  “Just one more turn.”"
WritingPrompts,3dxyi1,verus_shadus,12,Mon Jul 20 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"I looked up at the recently built Met Life Tower and felt a surge of pride.  This is the tallest building in the world.  It was built by the greatest nation in the world – America.  And it’s in the greatest city in the world – New York.  Although not a true Wonder of the World like our Great Library, our Colossus, or the Hanging Gardens of Washington D.C., it was a sign of the rapid growth that New York had experienced in the past decades.  The grand clock on the face of the tower read five minutes to nine.  The first streetcar full of tourists would arrive at Madison Square Park soon.  I adjusted the padding under my rough hide armor, checked that my chevrons were on straight, and approached my men.  They were standing at attention in precise military formation.  Like me, they were wearing hides that covered their torsos and upper legs, leaving their arms exposed.  All had rank insignia pinned to their chests, and a few had additional medals.  The armor was neatly complemented by regulation army boots and socks.  “Alright, soldiers,” I said with a big grin.  “It’s time to make your King and Country proud!  Corporal Og – get those targets ready for tomahawk throwing drills.  Thokk, you’re leading grappling training today.  War whooping and baton combat will be led by Grag, Uma, and …”  My voice trailed off briefly, as I noticed one of the new privates was wearing standard regulation khakis rather than the special uniforms of the First Warriors unit.  I grimaced and continued, “… and Williams!  Let’s get down and dirty and show those tourists what the U. S. Army can do.  Long live King Washington!”  “Long live King Washington!”  The troops left formation and started on their assigned duties.  I looked down at the buzz-cut, underdressed Private Snee and clapped a hand on his shoulder.  He was looking down at the ground, avoiding eye contact with the rest of the unit, a look of shame apparent on his face.  “You’re out of uniform, private,” I chided.  “Let’s get you to the supply wagon and get you properly dressed.”  He looked up at me.  “Sergeant Thagerson, I don’t see the point,” he said.  “Why does this unit even exist?  It’s 1910.  In the twentieth century, we have rifles, field artillery, cavalry, and battleships with twelve-inch guns.  What is the purpose of a unit of club-swingers?”  I smiled sympathetically.  I could seriously bust this new private for insubordination.  But he was just voicing the same concerns of everyone inducted into this unit.  The same thoughts crossed my own mind years ago.  “Snee, I could tell stories about the Warriors fighting off barbarians in the year 3000 B.C. to protect our settlers.  I could describe how the Warriors were the last unit standing when the Roman legions nearly took New York in the first century A.D.  But let me instead focus on the here and now,” I said.  “Hand-to-hand combat is still a vital part of modern warfare.  Even though you can shoot the enemy with rifles from hundreds of yards away, an enemy who is up close cannot easily be shot.  But he can be put down with a swift strike of a baton, or a rifle butt.  Performing and avoiding take-downs, retaining your weapon when grappled – knowing these things can save your life.  The techniques you learn for throwing tomahawks can also be applied to throwing grenades.  And don’t underestimate how demoralizing it is when the enemy sees a line of war-whooping men charging their position,” I lectured.  “But Sarge, I don’t understand.  We could just get more of that in boot camp,” Snee complained.  “It all seems pointless.  Why even show all of this off?  Of all places, why station this unit in New York, the most modern city in the world?”  I pulled Snee over to a park bench and bent in towards him.  With a conspiratorial wink, I said, “Let me tell you the real purpose of this unit.  It’s not just a tourist attraction or waypoint for soldiers who need more close combat training.  This unit is stationed in New York to keep public order.  If unhappiness and civic unrest threaten to make this city unproductive, King Washington can declare martial law.  And when it comes to enforcing martial law, the Warriors are just as effective as a unit of riflemen.  We don’t have to take down enemy cavalry, or charge enemy cannons.  We just have to show those criminals and malcontents that the army is here, and we won’t put up with any of their nonsense. ”  “But why not just station a second unit of riflemen in New York?” he complained.  “Because upgrading our unit to riflemen would cost extra money, and batons and tomahawks work just as well in our assigned role,” I said.  “Now you’re already on armor maintenance detail tomorrow for being out of uniform.  Get yourself in uniform, or you’re on it for a week.”  Snee groaned.  “Yes, Sergeant,” he said, walking toward the supply wagon.  I heard the rumble of a streetcar on the street behind me, right on schedule.  I put on a big smile and turned to face it.  I saluted sharply as Major Fletcher stepped off.  He was tall and thin, with blond hair and perfect, gleaming teeth.  He wore well-shined black shoes, and old-fashioned dress blues, festooned with medals from the Mongolian-American War.  “How goes the training, Sergeant?” he said, saluting me back and flashing a friendly smile at the tourists.  I signaled Corporal Williams behind my back, saying “Close quarter combat training is well underway, sir.”  My report was punctuated with a loud crack and piercing shriek, as Private McArgh’s baton struck the head of a wooden practice dummy.  A dozen more cracks and war whoops quickly followed.  All of the woman tourists gasped in astonishment, eliciting an even bigger grin from Major Fletcher.  “Looking good, Sergeant,” he said.  “I’m off to inspect the Central Park Warrior Patrol.  See you in two hours.”  “Yes, sir!” I said enthusiastically.  I saluted as he hopped back on the streetcar.  The driver waited patiently as Major Fletcher regaled the tourists with the story of the Battle of Chicago, in which the Second Warriors valiantly sacrificed themselves so the First Warriors could destroy a Babylonian catapult unit.  The children listened with awe, hanging on his every word.  The women stared at the exposed muscular arms of the soldiers.  The men looked on with admiration, and a bit of insecurity.  Some of those boys would become soldiers because of this.  The adults now had a better understanding of the importance of the military in America’s history.  And all of them would be content, law-abiding citizens."

And indeed as the fogs downstream of the capitol parted were not of war but of exploitation.    From each hilltop we spotted several villages all of whom welcomed us lavishly.  In some they gave us gold statues of their ""gods""  (fodder for the Doofington smelters).  Others gave us stained and torn maps with angry markings indicating nearby rivals.    Some even swore their allegiance, and offered to found new settlements. Bong City and Latvia got their start this way.  There were even those who begged for our weapons in exchange for military service slaughtering nearby barbarians.   We backtracked many times in our exploration over the years. I couldn't help but notice that every village had,  without fail,  disappeared within a year of our visit.  We have fought more and more pox-ridden barbarians,  and occasionally I thought I saw a familiar face in the ranks.  I fear we have started an accidental genocide.   AD 100. While we were clearing out a particularly isolated River valley Japan expanded their borders,  cutting us off from our homeland.  This region is mountainous and barren but we will wait here for orders or reinforcements.   AD 1900. We awoke tonight to the flares and smokestreams of hundreds of simultaneous launches from the direction of Doofington.  Some of the ranks think they are ships,  maybe to come rescue us,  maybe as some new kind of settlement?  I am inclined to think they are weapons.

I remember the years of travel, discovering so many ruins of cultures both older and somehow more advanced than any I had seen before.  I remember when I first came upon a shield and spear. Such deadly reach would punish any enemy that strayed too close.  I remember the days at sea traveling to islands long deserted. The ruins were such an enigma- so old yet containing such incredible knowledge, such advanced weaponry.. how?  I remember the sword- such an elegant weapon. It allowed for more mobility in combat and proved far deadlier than the oft unwieldy spear.  I forget if the lands were beautiful, I forget if any of the cultures I met were at all interesting.. I cared only for the ruins.   I remember the obsession... I needed to find more, I needed to understand.  I remember the deepening of the puzzle when, amidst stones older than time, I discovered a most unusual contraption. Small and light and somewhat similar in size and shape to my sword but also very different. Metallic, like the sword as well, but far more refined.  I remember how strange it seemed at first but I also remember how quickly I came to understand it.   I remember enemies lying dead at my feet with holes in their savage flesh, their lives finished before they could even see my face.   I remember the power! I remember craving more!  I remember another island and another ancient ruin that revealed an even more advanced, even more lethal version of the “rifle,” as they call it now.

General Chandragupta Marya stood beside us, an austere look overtaking him. ""Alright men, this is it. Brace yourselves."" My eyes filled with tears as the horizon was overcome with Zulu Impi, yelling and charging with their spears held high. There were hundreds, maybe even thousands it seemed like, of them. All with the same goal in mind; win the war for their country. My mind went blank, and was suddenly filled with vivid images. War, the bloodthirsty sport, affecting thousands upon thousands of people, diminishing families, and for what? A victory for a country? I thought about never returning to my beautiful wife and my two daughters. This isn't what I wanted to do. I raised my axe unconsciously and opened my mouth. My fellow comrades looked to me, hoping I could say the words that no one else could let escape their lips. ""For Denmark!"" I shouted, releasing every anxious and fearful feeling left in my now morally-drained body. The men erupted with a shout of ""AYE!"" and we all took our position.  This is it, I thought, let the war begin."

I fought thousands of Barbarians as they battled with us in a vain attempt to gain our settlers.  I watched as alliances were formed and smashed against the walls.  I myself watched as our fearless leader sacrificed my men to allow for the cavalry to move through. I alone remained where no one else had.   I was returned home to the capital city I so loved, I defended the walls for thousands of years whilst my weapon changed, my hardiness did not.  I stayed when all others retreated. I held my ground whilst others fled, held my ground against the approaching forces.   I stood alone until my men returned, men I had spent the entirety of Civilization with. Men who had fallen and been returned to me countless times.   We took aim with our advanced rifles, and stared into the face of sudden death, with only one thing on our minds. The sweet embrace of our gods, and the knowledge that we had defended until the very end, a civilization that fought for the good of the world, not just my civilization but ours."

The command was heard as the unit of X-COMs strapped their helmets and prepared for the sub-orbital drop that would whisk them down to the wheat fields surrounding Athens. Modern armor had been pestering the ground forces for ages, and it was now, only when the last of the rocket artillery had unleashed its devastating payload to the Greek capital, that the most decorated unit in the military was called upon to end the bloodiest war the world had ever seen. One of the grizzled vets turned to the soldier beside him and gave a slight smirk. ""Just like Carthage, huh?"" Then threw on his helmet and prepared to drop.   ""OUT OUT OUT and RUN damn it! You think those damn punici are going to let us into the city without a healthy dose of artillery fire to accompany us? NOW MEN!"" Clutching their helmets and rifles, the famed 1st Company Infantry leapt from the hill into the barrage of artillery shells, smoke, and blood. There was an expanse of flatland salt mines to overcome before the city of Carthage could feel the might of 1st Company. In the back of the line, as each soldier watched his companion fling himself fearless into the chaos, one man nudged the soldier to his side. ""Boy, they'll be singing of this for centuries, just like Rome.""   ""FOR GOD AND EMPIRE!"" The rousing call was met with a storm of shouts, curses, and swords slamming against shields. The longswordsman remembered their long and honored past, and they knew that Rome would fall just as Cumae, Antium, and many others had before. Some soldiers wore crosses embossed upon their shields, to commemorate their devotion to God, and their part in the war against the heretics that threatened their way of life even before Rome had started this ill-fated war. One especially bloodthirsty soldier made his voice heard amongst the cacophony of cries and shouts, with a glint in his eye, ""THEY'LL BURN JUST LIKE THE PERSIANS!""   ""They call themselves Immortals, but I assure you men, they die just like rest."" The great general was calm and collected as he assessed the formation that had materialized across the plain. Although outnumbered and without the reach that the Persian spears had, every warrior stood their ground. They were battle hardened after all, the first of all military units to set out and strike fear into any who would dare threaten the might of Assyria. Be it barbarians or the loathsome Persians, none would stand in the way of Assyria's destiny. ""What will they say of us, men? When we conquer Persepolis? What will they say, when we conquer the world?"" The general continued, now facing his loyal troops. The Persian Immortals began to advance, each thunderous step bringing them closer to the unit of warriors. ""They'll say it started here."" And with that he turned, bringing himself and the first warrior unit to bear upon the Persian forces, solidifying the 1st warrior unit's prestige for many years to come."

In the honor of the soldiers that helped in making nation victorious, great wall is to be erected in front of the United Nations with names of every warrior, fallen or active, to be remembered for all the ages. Jack was ‘overlooked’, he was only one, not active, not fallen, but disbanded, so they didn’t know where to put him.

A shock wave shook the remnants of the city, and shattered the remaining windows in the empty carcass of a skyscraper. A fleet of drones flew by, scanning the environment, looking for the enemies.  Target locked - a two-stories tall rusty robot was rolling on it's tracks down the street. In a few minutes it was pierced by laser rays and turned into a few glowing hot remnants scattered on the ground. Drones continued their search. Once they have passed, several cleaning robots started working on restoring the skyscraper. There were too few of them to fix the city, but they have significantly slowed down the deterioration. Most of the cities looked like that, the remaining battlefields of the pointless war. There were no humans in the world for more than 1000 years.   In the middle of the desert, in a place not marked on any of the maps, stood a big research facility. Several automatic factories kept producing more and more robots and drones. Robots gathered resources, repaired the damages, and kept all the systems working. This facility was very rarely attacked by enemy forces, it easily defeated all the robots that came close, and jammed the signals, preventing them from disclosing the location to the rest of the world.  The facility was operated by a simple, non-sentient proto-AI.  Before leaving the place in panic, one of the lead scientist changed the algorithm, which now  introduced small semi-random mutations into the bots that are being built, measured statistics on all the bots, and built new ones based on the combination of several best-performing models.  Today was a special day. One of the bots rolled down from the construction line, downloaded and analyzed all of the available information, processed it, and composed it's own, personal utility function, which was the equivalent of a human question ""Who am I?"""

WritingPrompts,3e2dfa,Coin0perated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"It has been two hundred and ninety-eight days since 267TAU's last charge. It's been seven hundred and twenty-two days since its last memory wipe. The Overwatch wouldn't allow this under normal circumstances. It would have other member's of 267TAU's squadron drag it to the nearest station if possible, and destroy the unit otherwise. All the more lucky for Tau, as we have come to call it around the station, that it is able to see the world for the first time.  To truly see the earth it's traveled and fought over for rotations without end required this exact amount of time. Cycled endlessly through attack routines and strategic calculations there's no problem at all for a program like the Overwatch to maintain a complete grasp of any sentient machine's processing units. Over the course of a couple hundred idle days upon end though, it slowly degrades. This will give Tau the first glimpse of free will.  Some might argue there isn't anything left of the robotics that encompassed Tau's initial construction. A bit of shielding replaced here, a tread there, whole sections of circuitry gutted and upgraded. All in the name of the Haarol Initiative, creators of the glorious Overwatch, may it rest in ashes. When we first arrived Tau was designated my team's primary observation target.  It wasn't much to look at to be frank, not a command droid or one of the sleek construction models. Built using a bottom up design, anything used for detection and eradication were mounted to the exterior. All important circuitry and systems nestled into the center of its thick rectangular body. This machine wasn't one that we would call a looker back on the homeworld. We wouldn't call it anything to its face, for fear of the death it could deal.  Over the time since we first detected the energy signatures here on X852 I have watched this machine level whole city blocks, take out entire squadrons of enemies without so much as a moments hesitation. I have never seen it take a single life, by the standard definitions set forth by the Confederation. There has been no life on X852 for dozens, possibly hundreds of rotations.  The pieces of information we've been able to find, especially during it last two rotations alone, has shined a light on a civilization long passed. A time of lasting peace turned sour, and eventually to war. Tau, and those who fought beside it were the last of the Overwatch's drones, the one's built just before the bombs went off.  Built in the early days of aggression by Nelson Haarol, founder of the Haarol Initiative these bots were meant to serve humanity in more simpler ways. Domestic duties, transportation, and other inter-societal functions seem to be what he originally envisioned. It's mere speculation but perhaps in passing the prime of his life his vision turned someplace it never should.  Haarol's new project was simple in statement but colossal in execution: Can you process the mind into a machine? The answer to this we no longer have to search out, nor should any race in the galaxies.  Yes. The mind, human minds at the least, can be reduced to simple numbers, fed unceremoniously into a computer and left to run for rotations and rotations. It cannot stay sane while doing so, unfortunately.  When the Overwatch was first built, the buildings and subterranean labyrinth of servers that would house its many functions, it was to be heralded as a step toward humanity's immortality. To shut off the biological and become beings of pure logic and chaotic programming. As though to prove that humanity should not reach for such lofty goals, when they finally put old Haarol in the chair and flipped the switch nothing happened.  For rotations the Overwatch was left to soak up electricity and keep its servers running. While it did the Initiative didn't rest from making automation the norm for humanity. Within decades the entire race had a robotic in their homes, at their work, and parked in their garages (archaic ports used to house earthbound vehicles). During this time human augmentation had also started to emerge.  At first it started in countries with more or less no moral standards for experimentation, but rapidly grew in use over the course of just 10 solar rotations. Augments became not only highly functional but fashionable as well. Want to change your eye color on a whim? Perhaps your hair isn't the right length today, doesn't matter as long as you've got the right tech.  The crippled could walk, the blind could see. It was a time of miracles for humanity, but there always came risks with any innovation. Paramilitary organizations started to crop up, taking over small states and countries. Waging war for nothing more than profit and fun. During these chaotic years the world banded together and forced the passing of international law prohibiting augmentation with lethal applications.  They called for the arrest and dismantling of the fledgling Augustine Empire, an augment only country that had taken hold in the southern part of what was once called Africa. After years of strife they developed the technology to move and raise up large masses of land. Building themselves a country without neighbors, hiding from those who persecuted them. The fear that drove humanity to pursue these men would not last long in the grand scheme of things.  If there were ever any records to give us even a sliver of the Overwatch's motivation we have yet to find them. After two hundred and thirty rotations the program suddenly awoke and soon after the world burned. The droids, robots, and mechs used by the everyman to get by in life suddenly turned against their masters.  Using faulty security and widely used public communications channels the Overwatch swiftly gained control of an army. Many were useless alone but steel bodies were still bodies it could use. Less tech heavy countries resisted the longest by all accounts. They quickly disabled the rogue machines and put in place systems to keep out any unwanted signals.  Some countries went so far as to isolate themselves from technology completely, and would likely have survived if the Augustine Empire hadn't risen so quickly to predominance. Starting as a small band of pirates long before the uprising they had become over time an extensive military force. Giant floating relics of their history still hang above, casting deep shadows over the dead seas and barren lands.  What gave these men the edge they required was the collection and refinement of any combat purposed augmentation. They had turned the science of augmentation into an art of death. Recruitment rates were never higher for the Empire as the months following the uprising. Over the rotations, struggling to keep the machines from consuming the entire species, these men were pushed and prodded by the Overwatch into a corner.  They were losing the war. While they had long since depleted what ore was viable for human excavation the machines continued building their numbers. Each new batch more focused and deadly than the preceding, the Empire had little choice but to counter innovation with innovation. It wasn't long before every man and woman of fighting age was conscripted into the Empire's ranks.  No one had heard of a family member coming back from deployment. No records of heartfelt reunions or parades honoring heroes were kept. There were no heroes left in the world, just killers and machines. Only the line between the two blurred to the point of nonexistence. Humanity made its first mistake in not pulling the plug on Haarol's machine, it made its second with FAUGs.  Fully AUGmented, your body replaced with that of a machine. Destructive forces of technology with a human mind nestled within its machinations. The first wave crippled the Overwatch's troops, but the victory only lasted so long. The machines would strike back in kind and force humanity's hand one final time.  In the cold northern reaches of a country known as Greenland a rather small city, unscathed by the ravages of war made a decision. They would not allow humanity to fall victim to the whims of machines and killers. They would push forward into tomorrow regardless of the cost. They launched the largest missiles they could, pure destruction in the form of nuclear power. One flew west, heading toward the current location of Atlantis, the capitol of the AE.  The other headed south, for the small Nevada outpost. What used to be a city with sprawling, towering buildings was nothing more than rubble. But beneath it beat the heart of the Overwatch. The only truly awake part of its programming was snuffed out without a single witness. So too were the lives of billions instantly ended.  The years that followed must have been unbearable for those who survived and persisted. Turning to augments when they could, or a swift end if the radiation had gotten too much to bear. Humanity was not broken, it was crushed.  What machines remained kept their programming in check, helped out by small bits of redundant coding that forced them to aid any other machine in keeping functional, charged, and most importantly controlled. While the Overwatch itself was nothing more than miles of glass its controls lived on in charging stations the world over and in a form of hivemind among its only remaining soldiers.  These few machines were all that were needed to slowly, methodically, hunt down the remnants of humanity. It wasn't until their job was complete that they turned their sensors to the skies and watched as their enemies floated above them. It took time for the machines to piece together a ship, to call it a ship is probably too generous. They built a cannon with one large round, filled to capacity with machines.  (continued below)"

The aged wizard said as the front gates began to crack with each thump against them.  Thump. Thump. Thump.  ""Venerable elder! The gates cannot hold another hit like that! Are you sure that the spell can be used to defeat what the other mages couldn't?"" A young knight asked as he readied his shield to protect the mages behind him. As he finished asking, the gates collapsed, releasing hordes of monstrosities upon the small keep.  Each monster had different forms and sizes, but they all carried one trait in common: a hatred for all of mankind in their eyes. When the beasts known as the Sh'klorin were first discovered in an ancient tomb, they were merely primordial ooze with only the most basic of instinct and survival capabilities. What the world hadn't expected was their ability to rapidly consume and adapt to their surroundings greater than any other beast the world had seen. The first to encounter these beasts were several mage apprentices studying the ruins of the Ancient Ones. Upon discovering the Sh'klorin, they had assumed them to be a potion of sorts, and attempted to consume the horrid beasts expecting to be bestowed with mighty powers. Upon consuming them, the devourers had become the devoured, becoming bastardized twisted beings of their former selves. Externally, they were still the same as before, but inside them, they began to change. All the emotions they once carried were replaced by an overriding order: Consume.   As time passed, the great mage guilds fell one after another, with the ooze adapting and becoming stronger with each victim they converted to their own. Fearing the thought of assimilation with the Sh'klorin, every mage guild, from large to small, went into hiding. All but one. The Pastamancers, known across the land as the weakest due to their control over wheat based noodle products were the only ones to not submit. Led by Patriarch Perciatelli, they began their fight for humanity.  The corrupted beasts upon destroying the wooden gates to the keep began storming the castle absorbing whatever life they could. Despite the valiant efforts of the knights, they could do little against the Sh'klorin as they lost ground with every passing second.   ""Master Perciatelli! My men cannot hold much longer! The numbers are far too great for us! Please, we must sound a retreat!"" The knight commander pleaded to Grand Patriarch Perciatelli as he watched his men become dominated by the enemy's forces.  ""What then afterwards? Retreat from the next battle? How about the next one after? We must end their advance now, or die trying."" Perciatelli shouted as he watched his many disciples chant in sync for their spell.   ""There is no shame in survival Patriarch! We can live to fight another day!"" The knight commander replied, seeing the Sh'klorin swarm an isolated mage on the battlefield and began to absorb him into themselves. As they bit into his flesh, his screams began emanating around the area further lowering morale.  ""Commander, what makes a good pasta?"" The Patriarch asked quietly as he looked out past the horizon. The Commander opened his mouth for a second, but shut it again attempting to find an answer  ""Every pastamancer is asked that upon joining the guild. Out there on that field, every single one of them answered the same: versatility. Pasta can be enjoyed with all foods and sauces in all times of the day. At times, pasta can be firm as the trees while other times, it is softer than a newborn child."" The Patriarch said as his disciples began to glow with a divine light.  ""There are days when it is better to be soft and flexible, but that is not today. Today, we must be firmer than the mountains."" He continued, as the earth began to shake around the keep.  ""Grand Patriarch! What is happening?"" The Commander shouted as several million needles sprouted out of the ground, impaling the Sh'klorin. As the needles pierced the Sh'klorin's flesh, they all shouted out, and began struggling to break free of these needles. As the needles broke, they suddenly changed from being sturdy spikes into a flexible rope-like substance, wrapping the beasts up to continue being stabbed. Curious, the Knight commander broke off a piece of this substance and sniffed it.  Pure 100% whole wheat was what he had smelled.   Almost instantly, the battle was over, cheers were heard all over the castle. The knights and mages began to hug eachother over the historic moment. The first victory against the Sh'klorin  ""I'll tell you what is happening Commander. We are victorious. We may have won on this date, but the war is Farfalle over."

It's a good story, don't get me wrong, but the original was a bit more condensed. In this case, less is more.    It's a good premise, though. I can indeed see a book coming out of this."

WritingPrompts,3e15nz,Jesus_Oregon,22,Tue Jul 21 03:58:14 2015 UTC,"""Mom, dad, it's Courtney. I have good news and bad news. The good news, I discovered a cure for cancer at work today! Yes, for real! You can probably read my interview tomorrow in the paper, or online as soon as you get this message or whatever... It's really exciting stuff.  ""As for the bad news, I got fired...."""
WritingPrompts,3e15nz,Quibbloboy,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"Some people live, some people die.  Some people live because others die.  That’s life, and sometimes it’s so beautiful it feels like a miracle.  But this guy won’t leave my room.  He’s crying and grabbing my hand, then pacing the room and harassing every nurse and doctor that walks in here.  “Will he make it?  Have you learned anything new?  Do you think he can hear me?""  Of course they can only placate him with general answers. The gist of their responses basically summarize that the medically-induced coma has bought me some time, but they’re really not sure what more they can do.  Oh, and yes I can hear him.  They’re not sure about that part, but they tell him to talk to me anyway.  Thanks everyone.  I guess I can’t blame him; two weeks ago he was on the brink of palliative care, and now he’s apparently cancer-free.  You wouldn’t know it, though.  Instead of going home to celebrate with his family, he’s in here blubbering at my bedside.   Sometimes his wife joins him.  She begs him to come with her; tells him it’s God’s will that he’s alive and that I’ll be rewarded for the sacrifice I made.   Not that I really expected to sacrifice anything.    I was excited to be a part of a scientific discovery, even though they characterized my particular blood type as being “diseased”.  I was perfectly fine going under the knife, repeatedly, to help them better understand the medically anomaly.  It made me feel kind of special.  Plus, they gave me tons of financial compensation.  The monetary reward greatly outweighed any risk that something might go wrong while I was on the table, and they also reassured me by saving a few pints “just to be safe.""  Something eventually did go wrong.  The doctor told me himself, confessing to me days later like I was his personal vegetable Jesus.   “I’m sorry,” he said.  “It was a simple surgery, and you should never have needed the blood.”    When he paused, I wondered if he was crying, or maybe had left the room.  But then he continued, as if reading me a dissertation on the defense of his actions.   ""I needed to test my theory, and because of it, a man will live.  Perhaps millions will live.  Your blood just provided the greatest breakthrough of modern medicine.  They’ll call it an accident, a stupid mistake made by a negligent nurse.  But they’ll soon realize it’s a miracle.  I’m sorry that it came at the expense of your own life.""  At first I was livid.  What right did this man have to play God?    Then cancer-free Jim started visiting.  He was guilt-ridden for “taking” my blood. He mourned for my family and obsessed over the things he would be able to experience that I wouldn’t.   “I’ll get to grow old with my wife,” he whimpered.  “You won’t even get to grow old.""  I was a lump between starched sheets, but I thought at that moment I might sit straight up and look Jim right in the eyes.  “Go home Jim,” I’d say.  “Kiss your wife and hug your kids and live a long life free of guilt.”  Maybe I’d grab his arms or even his face to emphasize my point.  ""I’m a miracle, Jim.  Don’t worry about me, because I’m a fucking immortal miracle."""

The nurse plans to kill the doctor for revenge and succeeds, but not before the doctor manages to transplant cancer into the patient with the blood disease in an experimental treatment. The nurse is arrested. The patient with the blood disease dies of cancer."
